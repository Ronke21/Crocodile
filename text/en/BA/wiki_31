<text>Cynthia Karen Loving (born November 19, 1978), known professionally as Lil&#x27; Mo, is an American singer and songwriter. She is best known for her 2001 single &quot;Superwoman Pt. II&quot; (featuring Fabolous), which peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and is credited with launching Fabolous&#x27; career. Regarded as Missy Elliott&#x27;s protégé, Elliott guest appeared on Lil Mo&#x27;s 1998 debut single &quot;5 Minutes&quot;, which was released for the &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; film soundtrack. The following year, Lil&#x27; Mo appeared alongside Nas, Eve, and Q-Tip on Elliott&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Hot Boyz&quot;. She guest performed alongside Vita on Ja Rule&#x27;s 2000 singles &quot;Put It on Me&quot;, as well as his 2001 single &quot;I Cry&quot;, the former of which was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Early life==
Mo was born into a military family. Her father, Bishop Jacob D. Loving, and her mother, First-Lady Cynthia Loving Sr., raised her primarily in Long Island, but moved regularly due to her father&#x27;s military assignments. The family lived in Texas, Georgia and North Carolina before settling in Baltimore. As an adult, Mo moved to New York City&#x27;s Manhattan borough to pursue her music career.

==Career==
===Beginnings (1996–2000)===
Mo began her career as a backing vocalist, session musician and songwriter. In early 1998, while submitting demo material to Elektra Records for Nicole Wray&#x27;s 1998 debut album, &quot;Make It Hot&quot;, Mo caught the attention of Missy Elliott, who helped land her a contract deal with Elektra. On June 29, 1998, Mo released her debut single &quot;5 Minutes&quot; from the &quot;soundtrack&quot; for the Frankie Lymon biographical film &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. The song was planned to appear on Mo&#x27;s debut album, however when it underperformed in the US, it was pulled from the final track listing. Mo&#x27;s debut album was originally set to be released in March 1999, however, it was pushed back multiple times during Elektra&#x27;s attempts to revamp Mo&#x27;s image and sound.

Mo gained further exposure during this time for her features on Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s cover of Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot;, Missy Elliott&#x27;s record-breaking single &quot;Hot Boyz&quot;, which spent 18 weeks at number one on the Hot Rap Singles from December 4, 1999, to March 25, 2000, and Ja Rule&#x27;s single &quot;Put It on Me&quot;, which was a hit on both urban and pop radio, and reached number eight on the US pop charts. More collaborations by Ja Rule and Lil&#x27; Mo followed, including &quot;I Cry&quot;, which repurposed The O&#x27;Jays&#x27; 1978 hit &quot;Cry Together&quot;.

===Breakthrough, &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; (2001)===
On April 10, 2000, Mo released &quot;Ta Da&quot;, her first solo single. After years of successful collaborations and features, Mo would finally release a successful hit of her own, &quot;Superwoman Pt. II&quot;, her second single from her upcoming album. The single was released on March 6, 2001, and peaked at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, helping bring then-underground rapper Fabolous to mainstream attention. On June 26, 2001, Mo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; was released to generally favorable reviews. The album peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and attained a gold certification from the RIAA, making it Mo&#x27;s successful album to date. In August 2001, Mo released the follow-up single &quot;Gangsta (Love 4 the Streets)&quot;, however, it failed to match the success of its predecessor.

===&quot;Meet the Girl Next Door&quot;, career struggles (2002–05)===

While recovering from being assaulted with a champagne bottle after a performance in San Francisco, Mo began her radio career, working as a part-time anchor for Baltimore urban radio station WERQ-FM. That same year, Mo began preparations for her second album, &quot;Meet the Girl Next Door&quot;. The album was released on April 29, 2003, preceded by the singles &quot;4Ever&quot; and &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;. While Mo promoted the singles on shows such as &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and &quot;Soul Train&quot;, she would later criticise Elektra for their lack of support and minimal promotion for the album, which she attributed to being pregnant at the time.

Mo&#x27;s contract with Elektra expired as the label was absorbed by Atlantic Records, and in July 2004, she signed Universal&#x27;s Cash Money Records to record her third album, then titled &quot;Syndicated: the Lil&#x27; Mo Hour&quot;. The album was scheduled for an early 2005 release, before being pushed back to October, after its four singles (including &quot;Hot Girls&quot; and &quot;Dem Boyz&quot;) failed to create any buzz. Following the destruction of Cash Money&#x27;s New Orleans studio by Hurricane Katrina, Mo was dropped from the Cash Money roster and &quot;Syndicated&quot; was shelved.

===Independent releases, &quot;Pain and Paper&quot;, &quot;P.S. I Love Me&quot; (2006–12)===
Mo began releasing singles as an independent artist under her production company HoneyChild Entertainment, which was first founded by Mo in 2000. On August 28, 2007, Mo released the album &quot;Pain &amp; Paper&quot;, distributed by Koch Entertainment and DrakeWeb Music Group and selling only 6000 copies. Its singles, &quot;Sumtimes I&quot;, featuring Jim Jones, and &quot;Lucky Her&quot; failed to chart.

In 2008, Mo signed a two-album deal with Global Music Group and began work her fourth album, tentatively titled &quot;Tattoos &amp; Roses: The Rebellion Against My Pain&quot;. The album was initially planned to include a second disc featuring Mo&#x27;s live performances, however this was eventually scrapped. On May 8, 2011, Mo released the mixtape &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;. On November 1, 2011, Mo released &quot;P.S. I Love Me&quot; in conjunction with Bronx Bridge Entertainment and distributed by Fontana Distribution. The album was preceded by the singles &quot;On the Floor&quot;, &quot;I Love Me&quot;, featuring Tweet, and &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, featuring Maino.

===Television career, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, retirement (2013–present)===
In 2013, Mo became a cast member of the reality television series &quot;R&amp;B Divas: Los Angeles&quot;, which premiered on TV One on July 10, 2013. The season&#x27;s reunion special garnered a total of 834,000 viewers, tying with the debut of the sitcom &quot;The Rickey Smiley Show&quot; as the network&#x27;s No. 1 telecast among adults 25–54 in TV One history. On September 10, 2013, Lil&#x27; Mo released the song &quot;I&#x27;m a Diva&quot; via iTunes. Another non-album single, &quot;L&#x27;s Up&quot;, was released the following week.

On October 28, 2014, Mo released her fifth album, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, under Penalthy Entertainment. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Should&#x27;ve Never Let You Go&quot;, as well as her second mixtape &quot;No Shit Sherlock&quot;, which featured contributions by Da Brat and songwriter Tiyon &quot;TC&quot; Mack. On April 29, 2015, &quot;R&amp;B Divas: Los Angeles&quot; ended after its third season.

In January 2016, Mo began hosting the WKYS radio show &quot;The Fam in the Morning&quot; with DJ Quick Silva. She was fired from the show in February 2017. Later that year, Mo joined the cast of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot; and appeared in an episode of &quot;Couples Court with the Cutlers&quot;. She would also appear in We TV&#x27;s &quot;Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 12 — Hip Hop Edition&quot;.

On October 25, 2018, Mo announced her retirement from the music industry to pursue a career in law.

==Personal life==
===Assault===
On June 22, 2001, while being escorted to a limousine, Lil&#x27; Mo was assaulted by a male at a San Francisco concert venue. She was bludgeoned in the head by the man&#x27;s champagne bottle and was immediately hospitalized at California Pacific Medical Center, where she received 20 stitches. The incident traumatized Mo and left her suspicious of the attack, in which she felt it may have been a potential &quot;set up&quot;. Mo confirmed to &quot;MTV News&quot; that she had to cancel many shows and cease a double-music video shoot for her single &quot;Gangsta&quot; so she could recover from the incident. A reward ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 was issued in hopes of catching the assailant. Though the alleged male attacker was never found, local San Francisco police received anonymous tips that the attacker boasted about his actions at a Hunters Point housing project near San Francisco, California.

===Marriages and children===
In 2001, Mo met her first husband, Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; Stone, at a Washington, D.C. gas station. After dating for five months, they wed on August 29, 2001. On August 19, 2002, Mo gave birth to her first child, Heaven Love&#x27;on Stone. On February 24, 2005, Mo gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second child, God&#x27;Iss Love Stone. In December 2005, she filed for divorce. Their divorce was finalized in August 2007. Through the marriage, she became the stepmother to his son, Jerez Coleman, who in June 2014 appeared as &quot;Kidd Cole&quot; on an episode of MTV&#x27;s television series &quot;&quot;.

On June 22, 2008, Mo married Gospel recording artist Phillip Bryant. On January 16, 2009, Mo gave birth to her third child, Justin McKenzie Phillip Bryant. On July 10, 2012, Mo gave birth to her fourth child, Jonah Maddox-Phillip Bryant. The couple separated due to his infidelity and officially divorced on September 15, 2014.

On October 1, 2014, Mo married professional boxer Karl Dargan. On August 28, 2015, Mo gave birth to Karl Sharif Dargan Jr., her fifth child and Karl&#x27;s third. In 2018, at the reunion special of &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot;, Mo announced that she was expecting her sixth child. Mo admitted on social media that she had suffered a miscarriage a month before the reunion aired. In May 2019, Mo announced that she had left Karl, after he had spat on her in front of their children during an argument. Mo revealed in later interviews that he had been physically abusive throughout their marriage. Their divorce was finalized in April 2021.

===Personal struggles===
In 2003, Mo revealed to &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine that she struggled with an eating disorder since 2000.

In 2019, Mo revealed that she had struggled with an opioid addiction.

===Religion===
Mo was raised in a Christian household; her parents are Holiness preachers. In a 2017 episode of &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York&quot;, Mo revealed that she had converted to Islam three years prior as a result of her marriage to Karl, and is seen praying in hijab.

==Feuds==
===Ja Rule===
A feud between Mo and former collaborator Ja Rule embroiled in late 2001, when Murder Inc. began favoring Ashanti over her. In January 2003, while co-hosting &quot;106 &amp; Park: Prime&quot;, Mo sent a shout-out to 50 Cent, just seconds after she premiered a Ja Rule video. The incident angered Ja Rule and Murder Inc. Mo had told the press she assumed BET was going to edit out the shout, and did not think the gesture would cause an uproar. Ja Rule released the diss track &quot;Loose Change,&quot; which targeted Eminem, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Chris Lighty and Lil&#x27; Mo. Rule credited himself as the reason why she had any hits. In May 2003, Mo released a freestyle diss to Ja Rule.

In April 2003, controversy arose regarding payment for Lil&#x27; Mo&#x27;s contributions on &quot;I Cry&quot; and &quot;Put It on Me&quot;. In 2005, Lil&#x27; Mo filed a lawsuit against Ja Rule, Murder Inc. and Def Jam for over $15 million. In 2010, the two reconciled, and the next year, recorded a track together titled &quot;U &amp; Me&quot;.

===Keyshia Cole===
The feud between Lil&#x27; Mo and R&amp;B singer Keyshia Cole originated in August 2005 via the radio series &quot;Star and Buc Wild Morning Show&quot;. Mo was reported to have dismissed the vocal talent of a new crop of R&amp;B performers, saying that they relied on dancing. Cole took offense and went to Dream Hotel in New York City, where she encountered Lil&#x27; Mo&#x27;s manager Phil Thornton and a stylist, allegedly stating &quot;You all are traitors. [Lil&#x27; Mo] is the enemy.&quot;. Lil&#x27; Mo shrugged off the incident, saying she was told that Cole was intoxicated at the time, which Cole denied.

In March 2013, Cole was criticized by urban media outlets for her Twitter critique of Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Bow Down/I Been On&quot;. This led to Mo and Cole exchanging hostile tweets over the next few days. Despite the exchanges, in May 2013, Mo said there was no beef between her and Cole, which led to the two exchanging hostile messages again via Instagram and Twitter.

<doc id="216310" wikidata="Q4747569" url="?curid=216310" title="Amongst Barbarians">
<text>Amongst Barbarians is a 1989 play by British playwright Michael Wall, first performed at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester prior to a transfer to the Hampstead Theatre in London. It was filmed as a made-for-TV movie in 1990, which was shown as part of series five of the BBC drama anthology series, &quot;ScreenPlay&quot;. It was directed by Jane Howell and starred David Jason, Anne Carroll, Rowena Cooper, Con O&#x27;Neill and Lee Ross.

&quot;Amongst Barbarians&quot; is set far away from Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Britain in Penang, Malaysia, a former British colony, where two young Englishmen have been arrested for drug trafficking. As they both face the death penalty, their relatives travel to Penang to come to their rescue. However, they soon find out that there is nothing they can do to save the boys&#x27; lives. In the course of their futile attempts at influencing the authorities, their racism becomes more than apparent. The question which is never made explicit is who the real barbarians are.

Wall&#x27;s play is based on the true story of the Barlow and Chambers execution.

<doc id="216311" wikidata="Q7764868" url="?curid=216311" title="The Small House at Allington">
<text>The Small House at Allington is a novel by English novelist Anthony Trollope. It first appeared as a serial in the 1862 July to December edition of the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, and ended its run in the July to December edition of the following year. It was later published 1864 as a two volume novel. It is the fifth book in the &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; series, preceded by &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot; and followed by &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot;. It enjoyed a revival in popularity in the early 1990s when the British prime minister, John Major, declared it as his favourite book.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Small House at Allington&quot; concerns the Dale family, who live in the &quot;Small House&quot;, a dower house intended for the widowed mother of the owner of the estate. The landowner, in this instance, is the bachelor Squire of Allington, Christopher Dale. Dale&#x27;s mother having died, he has allocated the Small House, rent free, to his widowed sister-in-law and her daughters Isabella (&quot;Bell&quot;) and Lilian (&quot;Lily&quot;).

Bernard, the squire&#x27;s nephew and heir, brings his friend Adolphus Crosbie to Allington and introduces him to the family. Crosbie is handsome and well-regarded in London society. Bell and Lily are impressed by Crosbie&#x27;s charm and worldliness; Lily, the younger and wittier sister, labels him an Apollo. She and Crosbie grow increasingly intimate during his stay, and before leaving he proposes to her. Mrs. Dale has no money for a dowry, but Crosbie thinks the squire might provide Lily with some fortune given that, in many ways, he treats her and Bell as if they were his daughters. When asked, the squire informs him this is not the case, leading Crosbie to reflect on how his salary as a clerk at the General Committee Office allows him to live comfortably as a bachelor, but if he were to marry and have to support a family on his current income, they would need to live very humbly. The engagement is made public and celebrated in Allington, but when Lily learns about his misunderstanding regarding her possible fortune, she offers to break off the engagement with no hard feelings. Crosbie refuses, however, because he is impressed by this noble gesture and genuinely fond of Lily.

After leaving Allington, Crosbie heads straight to Courcy Castle. Back among people of high society, Crosbie&#x27;s image of married life with Lily on his small salary grows bleaker. Rumors have reached the castle, but Crosbie attempts to dodge any questions about his engagement. Thus, the Countess de Courcy views him as fair game and a viable match for her only single daughter still of marriageable age, Alexandrina, who had previously struck up a friendship with Crosbie in London. Pressed by Alexandrina, in a moment of weakness, he asks her to marry him. The countess sees that their engagement is firmly settled between Crosbie and the earl before he leaves. Crosbie immediately begins having second thoughts; he is now engaged to two women and although he prefers Lily (who is younger, prettier and more intelligent), she is a country girl he can jilt with few repercussions, whereas Alexandrina is the daughter of a prominent family. Thus he writes a letter to Lily and Mrs. Dale breaking off the engagement. Ironically, he is given a raise in salary almost as soon as he returns to London, and he muses how he could have had a comfortable, happy life married to Lily.

Lily is heartbroken, but puts on a brave face, claiming she is happy for Crosbie and Alexandrina. However, she refuses to entertain the idea of marrying another man and thus rejects repeated proposals from Johnny Eames, a family friend who has loved Lily since childhood (and who first confesses his feelings to her as soon as he hears about her engagement). Eames is a lowly clerk at the Income-Tax office, but his expectations rise after he saves the Earl de Guest from a bull. After the incident, Eames becomes a close friend of the childless earl and his spinster sister, Lady Julia de Guest. The earl takes an interest in Johnny&#x27;s career and essentially adopts him. When Eames encounters Crosbie at a London railway station, he assaults Crosbie and gives him a black eye. Mrs. Dale, the squire, Lord de Guest and Lady Julia all hope Lily will eventually agree to marry Johnny, but she chooses to remain true to the memory of her Apollo.

Meanwhile, Christopher Dale, the squire, encourages Bernard to court Bell, as he would be happy to see his niece and nephew marry and live together on the family estate. Bell, however, thinks of Bernard as a brother. When Mrs. Dale and her daughters feel Christopher is pressuring Bell to marry Bernard, they announce they will be leaving the Small House so they are no longer beholden to him. In the end, the squire convinces them to stay, and he gives both girls a sum of money regardless of whom they marry or if they marry at all. Bell ends up marrying John Crofts, the young doctor in the area; they had feelings for each other since she was a young girl.

Crosbie quickly learns he has little to gain from marrying into the de Courcy family. When he returns to London, his future sister-in-law Amelia keeps a close eye on him and the countess, together with Amelia&#x27;s attorney husband Gazebee, bind all of Crosbie&#x27;s finances to the marital estate and make him pay for a furnished home in a respectable neighborhood in order to keep up appearances. Neither Crosbie nor Alexandrina are happy with their married life, and, less than four months after the wedding, Alexandrina leaves with her mother to live in the spa town of Baden-Baden, Germany, indefinitely. Crosbie gladly pays to regain his freedom.

<doc id="216313" wikidata="Q7382648" url="?curid=216313" title="Majority">
<text>A majority is more than half of a total. It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set&#x27;s elements. For example, if a group consists of 31 individuals, a majority would be 16 or more individuals, while having 15 or fewer individuals would not constitute a majority.

A majority is different from, but often confused with, a plurality, which is a subset larger than any other subset but not necessarily more than half the set. For example, if there is a group with 20 members which is divided into subgroups with 9, 6, and 5 members, then the 9-member group would be the plurality, but would not be a majority (as they have less than eleven members).

== Majority vote ==
In parliamentary procedure, a majority always means precisely &quot;more than half&quot;. Other common definitions (e.g. the frequent 50%+1) may be misleading (see &quot;Common errors&quot; below). 

Depending on the parliamentary authority used, there may be a difference in the total that is used to calculate a majority vote due to spoiled votes. Comparing the two most popular authorities in the United States: In &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order Newly Revised&quot; (abbreviated RONR), spoiled votes are counted as votes cast, but are not credited to any candidate. In &quot;The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure&quot; (abbreviated &quot;TSC&quot;), spoiled votes are not included in the total and a majority vote is defined as being more than half of all &quot;eligible&quot; votes cast. 

As it relates to a vote, a majority vote most often means a &quot;simple&quot; majority vote, which means more &quot;yes&quot; votes than &quot;no&quot; votes. Abstentions or blanks are excluded in calculating a simple majority vote. Also, the totals do not include votes cast by someone not entitled to vote or improper multiple votes by a single member.

=== Related terms ===
Other related terms containing the word &quot;majority&quot; have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.

In British English, the term &quot;size of a majority&quot;, &quot;overall majority&quot;, or &quot;working majority&quot; is used to mean the difference between the number of votes gained by the winning party and the total votes gained by all the other parties. This has led to some confusion and misuse of the terms &quot;majority&quot; or &quot;relative majority&quot; to mean what is correctly called the , i.e. the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher.

A &quot;double majority&quot; is a voting system which requires a majority of votes according to two separate criteria. e.g. in the European Union, the Council uses a double majority rule, requiring 55% of member states, representing at least 65% of the total EU population in favor. In some cases, the required percentage of member states in favor is increased to 72%.

A &quot;supermajority&quot; is a specified threshold greater than one half. A common use of a supermajority is a &quot;two-thirds vote&quot;, which is sometimes referred to as a &quot;two-thirds majority&quot;.

=== Voting basis ===
The voting basis refers to the set of members considered when calculating whether a proposal has a majority, i.e. the denominator used in calculating the percent support for a vote. Common voting bases include:

* Members present and voting: Members who cast a vote. Often called a simple majority, and excludes abstentions. 
** If 30 members were at a meeting, but only 20 votes were cast, a majority of members present and voting would be 11 votes.

* Members present: All members present at a meeting, including those who do not vote or abstain. Often called an absolute majority. 
** If 30 members were at a meeting, a majority of the members present would be 16. In any situation which specifies such a requirement for a vote, an abstention would have the same effect as a &quot;no&quot; vote.
* Entire membership: all the members of a body, including those absent and those present but not voting. In practical terms, it means an absence or an abstention from voting is equivalent to a &quot;no&quot; vote. It may be contrasted with a majority vote which only requires more than half of those actually voting to approve a proposition for it to be enacted
** By way of illustration, in February 2007 the Italian Government fell after it lost a vote in the Italian Senate by 158 votes to 136 (with 24 abstentions). The government needed an absolute majority in the 318-member house but fell two votes short of the required 160 when two of its own supporters abstained.
* Fixed membership: the official, theoretical size of the full deliberative assembly. It is used only when a specific number of seats or memberships is established in the rules governing the organization. A majority of the fixed membership would be different from a majority of the entire membership if there are vacancies.
** For example, say a board has 13 seats. If the board has the maximum number of members, or 13 members, a majority of the entire membership and a majority of the fixed membership would be seven members. However, if there are two vacancies (so that there are only 11 members on the board), then a majority of the entire membership would be six members (more than half of ten), but a majority of the fixed membership would still be seven members.

== Examples ==
For example, assume that votes are cast for three people for an office: Alice, Bob, and Carol. In all three scenarios, Alice receives a plurality, or the most votes among the candidates, but in some she does not receive a majority.

=== Scenario 1 ===

In Scenario 1, Alice received a majority of the vote. There were 20 votes cast and Alice received more than half of them.

=== Scenario 2 ===

In Scenario 2, assume all three candidates are eligible. In this case, no one received a majority of the vote.

=== Scenario 3 ===
In Scenario 3, assume that Alice and Bob are eligible candidates, but Carol is not. Using &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, no one received a majority vote, which is the same as Scenario 2. In this case, the 4 votes for Carol are counted in the total, but are not credited to Carol (which precludes the possibility of an ineligible candidate being credited with receiving a majority vote). However, using &quot;The Standard Code&quot;, Alice received a majority vote since only votes for eligible candidates are counted. In this case, there are 16 votes for eligible candidates and Alice received more than half of those 16 votes.

== Temporary majority ==
A temporary majority exists when the positions of the members present and voting in a meeting of a deliberative assembly on a subject are not representative of the membership as a whole. Parliamentary procedure contains some provisions designed to protect against a temporary majority violating the rights of absentees. For instance, previous notice is typically required to rescind, repeal or annul something previously adopted by a majority vote. However, in this and many other cases, previous notice is not required if a majority of the entire membership votes in favor, because that indicates that it is clearly not a temporary majority. Another protection against a decision being made by a temporary majority is the motion to reconsider and enter on the minutes, by which two members can suspend action on a measure until it is called up at a meeting on another day.

== Common errors ==
The expression &quot;at least 50% +1&quot; may mislead when &quot;majority&quot; is actually intended, where the total number referred to is odd. For example, say a board has 7 members. &quot;Majority&quot; means &quot;at least 4&quot; in this case (more than half of 7, which is 3.5). But 50% + 1 is 4.5, and since a number of people can only be a positive integer, &quot;at least 50% + 1&quot; could be interpreted as meaning &quot;at least 5&quot;.

<text>Eva Marie Saint (born July 4, 1924) is an American retired actress. In a career that spanned nearly 80 years, she won an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award, alongside nominations for a Golden Globe Award and two British Academy Film Awards. Saint is the oldest living and earliest surviving Academy Award winner, and one of the last living stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Saint attended Bowling Green State University and began her career as a television and radio actress in the late 1940s. She played the role of Thelma in Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; (1953). She made her film debut in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), opposite Marlon Brando. The film won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and earned her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress along with a BAFTA nomination for Most Promising Newcomer.

From then on, Saint appeared in a variety of roles, including &quot;Raintree County&quot; (1957), opposite Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor; and Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1957), opposite Don Murray and Anthony Franciosa, for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama; and Eve Kendall in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), opposite Cary Grant. In the 1960s, Saint appeared in &quot;Exodus&quot; (1960), alongside Paul Newman; &quot;The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1965), alongside Carl Reiner and Alan Arkin; &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; (1965), which reunited her with Elizabeth Taylor and featured Richard Burton; &quot;36 Hours&quot; (1965) with James Garner; and John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), opposite Yves Montand and in her second film with James Garner. Beginning in the 1970s, her film career began to decline and she returned to television in the following decades and into the 2010s, with a few film roles throughout.

==Early life==

Saint was born on July 4, 1924, in Newark, New Jersey, to Quaker parents. Her father was John Merle Saint and her mother was Eva Marie (née Rice) Saint. She attended Bethlehem Central High School in Delmar, New York, near Albany, graduating in 1942. She was inducted into the high school&#x27;s hall of fame in 2006. She studied acting at Bowling Green State University and joined Delta Gamma sorority. During this time she played the lead role in a production of &quot;Personal Appearance&quot;. A theater on Bowling Green&#x27;s campus is named after her. She was an active member in the theater honorary fraternity, Theta Alpha Phi, and served as record keeper of the student council in 1944.

==Career==
===Early television career===
Saint&#x27;s introduction to television began as an NBC page. She appeared in the live NBC-TV show &quot;Campus Hoopla&quot; in 1946–47. Her performances on this program are recorded on rare kinescope, and audio recordings of these telecasts are preserved in the Library of Congress. She also appeared in &quot;Bonnie Maid&#x27;s Versa-Tile Varieties&quot; on NBC in 1949 as one of the original singing &quot;Bonnie Maids&quot; used in the live commercials.

Saint appeared in a 1947 &quot;Life&quot; Magazine special about television, and also in a 1949 feature &quot;Life&quot; article about her as a struggling actress earning minimum amounts from early TV while trying to make ends meet in New York City. In the late 1940s, Saint continued to make her living by extensive work in radio and television. In 1953, she won the Drama Critics Award for her Broadway stage role in the Horton Foote play &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; (1953), in which she co-starred with actresses such as Lillian Gish and Jo Van Fleet.

In 1955, Saint was nominated for her first Emmy for &quot;Best Actress In A Single Performance&quot; on &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse,&quot; playing the young mistress of middle-aged E. G. Marshall in &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; by Paddy Chayefsky. She won another Emmy nomination for the 1955 television musical version of &quot;Our Town,&quot; adapted from the Thornton Wilder play of the same name. Co-stars were Paul Newman and Frank Sinatra. Her success and acclaim in TV productions were of such a high level that &quot;one slightly hyperbolic primordial TV critic dubbed her &#x27;the Helen Hayes of television.&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;On the Waterfront&quot;===
Saint made her feature film debut in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), starring Marlon Brando and directed by Elia Kazan—a performance for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance in the role of Edie Doyle (whose brother&#x27;s death sets the film&#x27;s drama in motion), which she won, with competitors including Claire Trevor, Nina Foch, Katy Jurado and Jan Sterling. She also earned her a British Academy of Film and Television Award nomination for &quot;Most Promising Newcomer&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic A. H. Weiler wrote, &quot;In casting Eva Marie Saint—a newcomer to movies from TV and Broadway—Mr. Kazan has come up with a pretty and blond artisan who does not have to depend on these attributes. Her parochial school training is no bar to love with the proper stranger. Amid scenes of carnage, she gives tenderness and sensitivity to genuine romance.&quot; The film was a major success and launched Saint&#x27;s film career. She received $7,500 for the role.

In a 2000 interview in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine, Saint recalled making the film, which has been highly influential, saying, &quot;[Elia] Kazan put me in a room with Marlon Brando. He said &#x27;Brando is the boyfriend of your sister. You&#x27;re not used to being with a young man. Don&#x27;t let him in the door under any circumstances.&#x27; I don&#x27;t know what he told Marlon; you&#x27;ll have to ask him—good luck! [Brando] came in and started teasing me. He put me off balance. And I remained off balance for the whole shoot.&quot; She repeated the anecdote in a 2010 interview.

Saint appeared alongside Bob Hope in &quot;That Certain Feeling&quot; (1956) for which she received $50,000. She was then offered $100,000 to star in the Civil War drama &quot;Raintree County&quot; (1957) with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. After that, she starred with Don Murray in &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;, the pioneering drug-addiction drama, which although made later than &quot;Raintree Country&quot; was released earlier in 1957. She received a nomination for the &quot;Best Foreign Actress&quot; award from the British Academy of Film and Television for her performance.

===&quot;North by Northwest&quot;===

Director Alfred Hitchcock surprised many by choosing Saint over dozens of other candidates for the femme fatale role in what was to become a suspense classic &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959) with Cary Grant and James Mason. Written by Ernest Lehman, the film updated and expanded upon the director&#x27;s early &quot;wrong man&quot; spy adventures of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, including &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, &quot;Young and Innocent&quot;, and &quot;Saboteur&quot;. &quot;North by Northwest&quot; became a box-office hit and an influence on spy films for decades. The film ranks number forty on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest American Movies of All Time.

Hitchcock worked with Saint to make her voice lower and huskier, and personally chose costumes for her during a shopping trip to Bergdorf Goodman in New York City.

The change in Saint&#x27;s screen persona, coupled with her adroit performance as a seductive woman of mystery who keeps Cary Grant (and the audience) off balance, was widely heralded. In his review of August 7, 1959, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Abe H. Weiler wrote, &quot;In casting Eva Marie Saint as [Cary Grant&#x27;s] romantic vis-a-vis, Mr. Hitchcock has plumbed some talents not shown by the actress heretofore. Although she is seemingly a hard, designing type, she also emerges both the sweet heroine and a glamorous charmer.&quot;

In 2000, recalling her experience making the picture with Cary Grant and Hitchcock, Saint said, &quot;[Grant] would say, &#x27;See, Eva Marie, you don&#x27;t have to cry in a movie to have a good time. Just kick up your heels and have fun.&#x27; Hitchcock said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want you to do a sink-to-sink movie again, ever. You&#x27;ve done these black-and-white movies like &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. It&#x27;s drab in that tenement house. Women go to the movies, and they&#x27;ve just left the sink at home. They don&#x27;t want to see you at the sink.&#x27; In a 2010 interview she stated: &quot;I said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t promise you that, Hitch, because I love those dramas.&#x27;&quot;

===Mid-career===

Although &quot;North by Northwest&quot; might have propelled her to the top ranks of stardom, Saint chose to limit her film work in order to spend time with her husband since 1951, director Jeffrey Hayden, and their two children. In the 1960s, Saint continued to distinguish herself in both high-profile and offbeat pictures. She co-starred with Paul Newman in &quot;Exodus&quot; (1960), a historical drama about the founding of the state of Israel adapted from the novel of the same name by Leon Uris. It was directed by Otto Preminger. She also co-starred with Warren Beatty, Karl Malden and Angela Lansbury as a tragic beauty in the drama &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962). Based upon a novel by James Leo Herlihy and a screenplay by William Inge, the film was directed by John Frankenheimer.

Saint appeared with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the melodrama &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; for Vincente Minnelli, and with James Garner in the World War II thriller &quot;36 Hours&quot; (1965), directed by George Seaton. Saint joined an all-star cast in the comedic satire, &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot;, directed by Norman Jewison, and the international racing drama, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966) directed by Frankenheimer and presented in Cinerama.

Saint received some of her best reviews for her performance in &quot;Loving&quot; (1970), co-starring as the wife of George Segal. The film was about a commercial artist&#x27;s relationship with his wife and other women; it was critically acclaimed but did not have wide viewership.

Because of the mostly second-rate film roles that came her way in the 1970s, Saint returned to television and the stage in the 1980s. She received an Emmy nomination for the 1977 miniseries &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; and a 1978 Emmy nomination for &quot;Taxi!!!&quot;. She was reunited with &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; co-star Karl Malden in the television film &quot;Fatal Vision&quot;, this time as the wife of his character, as he investigated the murder of his daughter and granddaughters. She played the mother of Cybill Shepherd in the television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, a role that spanned episodes over three years.

===Later career===

Saint returned to the big screen for the first time in over a decade in &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; (1986), in which she played the mother of Tom Hanks&#x27;s character; it was directed by Garry Marshall. Critics applauded her return to features. Saint was soon back on the small screen in numerous projects. After receiving five nominations, she won her first Emmy Award for the 1990 miniseries &quot;People Like Us&quot;. She appeared in a number of television productions in the 1990s and was cast as the mother of radio producer, Roz Doyle, in a 1999 episode of the comedy series &quot;Frasier&quot;.

In 2000, Saint returned to feature films in &quot;I Dreamed of Africa&quot; with Kim Basinger. In 2005, she co-starred with Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard in &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Knocking&quot;. Also in 2005, she appeared in the family film &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie&quot;, co-starring AnnaSophia Robb, Jeff Daniels, and Cicely Tyson.

In 2006, Saint appeared in &quot;Superman Returns&quot; as Martha Kent, the adoptive mother of Superman, alongside Brandon Routh and a computer-generated performance from her &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; co-star Marlon Brando. Saint was presented one of the Golden Boot Awards in 2007 for her contributions to western cinema.

Saint lent her voice to the 2012 Nickelodeon animated series &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;, a sequel to the hit TV show &quot;,&quot; playing the now-elderly Katara, a main character from the original series. In September 2012, Saint was cast as the adult version of Willa in the film adaptation of the novel &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Mark Helprin.

At the age of 93, Saint appeared at the 2018 Academy Award ceremony to present the award for Costume Design. She received a standing ovation upon entering the stage. In 2021, Saint appeared alongside Marisa Tomei in the podcast play series &quot;The Pack Podcast&quot; as part of the segment &quot;The Bus Ride&quot;.

Saint has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures at 6624 Hollywood Boulevard, and one for television at 6730 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Personal life==

Saint married producer and director Jeffrey Hayden on October 28, 1951. They had two children together: son Darrell Hayden, born April 1, 1955, and daughter Laurette Hayden, born July 19, 1958. Their first child, Darrell, was born two days after she won an Academy Award for &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. She began her acceptance speech with &quot;I may have the baby right here!&quot; Saint and Hayden also have four grandchildren and were married for 65 years, until Hayden&#x27;s death in 2016. 
On July 4, 2024, Saint turned 100, which she spent celebrating with four generations of family members in Los Angeles.

<text>The Country Wife is a Restoration comedy written by William Wycherley and first performed in 1675. A product of the tolerant early Restoration period, the play reflects an aristocratic and anti-Puritan ideology, and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time. The title contains a lewd pun with regard to the first syllable of &quot;country&quot;. It is based on several plays by Molière, with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded: colloquial prose dialogue in place of Molière&#x27;s verse, a complicated, fast-paced plot tangle, and many sex jokes. It turns on two indelicate plot devices: a rake&#x27;s trick of pretending impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women, and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young &quot;country wife&quot;, with her discovery of the joys of town life, especially the fascinating London men.
The implied condition the Rake, Horner, claimed to suffer from was, he said, contracted in France whilst &quot;dealing with common women&quot;. The only cure was to have a surgeon drastically reduce the extent of his manly stature; therefore, he could be no threat to any man&#x27;s wife.

The scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play&#x27;s history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, &quot;The Country Wife&quot; was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick&#x27;s cleaned-up and bland version &quot;The Country Girl&quot;, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.

==Background==

After the 18-year Puritan stage ban was lifted at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the theatrical life of London recreated itself quickly and abundantly. During the reign of Charles II (1660–1685), playwrights such as John Dryden, George Etherege, Aphra Behn, and William Wycherley wrote comedies that triumphantly reassert aristocratic dominance and prestige after the years of middle class power during Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth. Reflecting the atmosphere of the Court, these plays celebrate a lifestyle of sensual intrigue and conquest, especially conquest that served to humiliate the husbands of the London middle classes and to avenge, in the sensual arena, the marginalisation and exile suffered by royalists under Cromwell. Charles&#x27; personal interest in the stage nourished Restoration drama, and his most favoured courtiers were poets, playwrights, and men of wit, such as John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset, and William Wycherley. Wycherley had no title or wealth, but had by 1675 already recommended himself by two well-received comedies and had been admitted to the inner circle, sharing the conversation and sometimes the mistresses of Charles, who &quot;was extremely fond of him upon account of his wit&quot;. In 1675, at age 35, he created a sensation with &quot;The Country Wife&quot;, greeted as the bawdiest and wittiest play yet seen on the English stage.

Like Charles II, Wycherley had spent some Commonwealth years in France and become interested in French drama, and throughout his short playwriting career (1671–1676) he would borrow plotlines and techniques from French plays, particularly Molière. However, in contrast to the French, English audiences of the 1670s had no enthusiasm for structurally simple comedies or for the neoclassical unities of time, place, and action, but demanded fast pace, many complications, and above all &quot;variety&quot;. To achieve the much denser texture and more complex plotting that pleased in London, Wycherley would combine several source plays to produce bustling action and clashing moods, ranging from farce through paradox to satire.

A Restoration novelty of which Wycherley took advantage was the readiness of public opinion to accept women on stage, for the first time in British history. Audiences were fascinated to see real women reverse the cross-dressing of the Elizabethan boy actors and appear in tight-fitting male outfits in the popular breeches roles, and to hear them match or even outdo the rake heroes in repartee and double entendre. Charles&#x27; choice of actresses as mistresses, notably Nell Gwyn, helped keep the interest fresh, and Wycherley plays on this interest in &quot;The Country Wife&quot; by having Mr. Pinchwife disguise his wife (the eponymous &#x27;country wife&#x27;) in a boy&#x27;s outfit. It has also been suggested that he uses the allure of women on display to emphasise in an almost voyeuristic way Margery&#x27;s provocative innocence, as well as the immodest knowingness of &quot;town&quot; wives like Lady Fidget.

==Plots==
&quot;The Country Wife&quot; is more neatly constructed than most Restoration comedies, but is typical of its time and place in having three sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner&#x27;s impotence trick, the married life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.

1. Horner&#x27;s impotence trick provides the play&#x27;s organising principle and the turning-points of the action. The trick, to pretend impotence to be allowed where no complete man may go, is distantly based on the classic Roman comedy &quot;Eunuchus&quot; by Terence. The upper-class town rake Harry Horner begins a campaign to seduce as many respectable ladies as possible, thus cuckolding or &quot;putting horns on&quot; their husbands: Horner&#x27;s name serves to alert the audience to what is going on. He spreads a false rumour of his own impotence, to convince married men that he can safely be allowed to socialise with their wives. The rumour is also meant to assist his mass seduction campaign by helping him identify women who are secretly eager for extramarital sex, because those women will react to a supposedly impotent man with tell-tale horror and disgust. This diagnostic trick, which invariably works perfectly, is one of &quot;The Country Wife&quot;&#x27;s many running jokes at the expense of hypocritical upper-class women who are rakes at heart.

Horner&#x27;s ruse of impotence is a success: he has sex with many ladies of virtuous reputation, mostly the wives and daughters of citizens or &quot;cits&quot;, i.e. upwardly mobile businessmen and entrepreneurs of the City of London, as opposed to the Town, the aristocratic quarters where Horner and his friends live. Three such ladies appear on stage, usually together: Lady Fidget, her sister-in-law Mrs Dainty Fidget, and her tag-along friend Mrs Squeamish names that convey both a delicate sensitivity about the jewel of reputation, and a certain fidgety physical unease or tickle and the dialogue gives an indefinite impression of many more. The play is structured as a farce, driven by Horner&#x27;s secret and by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth, from which he extricates himself by aplomb and good luck. A final threat of exposure comes in the last scene, through the well-meaning frankness of the young country wife Margery Pinchwife. Margery is indignant at the accusations of impotence directed at &quot;poor dear Mr. Horner&quot;, which she knows from personal experience to be untrue, and is intent on saying so at the traditional end-of-the-play public gathering of the entire cast. In a final trickster masterpiece, Horner averts the danger, joining forces with his more sophisticated lovers to persuade the jealous Pinchwife to at least pretend to believe Horner impotent and his own wife still innocent. Horner never becomes a reformed character but is assumed to go on reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.
2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière&#x27;s &quot;The School for Husbands&quot; (1661) and &quot;The School for Wives&quot; (1662). Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married a naive country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swath through the complexities of London upper-class marriage and seduction without even noticing them. Restoration comedies often contrast town and country for humorous effect, and this is one example of it. Both Molière in the &quot;School For Wives&quot; and Wycherley in &quot;The Country Wife&quot; get much comic business out of the meeting between, on the one hand, innocent but inquisitive young girls and, on the other hand, the sophisticated 17th-century culture of sexual relations which they encounter. The difference, which would later make Molière acceptable and Wycherley atrocious to 19th-century critics and theatre producers, is that Molière&#x27;s Agnes is naturally pure and virtuous, while Margery is just the opposite: enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors, she keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife&#x27;s pathological jealousy always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.

3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a conventional love story without any direct source. By means of persistence and true love, the witty Harcourt, Horner&#x27;s friend, wins the hand of Pinchwife&#x27;s sister Alithea, who is, when the play opens, engaged to the shallow fop Sparkish. The delay mechanism of this story is that the upright Alithea holds fast virtuously to her engagement to Sparkish, even while his stupid and cynical character unfolds to her. It is only after Alithea has been caught in a misleadingly compromising situation with Horner, and Sparkish has doubted her virtue while Harcourt has not, that she finally admits her love for Harcourt.

==Key scenes==
Notorious scenes in the play include &quot;the china scene&quot;, a sustained double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection with two of his lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner &quot;knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet&quot; (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made &quot;china&quot; a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.

In another famous scene Lady Fidget&#x27;s self-styled &quot;virtuous gang&quot; meet up at Horner&#x27;s lodging to carouse, throw off their public virtue, and behave exactly like male rakes, singing riotous songs and drinking defiant toasts. Finally each of the ladies triumphantly declares that Horner himself is the very lover they have been toasting, and a mayhem of jealousy breaks out as they realise that their friends have also been receiving Horner&#x27;s favours. But they quickly realise they have no choice but to keep the scandalous secret: &quot;Well then, there&#x27;s no remedy, sister sharers, let us not fall out, but have a care of our honour&quot; (V.iv.169).

A scene of the Pinchwife plot that combines farce and nightmare is Pinchwife&#x27;s attempt to force Mrs Pinchwife to write a haughty farewell letter to Horner, using the Freudian threat to &quot;write whore with this penknife in your face&quot; (IV.ii.95). Like all Pinchwife&#x27;s efforts it misfires, giving Mrs Pinchwife instead an opportunity to send to Horner a letter of praise.

==Themes and analysis==

===The dynamics of marriage===
People marry for the sake of outward appearances, for example Alithea feels that she has no choice but to marry Sparkish because her status in society expects her to. Wives are treated as property as made evident by Pinchwife who locks Margery in her room and forbids her from speaking to men. Sir Jasper&#x27;s marriage to Lady Fidget is beneficial to his business; therefore he treats her as his asset. He constantly asks Horner to &quot;watch&quot; her so that she will have no opportunity to make a cuckold out of him. Furthermore, there is a struggle for dominance between men and women. As Pinchwife says, ‘”If we do not cheat women, they’ll cheat us&quot; is the very basis for the chief plot of the play, &quot;which centers upon the exchange of positions of dominance within his own family&quot;. Pinchwife decides to marry a country woman in the hopes that she will not be clever enough to know how to cheat, but his extremes in preventing her exposure to men leads to his downfall. Only the women are expected to remain faithful to their husbands. As a result, Lady Fidget &quot;uses sex as a means of revenge against their husbands and achieve a kind of moral victory over them by making them what they most fear to be cuckolds&quot;.

===Horner’s position of power===
Initially, Horner is confident that he can seek out the married women who are willing to have affairs because they are the ones who do not care about their honour. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner&#x27;s lodgings despite his protest, conveying &quot;his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch&quot;. They talk about him as if he was not present, referring to him as a &#x27;beast,’ &#x27;toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, &quot;As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also &#x27;claps him on the back&#x27; thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented&quot;. While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has &quot;exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognises him to be&quot;. Horner&#x27;s true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.

===Horner&#x27;s true intentions towards women===
Andrew Kaufman claims that although Horner may seem to pretend to despise women because of his pretended state as a eunuch, his hatred towards women is real. When asked whether he enjoys the company of women, &quot;Horner&#x27;s language in a constant barrage of hostile wit, discharging hostility which cannot, at the moment, be directly expressed. His characteristic action, verbally, is to &#x27;unmask&#x27; women.&quot;

==First performance==

&quot;The Country Wife&quot; was first performed in January 1675, by the King&#x27;s Company, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This luxurious playhouse, designed by Christopher Wren, had opened less than a year before and provided a more modern stage to accommodate innovations in scenic design, while still allowing a close connection between actors and the audience.

The original cast was listed in the first edition of &quot;The Country Wife&quot;, as was standard practice, and modern scholars have suggested that this information throws light on Wycherley&#x27;s intentions. Wycherley wrote with the original actors in mind, tailoring the roles to their strengths. Also, since the audience consisted mostly of habitual playgoers, authors and directors could use the associations of an actor&#x27;s previous repertoire to enrich or undercut a character, effects familiar on television and in the cinema today.

Several of the actors were specialised comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea&#x27;s original fiancé. At the outset of his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines already had a reputation for eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish is not merely a comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea.

 Pinchwife was played by the elderly Michael Mohun, who was best known for playing menacing villains, such as Volpone and Iago. Mrs. Pinchwife was Elizabeth Boutell or Bowtel, a young actress who had &quot;a childish look. Her voice was weak, tho&#x27; very mellow; she generally acted the &quot;young innocent lady&quot; whom all the heroes are mad in love with&quot;. Boutell&#x27;s previous recorded roles had in fact all been unmarried as well as innocent girls, and Margery was her first married role. Matching Boutell and Mohun as a couple would emphasise &quot;her youth and innocence against Mohun&#x27;s age and violence&quot;. The other husband to be cuckolded by Horner, Sir Jaspar Fidget, was played by another elderly actor, William Cartwright, best known for comic parts such as Falstaff. This casting suggests that Sir Jaspar was played as a straightforwardly comic part, while Pinchwife would be &quot;alarming as well as funny&quot;.

The male leads Horner and Harcourt were played by the contrasted actors Charles Hart and Edward Kynaston (or Kenaston). The forcefully masculine 45-year-old Hart &quot;was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Conquest of Granada&quot;&quot;, and also for playing rakish comedy heroes with nonchalance and charisma. Many critics credit the personalities and skills of Hart and Nell Gwyn with creating, as much as any playwright did, the famous flirting/bantering Restoration comedy couple. The beautiful androgynous Kynaston, probably in his early thirties, was a different kind of hero. He had started his career in 1660 as the outstanding Restoration female impersonator &quot;the prettiest woman in the whole house&quot; before real women entered the profession in the fall of 1660. (The 2004 movie &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; is loosely based on Kynaston&#x27;s career.)

John Harold Wilson argues that the famously virile stage presence of Hart as Horner must be taken into account when interpreting the play. As personified by Hart, Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as &quot;the old-fashioned way&quot;, by being &quot;dangerously attractive&quot;, and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless. Harcourt/Kynaston, although by 1675 a well-regarded and skilful actor of male roles, would clearly have been overshadowed by Horner/Hart. The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true-love plot. Horner&#x27;s primary mistress Lady Fidget, spokeswoman for &quot;the virtuous gang&quot; of secretly sex-hungry town wives, was played by the dynamic Elizabeth Knepp, who Samuel Pepys declared &quot;the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;, talents that the famous drinking scene in Horner&#x27;s lodging seems designed to do justice to. By contrast, the choice of the bit-part actress Elizabeth James as Alithea would have de-emphasised the Harcourt-Alithea plot. Such historical considerations have made modern critics sceptical of Norman Holland&#x27;s classic 1959 &quot;right way/wrong way&quot; interpretation of the play, which positions the true-love plot as the most important one.

==Stage history==
The play had a good initial run, although Horner&#x27;s trick and the notorious china scene immediately raised offence. Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; (1676), where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in &quot;The Country Wife&quot; &quot;has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady&#x27;s chamber&quot;. Olivia&#x27;s sensible cousin Eliza insists that she&#x27;ll go see &quot;The Country Wife&quot; anyway: &quot;All this will not put me out of conceit with china, nor the play, which is acted today, or another of the same beastly author&#x27;s, as you call him, which I&#x27;ll go see.&quot; Writing himself into &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; as the &quot;beastly author&quot; of the china scene, Wycherley seems more amused than repentant. &quot;The Country Wife&quot; did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable repertory play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, but by then public taste had changed too much to put up with the sex jokes any longer. Its last eighteenth century performance was on 7 November 1753, followed by a hiatus of 171 years, until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London. The first-ever American performance of Wycherley&#x27;s original &quot;Country Wife&quot; took place in 1931. Wycherley&#x27;s play is now again a stage classic, with countless professional and amateur performances, an actors&#x27; favourite because of the high number of good parts it offers.

==Adaptations==
===Expurgated versions===
The bawdy elements of &quot;The Country Wife&quot; inspired multiple adaptations to bowdlerise it. The first was by John Lee, whose 1765 revision eliminated the Horner character and cut the play from five acts to two in an attempt to make it &quot;inoffensively humorous&quot;. A more successful adaptation was made the following year by David Garrick. He retained the five-act structure, but renamed the characters and called it &quot;The Country Girl&quot;. Peggy (the renamed Margery) is a virginal country girl who wants to marry against the wishes of her guardian, Jack Moody (the reimagining of Pinchwife). In this cleaned-up form, &quot;The Country Wife&quot; continued a shadowy existence into the twentieth century, as Garrick&#x27;s version was very popular, going through at least twenty editions and reaching the New York stage in 1794. The few modern critics who have read Garrick&#x27;s version typically dismiss it as &quot;sentimental and boring, where &quot;The Country Wife&quot; is astringent and provocative&quot;.

===Other adaptations===
&quot;She Shall Have Music&quot;, a 1959 musical comedy, mixed &quot;The Country Wife&quot; with other Restoration comedies such as &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;Love for Love&quot;. It debuted Off-Broadway on 22 January 1959.

In 1977, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; broadcast a production of &quot;The Country Wife&quot; with Anthony Andrews as Horner, Helen Mirren as Margery and Bernard Cribbins as Pinchwife; it was later released on DVD.

The 1975 film &quot;Shampoo&quot;, with Warren Beatty as the Horner character, is a somewhat distant version of &quot;The Country Wife&quot; after exactly 300 years, reportedly inspired by the Chichester Festival production of 1969.

In 1992, &quot;The Country Wife&quot; was adapted into a musical called &quot;Lust&quot;. Written by the Heather Brothers, it was first performed at the Queens Theatre in Hornchurch in the London Borough of Havering in 1992. It later transferred to the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London&#x27;s West End, starring Denis Lawson as Horner. Lawson travelled with the production to New York for an Off-Broadway run at the John Houseman Theatre in 1995.

On 13 April 2008, an adaptation was broadcast on BBC Radio 3, directed by David Blount and featuring Ben Miller as Horner, Geoffrey Whitehead as Pinchwife, Clare Corbett as Mrs. Margery Pinchwife, Nigel Anthony as Sir Jasper Fidget, Celia Imrie as Lady Fidget and Jonathan Keeble as Harcourt.

==Critical reception==

From its creation until the mid-20th century, &quot;The Country Wife&quot; was subject to both aesthetic praise and moral outrage. Many critics through the centuries have acknowledged its linguistic energy and wit, including even Victorians such as Leigh Hunt, who praised its literary quality in a selection of Restoration plays that he published in 1840 (itself a daring undertaking, for reputedly &quot;obscene&quot; plays that had been long out of print). However, in an influential review of Hunt&#x27;s edition, Thomas Babington Macaulay swept aside questions of literary merit, claiming with indignation that &quot;Wycherley&#x27;s indecency is protected against the critics as a skunk is protected against the hunters. It is safe, because it is too filthy to handle and too noisome even to approach.&quot; Margery Pinchwife, regarded in Wycherley&#x27;s own time as a purely comic character, was denounced by Macaulay as a scarlet woman who threw herself into &quot;a licentious intrigue of the lowest and least sentimental kind&quot;.
It was Macaulay, not Hunt, who set the keynote for the 19th century. The play was impossible equally to stage and to discuss, forgotten and obscure.

Academic critics of the first half of the 20th century continued to approach &quot;The Country Wife&quot; gingerly, with frequent warnings about its &quot;heartlessness&quot;, even as they praised its keen social observation. At this time nobody found it funny, and positive criticism tried to rescue it as satire and social criticism rather than as comedy. Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;licentious&quot; Mrs. Pinchwife becomes in the 20th century a focus for moral concern: to critics such as Bonamy Dobrée, she is a tragic character, destined to have her naiveté cruelly taken advantage of by the &quot;grim, nightmare figure&quot; of Horner.

==Modern criticism==
The past fifty years have seen a major change, and academic critics have acknowledged the play as a powerful and original work. Norman Holland&#x27;s widely influential proposal in 1959 of a &quot;right way/wrong way&quot; reading took Wycherley&#x27;s morality with innovative seriousness and interpreted the play as presenting two bad kinds of masculinity Horner&#x27;s libertinism and Pinchwife&#x27;s possessiveness and recommending the golden mean of Harcourt, the true lover, the representative of mutual trust in marriage. A competing milestone approach of the same generation is that of Rose Zimbardo (1965), who discusses the play in generic and historical terms as a fierce social satire.
Both these types of reading have now fallen out of favour; there is little consensus about the meaning of &quot;The Country Wife&quot;, but its &quot;notorious resistance to interpretation&quot; is having an invigorating rather than damping effect on academic interest. The play&#x27;s ideological dimension has been emphasised recently. It was written by a courtier for a courtly and aristocratic audience, and Douglas Canfield has pointed to an unusual complication for a courtly play. Horner&#x27;s acts of cuckolding aggression are directed not only at disrupting middle-class families of &quot;the City&quot;, in the usual way of the aristocratic Restoration rake, but also at his own, upper, class, the inhabitants of &quot;the Town&quot; the new and fashionable quarters (the future West End) that had sprung up west of the medieval City walls after the Great Fire of London in 1666. The courtier code proposed by Wycherley is of a sexual game.

Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued in &quot;Between Men&quot; that the game is played not between men and women, but between men by means of women, who are merely the &quot;conduits&quot; of homosocial desire between men. The hierarchy of wits meant that the wittiest and most virile man would win at the game. Thus Horner, as Canfield puts it, &quot;represents not just class superiority, but that subset of class represented by the Town wits, a privileged minority that ... is the jet set identified with the Town and the Court as the loci of real power in the kingdom.&quot; The aggressive attack mounted in the china scene against the class and the generation by which Wycherley was patronised with the expectation that he would defend it (against Sir Jaspar Fidget and Lady Fidget), suggests Canfield, would only let an audience of that class laugh comfortably if Horner were punished by actual impotence in the end, which he is not. &quot;When the play concludes with no poetical justice that makes Horner really impotent&quot;, writes Canfield, &quot;leaving him instead potent and still on the make, the audience laughs at its own expense: the women of quality nervously because they have been misogynistically slandered; the men of quality nervously because at some level they recognize that class solidarity is just a pleasing fiction.&quot;

<text>Soyuz TMA-2 was a Soyuz (Russian Союз ТМА-2, &quot;Union TMA-2&quot;) mission to the International Space Station (ISS) launched by a Soyuz FG launch vehicle. The spacecraft docked with the ISS on April 28, 2003 and undocked on October 28, 2003. Soyuz TMA-2 was the second flight for the &quot;TMA&quot; modification of the Soyuz spacecraft, and the 6th Soyuz to fly to the ISS.

The commander was Yuri Ivanovich Malenchenko (Russia), and the flight engineer was Edward Tsang Lu (USA). After docking with the ISS they exchanged with the resident crew on ISS and became the seventh station crew, called &quot;ISS Expedition Seven&quot;. Alexander Kaleri and Michael Foale were assigned as the backup crew.

==Crew==
==Original Crew==
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 7136 kg
*Perigee: 200 km
*Apogee: 250 km
*Inclination: 51.7°
*Period: 88.7 min

===Docking with ISS===
*Docked to ISS: April 28, 2003, 05:56 UTC (to nadir port of Zarya)
*Undocked from ISS: October 27, 2003, 23:17 UTC (from nadir port of Zarya)

==Mission highlights==
Originally the Soyuz missions to the ISS were all planned to be only taxi mission to deliver a new Soyuz spacecraft as the station&#x27;s lifeboat every six month with a visiting crew, but not for crew exchange. Until the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the same was planned for Soyuz TMA-2, a visiting crew consisting of commander Gennady Padalka and ESA-astronaut Pedro Duque were to spend about one week at the station and then return with the previous Soyuz TMA-1 spacecraft. The third seat might have gone to the Chilean Klaus von Storch as a Chilean space agency (Agencia Chilena del Espacio) cosmonaut, but even before the Columbia disaster, it looked like his flight would not happen, and the seat would go to the Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov or to deliver freight to the station.
During his stay on the station, Malenchenko became the first person to get married in space. His bride was in Texas where long distance marriages are legal.

The spacecraft returned to Earth on October 28, with both the &quot;Expedition 7&quot; crew as well as Pedro Duque on board. Duque was launched with Soyuz TMA-3 and spent only one week on board of the ISS.

<text>Harold Scott MacDonald &quot;Donald&quot; Coxeter (9 February 1907 – 31 March 2003) was a British-Canadian geometer and mathematician. He is regarded as one of the greatest geometers of the 20th century.

Coxeter was born in England and educated at the University of Cambridge, with student visits to Princeton University. He worked for 60 years at the University of Toronto in Canada, from 1936 until his retirement in 1996, becoming a full professor there in 1948. His many honours included membership in the Royal Society of Canada, the Royal Society, and the Order of Canada.

He was an author of 12 books, including &quot;The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra&quot; (1938) and &quot;Regular Polytopes&quot; (1947). Many concepts in geometry and group theory are named after him, including the Coxeter graph, Coxeter groups, Coxeter&#x27;s loxodromic sequence of tangent circles, Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams, and the Todd–Coxeter algorithm.

== Biography ==
Coxeter was born in Kensington, England, to Harold Samuel Coxeter and Lucy (). His father had taken over the family business of Coxeter &amp; Son, manufacturers of surgical instruments and compressed gases (including a mechanism for anaesthetising surgical patients with nitrous oxide), but was able to retire early and focus on sculpting and baritone singing; Lucy Coxeter was a portrait and landscape painter who had attended the Royal Academy of Arts. A maternal cousin was the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.

In his youth, Coxeter composed music and was an accomplished pianist at the age of 10. He felt that mathematics and music were intimately related, outlining his ideas in a 1962 article on &quot;Music and Mathematics&quot; in the &quot;Canadian Music Journal&quot;.

He was educated at King Alfred School, London, and St George&#x27;s School, Harpenden, where his best friend was John Flinders Petrie, later a mathematician for whom Petrie polygons were named. He was accepted at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1925, but decided to spend a year studying in hopes of gaining admittance to Trinity College, where the standard of mathematics was higher. Coxeter won an entrance scholarship and went to Trinity in 1926 to read mathematics. There he earned his BA (as Senior Wrangler) in 1928, and his doctorate in 1931. In 1932 he went to Princeton University for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow, where he worked with Hermann Weyl, Oswald Veblen, and Solomon Lefschetz. Returning to Trinity for a year, he attended Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s seminars on the philosophy of mathematics. In 1934 he spent a further year at Princeton as a Procter Fellow.

In 1936 Coxeter moved to the University of Toronto. In 1938 he and P. Du Val, H. T. Flather, and John Flinders Petrie published &quot;The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra&quot; with University of Toronto Press. In 1940 Coxeter edited the eleventh edition of &quot;Mathematical Recreations and Essays&quot;, originally published by W. W. Rouse Ball in 1892. He was elevated to professor in 1948. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1948 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1950. He met M. C. Escher in 1954 and the two became lifelong friends; his work on geometric figures helped inspire some of Escher&#x27;s works, particularly the &quot;Circle Limit&quot; series based on hyperbolic tessellations. He also inspired some of the innovations of Buckminster Fuller. Coxeter, M. S. Longuet-Higgins and J. C. P. Miller were the first to publish the full list of uniform polyhedra (1954).

He worked for 60 years at the University of Toronto and published twelve books.

==Personal life==

Coxeter was a vegetarian. He attributed his longevity to his vegetarian diet, daily exercise such as fifty press-ups and standing on his head for fifteen minutes each morning, and consuming a nightly cocktail made from Kahlúa (a coffee liqueur), peach schnapps, and soy milk.

==Awards==
Since 1978, the Canadian Mathematical Society have awarded the Coxeter–James Prize in his honor.

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1950 and in 1997 he was awarded their Sylvester Medal. In 1990, he became a Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1997 was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

In 1973 he received the Jeffery–Williams Prize.

A festschrift in his honour, &quot;The Geometric Vein&quot;, was published in 1982. It contained 41 essays on geometry, based on a symposium for Coxeter held at Toronto in 1979. A second such volume, &quot;The Coxeter Legacy&quot;, was published in 2006 based on a Toronto Coxeter symposium held in 2004.

<text>In American jurisprudence, an excuse is a defense to criminal charges that is a distinct from an exculpation. Justification and excuse are different defenses in a criminal case (See Justification and excuse). Exculpation is a related concept which reduces or extinguishes a person&#x27;s culpability, such as their liability to pay compensation to the victim of a tort in the civil law.

The excuse provides a mitigating factor for a group of persons sharing a common characteristic. Justification, as in justifiable homicide, vindicates or shows the justice. Thus, society approves of the purpose or motives underpinning some actions or the consequences flowing from them (see Robinson), and distinguishes those where the behavior cannot be approved but some excuse may be found in the characteristics of the defendant, e.g. that the accused was a serving police officer or suffering from a mental illness. Thus, a justification describes the quality of the act, whereas an excuse relates to the status or capacity (or lack of it) in the accused. These factors can affect the resulting judgment which may be an acquittal, or in the case of a conviction may mitigate sentencing. An excuse may also be something that a person or persons use to explain any criticism or comments based on the outcome of any specific event.

==Explanation==
The executive and legislative branches of modern states enact policy into laws which are then administered through the judicial system. Judges also have a residual discretion to excuse individuals from liability if it represents a just result. When considering the consequences which are to be imposed on those involved in the activities forming the subject matter of the common law or legislation, governments and judges have a choice:
:the criminal or civil defendant may be excused from liability as belonging to a class of person that ought to be excused, their behaviour may be considered justified, or an exculpation may be allowed on the merits of the particular case.
To be &quot;excused&quot; from liability means that although the defendant may have been a participant in the sequence of events leading to the prohibited outcome, no liability will attach to the particular defendant because they belong to a class of person exempted from liability. In some cases, this will be a policy of expediency. Hence, members of the armed forces, the police or other civil organizations may be granted a degree of immunity for causing prohibited outcomes while acting in the course of their official duties, e.g. for an assault or trespass to the person caused during a lawful arrest or for an ambulance driver exceeding the speed limit in an emergency. Others are excused by virtue of their status and capacity. Others may escape liability because the quality of their actions satisfied a general public good. For example, the willingness to defend oneself and others, or property from injury may benefit society at large. Albeit that the actions of a vigilante fall outside the formal controls that would seek to ensure reasonable use of force in state-appointed police officers, such people may accidentally find themselves interrupting the commission of a crime and their actions in defence of their own or another&#x27;s interests is justified out of expediency as opposed to having to wait until a police officer arrives before help can be rendered. Whilst the jurisprudential importance of the distinction between justification and excuse defenses is clear, legally they have the same effect, acquittal, and there is an ongoing debate about whether the distinction makes any practical difference.

An &quot;exculpation&quot; is a defense in which a defendant argues that despite the fact they committed and are guilty of the crime, tort, or other wrong and have a liability to compensate the victim, they should be exculpated because of special circumstances that operated in favor of the defendant at the time they broke the law.

===Defenses===
*Defense of infancy
:This is an aspect of the public policy of &quot;parens patriae&quot;. In the criminal law, each state will consider the nature of its own society and the available evidence of the age at which antisocial behavior begins to manifest itself. Some societies will have qualities of indulgence toward the young and inexperienced and will not wish them to be exposed to the criminal law system before all other avenues of response have been exhausted. Hence, some states have a policy of &quot;doli incapax&quot; and exclude liability for all acts and omissions that would otherwise have been criminal up to a specified age. Thereafter, there may be a rebuttable presumption against the use of criminal sanctions except in more serious cases. Other states leave discretion to prosecutors to argue or the judges to rule on whether the child understood that what was being done was wrong.
:The status of minor may also excuse liability in the civil law for contract, tort and other legal situations during which liabilities would otherwise attach to the infant. Where there is only minimal understanding, transactions entered into will be void, i.e. the infant is excused. When understanding grows in line with age, the law switches from excuse to exculpation, and transactions may be voidable, i.e. the courts will judge, whether in the particular circumstances, it would be right to favor the interests of the child or the interests of the other party or parties involved in the transaction. Hence, it would not be appropriate to allow a child knowingly to deceive innocent retailers or service providers into supplying value, and then allow him or her to avoid liability to pay a reasonable sum of money for those goods or services. This is a balancing of political and commercial interests.
*Insanity defense, mental disorder defences and the M&#x27;Naghten Rules
:If individuals are a danger to society and/or to themselves but not responsible through a lack of understanding, there is no point in punishment (whether in the criminal or non-criminal sense). Punishment is only justified morally if the person understands that what was done was wrong and accepts the judgment of society as part of the process of expiation and rehabilitation. Hence, as with &quot;parens patriae&quot;, the state accepts the person as being in need of care, and offers or requires medical treatment instead of subjecting such people to the stress of having to undergo a trial as to liability.
*Settled insanity is defined as a permanent or &quot;settled&quot; condition caused by long-term substance abuse and differs from the temporary state of intoxication. In some United States jurisdictions &quot;settled insanity&quot; can be used as a basis for an insanity defense, even though voluntary intoxication can not, if the &quot;settled insanity&quot; negates one of the required elements of the crime such as mens rea.
*Automatism
:This criminal defense straddles the divide between excuse and exculpation. It works by showing that the defendant&#x27;s mind was not in control of the body&#x27;s movements at the relevant time and that this loss of control was not foreseeable. For example, a diabetic suffering a hypoglycaemic attack will not be liable for any loss or damage caused. To that extent, it borrows from the policy excuse favoring those who are suffering from a mental illness, but allows the full trial as to liability to proceed. For a detailed comparative law discussion, see automatism (case law).
*Self-defense is, in general, some reasonable action taken in protection of self. An act taken in self-defense often is not a crime at all; no punishment will be imposed. To qualify, any defensive force must be proportionate to the threat. Use of a firearm in response to a non-lethal threat is a typical example of disproportionate force; however, such decisions are dependent on the situation and the applicable law, and thus the example situation can in some circumstances be defensible, generally because of a codified presumption intended to prevent the unjust negation of this defense by the trier of fact.

===Exculpations===
*Duress in criminal law and in contract law
:In this situation, the defendant has actually done everything to break the law and intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of liability already attaches to the defendant for what was done. In law, the usual rule is that the defendant&#x27;s motive for breaking the law is irrelevant although, in the criminal law, this may reduce the sentence. The basis of the defense argues that the threats made by the other person make the defendant&#x27;s entire behavior involuntary and therefore the liability should be reduced or removed. The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a simple matter of public policy. A state may say that no threat should force a person deliberately to break the law, particularly if this breach will cause loss or damage to a third person. Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law. For example, suppose that a group of terrorists kidnap A&#x27;s family and instruct A to carry a large bomb into a crowded area as the price for the release of their family. If A carries out these instructions, making no effort to contact the police or to warn those in the danger area, the issue of liability for death and injury resulting depends on the state&#x27;s values. This is a legal as well as a political decision. In the civil law, duress is similarly only an exculpation, rendering contracts and other transactions voidable, and offering only minor mitigation in the calculation of the amount of any damages payable.
*Mistake of fact and mistake of law in criminal law and in mistake in contract law
:The general policy usually allocated in cases of mistakes is &quot;ignorantia juris non excusat&quot;, i.e. the state cannot allow ignorance of the law to be a defense. This would unduly encourage the lazy and the deceitful to trade on their ignorance (real or otherwise). Thus, usually only mistakes relating to the factual basis of what is being attempted can form this defense and, in the majority of situations, it will only offer limited benefit to a defendant of ordinary capacity since the state owes no general duty to save citizens from the effects of their own ignorance or stupidity. Nevertheless, there may be limited circumstances in which people may honestly believe things that either prevent them from forming the requisite &quot;mens rea&quot; or from reaching an &quot;ad idem&quot; agreement.
*Provocation
:This is an example of a purely mitigatory defense in that, in the few situations when it is allowed to operate, it only reduces the level of criminal liability. In most legal systems, it cannot extinguish liability. It is a natural part of human nature that people get angry when they are provoked. But the state has a positive interest in maintaining good order and therefore, no matter what is done or said, people are not supposed to react violently or to cause loss or damage. Even though certain forms of physical contact or particular words might cause even reasonable people to become seriously annoyed, the state cannot sanction or justify retaliation. Thus, in most aspects of the law, any loss of control is taken to be an aggravating factor that, in the criminal law or the law of intentional torts, might well lead to an increase in sentencing, or the award of punitive or exemplary damages.

<text>In jurisprudence, duress or coercion refers to a situation whereby a person performs an act as a result of violence, threat, or other pressure against the person. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; (6th ed.) defines duress as &quot;any unlawful threat or coercion used... to induce another to act [or not act] in a manner [they] otherwise would not [or would]&quot;. Duress is pressure exerted upon a person to coerce that person to perform an act they ordinarily would not perform. The notion of duress must be distinguished both from undue influence in the civil law. In criminal law, duress and necessity are different defenses.

Duress has two aspects. One is that it negates the person&#x27;s consent to an act, such as sexual activity or the entering into a contract; or, secondly, as a possible legal defense or justification to an otherwise unlawful act. Defendants utilizing the duress defense admit to breaking the law but claim that they are not liable because, even though the act broke the law, it was only performed because of extreme, unlawful pressure. In criminal law, a duress defense is similar to a plea of guilty, admitting partial culpability, so that if the defense is not accepted then the criminal act is admitted.

Duress or coercion can also be raised in an allegation of rape or other sexual assault to negate a defense of consent on the part of the person making the allegation.

==Discussion==
A defendant who raises a defense of duress has actually done everything to constitute the &quot;actus reus&quot; of the crime, and has the &quot;mens rea&quot; because they intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of culpability already attaches to the defendant for what was done. 

In criminal law, the defendant&#x27;s motive for breaking the law is generally irrelevant unless a defendant is raising an affirmative defense allowed for by law. (Duress may or may not be allowed as an affirmative defense for some particular charge – in particular, it is generally forbidden for murder, and many jurisdictions also forbid it for sexual assault. &quot;Malum in se&quot; offenses, generally, are less likely to recognize duress as a defense than &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; offenses.)

A successful affirmative defense means not that a criminal act was justified, but that the act was not criminal at all. But if no affirmative defense of duress is available, then the duress may be considered as justifying a lighter sentence, typically in proportion to the degree of duress. If the duress is extreme enough, for example, the defendant might be found guilty of murder but given a minimal, or even trivial, sentence.

In some rare cases, a successful argument of duress – even when not an affirmative defense – might result in the jury nullifying the charge by refusing to convict.

The basis of the defense is that the duress actually overwhelmed the defendant&#x27;s will and would also have overwhelmed the will of a person of ordinary courage (a hybrid test requiring both subjective evidence of the accused&#x27;s state of mind, and an objective confirmation that the failure to resist the threats was reasonable), thus rendering the entire behavior involuntary. Thus, the liability should be reduced or discharged, making the defense one of exculpation.

The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a matter of public policy. A state may say that no threat should force a person to deliberately break the law, particularly if this breach will cause significant loss or damage to a third person. Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law.

A mutant of duress involves hostage taking, where a person is forced to commit a criminal act under the threat, say, that their family member or close associate will be immediately killed should they refuse (commonly known as a Tiger kidnapping). This has been raised in some cases of ransom, where a person commits theft or embezzlement under orders from a kidnapper in order to secure a family member&#x27;s life and freedom. However, duress is not a complete defense to all crimes. For example, the general rule, both at common law and today, is that duress is never a defense to murder; that is, one is never justified in killing another innocent person even if one&#x27;s own life has been threatened, although this part may be questioned when multiple people are threatened with death if the defendant does not kill a single or fewer people than threatened (such a situation is similar to the trolley problem). A counterpart may be found in an English law, where in R v Dudley and Stephens involved a case of one man being killed to save two lives - no duress defense was available and they were convicted.

==Requirements==
For duress to qualify as a defense, four requirements must be met:
* The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death
* The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime
* The threat must be immediate and inescapable
* The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of their own

A person may also raise a duress defense when force or violence is used to compel them to enter into a contract, or to discharge.

== In contract law ==

&quot;Duress&quot; in the context of contract law is a common law defense brought about when one of the parties to the contract enjoyed an ascendant position in relation to the other party and abused that position by subjecting the other to &quot;threats.&quot; A party who has entered into a contract under duress is entitled to rescind or set aside the contract, rendering it voidable (in equity).

Duress is a threat of harm made to compel someone to do something against their will or judgment; especially a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition. - Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)

Duress in contract law falls into two broad categories:
* Physical duress
* Economic duress

===Physical duress===
====Duress to the person====
Professor Ronald Griffin, Florida Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Law, Orlando, FL, puts physical duress simply: &quot;Your money or your life.&quot; 
In &quot;Barton v Armstrong&quot;, a decision of the Privy Council, Armstrong (defendant) sought to coerce Barton (plaintiff) into executing a deed relating to the sale of certain companies by threatening to have him murdered. While the plaintiff took the threats seriously, other business reasons existed for signing the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract. Furthermore, once it is established that the threat was made, the onus lies on the person who made the threat to prove that the threat made no contribution to the plaintiff&#x27;s decision to enter the agreement.

Common law took a narrow view of the concept of duress in that it was concerned with actual or threatened violence to the person or unlawful imprisonment. Equity, however, adopted a broader &quot;fusion&quot; view of what sort of pressure could constitute coercion for purposes of relief and has since prevailed. 

====Duress to goods====
In such cases, one party refuses to release the goods belonging to the other party until the other party enters into a contract with them. For example, in &quot;Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd v Helicopter Charter Pty Ltd&quot; (1991) 22 NSWLR 298, the contract was set aside after Hawker Pacific&#x27;s threats to withhold the helicopter from the plaintiff unless further payments were made for repairing a botched paint job.

===Elements of economic duress===
Economic duress is the use of unlawful economic pressure to compel a party to a contract to agree to demands which they would not have otherwise.
*&quot;Wrongful or improper threat&quot;. No precise definition of what is wrongful or improper. Examples include: morally wrong, criminal, or tortious conduct; one that is a threat to breach a contract &quot;in bad faith&quot; or threaten to withhold an admitted debt &quot;in bad faith&quot;.
*&quot;No reasonable alternative (but to accept the other party&#x27;s terms)&quot;. If there is an available legal remedy, an available market substitute (in the form of funds, goods, or services), or any other sources of funds this element is not met.
*&quot;The threat actually induces the making of the contract&quot;. This is a subjective standard, and takes into account the victim&#x27;s age, their background (especially their education), relationship of the parties, and the ability to receive advice.
*&quot;The other party caused the financial distress&quot;. The majority opinion is that the other party must have caused the distress, while the minority opinion allows them to merely take advantage of the distress.

==Insane duress==
In criminal law, when a person is found legally insane because they believed God ordered them to do the crime (&quot;deific-decree&quot;), one interpretation of the insanity is that they acted under a delusion of duress by God.

<doc id="216333" wikidata="Q2746387" url="?curid=216333" title="Newton polynomial">
<text>In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, a Newton polynomial, named after its inventor Isaac Newton, is an interpolation polynomial for a given set of data points. The Newton polynomial is sometimes called Newton&#x27;s divided differences interpolation polynomial because the coefficients of the polynomial are calculated using Newton&#x27;s divided differences method.

==Definition==
Given a set of &quot;k&quot; + 1 data points

:formula_1

where no two &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot; are the same, the Newton interpolation polynomial is a linear combination of Newton basis polynomials

:formula_2

with the Newton basis polynomials defined as

:formula_3

for &quot;j&quot; &gt; 0 and formula_4.

The coefficients are defined as

:formula_5

where

:formula_6

is the notation for divided differences.

Thus the Newton polynomial can be written as

:formula_7

===Newton forward divided difference formula=== 
The Newton polynomial can be expressed in a simplified form when formula_8 are arranged consecutively with equal spacing.

If formula_8 are consecutively arranged and equally spaced with formula_10 for &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, ..., &quot;k&quot; and some variable x is expressed as formula_11, then the difference formula_12 can be written as formula_13. So the Newton polynomial becomes
:formula_14

This is called the Newton forward divided difference formula.

===Newton backward divided difference formula===
If the nodes are reordered as formula_15, the Newton polynomial becomes

:formula_16

If formula_17 are equally spaced with formula_18 for &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, ..., &quot;k&quot; and formula_19, then,

:formula_20

This is called the Newton backward divided difference formula.

==Significance==

Newton&#x27;s formula is of interest because it is the straightforward and natural differences-version of Taylor&#x27;s polynomial. Taylor&#x27;s polynomial tells where a function will go, based on its &quot;y&quot; value, and its derivatives (its rate of change, and the rate of change of its rate of change, etc.) at one particular &quot;x&quot; value. Newton&#x27;s formula is Taylor&#x27;s polynomial based on finite differences instead of instantaneous rates of change.

=== Polynomial interpolation ===

For a polynomial formula_21 of degree less than or equal to n, that interpolates formula_22 at the nodes formula_23 where formula_24. Let formula_25 be the polynomial of degree less than or equal to n+1 that interpolates formula_22 at the nodes formula_23 where formula_28. Then formula_25 is given by:

formula_30

where formula_31 and formula_32.

Proof:

This can be shown for the case where formula_24:formula_34and when formula_35:

formula_36

By the uniqueness of interpolated polynomials of degree less than formula_37, formula_38 is the required polynomial interpolation. The function can thus be expressed as:

formula_39

where the factors formula_40 are divided differences. Thus, Newton polynomials are used to provide polynomial interpolation formula of n points.
Taking formula_41 for some unknown function in Newton divided difference formulas, if the representation of x in the previous sections was instead taken to be formula_42, in terms of forward differences, the Newton forward interpolation formula is expressed as:formula_43whereas for the same in terms of backward differences, the Newton backward interpolation formula is expressed as:formula_44This follows since relationship between divided differences and forward differences is given as:formula_45whereas for backward differences, it is given as:formula_46
==Addition of new points==
As with other difference formulas, the degree of a Newton interpolating polynomial can be increased by adding more terms and points without discarding existing ones. Newton&#x27;s form has the simplicity that the new points are always added at one end: Newton&#x27;s forward formula can add new points to the right, and Newton&#x27;s backward formula can add new points to the left.

The accuracy of polynomial interpolation depends on how close the interpolated point is to the middle of the &quot;x&quot; values of the set of points used. Obviously, as new points are added at one end, that middle becomes farther and farther from the first data point. Therefore, if it isn&#x27;t known how many points will be needed for the desired accuracy, the middle of the x-values might be far from where the interpolation is done.

Gauss, Stirling, and Bessel all developed formulae to remedy that problem.

Gauss&#x27;s formula alternately adds new points at the left and right ends, thereby keeping the set of points centered near the same place (near the evaluated point). When so doing, it uses terms from Newton&#x27;s formula, with data points and &quot;x&quot; values renamed in keeping with one&#x27;s choice of what data point is designated as the &quot;x&quot;0 data point.

Stirling&#x27;s formula remains centered about a particular data point, for use when the evaluated point is nearer to a data point than to a middle of two data points.

Bessel&#x27;s formula remains centered about a particular middle between two data points, for use when the evaluated point is nearer to a middle than to a data point.

Bessel and Stirling achieve that by sometimes using the average of two differences, and sometimes using the average of two products of binomials in &quot;x&quot;, where Newton&#x27;s or Gauss&#x27;s would use just one difference or product. Stirling&#x27;s uses an average difference in odd-degree terms (whose difference uses an even number of data points); Bessel&#x27;s uses an average difference in even-degree terms (whose difference uses an odd number of data points).

==Strengths and weaknesses of various formulae==
For any given finite set of data points, there is only one polynomial of least possible degree that passes through all of them. Thus, it is appropriate to speak of the &quot;Newton form&quot;, or Lagrange form, etc., of the interpolation polynomial. However, different methods of computing this polynomial can have differing computational efficiency. There are several similar methods, such as those of Gauss, Bessel and Stirling. They can be derived from Newton&#x27;s by renaming the &quot;x&quot;-values of the data points, but in practice they are important.

===Bessel vs. Stirling===
The choice between Bessel and Stirling depends on whether the interpolated point is closer to a data point, or closer to a middle between two data points.

A polynomial interpolation&#x27;s error approaches zero, as the interpolation point approaches a data-point. Therefore, Stirling&#x27;s formula brings its accuracy improvement where it is least needed and Bessel brings its accuracy improvement where it is most needed.

So, Bessel&#x27;s formula could be said to be the most consistently accurate difference formula, and, in general, the most consistently accurate of the familiar polynomial interpolation formulas.

===Divided-Difference Methods vs. Lagrange===
Lagrange is sometimes said to require less work, and is sometimes recommended for problems in which it is known, in advance, from previous experience, how many terms are needed for sufficient accuracy.

The divided difference methods have the advantage that more data points can be added, for improved accuracy. The terms based on the previous data points can continue to be used. With the ordinary Lagrange formula, to do the problem with more data points would require re-doing the whole problem.

There is a &quot;barycentric&quot; version of Lagrange that avoids the need to re-do the entire calculation when adding a new data point. But it requires that the values of each term be recorded.

But the ability, of Gauss, Bessel and Stirling, to keep the data points centered close to the interpolated point gives them an advantage over Lagrange, when it isn&#x27;t known, in advance, how many data points will be needed.

Additionally, suppose that one wants to find out if, for some particular type of problem, linear interpolation is sufficiently accurate. That can be determined by evaluating the quadratic term of a divided difference formula. If the quadratic term is negligible—meaning that the linear term is sufficiently accurate without adding the quadratic term—then linear interpolation is sufficiently accurate. If the problem is sufficiently important, or if the quadratic term is nearly big enough to matter, then one might want to determine whether the sum of the quadratic and cubic terms is large enough to matter in the problem.

Of course, only a divided-difference method can be used for such a determination.

For that purpose, the divided-difference formula and/or its &quot;x&quot;0 point should be chosen so that the formula will use, for its linear term, the two data points between which the linear interpolation of interest would be done.

The divided difference formulas are more versatile, useful in more kinds of problems.

The Lagrange formula is at its best when all the interpolation will be done at one &quot;x&quot; value, with only the data points&#x27; &quot;y&quot; values varying from one problem to another, and when it is known, from past experience, how many terms are needed for sufficient accuracy.

With the Newton form of the interpolating polynomial a compact and effective algorithm exists for combining the terms to find the coefficients of the polynomial.

===Accuracy===

When, with Stirling&#x27;s or Bessel&#x27;s, the last term used includes the average of two differences, then one more point is being used than Newton&#x27;s or other polynomial interpolations would use for the same polynomial degree. So, in that instance, Stirling&#x27;s or Bessel&#x27;s is not putting an &quot;N&quot;−1 degree polynomial through &quot;N&quot; points, but is, instead, trading equivalence with Newton&#x27;s for better centering and accuracy, giving those methods sometimes potentially greater accuracy, for a given polynomial degree, than other polynomial interpolations.

==General case==
For the special case of &quot;xi&quot; = &quot;i&quot;, there is a closely related set of polynomials, also called the Newton polynomials, that are simply the binomial coefficients for general argument. That is, one also has the Newton polynomials formula_47 given by

:formula_48

In this form, the Newton polynomials generate the Newton series. These are in turn a special case of the general difference polynomials which allow the representation of analytic functions through generalized difference equations.

==Main idea==
Solving an interpolation problem leads to a problem in linear algebra where we have to solve a system of linear equations. Using a standard monomial basis for our interpolation polynomial we get the very complicated Vandermonde matrix. By choosing another basis, the Newton basis, we get a system of linear equations with a much simpler lower triangular matrix which can be solved faster.

For &quot;k&quot; + 1 data points we construct the Newton basis as

:formula_49

Using these polynomials as a basis for formula_50 we have to solve

:formula_51

to solve the polynomial interpolation problem.

This system of equations can be solved iteratively by solving

:formula_52

==Derivation==

While the interpolation formula can be found by solving a linear system of equations, there is a loss of intuition in what the formula is showing and why Newton&#x27;s interpolation formula works is not readily apparent. To begin, we will need to establish two facts first:

Fact 1. Reversing the terms of a divided difference leaves it unchanged: formula_53 
The proof of this is an easy induction: for formula_54 we compute formula_55 
Induction step: Suppose the result holds for any divided difference involving at most formula_37 terms. 
Then using the induction hypothesis in the following 2nd equality we see that for a divided difference involving formula_57 terms we have 
formula_58 

We formulate next Fact 2 which for purposes of induction and clarity we also call Statement formula_59
(formula_60) :

Fact 2. (formula_60) : If formula_62 are any formula_59 points with distinct formula_64-coordinates and formula_65 is the unique polynomial of degree (at most) 
formula_66 whose graph passes through these formula_59 points then there holds the relation
formula_68 

Proof. (It will be helpful for fluent reading of the proof to have the precise statement and its subtlety in mind: formula_69 is defined by passing through formula_70 but the formula also speaks at both sides of an additional arbitrary point formula_71 with formula_64-coordinate distinct from the other formula_73.) 

We again prove these statements by induction.
To show formula_74 let formula_75 be any one point and let formula_76 be the unique polynomial of degree 0 passing through formula_77. Then evidently formula_78 and we can write formula_79 as wanted.

Proof of formula_80 assuming formula_81 already established: Let formula_76 be the polynomial of degree (at most) formula_59 passing through formula_84

With formula_85 being the unique polynomial of degree (at most) formula_66 passing through the points formula_87, we can write the following chain of equalities, where we use in the 
penultimate equality that Stmformula_88 applies to formula_89: 
formula_90

The induction hypothesis for formula_89 also applies to the second equality in the following computation, where 
formula_75 is added to the points defining formula_89 :

formula_94 

Now look at formula_95 By the definition of formula_89 
this polynomial passes through formula_97 and, as we have just shown, it also passes 
through formula_98 Thus it is the unique polynomial of degree formula_99 which passes through these points. Therefore this polynomial is formula_100 i.e.: formula_101

Thus we can write the last line in the first chain of equalities as `formula_102&#x27; and have thus established that
formula_103 So we 
established formula_104, and hence completed the proof of Fact 2. 

Now look at Fact 2: It can be formulated this way: If formula_69 is the unique polynomial of degree at most formula_66 whose graph passes through the points formula_107 then formula_108 is the unique polynomial of degree at most formula_59 passing 
through points formula_110 So we see Newton interpolation permits indeed to add new interpolation points without destroying what has already been computed.

==Taylor polynomial==

The limit of the Newton polynomial if all nodes coincide is a Taylor polynomial, because the divided differences become derivatives.
formula_111

==Application==
As can be seen from the definition of the divided differences new data points can be added to the data set to create a new interpolation polynomial without recalculating the old coefficients. And when a data point changes we usually do not have to recalculate all coefficients. Furthermore, if the &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; are distributed equidistantly the calculation of the divided differences becomes significantly easier. Therefore, the divided-difference formulas are usually preferred over the Lagrange form for practical purposes.

===Examples===
The divided differences can be written in the form of a table. For example, for a function &quot;f&quot; is to be interpolated on points formula_112. Write

:formula_113
Then the interpolating polynomial is formed as above using the topmost entries in each column as coefficients.

For example, suppose we are to construct the interpolating polynomial to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = tan(&quot;x&quot;) using divided differences, at the points
Using six digits of accuracy, we construct the table
: formula_114
Thus, the interpolating polynomial is
:formula_115
Given more digits of accuracy in the table, the first and third coefficients will be found to be zero.

Another example:

The sequence formula_116 such that formula_117 and formula_118, i.e., they are formula_119 from formula_120 to formula_121.

You obtain the slope of order formula_122 in the following way:
* formula_123
* formula_124
* formula_125

As we have the slopes of order formula_122, it is possible to obtain the next order:
* formula_127
* formula_128

Finally, we define the slope of order formula_129:
* formula_130

Once we have the slope, we can define the consequent polynomials:
* formula_131.
* formula_132
* formula_133.
* formula_134

<text>Bulbophyllum beccarii is by far the largest species in the genus &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; and one of the largest in the orchid family, perhaps second only to Grammatophyllum speciosum.

The thick rhizome, reportedly up to 20 cm in diameter (but the thickest reliably reported has been five cm.) snakes its way around tree trunks climbing up into the light. Exact length figures are not available, but its discoverer, Oduardo Beccari, reported that it climbed &quot;to a great height&quot; Along its length at intervals are the relatively small egg shaped pseudobulbs each with a huge thick, leathery leaf at their apex. They are up to 60 cm long and 20 cm wide, yellowish-green and point vertically. The huge bowl shaped leaves are designed to catch falling debris and turn it into fertilizers. The inflorescence is produced from the rhizome near one of the pseudobulbs and hangs downwards to about 20–22 cm and is composed of hundreds of small yellowish flowers netted with red that smell like rotting meat to attract various flies. It grows in the rainforests of Borneo.

<text>Bank robbery is the criminal act of stealing from a bank, specifically while bank employees and customers are subjected to force, violence, or a threat of violence. This refers to robbery of a bank branch or teller, as opposed to other bank-owned property, such as a train, armored car, or (historically) stagecoach. It is a federal crime in the United States.

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, robbery is &quot;the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence or by putting the victim in fear.&quot; By contrast, burglary is &quot;unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft.&quot;

==Overview==

===Places===
Bank robbery occurs in cities and towns. This concentration is often attributed to there being more branches in urban areas, but the number of bank robberies is higher than the number of branches. 

This has advantages both for bank robbers and for law enforcement. In urban areas the transportation infrastructure is more highly developed, especially where banks tend to cluster near retail shopping areas and commercial districts. Such banks are highly profitable targets for robbers, who are then afforded a number of potential escape routes. Law enforcement benefit by being able to respond more quickly, and the odds of catching a bank robber on or near the scene is higher than other types of crime. This is because most bank robberies are reported very quickly while the crime is in progress; most bank robberies occur during daylight hours, have multiple witnesses and with modern technology often produce photographic images that can be distributed and used immediately to canvass the local area. Consequently, many bank robbers are caught the same day. The clearance rate for bank robbery is among the highest of all crimes, at nearly 60%.

The urban location of the crime also contributes to its repeat victimization profile, a measure of how quickly a crime victim will suffer a repeat of the original crime. One study carried out by the Home Office found that in England, one third of banks at which a robbery has occurred will be robbed again within three months, while the same study found that in Tallahassee, Florida, one quarter of robbed banks will suffer repeat robbery within a week, and over half of robbed banks will be robbed again within a month.

===Characteristics===
The Australian Institute of Criminology analyzed trends in bank robbery over a four-year period. Of the 808 bank robbery incidents between January 1998 and May 2002 in which the number of offenders involved in the hold-up was recorded, 55% were committed by lone offenders, 25% by pairs, and 20% by three or more robbers. Unarmed offenders accounted for 28% of robberies, caused the fewest injuries to victims (one percent of all victims&#x27; injuries), were the type of robber who most often used a note to threaten bank staff (46% of all their robberies), and failed most often in their robbery attempts (33% failure). Unarmed gangs inflicted the most injuries to victims (51%) and failed the least in their robbery attempts (6% failure). Armed robbers used a disguise more often compared to unarmed robbers, with armed pairs employing disguises most often (59%).

According to the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics injuries occur in about two percent and a death occurs in less than one percent of all U.S. bank robberies. Violent takeover bank robberies that are often portrayed in the media are rare. The majority of bank robberies taking place today are so-called &quot;note jobs.&quot; These are usually accomplished by simply passing a written note to the teller demanding money. The idea is to attract as little attention as possible. In most cases, other customers present in the bank during a robbery are unaware of what is occurring. Standard bank policy is to avoid violence as much as possible, so they will normally hand over the money and try to obey the robber&#x27;s demands. The robber usually makes away with cash, but in small amounts. According to British Bankers&#x27; Association data, in 2007 there were 106 attempted or successful robberies in Britain in which an average of 1.6 persons were involved. One third of attempts came up empty while the average haul for a successful attempt was equivalent to US$46,600. Yet 20% of the successes would later prove less than successful by virtue of the robbers being arrested.

==U.S. Federal Statute==
Under federal law, bank robbery in the United States is defined, and made illegal, primarily by the bank robbery statute in 18 U.S.C. § 2113 states.

==History==
=== Early examples ===
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the first bank robbery in the United States occurred in March 1831 (the 19th according to the &quot;Times&quot;, the 20th according to the &quot;Post&quot;). Two men, James Honeyman and William J. Murray, entered the City Bank of New York using forged keys. This allowed them to empty the vault of more than $245,000 in bank money. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, it cannot be confirmed if this was a robbery or a burglary. The &quot;Post&quot; later corrected this claim upon learning of a previous 1798 robbery of $162,821 from the Bank of Pennsylvania at Carpenters&#x27; Hall. The Carpenters&#x27; Hall theft also may not have technically been a robbery as there were no signs of force and the thief may have had a key.

On September 14, 1828, five men tunneled through a sewage drain in George Street, Sydney and stole approximately £14,000 in promissory notes and coins from the vault of the Bank of Australia. It has been described as the first bank robbery in Australia and also the largest in Australian history.

On December 15, 1863, Postmaster Edward Green walked into the First National Bank on Pleasant Street in Malden, Massachusetts, shot the 17-year-old bookkeeper, Frank Converse, and stole $3,000 in large bills and $2,000 in small bills. The directors of the bank offered a $6,000 reward for the arrest of the murderer. This has been described as the first armed bank robbery murder in US history. The crime is detailed in the historical fiction novel, Abel Bodied: Murder at the Malden Bank written by Michael Cloherty.

On October 27, 1878, the Manhattan Savings Institution was robbed. It was the largest bank robbery in U.S. history.

The heist known as the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery in June 1907 in the Russian Empire resulted in 40 deaths, 50 injuries, and the &quot;expropriation&quot; of 241,000 rubles (approximately 3.96 million 2018 US dollars) by Bolsheviks organized by (among others) Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.

The first bank robbery in Denmark occurred August 18, 1913 in the bank &quot;Sparekassen for København og Omegn&quot; at Østerbro in Copenhagen. Two men, Danish salesman Lindorff Larsen and a German machinist Güttig, armed with revolvers, got away with 9000 Danish kroner. Güttig was arrested August 30 and Lindorff Larsen committed suicide after having fled the police.

===Bank robbery on the American frontier===

Bank robbery is commonly associated with the American Old West due to a few infamous examples and portrayal in fiction. The Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) in their research, found the scene of the Western bank-robbery to be generally a myth, identifying less than 10 definite bank robberies between 1859 and 1900 across 15 frontier states. Grunge.com pointed out that FEE&#x27;s research was conducted before many states and the Library of Congress began publishing historical newspapers online, and while bank robberies in the Old West were still uncommon, there were many more than previously assessed.

On February 13, 1866, several men believed to be members of the James-Younger Gang robbed the Clay County Savings Association in Liberty, Missouri, shooting to death an innocent street bystander, 17-year-old student George Clifford &quot;Jolly&quot; Wymore, and escaping with $60,000. This was the first successful daylight bank robbery during peacetime in the US. Previous robberies such as from the banks in St. Albans, Vermont more than a year earlier were perpetrated by Confederate soldiers, which some historians consider to be not robberies proper but acts of war.

===First known use of a getaway car ===
The August 29, 1909 edition of &quot;The Rich Hill Tribune&quot; contained a front-page news story entitled &quot;Bank Robbers in Motor Car&quot; and according to which two robbers used a gun to rob the Valley bank of Santa Clara of $7,000. They then used a hired automobile to escape and were chased by police and a posse of citizens also in automobiles, eventually leading to their capture.

On December 21, 1911, two armed men of the Bonnot Gang intercepted a bank messenger outside a branch of Société Générale in Paris. They stole a satchel of money he was about to deliver to the bank containing roughly five thousand pounds and escaped in a stolen vehicle. This was the first successful use of a getaway car in a bank robbery.

===First known use of a helicopter ===

On February 16, 1984, more than $160,000 was stolen from the Merchants and Farmers Bank and Trust Co. in Leesville, Louisiana using a stolen getaway helicopter. 

===Great Depression era and &quot;Public Enemy&quot;===
The 1920s and 1930s saw a significant increase in bank robberies in the United States. This led to the formation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the designation &quot;Public Enemy&quot; for significant wanted criminals. This era saw the rise of famous gangs such as the Dillinger Gang, the Barrow Gang (1932–1934), and the Barker–Karpis gang. Other famous public enemies included Pretty Boy Floyd (Public Enemy No, 1 in 1934) and Machine Gun Kelly.

===First known use of camera footage to apprehend a bank robber===
In 1957, security cameras installed at St. Clair Savings and Loan in Cleveland recorded the first film footage used to apprehend and identify bank robbers. The robbery occurred on April 12, when a 24-year-old male pointed a gun at a teller while his accomplice, an 18-year-old female, stuffed over $2,000 into a bag. A third accomplice drove the getaway car. The three were captured shortly after video footage of the robbery aired on national news.

===Stockholm syndrome===
In 1973, four hostages were taken during the Norrmalmstorg robbery in Stockholm, Sweden. After their release, the hostages defended their captors and refused to testify against them. This led to an academic interest in a phenomenon soon after referred to as Stockholm syndrome, wherein hostages, during captivity, paradoxically form a sympathetic bond with their captors as a survival strategy. Stockholm syndrome is a &quot;contested illness&quot; due to doubt about the legitimacy of the condition.

===Historical bank robbers===
George Leonidas Leslie (1842 – June 4, 1878) was involved in 80% of the bank robberies in the U.S. from 1869 to his death in 1878. He was involved in the Manhattan Savings Institution robbery.

Jesse James (September 5, 1847 – April 3, 1882) was one of the most notorious bank robbers in American history.

Ned Kelly (December 1854 – 11 November 1880), Australian bushranger and folk hero, pulled off a series of bank robberies in Victoria and New South Wales.

Herman Lamm (April 19, 1890 – December 16, 1930), The first &quot;modern&quot; bank robber, who developed techniques of surveillance and planning, such as casing and getaway maps, used by many latter stick-up men such as John Dillinger.

Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, better known as &quot;Bonny and Clyde&quot; (active February 1932 – May 1934), were an American couple who went on a crime spree during the Great Depression with their associates, the Barrow Gang. They captured the public imagination with their image as a wild young couple. Along with their gang, they were credited with only ten bank robberies, often making away with as little as $80. They were eventually ambushed and killed on the roadside outside Bienville Parish, Louisiana by a posse of Texas and Louisiana lawmen.

John Dillinger (June 22, 1903 – July 22, 1934) robbed banks in the Midwestern United States. Some considered him a dangerous criminal, while others idolized him as a present-day Robin Hood. He gained this latter reputation (and the nickname &quot;Jackrabbit&quot;) for his graceful movements during bank heists, such as leaping over the counter (a movement he supposedly copied from the movies) and many narrow getaways from police. On July 22, 1934, FBI agents cornered Dillinger in an alley outside a movie theater in Chicago, Illinois, where he was shot and killed by multiple agents.

George &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson (December 6, 1908 – November 27, 1934) was a bank robber and former associate of John Dillinger. He is notable for having killed more FBI agents in the line of duty than any other person. He was killed in a shootout known as The Battle of Barrington, outside Chicago.

Edwin Alonzo Boyd (April 2, 1914 – May 17, 2002) was a Canadian bank robber and leader of the Boyd Gang, which pulled off a string of heists, including the largest in Toronto history.

Clarence Anglin, and brother John Anglin, the infamous Alcatraz escapees, robbed a bank in Alabama.

In the early 20th century, Willie Sutton (June 30, 1901 – November 2, 1980) was asked why he robbed banks, and he was famously reported as answering: &quot;Because that&#x27;s where the money is.&quot; This is, in fact, a quote invented by the interviewer to make the story more interesting. However, when asked, Sutton did write this statement and autograph it for his physician, so in a sense it is accurate.

==Prevention==

In the 1920s, American banks added the security of alarm systems and concrete-reinforced, blast-proof vaults.

Modern banks have implemented modern security measures, like motion-sensing and high resolution color security cameras, time-locked heavy vault doors, silent alarms, exploding dye packs, bait money, and GPS tracking devices. Some banks supplement this protection with armed or unarmed security guards.

Today&#x27;s biometric technology makes non-violent methods of gaining access, even by the most experienced safe hackers and code crackers, nearly impossible. Modern vaults and safes are also reinforced to the point that the amount of explosives needed to blow them open would likely create unwanted attention and run the risk of harming the building to the point of collapse. By their very nature, even the most impregnable vault or safe eventually needs to be able to be opened and closed by someone. To circumvent vault and safe security features, robbers often kidnap the bank manager, but that is not always a successful idea as banks have often removed the manager&#x27;s ability to open the vault.

The police have new measures at their disposal to catch bank robbers, such as well-armed SWAT teams. Forensic identification techniques have also improved greatly; should a bank robber fire a gun, the police can trace the bullet to the exact firearm using ballistic fingerprinting. Martin Kemp, in a BBC documentary, once inquired on the effectiveness of an Uzi in a bank robbery, to which the firearms training instructor joked &quot;that would be sixty-four pieces of evidence to convict you.&quot; The sawed-off shotgun, a common robbery weapon in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand where handguns are difficult to obtain, is easily concealable but not particularly effective.

While it is not certain that the first time someone robs a bank they will be caught, if they continue to rob banks, they will most likely be caught. Few criminals are able to make a successful living out of bank robbery over the long run. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as extortion, drug trafficking, gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.

A further factor making bank robbery unattractive for criminals in the United States is the severity with which it is prosecuted. United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for bank robbery gives long prison terms, which are usually further enhanced by the use or carrying of loaded firearms, prior criminal convictions, and the absence of parole from the federal prison system. As with any type of robbery, the fact that bank robbery is also inherently a violent crime typically causes corrections administrators to place imprisoned bank robbers in harsher high-security institutions.

==In film==
Bank robberies are often a main plot in many heist films. Some of these films are based on the lives of historic bank robbers, such as &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), &quot;The Newton Boys&quot; (1998) and &quot;Public Enemies&quot; (2009) (based on the life of John Dillinger).

&quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975), &quot;Set It Off&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Bank Job&quot; (2008) are based on actual bank robberies. Other notable but fictional examples include &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), &quot;Heat&quot; (1995), &quot;Henry&#x27;s Crime&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Town&quot; (2010). In &quot;The Town&quot;, bank robbery is described as an element of life for residents of Charlestown, a neighborhood in Boston. However, this is exaggerated and is disputed by residents of Charlestown, who describe it as outdated, as of when the film &quot;The Town&quot; was made. Up to the early 2000s, Charlestown was notorious for criminals whose specialty was robbery but also other lucrative crimes.

<text>Alcorn State University (Alcorn State, ASU or Alcorn) is a public historically black land-grant university adjacent to Lorman, Mississippi. It was founded in 1871 and was the first black land grant college established in the United States. The university is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

Alcorn State&#x27;s athletic teams known as the Braves and compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. All teams compete as members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC).

==History==
Alcorn State University was the first black land grant college in the country. Mississippi&#x27;s Reconstructionist legislature, dominated by Republicans sympathetic to the cause of educating the formerly enslaved, was established on the site of Oakland College, a college that had gone defunct due to the Civil War. Alcorn University started with what is recognized as three historic buildings.

United States Senator Hiram R. Revels resigned his seat when he accepted the position as Alcorn&#x27;s first president. The state legislature provided $50,000 in cash for ten successive years for the establishment and overall operations of the college. The state also granted Alcorn three-fifths of the proceeds earned from the sale of of land scrip for agricultural or land grant colleges under federal legislation. The land was sold for $188,928 with Alcorn receiving a share of $113,400. This money was to be used solely to support the agricultural and mechanical components of the college, which Congress wanted to develop nationally. From its beginning, Alcorn State University was a land-grant college. After a group of white Democrats known as Redeemers took over the legislature, Alcorn&#x27;s appropriation was slashed by almost 90 percent, to $5,500 per year, and an all-white board of trustees was appointed.

In 1878, the name Alcorn University was changed to Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College. The university&#x27;s original of land have been expanded to develop a campus. The goals for the college set by the Mississippi legislature following the Reconstruction era emphasized training for blacks rather than academic education. The school, like other black schools during these years, was less a college than a vocational school intended to prepare students for the agricultural economy of the state and of most of their hometowns.

At first the school was exclusively for black males, but women were admitted in 1895. The 2022 freshman class included 339 females and 159 males. Alcorn began with eight faculty members in 1871. Today the faculty and staff number more than 500. The student body has grown from 179 mostly local male students to more than 2,933 students from all over the world.

In 1974, Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College was renamed Alcorn State University, representing the development of its programs. Governor William L. Waller signed House Bill 298 granting university status to Alcorn and the other state-supported colleges. Alcorn had already become a more diversified university, with graduate programs. It provides an undergraduate education that enables students to continue their work in graduate and professional schools, engage in teaching, and enter other professions. It also provides graduate education to equip students for further training in specialized fields.

In 1994 Jay Searcy of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said that except for its football team, Evers, and &quot;an occasional Olympic athlete,&quot; &quot;Alcorn rarely gets mentioned outside the state of Mississippi&quot; although attention on the university increased after Steve McNair made athletic successes.

In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $25 million to Alcorn State. Her donation is the largest single gift in Alcorn State&#x27;s history.

Alcorn State is accredited, with seven schools and degree programs in more than 50 areas, including a nursing and a Master of Business Administration program. The facilities number approximately 80 modern structures with an approximate value of $71 million.

<text>Senecio vulgaris, often known by the common names groundsel and old-man-in-the-spring, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is an annual herb, native to the Palaearctic and widely naturalised as a ruderal species in suitable disturbed habitats worldwide.

== Description ==

&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; is an erect herbaceous annual growing up to tall. The inflorescences usually lack ray florets, the yellow disc florets mostly hidden by the bracts giving the flowers an inconspicuous appearance. &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; is very similar to &quot;Senecio viscosus&quot; but &quot;S. vulgaris&quot; does not have the glandular hairs and ray florets found in &quot;S. viscosus&quot;.

===Leaves and stems===
Upper leaves of &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; are sessile, lacking their own stem (petiole), alternating in direction along the length of the plant, two rounded lobes at the base of the stem (auriculate) and sub-clasping above. Leaves are pinnately lobed and + long and wide, smaller towards the top of the plant. Leaves are sparsely covered with soft, smooth, fine hairs. Lobes typically sharp to rounded saw-toothed.

The hollow stems branch at the tops and from the base. Stems and leaves can both host the Cineraria leaf rust.

===Flowers===
Open clusters of 10 to 22 small cylinder shaped rayless yellow flower heads to inch (6 to 13 mm) with a highly conspicuous ring of black tipped bracts at the base of the inflorescence as is characteristic of many members of the genus &quot;Senecio&quot;. There is a radiate form of &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot;, which is the result of cross pollination with the closely related Oxford ragwort, &quot;Senecio squalidus&quot;.

===Seeds===
The name for the genus &quot;Senecio&quot; is probably derived from &quot;senex&quot; (an old man), in reference to its downy head of seeds; &quot;the flower of this herb hath white hair and when the wind bloweth it away, then it appeareth like a bald-headed man&quot; and like its family, flowers of &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; are succeeded by downy globed heads of seed. The seeds are achene, include a pappus
and become sticky when wet.
Laboratory tests have suggested maximum seed scattering distances of at wind speeds of respectively (affected by plant height), suggesting that it was more than wind that spread these groundsel seeds throughout the world.

The average weight of 1000 seeds is 0.21 gram (2,200,000 seeds per pound) and experienced a 100% germination success before drying and storage and an 87% germination success after drying and 3 years of cool dry storage.
In simple models for seed emergence prediction, soil thermal time did not predict the timing and extent of seedling emergence as well as hydrothermal time (warm rain).

===Roots===
The root system consists of a shallow taproot. This plant spreads by reseeding itself.

Groundsel acts as a host for the fungus that causes black root rot in peas, alfalfa, soybeans, carrots, tomatoes, red clover, peanuts, cucurbits, cotton, citrus, chickpeas, and several ornamental flowering plants; a list of flowering plants that can host their own fungus as well.

== Etymology and naming ==
Binomial etymology
*In Latin &quot;Senecio&quot; means &#x27;old man&#x27;. This name, used by Pliny, is in reference the plant becoming grey and hairy when fruiting.
*&quot;Vulgaris&quot; means &#x27;usual&#x27;, &#x27;common&#x27;, or &#x27;vulgar&#x27;.

Common names
*Vernacular names for &quot;S. vulgaris&quot; in English include old-man-in-the-spring, common groundsel, groundsel, ragwort, grimsel, grinsel, grundsel, simson, birdseed, chickenweed, old-man-of-the-spring, squaw weed, grundy swallow, ground glutton and common butterweed.

==Distribution==
&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; is considered to be native to Europe, northern Asia, and parts of North Africa. Its further distribution is less clear. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service Plants Profile Database considers it to be native to all 50 of the United States of America, Canada, Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the same USDA through the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) considers it to be native only to parts of Afro-Eurasia. The Integrated Taxonomic Information System Organization (ITIS), a partnership among many United States federal government departments and agencies states that the species has been introduced to the 50 United States, and the online journal Flora of North America calls it &quot;probably introduced&quot; to areas north of Mexico. Individual research groups claim it is not native to areas they oversee: Florida, Washington, Wisconsin, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Missouri. The United States Geological Survey reports that common groundsel is exotic to all 50 states and all Canadian provinces with the exception of Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Labrador.

==Ecology==
&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; is a frost-resistant deciduous annual plant that grows in disturbed sites, waste places, roadsides, gardens, nurseries, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, agricultural lands, at altitudes up to and is, additionally, self-pollinating producing 1,700 seeds per plant with three generations per year. Seeds are dispersed by wind and also cling to clothing and animal fur, and as contaminates of commercially exchanged seeds; the distribution of this plant throughout the world has been difficult if not impossible to contain.

===Herbivores===
The seed of common groundsel is a good green food for canaries and finches and it is available all year round.

&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; seed has been found in the droppings of sparrows, and seedlings have been raised from the excreta of various birds. Seed has also been found in cow manure.

Some &quot;Lepidoptera&quot; species eat many of the &quot;Senecio&quot;; additional studies via electrophysiological recordings have shown that the taste sensilla of the cinnabar moth larvae respond (get excited) specifically to the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which all &quot;Senecio&quot; contain.

Moths and caterpillars
* Cinnabar moth (&quot;Tyria jacobaeae&quot;)
* Flame shoulder (&quot;Ochropleura plecta&quot;)
* Ragwort plume moth (&quot;Platyptilia isodactyla&quot;)

The &quot;Senecio&quot; also are host to other insects:

Beetles
*Ragwort flea beetle (&quot;Longitarsus jacobaeae&quot;)
*&quot;Longitarsus gracilis&quot; (family Coleoptera species &quot;Chrysomelidae&quot;)
Flies
:Seed flies (Diptera: Muscoidea)
:*Ragwort seed fly (Anthomyiidae, &quot;Botanophila seneciella&quot;)
:Gall flies (Diptera: Tephritidae):
:*&quot;Ensina sonchi&quot;
:*&quot;Sphenella marginata&quot;
:*&quot;Trupanea stellata&quot;
:*&quot;Trypeta zoe&quot;
and other insects that are not listed here.

The ragwort flea beetle and ragwort seed fly have been approved and released for &quot;Senecio&quot; control in California, Australia and elsewhere.

Fungi
Most &quot;Senecio&quot;, including &quot;S. squalidus&quot; are susceptible to rust and other fungus and mildews:
:Rust fungus Uredinales
:*&quot;Coleosporium tussilaginis&quot; - stems and leaves (Coleosporiaceae)
:*&quot;Puccinia lagenophorae&quot; - leaves only (Pucciniaceae)
:*&quot;Bremia lactucae&quot;
:White rust Peronosporales
:*&quot;Albugo tragopogonis&quot; - (Albuginaceae)
:* some of the species &quot;Peronosporaceae&quot; - (Albuginaceae)
:Sac fungus Ascochyta, Pezizomycetes
:*&quot;Ascochyta senecionicola&quot; - (Coelomycete)
:Groundsel mildew Erysiphales
:*&quot;Golovinomyces cichoracearum&quot; var. &quot;fischeri&quot;
:Powdery mildew Erysiphales
:*&quot;Podosphaera fusca&quot; - (Erysiphaceae)
:Black root rot Microascales
:* some of the family Incertae sedis
and other fungus that are not listed here.

== Toxicity ==
In the United States, &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; has been listed as a noxious weed, being both non-indigenous to most if not all of the Americas and having a reputation for being hepatotoxic to livestock and to humans.

=== Toxic versus medicinal ===
;Human
As a plant that is reported to be both poisonous for human ingestion and also medicinal; much of the contradiction can be found by closely reviewing the words that are used and the dose (amount) of the poisonous substance that is ingested to prove either claim. All species of the genus &quot;Senecio&quot; contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (e.g., senecionine), a substance that when a human has &quot;chronic exposure&quot; can cause irreversible liver damage.

Common groundsel as a medicinal herb does not seem to have been recommended very often since 1931, when it was recommended as a diaphoretic, an antiscorbutic, a purgative, a diuretic and an anthelmintic, which was a demotion as it was previously suggested for the expelling of gravel of the kidneys and reins by Pedanius Dioscorides in the 1st century, for use as poultices by John Gerard in the late 16th century and as a cure for epilepsy by Nicholas Culpeper in the 17th century. More current information is contradictory about the dangers of the ingestion of groundsel. A heavily referenced paper from 1989 suggests that the response is immediate and gives pre-ambulatory care recommendations. A Canadian poisonous plants information database references a paper from 1990 in presenting this prenatal warning: &quot;In a case of prenatal exposure, a mother ingested tea containing an estimated 0.343 milligram of senecionine, resulting in fatal veno-occlusive disease in a newborn infant.&quot; Information about the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, the substance present in &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; is much less contradictory and all warn of accumulation of the alkaloid.

Certain pyrrolizidine alkaloids are non-toxic precursors that are converted to toxic metabolites in the body in a process called toxification

Botanist and noted authority on plant-lore Albert Roy Vickery quotes a 1991 account of the use of groundsel as a highly effective purge in the English county of Dorset: Mr Joby House, who used to be at Hewood, told us that, for constipation, you boiled groundsel and lard and take that and you will shit through the eye of a needle. His sister Lucy had constipation so bad that when the doctor called in the morning he said Lucy would be dead by 5 o’clock. Mrs. House went to the gypsies (Mrs. Penfold)…and she told her how to cure her. The doctor came late in the day, and Lucy was running around; there was shit everywhere. The doctor had brought Lucy’s death certificate, but he was so mad he tore it up and put it in the fire.

;Livestock
Carl Linnaeus is cited to have claimed that &quot;goats and swine eat this common plant freely, cows being not partial to it and horses and sheep declining to touch it, but not only are caged birds fond of it (the seeds), but its leaves and seeds afford food for many of our wild species (rabbits were given as an example).&quot; More recent studies claim that the lethal amount that cattle or horses need to consume is 7% of their body weight (example: would need to be consumed by a cow weighing ). Lesser amounts cause the liver to lose function but is not apparent until the animal is stressed (by new feed or location, pregnancy, a different toxin, etc.). Sheep and goats have rumen bacteria that detoxify the alkaloids and are able to consume twice their body weight of this and other species of genus &quot;Senecio&quot;. The alkaloids responsible are not destroyed by drying or by fermentation in silage.

=== Introduced versus invasive ===
Introduced species become invasive when they compete with natives or with crops. &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; is not known to be a strong competitor but it has been known to reduce mint production.
There is evidence that it is not a strong invasive and sometimes protective of critically endangered native plants.

The approximately long pappus seeds of &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot;, each plant capable of producing 25,000 or more seeds (1,700 seeds per plant are more likely) with three generations of the plant per year; seeds that are widely dispersed by the wind, have been identified as a contaminant of cereal and vegetable seeds and a poison to some livestock; there is some inspiration to understand the growth stages and determine some control methods.

;Cultivation
Cultivation with the hand or tiller is a recommended method of controlling &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; from growing in gardens and planting fields; cultivate to a depth of . The plant does prefer to take root in disturbed soils, so cultivation rids new plants but also buries and stirs up new seeds so the cultivation needs to be repeated at 14-day intervals. Seeds can still mature even when the plant has been killed; seed from plants cut in flower had germination levels of 35%. Groundsel seed numbers increased in soil during a two-year set-aside left fallow but not when there was a sown grass cover. The weed cannot live on grazed, trampled or mowed sites.

;Biological
The pathogen rust fungus or &quot;Puccinia lagenophorae&quot; and the cinnabar moth (&quot;Tyria jacobaeae&quot;) have both been used and studied in an attempt to control infestation of &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot;. One study showed that rust fungus infected &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; survived and actually used more of the available soil nutrients. The cinnabar moth eats groundsel between June and August, but the seeds germinate and the plant grows as soon as the ground is warm enough (and after a warm rain), making this an insufficient control almost everywhere groundsel can be found.

;Chemical
Herbicides designed to control broadleaf plants are effective for controlling &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; in cereals and forage grasses but also will &quot;control&quot; broadleaf crops, such as mint, forage legumes, strawberries, carrots and all other non-grass crops. There is also evidence that the plant develops an immunity to the chemical control.

;Other
Groundsel seedlings with 2–6 leaves are tolerant of flame weeding but the seeds are susceptible to soil solarization.

<text>The age of criminal responsibility is the age below which a child is deemed incapable of having committed a criminal offence. In legal terms, it is referred to as a defence/defense of infancy, which is a form of defense known as an excuse so that defendants falling within the definition of an &quot;infant&quot; are excluded from criminal liability for their actions, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an age of criminal responsibility. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed.

Under the English common law the defense of infancy was expressed as a set of presumptions in a doctrine known as doli incapax. A child under the age of seven was presumed incapable of committing a crime. The presumption was conclusive, prohibiting the prosecution from offering evidence that the child had the capacity to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of what they had done. Children aged 7–13 were presumed incapable of committing a crime but the presumption was rebuttable. The prosecution could overcome the presumption by proving that the child understood what they were doing and that it was wrong. In fact, capacity was a necessary element of the state&#x27;s case (thus, the rule of sevens doctrine arose). If the state failed to offer sufficient evidence of capacity, the infant was entitled to have the charges dismissed at the close of the state&#x27;s evidence. &quot;Doli incapax&quot; was abolished in England and Wales in 1998 for children over the age of 10, but persists in other common law jurisdictions.

==Terminology==
The terminology regarding such a defense varies by jurisdiction and sphere. &quot;Defense of infancy&quot; is a mainly US term. The &quot;age of criminal responsibility&quot; is used by most European countries, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and other Commonwealth of Nations countries. Other instances of usage have included the terms age of accountability, age of responsibility, and age of liability,

The term minimum age of criminal responsibility (MACR) is a term commonly used in the literature.
The rationale behind the age of accountability laws are the same as those behind the insanity defense, insinuating both the mentally disabled and the young lack apprehension.

==The age of criminal responsibility==
Governments enact laws to label certain types of activity as wrongful or illegal. Behavior of a more antisocial nature can be stigmatized in a more positive way to show society&#x27;s disapproval through the use of the word &quot;criminal&quot;. In this context, laws tend to use the phrase, &quot;age of criminal responsibility&quot; in two different ways: 
#As a definition of the process for dealing with an alleged offender, the range of ages specifies the exemption of a child from the adult system of prosecution and punishment. Most jurisdictions develop special juvenile justice systems in parallel to the adult criminal justice system. Here, the hearings are essentially welfare-based and deal with children as in need of compulsory measures of treatment and/or care. Children are diverted into this system when they have committed what would have been an offense as an adult.
#As the physical capacity of a child to commit a crime. Hence, children are deemed incapable of committing some sexual or other acts requiring abilities of a more mature quality.

==Discussion==

This is an aspect of the public policy of &quot;parens patriae&quot;. In the criminal law, each state will consider the nature of its own society and the available evidence of the age at which antisocial behaviors begins to manifest itself. Some societies will have qualities of indulgence toward the young and inexperienced, and will not wish them to be exposed to the criminal law system before all other avenues of response have been exhausted. Hence, some states have a policy of &quot;doli incapax&quot; (i.e. incapable of wrong) and exclude liability for all acts and omissions that would otherwise have been criminal after reaching a specified age. Hence, no matter what the child may have done, there cannot be a criminal prosecution. However, although no criminal liability is inferred, other aspects of law may be applied. For example, in Nordic countries, an offense by a person under 15 years of age is considered mostly a symptom of problems in child&#x27;s development. This will cause the social authorities to take appropriate administrative measures to secure the development of the child. Such measures may range from counseling to placement at a special care unit. Being non-judicial, the measures are not dependent on the severity of the offense committed but on the overall circumstances of the child.

The policy of treating minors as incapable of committing crimes does not necessarily reflect modern sensibilities. Thus, if the rationale of the excuse is that children below a certain age lack the capacity to form the &quot;mens rea&quot; of an offense, this may no longer be a sustainable argument. Indeed, given the different speeds at which people may develop both physically and intellectually, any form of explicit age limit may be arbitrary and irrational. Yet, the sense that children do not deserve to be exposed to criminal punishment in the same way as adults remains strong. Children have not had experience of life, nor do they have the same mental and intellectual capacities as adults. Hence, it might be considered unfair to treat young children in the same way as adults. 

In Scotland, the age of criminal responsibility was raised from 8 to 12 by the implementation of the Age of Criminal Responsibility (Scotland) Act 2019, which came into force on 31 March 2020. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the age of responsibility is 10 years, and in the Netherlands and Canada the age of responsibility is 12 years. Sweden, Finland, and Norway all set the age at 15 years. In the United States, the minimum age for federal crimes is 11 years. State minimums vary, with 24 states having no defined minimum age, and defined minimums ranging from 7 years in Florida to 13 years in Maryland and New Hampshire.

As the treaty parties of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court could not agree on a minimum age for criminal responsibility, they chose to solve the question procedurally and excluded the jurisdiction of the Court for persons under eighteen years.

Some jurisdictions do not have a set fixed minimum age, but leave discretion to prosecutors to argue or the judges to rule on whether the child or adolescent (&quot;juvenile&quot;) defendant understood that what was being done was wrong. If the defendant did not understand the difference between &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, it may not be considered appropriate to treat such a person as culpable. Alternatively, the lack of real fault in the offender can be recognized by rulings that avoid criminal sentences and/or address more practical matters of parental responsibility by adjusting the rights of parents to unsupervised custody, or by separate criminal proceedings against the parents for breach of their duties as parents.

==By country==
The following are the minimum ages at which people may be charged with a criminal offence in each country:

==Juvenile courts==
In some countries, a juvenile court is a court of special jurisdiction charged with adjudicating cases involving crimes committed by those who have not yet reached a specific age. If convicted in a juvenile court, the offender is found &quot;responsible&quot; for their actions as opposed to &quot;guilty&quot; of a criminal offense. Sometimes, in some jurisdictions (such as the United States of America), a minor may be tried as an adult.

<doc id="216346" wikidata="Q106187" url="?curid=216346" title="Giant's Causeway">
<text>The Giant&#x27;s Causeway () is an area of approximately 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic fissure eruption. It is located in County Antrim on the north coast of Northern Ireland, about northeast of the town of Bushmills.

It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 and a national nature reserve by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland in 1987. In a 2005 poll of &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers, the Giant&#x27;s Causeway was named the fourth-greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom.

The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the cliff foot and disappear under the sea. Most of the columns are hexagonal, although some have four, five, seven, or eight sides. The tallest are approximately high, and the solidified lava in the cliffs is thick in places.

Much of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Causeway Coast World Heritage Site is owned and managed by the National Trust. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 998,000 visitors in 2019. Access to the Giant&#x27;s Causeway is free of charge: it is not necessary to go via the visitor centre that charges a fee. The remainder of the site is owned by the Crown Estate and several private landowners.

== Geology ==
Around 50 to 60 million years ago, during the Paleocene Epoch, Antrim was subject to intense volcanic activity, when highly fluid molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive volcanic plateau. As the lava cooled, contraction occurred. Horizontal contraction fractured in a similar way to drying mud, with the cracks propagating down as the mass cooled, leaving pillarlike structures that also fractured horizontally into &quot;biscuits&quot;. In many cases, the horizontal fracture resulted in a bottom face that is , while the upper face of the lower segment is concave, producing what are called &quot;ball and socket&quot; joints. The size of the columns was primarily determined by the speed at which lava cooled. The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen today. The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateau that formed during the Paleocene.

=== Geological heritage site ===
In respect of its key role in the development of volcanology as a geoscience discipline, and notably the origin of basalt, the Palaeocene rocks of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Causeway Coast were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 &quot;geological heritage sites&quot; around the world in a listing published in October 2022.

== Legend ==

According to legend, a form of &#x27;geomyth&#x27;, the columns are the remains of a causeway built by a giant. The story goes that the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn MacCool), from the Fenian Cycle of Gaelic mythology, was challenged to a fight by the Scottish giant Benandonner. Fionn accepted the challenge and built the causeway across the North Channel so that the two could meet. In one version of the story, Fionn defeats Benandonner. Another common telling of the story has Fionn hide from Benandonner when he realises that his foe is much bigger than he is. Fionn&#x27;s wife, Sadhbh, disguises Fionn as a baby and tucks him in a cradle. When Benandonner sees the size of the &quot;baby&quot;, he reckons that its father, Fionn, must be a giant among giants. He flees back to Scotland in fright, destroying the causeway behind him so that Fionn would be unable to chase him down. Across the sea, there are identical basalt columns (a part of the same ancient lava flow) at Fingal&#x27;s Cave on the Scottish isle of Staffa, and it is possible that the story was influenced by this.

Overall, in Irish mythology, Fionn mac Cumhaill is not a giant, but a hero with supernatural abilities, contrary to what this particular legend may suggest. In &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot; (1888), it is noted that, over time, &quot;the pagan gods of Ireland [...] grew smaller and smaller in the popular imagination until they turned into the fairies; the pagan heroes grew bigger and bigger until they turned into the giants&quot;. There are no surviving pre-Christian stories about the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, but it may have originally been associated with the Fomorians (&quot;Fomhóraigh&quot;); the Irish name &quot;Clochán na bhFomhóraigh&quot; or &quot;Clochán na bhFomhórach&quot; means &quot;stepping stones of the &quot;Fomhóraigh&quot;&quot;. The &quot;Fomhóraigh&quot; are a race of mythological beings in Irish mythology who were sometimes described as giants and who may have originally been deities among a pre-Christian pantheon.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon comments on these mythological associations in her notes to , a poetical illustration to a painting by Thomas Mann Baynes.

== Tourism ==

William King, Bishop of Derry visited the site in 1692. The existence of the causeway was announced to the wider world the following year by the presentation of a paper to the Royal Society from Sir Richard Bulkeley, a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin. The Giant&#x27;s Causeway received international attention when Dublin artist Susanna Drury made watercolour paintings of it in 1739; they won Drury the first award presented by the Royal Dublin Society in 1740 and were engraved in 1743. In 1765, an entry on the causeway appeared in volume 12 of the French &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, which was informed by the engravings of Drury&#x27;s work; the engraving of the &quot;East Prospect&quot; appeared in a 1768 volume of plates published for the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. In the caption to the plates, French geologist Nicolas Desmarest suggested, for the first time in print, that such structures were volcanic in origin.

The site first became popular with tourists during the nineteenth century, particularly after the opening of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway Tramway. Only after the National Trust took over its care in the 1960s were some of the vestiges of commercialism removed. Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, visited the site on 9 July 1877 as part of a largely unpublicised three-day visit to Ireland.

Visitors may walk over the basalt columns that are at the edge of the sea, a half-mile walk from the entrance of the site.

=== Visitor centre ===

The causeway was without a permanent visitor centre between 2000 and 2012, as the previous building, built in 1986, burned down in 2000. While preliminary approval was given for a publicly funded (but privately managed) development by then Environment Minister and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) member Arlene Foster in 2007, the public funding was frozen due to a perceived conflict of interest between the proposed private developer and the DUP. Ultimately, the private developer dropped a legal challenge to the publicly funded plan, and the new visitor centre was officially opened by 2012. Its construction was funded by the National Trust, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, the Heritage Lottery Fund and public donations. Since opening, the new visitor centre has garnered mixed reviews from those visiting the causeway, for its pricing, design, contents, and placement across the causeway walk descent. In 2018, the visitor centre was visited by 1,011,473 people.

There was some controversy regarding the content of some exhibits in the visitor centre, which refer to the Young Earth Creationist view of the age of the Earth. While these inclusions were welcomed by the chairman of the Northern Irish evangelical group, the Caleb Foundation, the National Trust stated that the inclusions formed only a small part of the exhibition and that the Trust &quot;fully supports the scientific explanation for the creation of the stones 60 million years ago&quot;. An online campaign to remove creationist material was launched in 2012, and following this, the Trust carried out a review and concluded that they should be amended to have the scientific explanation on the origin of the causeway as their primary emphasis. Creationist explanations are still mentioned, but presented as a traditional belief of some religious communities rather than a competing explanation for the origin of the causeway.

== Notable features ==
Some of the structures in the area, having been subject to several million years of weathering, resemble objects, such as the &quot;Organ&quot; and &quot;Giant&#x27;s Boot&quot; structures. Other features include many reddish, weathered low columns known as &quot;Giant&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, created by the displacement of basalt boulders such as the &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Steps&quot;, the &quot;Honeycomb&quot;, the &quot;Giant&#x27;s Harp&quot;, the &quot;Chimney Stacks&quot;, the &quot;Giant&#x27;s Gate&quot;, and the &quot;Camel&#x27;s Hump&quot;.

== Flora and fauna ==
The area is a haven for seabirds, such as fulmar, petrel, cormorant, shag, redshank, guillemot, and razorbill, while the weathered rock formations host numerous plant types, including sea spleenwort, hare&#x27;s-foot trefoil, vernal squill, sea fescue, and frog orchid. A stromatolite colony was reportedly found at the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in October 2011 – an unusual find, as stromatolites are more commonly found in warmer waters with higher saline content than that found at the causeway.

== Similar structures ==

Basalt columns are a common volcanic feature. They occur on many scales and with some variations in formation.

== Transport access ==
The Belfast-Derry railway line run by Northern Ireland Railways connects to Coleraine and along the Coleraine-Portrush branch line to Portrush. Locally, Ulsterbus provides connections to the railway stations. There is a scenic walk of from Portrush alongside Dunluce Castle and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Bushmills Railway.

<doc id="216349" wikidata="Q7269742" url="?curid=216349" title="Quebec (album)">
<text>Quebec is the eighth studio album by the American rock band Ween, released on August 5, 2003, on Sanctuary Records. It was the first album released after the band&#x27;s contract with Elektra expired, and marked its return to independent labels.

Recorded during a period of strife in the band members&#x27; personal lives, &quot;Quebec&quot; was described by Dean Ween as a &quot;very negative&quot; album that takes on a darker tone compared to the band&#x27;s prior work. Josh Freese performed the drums on the album, stepping in for Claude Coleman Jr. as he was recovering from a near-fatal car crash in 2002. Freese also played with the band on tour during this time, including during a series of benefit concerts for Coleman at New York City&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom on October 7 and 8, 2002. 

The album cover is an edited version of the packaging for the game &quot;Thorns&quot; from the 3M Paper Games series with the band superimposed on it.

== Background ==
The album was the band&#x27;s first since 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Pod&quot; to be released on an independent label, as Ween&#x27;s contract with Elektra Records expired following 2000&#x27;s &quot;White Pepper&quot;. The three-year gap between albums was the longest for the band up to this point.

The album was originally titled &quot;Caesar&quot;. It was changed to &quot;Quebec&quot; because, according to Dean Ween, &quot;Our vision is like this rainy, colder than Paris, Parisian place. The vibe of our record is like romantic and rainy without being as classy as Paris. That was why we called it &quot;Quebec&quot;, it&#x27;s like this B-version of Leonard Cohen.&quot; 

Dean Ween recorded the guitar solo on &quot;Transdermal Celebration&quot; illicitly using Carlos Santana&#x27;s guitar and amplifier at a storage space where it was to be shipped to New York. After being informed by a roadie, he took a hard disk recorder with him and successfully recorded it in ten minutes without getting caught.

==Themes==
The recording of &quot;Quebec&quot; saw the band deal with many struggles in their professional and personal lives. Gene Ween was going through a divorce from his first wife, Dean Ween was dealing with drug issues and was &quot;partying way too hard&quot;, Claude Coleman was recovering from a life-threatening car crash that left him unable to perform on the record (with drumming instead being primarily handled by Josh Freese), and the band was moving from Elektra Records to a smaller, independent label. 

As a result, many of the songs on the album deal with drug abuse, mental health issues, and failing relationships. Gene Ween has admitted to taking inspiration from his divorce, saying to Pop Matters “I wrote most of these songs right before the end. A lot of these songs are about that. Even if it’s not direct, you can feel the beginning of the end of the breakup in these songs.”. Reflecting on these themes in 2007, Dean said to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, &quot;With &quot;Quebec&quot;, I like it as a record, but it&#x27;s very negative. It&#x27;s one of our darker records, I think. I don&#x27;t listen to any of our records, but I have never listened to that one.&quot;

==Reception==
The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. Mark Prindle named &quot;Quebec&quot; the best album of the 2000s in an interview on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; named it the No. 39 best album of 2003. &quot;CMJ&quot; named it the No. 8 best album of 2003.

== Track listing ==
All tracks written by Ween.


== Soundtrack appearances and covers==

The song &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be a Long Night&quot; is featured in the video games &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot; and &quot;ATV Offroad Fury 3&quot;, as downloadable content in the &quot;Rock Band &quot; franchise, and in the TV show &quot;The Shield&quot;. 
The song &quot;If You Could Save Yourself (You&#x27;d Save Us All)&quot; was featured in episode 7 of &quot;The Morning Show&quot;.

&quot;Tried and True&quot; and &quot;Transdermal Celebration&quot; appeared in the second season of &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot; with the former being featured in the sixth episode of the same name.

Indie pop band Water from Your Eyes covered &quot;If You Could Save Yourself (You&#x27;d Save Us All)&quot; in 2024 for mental health awareness.

Heavy metal musician Devin Townsend covered &quot;Transdermal Celebration&quot; for his album Transcendence in 2016. 

== &quot;The Caesar Demos&quot; ==

On August 11, 2011, Dean Ween quietly released a two-disc, MP3-only collection of songs, &quot;The Caesar Demos&quot;, named after the band&#x27;s original working title for &quot;Quebec&quot;, to friends on his Facebook page. In his comment, he stated the songs were all recorded between 2001 and 2003 while drummer Claude Coleman, Jr. was recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident, and that many of the tracks featured only himself and Gene. In addition to a handful of recordings that eventually made the album, the demos feature several alternate takes as well as a number of songs that have remained unreleased. 
well what can i say about this here, lemme see. the first thing that comes to mind is that all the while we were doing this we still had claude coleman on drums, he eventually got into a major car wreck and wasn&#x27;t around when it finally came time to make the &quot;real&quot; record. instead the drum duties fell on me, josh freese, and sim cain for a couple of tunes. almost all of this was recorded at our beach house in holgate, nj onto 16 track tape. a tiny bit of it was recorded in the garage behind aaron&#x27;s house in pt. pleasant, pa. some of it was recorded in the spare bedroom of my house in new hope. most of the tunes are just me and aaron, with the two of us playing everything, with me on drums. the songs with claude, dave, and glenn are pretty obvious. on just a few tunes we took what you hear here and cleaned them up and had andrew weiss mix them for the record after some overdubs. dave sings on &quot;it&#x27;s gonna be a long night&quot;, this was days before he had surgery to remove polyps in his throat and his voice was really rough so we figured he was the guy for the job. This isn&#x27;t even all of the tunes that we ended up choosing from, just the ones i happened to burn to cd before we drove home from the beach every week. hope you dig it for what it is.

A few of the songs on the Caesar Demos would end up on later records by the band. &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;I Fell In Love Today&quot; would later be featured on the B-sides compilation Shinola, Vol. 1, while a slightly rewritten version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let The Moon Catch You Crying&quot; would end up on Dean Ween&#x27;s second solo album &quot;rock2&quot;.

<doc id="216352" wikidata="Q265562" url="?curid=216352" title="Sylvia Beach">
<text>Sylvia Beach (14 March 1887 – 5 October 1962), born Nancy Woodbridge Beach, was an American-born bookseller and publisher who lived most of her life in Paris, where she was one of the leading expatriate figures between World War I and II.

She is known for her Paris bookstore, Shakespeare and Company, where she published James Joyce&#x27;s book &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922), and encouraged the publication of and sold copies of Hemingway&#x27;s first book, &quot;Three Stories and Ten Poems&quot; (1923).

== Early life ==
Beach was born in her father&#x27;s parsonage in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, on 14 March 1887, the second of three daughters of Sylvester Beach and Eleanor Thomazine Orbison. She had an older sister, Holly, and a younger sister, Cyprian. Although named Nancy after her grandmother Orbison, she later decided to change her name to Sylvia. Her maternal grandparents were missionaries to India, and her father, a Presbyterian minister, was descended from several generations of clergymen. When the girls were young, the family lived in Baltimore and in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Then, in 1901, the family moved to France upon Sylvester Beach&#x27;s appointment as assistant minister of the American Church in Paris and director of the American student center.

Beach spent 1902–1905 in Paris, returning to New Jersey in 1906 when her father became minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Princeton. She made several return trips to Europe, lived for two years in Spain, and worked for the Balkan Commission of the Red Cross. During the last years of the Great War, she was drawn back to Paris to study contemporary French literature.

==Shakespeare and Company==
While conducting research at the Bibliothèque Nationale, in a French literary journal Beach read of a lending library and bookshop, &quot;La Maison des Amis des Livres&quot; at 7 rue de l&#x27;Odéon, Paris VI. There she was welcomed by the owner who, to her surprise, was a plump, fair-haired young woman, Adrienne Monnier. Monnier was wearing a garment that looked like a cross between a peasant&#x27;s dress and a nun&#x27;s habit, &quot;with a long full skirt … and a sort of tight-fitting velvet waistcoat over a white silk blouse. She was in gray and white like her bookshop.&quot; Although Beach was dressed in a Spanish cloak and hat, Monnier said later she knew immediately that Beach was American. At that first meeting, Monnier declared, &quot;I like America very much&quot;. Beach replied that she liked France very much. They later became lovers and lived together for 36 years until Monnier&#x27;s suicide in 1955.

Beach immediately became a member of Monnier&#x27;s lending library, where she regularly attended readings by authors such as André Gide, Paul Valéry and Jules Romains. Inspired by the literary life of the Left Bank and by Monnier&#x27;s efforts to promote innovative writing, she dreamed of starting a branch of Monnier&#x27;s book shop in New York that would offer contemporary French works to American readers. Since her only capital was US$3,000, which her mother gave her from her savings, she could not afford such a venture in New York. However, Paris rents were much cheaper and the exchange rates favorable, so with Monnier&#x27;s help, she opened an English language bookstore and lending library that she named Shakespeare and Company. Monnier had been among the first women in France to found her own bookstore four years before. Beach&#x27;s bookstore was located at 8 rue Dupuytren, Paris VI.

Shakespeare and Company quickly attracted French and American readers, including aspiring writers to whom Beach offered hospitality, encouragement, and books. As the franc dropped in value and the favorable exchange rate attracted many Americans, her shop flourished and soon needed more space. In May 1921, Shakespeare and Company moved to 12 rue de l&#x27;Odéon, just across the street from Monnier&#x27;s &quot;Maison des Amis des Livres&quot;.
In July 1920, Beach met Irish writer James Joyce at a dinner party hosted by French poet André Spire. Soon after, Joyce joined her lending library. Joyce had been trying, unsuccessfully, to publish his manuscript for his masterpiece, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and Beach, seeing his frustration, offered to publish it. Shakespeare and Company gained considerable fame after it published &quot;Ulysses&quot; in 1922, as a result of Joyce&#x27;s inability to get an edition out in English-speaking countries. She was later financially stranded when Joyce signed on with another publisher, leaving her in debt after she had bankrolled, and suffered severe losses from, the publication of &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Shakespeare and Company experienced financial difficulty throughout the Great Depression of the 1930s but remained supported by wealthy friends, including Bryher. In 1936, when Beach thought she would be forced to close her shop, André Gide organized a group of writers into a club called Friends of Shakespeare and Company. Subscribers paid 200 francs a year to attend readings at the bookstore. Although subscriptions were limited to a select group of 200 people (the maximum number the store could accommodate), the renown of the French and American authors participating in readings during those two years attracted considerable attention to the store. Beach recalled that by then, &quot;we were so glorious with all these famous writers and all the press we received that we began to do very well in business&quot;. Violette Leduc describes meeting her and the ambiance of the shop in her autobiography &quot;La Bâtarde&quot;. Shakespeare and Company remained open after the Fall of Paris, but by the end of 1941, she was forced to close it.

She was interned for six months during World War II at Vittel until Tudor Wilkinson managed to secure her release in February 1942. Following her release she occasionally assisted the American member of the French Resistance, Drue Leyton, in sheltering allied airmen shot down in France. Beach kept her books hidden in a vacant apartment upstairs at 12 rue de l&#x27;Odeon. Ernest Hemingway symbolically &quot;liberated&quot; the shop in person in 1944, but it never re-opened for business.

==Later life==
In 1956, Beach wrote &quot;Shakespeare and Company&quot;, a memoir of the inter-war years that details the cultural life of Paris at the time. The book contains first-hand observations of James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Valery Larbaud, Thornton Wilder, André Gide, Leon-Paul Fargue, George Antheil, Robert McAlmon, Gertrude Stein, Stephen Vincent Benét, Aleister Crowley, Harry Crosby, Caresse Crosby, John Quinn, Berenice Abbott, Man Ray, and many others.

After Monnier&#x27;s suicide in 1955, Beach had a relationship with Camilla Steinbrugge. Although Beach&#x27;s income was modest during the last years of her life, she was widely honored for her publication of &quot;Ulysses&quot; and her support of aspiring writers during the 1920s. On 16 June 1962, she opened the Martello Tower in Sandycove in Dublin (where the opening scene of Ulysses is set) as a museum. She remained in Paris until her death in 1962 and was buried in Princeton Cemetery. Her papers are archived at Princeton University.

American George Whitman opened a new bookshop in 1951 at a different location in Paris (in the rue de la Bûcherie) originally called &quot;Le Mistral&quot;, but renamed Shakespeare and Company in 1964 in honor of the late Sylvia Beach. Since his death in 2011, it has been run by his daughter Sylvia Whitman.

<text>A good&#x27;s price elasticity of demand (formula_1, PED) is a measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded is to its price. When the price rises, quantity demanded falls for almost any good (law of demand), but it falls more for some than for others. The price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant. If the elasticity is −2, that means a one percent price rise leads to a two percent decline in quantity demanded. Other elasticities measure how the quantity demanded changes with other variables (e.g. the income elasticity of demand for consumer income changes).

Price elasticities are negative except in special cases. If a good is said to have an elasticity of 2, it almost always means that the good has an elasticity of −2 according to the formal definition. The phrase &quot;more elastic&quot; means that a good&#x27;s elasticity has greater magnitude, ignoring the sign. Veblen and Giffen goods are two classes of goods which have positive elasticity, rare exceptions to the law of demand. Demand for a good is said to be &quot;inelastic&quot; when the elasticity is less than one in absolute value: that is, changes in price have a relatively small effect on the quantity demanded. Demand for a good is said to be &quot;elastic&quot; when the elasticity is greater than one. A good with an elasticity of −2 has elastic demand because quantity demanded falls twice as much as the price increase; an elasticity of −0.5 has inelastic demand because the change in quantity demanded change is half of the price increase.

At an elasticity of 0 consumption would not change at all, in spite of any price increases. 

Revenue is maximized when price is set so that the elasticity is exactly one. The good&#x27;s elasticity can be used to predict the incidence (or &quot;burden&quot;) of a tax on that good. Various research methods are used to determine price elasticity, including test markets, analysis of historical sales data and conjoint analysis.

==Definition==

The variation in demand in response to a variation in price is called price elasticity of demand. It may also be defined as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in price of particular commodity. The formula for the coefficient of price elasticity of demand for a good is: 

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the initial price of the good demanded, formula_4 is how much it changed, formula_5 is the initial quantity of the good demanded, and formula_6 is how much it changed. In other words, we can say that the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in demand for a commodity due to a given percentage change in the price. If the quantity demanded falls 20 tons from an initial 200 tons after the price rises $5 from an initial price of $100, then the quantity demanded has fallen 10% and the price has risen 5%, so the elasticity is (−10%)/(+5%) = −2.

The price elasticity of demand is ordinarily negative because quantity demanded falls when price rises, as described by the &quot;law of demand&quot;. Two rare classes of goods which have elasticity greater than 0 (consumers buy more if the price is &quot;higher&quot;) are Veblen and Giffen goods. Since the price elasticity of demand is negative for the vast majority of goods and services (unlike most other elasticities, which take both positive and negative values depending on the good), economists often leave off the word &quot;negative&quot; or the minus sign and refer to the price elasticity of demand as a positive value (i.e., in absolute value terms). They will say &quot;Yachts have an elasticity of two&quot; meaning the elasticity is −2. This is a common source of confusion for students. 

Depending on its elasticity, a good is said to have 
elastic demand (&gt; 1),
inelastic demand (&lt; 1), or 
unitary elastic demand (= 1). If demand is elastic, the quantity demanded is very sensitive to price, e.g. when a 1% rise in price generates a 10% decrease in quantity. If demand is inelastic, the good&#x27;s demand is relatively insensitive to price, with quantity changing less than price. If demand is unitary elastic, the quantity falls by exactly the percentage that the price rises. Two important special cases are perfectly elastic demand (= ∞), where even a small rise in price reduces the quantity demanded to zero; and perfectly inelastic demand (= 0), where a rise in price leaves the quantity unchanged. 
The above measure of elasticity is sometimes referred to as the &quot;own-price&quot; elasticity of demand for a good, i.e., the elasticity of demand with respect to the good&#x27;s own price, in order to distinguish it from the elasticity of demand for that good with respect to the change in the price of some other good, i.e., an independent, complementary, or substitute good. That two-good type of elasticity is called a &quot;cross&quot;-price elasticity of demand. If a 1% rise in the price of gasoline causes a 0.5% fall in the quantity of cars demanded, the cross-price elasticity is formula_7 

As the size of the price change gets bigger, the elasticity definition becomes less reliable for a combination of two reasons. First, a good&#x27;s elasticity is not necessarily constant; it varies at different points along the demand curve because a 1% change in price has a quantity effect that may depend on whether the initial price is high or low. Contrary to common misconception, the price elasticity is not constant even along a linear demand curve, but rather varies along the curve. A linear demand curve&#x27;s slope is constant, to be sure, but the elasticity can change even if formula_8 is constant. There does exist a nonlinear shape of demand curve along which the elasticity is constant: formula_9, where formula_10 is a shift constant and formula_11 is the elasticity. 

Second, percentage changes are not symmetric; instead, the percentage change between any two values depends on which one is chosen as the starting value and which as the ending value. For example, suppose that when the price rises from $10 to $16, the quantity falls from 100 units to 80. This is a price increase of 60% and a quantity decline of 20%, an elasticity of formula_12 for that part of the demand curve. If the price falls from $16 to $10 and the quantity rises from 80 units to 100, however, the price decline is 37.5% and the quantity gain is 25%, an elasticity of formula_13 for the same part of the curve. This is an example of the index number problem.

Two refinements of the definition of elasticity are used to deal with these shortcomings of the basic elasticity formula: &quot;arc elasticity&quot; and &quot;point elasticity&quot;.

===Arc elasticity===
Arc elasticity was introduced very early on by Hugh Dalton. It is very similar to an ordinary elasticity problem, but it adds in the index number problem. Arc Elasticity is a second solution to the asymmetry problem of having an elasticity dependent on which of the two given points on a demand curve is chosen as the &quot;original&quot; point will and which as the &quot;new&quot; one is to compute the percentage change in P and Q relative to the &quot;average&quot; of the two prices and the &quot;average&quot; of the two quantities, rather than just the change relative to one point or the other. Loosely speaking, this gives an &quot;average&quot; elasticity for the section of the actual demand curve—i.e., the &quot;arc&quot; of the curve—between the two points. As a result, this measure is known as the &quot;arc elasticity&quot;, in this case with respect to the price of the good. The arc elasticity is defined mathematically as:

:formula_14

This method for computing the price elasticity is also known as the &quot;midpoints formula&quot;, because the average price and average quantity are the coordinates of the midpoint of the straight line between the two given points. This formula is an application of the midpoint method. However, because this formula implicitly assumes the section of the demand curve between those points is linear, the greater the curvature of the actual demand curve is over that range, the worse this approximation of its elasticity will be.

===Point elasticity===

The point elasticity of demand method is used to determine change in demand within the same demand curve, basically a very small amount of change in demand is measured through point elasticity. One way to avoid the accuracy problem described above is to minimize the difference between the starting and ending prices and quantities. This is the approach taken in the definition of &quot;point&quot; elasticity, which uses differential calculus to calculate the elasticity for an infinitesimal change in price and quantity at any given point on the demand curve:
:formula_15

In other words, it is equal to the absolute value of the first derivative of quantity with respect to price formula_16 multiplied by the point&#x27;s price (&quot;P&quot;) divided by its quantity (&quot;Q&quot;d). However, the point elasticity can be computed only if the formula for the demand function, formula_17, is known so its derivative with respect to price, formula_18, can be determined.

In terms of partial-differential calculus, point elasticity of demand can be defined as follows: let formula_19 be the demand of goods formula_20 as a function of parameters price and wealth, and let formula_21 be the demand for good formula_22. The elasticity of demand for good formula_21 with respect to price formula_24 is

:formula_25

==History==
Together with the concept of an economic &quot;elasticity&quot; coefficient, Alfred Marshall is credited with defining &quot;elasticity of demand&quot; in &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;, published in 1890. Alfred Marshall invented price elasticity of demand only four years after he had invented the concept of elasticity. He used Cournot&#x27;s basic creating of the demand curve to get the equation for price elasticity of demand. He described price elasticity of demand as thus: &quot;And we may say generally:— the elasticity (or responsiveness) of demand in a market is great or small according as the amount demanded increases much or little for a given fall in price, and diminishes much or little for a given rise in price&quot;. He reasons this since &quot;the only universal law as to a person&#x27;s desire for a commodity is that it diminishes ... but this diminution may be slow or rapid. If it is slow... a small fall in price will cause a comparatively large increase in his purchases. But if it is rapid, a small fall in price will cause only a very small increase in his purchases. In the former case... the elasticity of his wants, we may say, is great. In the latter case... the elasticity of his demand is small.&quot; Mathematically, the Marshallian PED was based on a point-price definition, using differential calculus to calculate elasticities.

==Determinants==
The overriding factor in determining the elasticity is the willingness and ability of consumers after a price change to postpone immediate consumption decisions concerning the good and to search for substitutes (&quot;wait and look&quot;). A number of factors can thus affect the elasticity of demand for a good:

* Availability of substitute goods: The more and closer the substitutes available, the higher the elasticity is likely to be, as people can easily switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect. If no close substitutes are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.
** Breadth of definition: The broader the definition of a good (or service), the lower the elasticity, because it is no longer possible to . For example, McDonalds hamburgers will probably have a relatively high elasticity of demand (as customers can switch to other fast-food options), whereas food in general will have an extremely low elasticity of demand, because no substitutes exist. Specific foodstuffs (ice cream, meat, spinach) or families of them (dairy, meat, sea products) may be more elastic.
* Necessity: The more necessary a good is, the lower the elasticity, as people will attempt to buy it no matter the price, such as the case of insulin for those who need it.
* Timespan: For most goods, the longer a price change holds, the higher the elasticity is likely to be, as more and more consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.
* Brand loyalty: An attachment to a certain brand can override sensitivity to price changes, resulting in more inelastic demand.
* Who pays: Where the purchaser does not directly pay for the good they consume, such as with corporate expense accounts, demand is likely to be more inelastic.

When measuring Marshallian demand—the demand curve holding nominal, rather than real, income constant—the percentage of income a customer spends on a certain good also affects the elasticity. In introductory microeconomics, the distinction between Marshallian and Hicksian (real-value) demand is often ignored, assuming that any particular good will be a small part of the customer&#x27;s budget, but for large or frequent purchases (e.g. food or transportation) the income effect can become substantial or even dominate the price effect (as for Giffen goods). When the goods represent only a negligible portion of the budget, the income effect is insignificant and does not contribute substantially to elasticity.

==Relation to marginal revenue==
The following equation holds:

: formula_26

where

: &quot;R&quot;′ is the marginal revenue
: &quot;P&quot; is the price

Proof:
: Define Total Revenue as &quot;R&quot; 
: formula_27

: formula_28

: formula_29

On a graph with both a demand curve and a marginal revenue curve, demand will be elastic at all quantities where marginal revenue is positive. Demand is unit elastic at the quantity where marginal revenue is zero. Demand is inelastic at every quantity where marginal revenue is negative.

==Effect on entire revenue==

A firm considering a price change must know what effect the change in price will have on total revenue. Revenue is simply the product of unit price times quantity:

:formula_30

Generally, any change in price will have two effects:
===The price effect===
For inelastic goods, an increase in unit price will tend to increase revenue, while a decrease in price will tend to decrease revenue. (The effect is reversed for elastic goods.)
===The quantity effect===
An increase in unit price will tend to lead to fewer units sold, while a decrease in unit price will tend to lead to more units sold.

For inelastic goods, because of the inverse nature of the relationship between price and quantity demanded (i.e., the law of demand), the two effects affect total revenue in opposite directions. But in determining whether to increase or decrease prices, a firm needs to know what the net effect will be. Elasticity provides the answer: The percentage change in total revenue is approximately equal to the percentage change in quantity demanded plus the percentage change in price. (One change will be positive, the other negative.) The percentage change in quantity is related to the percentage change in price by elasticity: hence the percentage change in revenue can be calculated by knowing the elasticity and the percentage change in price alone.

As a result, the relationship between elasticity and revenue can be described for any good:
* When the price elasticity of demand for a good is &quot;perfectly inelastic&quot; (&quot;E&quot;&quot;d&quot; = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person will be willing to pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.
* When the price elasticity of demand is &quot;relatively inelastic&quot; (−1 &lt; &quot;E&quot;&quot;d&quot; &lt; 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.
* When the price elasticity of demand is &quot;unit (or unitary) elastic&quot; (&quot;E&quot;&quot;d&quot; = −1), the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to that in price, so a change in price will not affect total revenue.
* When the price elasticity of demand is &quot;relatively elastic&quot; (−∞ &lt; &quot;E&quot;&quot;d&quot; &lt; −1), the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls, and vice versa.
* When the price elasticity of demand is &quot;perfectly elastic&quot; (&quot;E&quot;&quot;d&quot; is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a five-dollar bill were sold for anything more than five dollars, nobody would buy it [unless there is demand for economical jokes], so demand is zero (assuming that the bill does not have a misprint or something else which would cause it to have its own inherent value).

Hence, as the accompanying diagram shows, total revenue is maximized at the combination of price and quantity demanded where the elasticity of demand is unitary.

Price-elasticity of demand is &quot;not&quot; necessarily constant over all price ranges. The linear demand curve in the accompanying diagram illustrates that changes in price also change the elasticity: the price elasticity is different at every point on the curve.

==Effect on tax incidence==
Demand elasticity, in combination with the price elasticity of supply can be used to assess where the incidence (or &quot;burden&quot;) of a per-unit tax is falling or to predict where it will fall if the tax is imposed. For example, when demand is &quot;perfectly inelastic&quot;, by definition consumers have no alternative to purchasing the good or service if the price increases, so the quantity demanded would remain constant. Hence, suppliers can increase the price by the full amount of the tax, and the consumer would end up paying the entirety. In the opposite case, when demand is &quot;perfectly elastic&quot;, by definition consumers have an infinite ability to switch to alternatives if the price increases, so they would stop buying the good or service in question completely—quantity demanded would fall to zero. As a result, firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices, so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves.

In practice, demand is likely to be only &quot;relatively&quot; elastic or relatively inelastic, that is, somewhere between the extreme cases of perfect elasticity or inelasticity. More generally, then, the &quot;higher&quot; the elasticity of demand compared to PES, the heavier the burden on producers; conversely, the more &quot;inelastic&quot; the demand compared to supply, the heavier the burden on consumers. The general principle is that the party (i.e., consumers or producers) that has &quot;fewer&quot; opportunities to avoid the tax by switching to alternatives will bear the &quot;greater&quot; proportion of the tax burden.

PED and PES can also have an effect on the deadweight loss associated with a tax regime. When PED, PES or both are inelastic, the deadweight loss is lower than a comparable scenario with higher elasticity.

==Optimal pricing==

Among the most common applications of price elasticity is to determine prices that maximize revenue or profit.

===Constant elasticity and optimal pricing===

If one point elasticity is used to model demand changes over a finite range of prices, elasticity is implicitly assumed constant with respect to price over the finite price range. The equation defining price elasticity for one product can be rewritten (omitting secondary variables) as a linear equation.

:formula_31
where

:formula_32 is the elasticity, and formula_33 is a constant.

Similarly, the equations for cross elasticity for formula_34 products can be written as a set of formula_34 simultaneous linear equations.

:formula_36
where
:formula_37 and formula_38, and formula_39 are constants; and appearance of a letter index as both an upper index and a lower index in the same term implies summation over that index.

This form of the equations shows that point elasticities assumed constant over a price range cannot determine what prices generate maximum values of formula_40; similarly they cannot predict prices that generate maximum formula_5 or maximum revenue.

Constant elasticities can predict optimal pricing only by computing point elasticities at several points, to determine the price at which point elasticity equals −1 (or, for multiple products, the set of prices at which the point elasticity matrix is the negative identity matrix).

===Non-constant elasticity and optimal pricing===

If the definition of price elasticity is extended to yield a quadratic relationship between demand units (formula_5) and price, then it is possible to compute prices that maximize formula_40, formula_5, and revenue. The fundamental equation for one product becomes

:formula_45

and the corresponding equation for several products becomes

:formula_46

Excel models are available that compute constant elasticity, and use non-constant elasticity to estimate prices that optimize revenue or profit for one product or several products.

===Limitations of revenue-maximizing strategies===

In most situations, such as those with nonzero variable costs, revenue-maximizing prices are not profit-maximizing prices. For these situations, using a technique for Profit maximization is more appropriate.

==Selected price elasticities==
Various research methods are used to calculate the price elasticities in real life, including analysis of historic sales data, both public and private, and use of present-day surveys of customers&#x27; preferences to build up test markets capable of modelling such changes. Alternatively, conjoint analysis (a ranking of users&#x27; preferences which can then be statistically analysed) may be used. Approximate estimates of price elasticity can be calculated from the income elasticity of demand, under conditions of preference independence. This approach has been empirically validated using bundles of goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, recreation, etc.).

Though elasticities for most demand schedules vary depending on price, they can be modeled assuming constant elasticity. Using this method, the elasticities for various goods—intended to act as examples of the theory described above—are as follows. For suggestions on why these goods and services may have the elasticity shown, see the above section on determinants of price elasticity.

<text>A weed of cultivation is any plant that is well-adapted to environments in which land is cultivated for growing some other plant. 

Many such weeds are quite specialised and can only thrive and reproduce where the ground has been broken by plough or spade. They are invariably annual and reproduction is by seed alone, which can in many species lie dormant for years in the soil until brought to the surface during cultivation. They have fast reproduction cycles, usually in one year from seed to seed, though some species can have more than one generation in one season. A few species such as groundsel (&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot;), shepherd&#x27;s purse (&quot;Capsella bursa-pastoris&quot;), red deadnettle (&quot;Lamium purpureum&quot;) and chickweed (&quot;Stellaria media&quot;) can survive unharmed through very cold weather and are often able to seed even in winter.

<text>Sky News is a British free-to-air television news channel, live stream news network and news organisation. Sky News is distributed via an English-language radio news service, and through online channels. It is owned by Sky Group, a division of Comcast. In 2024, Sky News was named Royal Television Society News Channel of the Year, the 17th time it has held the award and the channel’s 7th consecutive win. The channel and its live streaming world news is available on its website, TV platforms, and online platforms such as YouTube and Apple TV, and various mobile devices and digital media players.

A sister channel, Sky News Arabia, is operated as a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Media Investment Corporation. A channel called Sky News International, simulcasting the UK channel directly but without British advertisements, is available in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Asia Pacific, Australia, and the Americas. Narrated segments (which generally cover lighter issues unrelated to current news stories) are played in lieu of advertisements, and international weather forecasts also are given at the end of each half-hour newswheel. Sponsored advertisements are still broadcast before and/or after the sports news and weather segments. Sky News Radio provides national and international news to commercial radio and community radio stations in the UK and other English-language stations around the world. Sky News also provides content to Yahoo! News.

Sky News Australia was part-owned by Sky News parent Sky plc until December 2016. Sky News Australia and Sky News UK are presently unlinked, despite the similar names and logos.

==History==
===Establishment and early years===
On 8 June 1988, Rupert Murdoch announced in a speech to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts plans to start a new television news service. Sky News started broadcasting at 6 pm on 5 February 1989.
In the early days, the channel operated on a £40 million budget (plus £10 million share of overheads), which led Sam Chisholm, chief executive of the newly merged BSkyB, to suggest to Murdoch that the station be closed, but Murdoch was &quot;pleased with its achievements ... there were overriding reasons of prestige and politics for keeping it ... the final hurdle of the Broadcasting Bill had still to be overcome and the case for the acceptability of Sky would collapse if suddenly there was no news channel.&quot; Former Home Secretary William Whitelaw said in the House of Lords in 1990 that Sky News had &quot;a very high reputation ... I admire it, as do many other people, it will certainly waken up both the BBC and ITN and ensure that they compete with what is a very important news service&quot; Hansard October 1990. The channel has never been run for a profit, and has considered using ITN to supplement the service.

By March 1992, Sky News&#x27; parent company turned from loss to profit. 
Sky News was the UK&#x27;s first 24-hour news channel, broadcast on Astra 1A. It had no local competition until November 1997, when BBC News launched a new 24-hour channel, BBC News 24, now known simply as BBC News. In September 1999, the European Commission ruled against a Sky News complaint, which argued that the publicly funded BBC News 24 was unfair and illegal under EU law. The EC ruled that the television licence fee &quot;should&quot; be considered state aid (within the meaning of Article 87), but that the BBC&#x27;s public service remit justified the channel.

===2000–2018===
In March 2000, Sky News Active, a 24-hour interactive service providing headlines and other services which ranged from weather, the top story of the day, and showbiz on demand, was launched.

Analogue broadcasting of the channel ceased on 30 June 2001.

In March 2004, Sky News was announced to have won a five-year contract to supply news bulletins to Channel 5, taking over from ITN in January 2005.

On 24 October 2005, Sky News moved to new studios in Isleworth, Greater London, and underwent a major on-screen revamp. The new studio was integrated with the newsroom and boasted the biggest video wall in Britain; it was designed by New York architects Janson Design Group. New music was scored by Adelphoi Music and recorded with a full orchestra at Air Studios, Hampstead, and mastered at Metropolis Studios. New on-screen graphics were launched and the channel began broadcasting in widescreen (16:9) format.

The 2005 relaunch also had the introduction of a new schedule designed around &quot;appointment to view&quot; programmes rather than continuous rolling news. James Rubin joined to present a new evening programme called &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, Julie Etchingham presented another new &quot;hard-hitting&quot; evening show called &quot;The Sky Report&quot;, Eamonn Holmes joined to present &quot;Sunrise&quot;, Kay Burley presented a new programme called &quot;Lunchtime Live&quot; from 12 to 2 pm, and the daytime show &quot;Sky News Today&quot; had the introduction of a three-presenter format. However, the relaunched schedule was unsuccessful, and from October 2005, the BBC News channel overtook Sky News in the ratings.

In response to the schedule&#x27;s unpopularity with viewers, July 2006 saw the removal of the evening programmes—which were replaced by rolling news and an interactive programme, &quot;Sky News with Martin Stanford&quot;, and the return to a two-presenter format on &quot;Sky News Today&quot;. These changes came with the arrival of John Ryley, who is still the head of Sky News. On 1 October 2007, Sky introduced another new schedule, extending Kay Burley&#x27;s &quot;Lunchtime Live&quot; programme and renaming it &quot;Afternoon Live&quot;. It also switched to a new format for much of the day, with a solo lead presenter and a summary newsreader. Sky News put more emphasis on interactive news with Martin Stanford&#x27;s new &quot;SkyNews.com&quot; programme; an early evening financial news programme presented by Jeff Randall, was also introduced, initially on Mondays only. Further changes were made to the Sky News schedule on 8 September 2008, with Colin Brazier presenting a new show from 1 – 2 pm, &quot;The Live Desk&quot;, and Martin Stanford&#x27;s &quot;Sky.com News&quot; became &quot;SkyNews.com&quot;, moving to 7 pm every weeknight. More changes took place during the early part of 2009. These changes involved major changes to the layout of the newsroom/studio, the introduction of a morning edition of &quot;The Live Desk&quot; and the extension of the financial news programme &quot;Jeff Randall Live&quot; to run for four nights each week, Monday to Thursday.

From 6 am to midnight on 8 March 2010, Sky News was presented and produced exclusively by women to mark International Women&#x27;s Day. This exercise was repeated in 2011 and 2012.

In preparation for the start of high-definition broadcasting, Sky News moved to its second studio (Studio B) on the morning of 30 March 2010. Broadcasting from Studio B continued until 9 pm on 6 May, when it moved back to the main newsroom and launched Sky News HD in time for the 2010 general election results. Sky News received a graphics refresh and a new logo to coincide with the launch of the new HD channel – this was tried out during the soft launch for Sky News HD on 22 April; Sky News&#x27; distinctive orchestral theme music, in use since 2005, was also updated on 6 May 2010. The new title music, orchestrated by David Arnold, was recorded with a 60-piece Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in Angel Recording Studios, London, and uses more than 132 audio channels for 18 seconds of sound.

Following the 2015 general election, Sky News was rebranded, with a new top-of-the-hour sequence and on-screen graphics. The traditional opening voiceover, read by Bruce Hammal, was dropped after two decades in use. On 24 October 2016, Sky News began broadcasting from a new studio (Studio 21) at Sky Central, Sky&#x27;s new headquarters in West London. The &quot;glass box&quot; studio was initially used for broadcasts from 6 am to 6.30 pm each weekday (with the exception of &quot;All Out Politics&quot;, which comes from Sky&#x27;s Westminster studio) - as of April 2019 it was only used from 11 am to 7 pm, and 9 pm to 12 am. The schedule was also changed.

In January 2017, Sky moved its business operations into the News Building in central London. On 16 January 2018, Sky moved all its news operations over to Studio 21, &quot;the glass box&quot;, and a new studio in Sky Studios.

===Comcast acquisition, 2018–present===
On 9 December 2016, Sky shareholder 21st Century Fox announced that it had made an offer to acquire the remainder of the company for £11.7 billion. The combination of Sky with Fox&#x27;s other assets led to concerns that the Murdoch family would attain &quot;material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms&quot; and &quot;increased influence over the UK news agenda and the political process&quot;. Concerns were also raised about recent sexual harassment allegations centred upon Fox&#x27;s U.S. network Fox News, although Ofcom did deem 21st Century Fox to be &quot;fit and proper&quot; to hold broadcast licences. On 14 December 2017, The Walt Disney Company in turn announced its intent to acquire 21st Century Fox, following the divestiture of certain assets (particularly the U.S. Fox network proper). Analysts felt that would ease regulatory tensions surrounding the Fox purchase of Sky, as Sky was to be included in the purchase, and Disney&#x27;s scope of media ownership in the UK was not as wide.

In January 2018, the Competition and Markets Authority issued a preliminary report recommending that Sky News be insulated from the remainder of Murdoch&#x27;s assets, or divested, in order to preserve its editorial independence. The following month, Fox proposed a commitment to funding Sky News for 10 years, and the establishment of an independent editorial board. The commitments would have been inherited by Disney if it completed its purchase. On 3 April 2018, Fox stated that Disney had expressed interest in acquiring Sky News in a separate transaction, not dependent on the outcome of the Disney/Fox purchase.

On 5 June 2018, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock cleared Fox&#x27;s proposed deal, contingent on the divestiture of Sky News. It also cleared counteroffers for Sky that were being made in a bidding war by U.S. telecoms and media conglomerate Comcast. Comcast made a US$65 billion counter-offer to acquire the 21st Century Fox assets being sold to Disney. Fox rejected the offer, in favour of a higher-valued offer from Disney. Comcast subsequently pursued a counter-offer for Sky only, resulting in the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ordering that a blind auction be held between Comcast and Fox. On 22 September, Comcast was declared the winner of the auction, resulting in Fox agreeing to sell its controlling stake in Sky to the company.

The sale made Sky News a sister division to NBC News—a U.S.-based news operation owned by Comcast&#x27;s U.S. media division NBCUniversal, its U.S. pay television news channel MSNBC, as well as Euronews—a pan-European news channel which NBCUniversal owned a stake in at the time of purchase. In April 2019, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts stated that the company was exploring the establishment of a &quot;global&quot; news channel as a joint venture between Sky News and NBC News. In January 2020, it was stated that this new channel would also be carried on NBCUniversal&#x27;s new U.S. streaming video platform Peacock. In April 2020, it was stated that the launch of the service, by then known as &quot;NBC Sky World News&quot;, would be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 20 April 2020, NBCUniversal sold its stake in Euronews to one of its existing shareholders, citing a desire to prioritise the NBC/Sky service instead. The proposed service was scrapped in August 2020, resulting in layoffs of 60 employees.

On 3 June 2021, Sky News updated its top-of-the-hour sequence, soundtrack, and on-screen graphics package. A Sky News source denied the move was related to the launch of GB News. On 9 February 2023, David Rhodes was appointed Executive Chairman of the Sky News Group in charge of all Sky&#x27;s news operations. Jonathan Levy was appointed Managing Director and Executive Editor, Sky News UK.

On 19 July 2024, Sky News was taken offline by the 2024 CrowdStrike incident, briefly making it unable to broadcast live.

On 9 November Sky News released a video report on the November 2024 Amsterdam riots citing the fact that the violence was kickstarted by Israeli football fans chanting anti-Arab slurs and tearing down Palestinian flags from various properties. Shortly afterwards Sky News removed their coverage only to reupload an edited version seemingly removing culpability from the Israeli football fans for starting the violence, prompting outrage on social media. 

==Reception==
Sky News is free-to-air on the Astra 28.2°E satellites carrying Sky. It is also available on Freeview and analogue and digital cable. In 2007, BSkyB announced its intention to cease broadcasting Sky News – as well as other BSkyB channels – over Freeview, pending Ofcom approval.

In the 1990s, short-form news updates were broadcast between programs on other Sky networks, including Sky One, Sky Movies and The Movie Channel. Sky One also simulcast the 11PM &quot;Sky World News Hour&quot; for a time in the early 1990s.

===Sky News International===

Sky News is also available internationally on cable systems, on satellite, and in some hotels. While the UK feed is broadcast in 16:9, the international version remained broadcast in a 4:3 picture format until August 2010. Sky News broadcasts in Europe, Middle East, Africa.

The international version is shown as free-to-air on Astra 1L at 19.2° east. It is also carried encrypted on a number of satellites for international reception, including Hot Bird, Nilesat, Amos 1, and Intelsat 10-02. It is also usually carried on cable systems in Europe, particularly in Northern Europe, especially in the Scandinavian countries.

International viewers receive the same programming line-up of Sky News as the UK version. Brief news stories, entertainment news, worldwide weather forecast summaries, and the front pages of international newspapers are broadcast in lieu of UK commercials. The timepiece on the lower left side of the ticker is covered with a banner that says &quot;skynews.com&quot;.

Sky News is not available on Sky Deutschland, Sky plc&#x27;s offering in Germany, but is available on Sky Italia.

On 19 June 2013, Sky News International was added to Apple TV for users in the UK, Ireland, and the United States. Viewers can watch clips or live streaming of the channel at no charge. On 24 July 2013, it was added to the Roku streaming player. Sky News International is available on news.sky.com to viewers around the world. On 30 September 2014, Sky News began live streaming the channel on YouTube. The free streaming service Pluto TV also offers a live feed of Sky News to American users on channel 135. Since its acquisition by Comcast, Sky News has been made available in the U.S. on the Peacock streaming service run by NBCUniversal, and simulcast on MSNBC and NBC News Now during breaking news events of major significance such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the Wagner Group rebellion, and the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

Sky News International and Sky News Ireland feeds are registered to broadcast within the European Union/EEA through ALIA in Luxembourg.

In 2023 Sky News UK launched on Bell Fibe in Canada, it was previously on Videotron,

Sky TG24, Italy&#x27;s version of Sky News, launched in 2003.

Sky News Australia was one-third owned by Sky plc until December 2016, when it was acquired by News Corp Australia. It carries Sky News UK overnight and shares some of its presentational style. On Foxtel in Australia, Sky News UK is available on channel 604.

From 2004 to 2006, Sky News Ireland broadcast two newscasts produced in Dublin. The newscasts were cancelled due to low viewership. Sky News in Ireland now carries the same programming as Sky News in the UK with local insertion of Irish-specific ads.

===Previous partnership with CBS News===
Until 2017, Sky News had a resource-sharing agreement with CBS News in the United States to share footage and reporting. In July 2017, in the wake of Sky&#x27;s pending takeover by 21st Century Fox (which runs the competing and former &quot;de facto&quot; sister Fox News Channel in the U.S.), and NBC News acquiring a stake in Euronews, CBS ended the agreement and entered into a similar deal with the BBC.

==Sky News HD==

Beginning in early 2008, Sky News began using HD-capable cameras in the field. Some one-off programmes were made available in HD to Sky+ HD subscribers on Sky On Demand. The programmes included &quot;Technofile&quot;, &quot;Diana: The Final Word&quot;, &quot;Canoe Man: Rise and Fall of John Darwin&quot;, and &quot;Pathfinders: Into The Heart Of Afghanistan&quot;.

On 20 January 2009, before the launch of the Sky News HD channel, Sky Arts broadcast Sky News coverage in HD of the Inauguration of Barack Obama. Jeremy Thompson fronted the coverage from Washington, D.C. Michael Jackson&#x27;s memorial service was also broadcast in HD, with Kay Burley presenting.

Sky News moved operations to a chroma-key set in Studio B from 30 March 2010, so final preparations for HD could take place in the main newsroom.

The first live broadcast of Sky News HD, on Sky Channel 517, was the channel&#x27;s election debate, which was held on 22 April 2010. For the 10 days leading up to the debate, channel 517 displayed a countdown clock to launch. The debate was hosted in HD by Kay Burley and Adam Boulton. Following the end of the coverage for the evening, channel 517 moved to show a looping preview tape. The tape included the HD, which were available on Sky Anytime. The loop continued until Sky News HD was launched on the evening of 6 May 2010, coinciding with the coverage of the 2010 general election results, hosted by Adam Boulton.

On 26 July 2010, Sky News HD launched on the OSN Network, broadcasting to the Middle East and Africa.

On 1 January 2015, Sky News HD launched on Virgin Media.

==Sky News Radio==

Sky News Radio provides news bulletins to radio stations in the United Kingdom and to other English-language radio stations around the world.

In March 2007, BSkyB and Chrysalis Group announced plans to launch a dedicated Sky News Radio station on the proposed bid by Channel 4&#x27;s 4 Digital Group for the second digital audio broadcasting multiplex in the United Kingdom. However, two months later Chrysalis sold its radio stations to Global Radio, and in October 2007 following a business review Global&#x27;s chief executive announced that it would be withdrawing from the joint venture.

The Sky News Radio feed is available free-to-air on the Astra 2A satellite at 28.2 East by tuning it manually: 12207.00 V, 27500, 2/3 (Label: SNR).

==Additional channels==
===Sky News Raw===
On 5 February 2019, Sky News launched a pop-up channel called Sky News Raw. It aired with behind-the-scenes programming from 07:00 to 17:00 on channel 523 on Sky TV and online via Sky News&#x27; social media channels. The pop-up channel celebrated the 30th anniversary of Sky News, having first broadcast on 5 February 1989.

Robotic cameras were placed around the newsroom and planning rooms at Sky Studios, in the three main television studios at Osterley and Millbank, and in the broadcast galleries. There were also behind-the-scenes features from elsewhere in the newsgathering operation, such as the Sky News helicopter and ENG vehicles.
===Sky News Brexit-Free===
From 16 October to 1 November 2019, Sky News ran a pop-up channel called Sky News Brexit-Free. The channel aired on weekdays from 17:00 to 22:00 and carried coverage of other news headlines unrelated to the United Kingdom&#x27;s exit from the European Union. Sky News head John Ryley cited viewer fatigue over the near-constant coverage of Brexit as justification for the channel.

==In-depth series==
The channel occasionally focuses on specific areas of society and current affairs. Past examples include &quot;Inside Iraq&quot;, &quot;Green Britain&quot; and &quot;Crime Uncovered&quot;.

&quot;Pakistan: On Terror&#x27;s Frontline&quot; was shown throughout the week beginning Monday 23 March 2009. A Sky News press release stated:
The series of reports won a 2009 RTS Award for International News Coverage.

==Criticism and perception==
Sky News operates under Ofcom broadcasting regulations which require impartial, unbiased coverage and prevent the channel from being encrypted in the UK. The channel is viewed by some in the media establishment as an impartial and unbiased provider of news.

There are sources stating that Sky News may be inherently biased because throughout the 1990s and 2000s it was minority-owned and dominated by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s right-leaning News Corporation, and thereafter the Murdoch family&#x27;s 21st Century Fox. Many News Corp subsidiaries, including News Corp UK &amp; Ireland Ltd, the owner of the &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; newspapers, have an openly conservative or right-wing outlook. In a 2010 article in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, prominent left wing progressive journalist and broadcaster Mehdi Hasan argued that &quot;in style and in substance, of course, it is nothing like the pro-war, pro-Republican, pro-Palin Fox News Channel... Sky News remains, as far as I can see, free of party political bias.&quot; As of October 2018, Fox no longer has any stake in the broadcaster.

Ofcom received complaints regarding the network&#x27;s lack of neutrality ahead of the 2010 general election, but these were not upheld.

In early 1994 Kelvin MacKenzie, former editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, was appointed managing director of BSkyB, Sky News&#x27;s parent company at the time. MacKenzie&#x27;s proposed changes to Sky News led to clashes with CEO Sam Chisholm and the head of Sky News, Ian Frykberg, who protested at what they saw as an attempt to take the channel&#x27;s news values . The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with Lady Bienvenida Buck. Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards. The interview was broadcast on Sky One. MacKenzie announced his resignation in August 1994, but not before Sky News had transmitted live pictures of the freeway chase of O. J. Simpson&#x27;s white Bronco on 17 June 1994, bringing US &quot;helicopter journalism&quot; to the UK.

In 1997, Sky News broadcast live coverage of Louise Woodward&#x27;s trial, held in Boston, Massachusetts, US. When Sky returned to a regular schedule, viewers demanded the trial coverage be continued. Sky News broadcast reaction from Woodward&#x27;s home town of Elton, Cheshire, leading to criticism that the station had a pro-Louise Woodward stance.

In November 2005 the then head of BBC News, Peter Horrocks, acknowledged that Sky News remained the first choice for &quot;key opinion formers&quot;.

Ofcom received 652 complaints regarding the network&#x27;s neutrality after it hosted the second leaders&#x27; debate ahead of the 2010 General Election.

Ofcom received 832 complaints about a May 2010 interview with electoral reformist David Babbs conducted by Sky News presenter Kay Burley. The interview led to Burley being heckled by protesters while reporting from Westminster, and further protest via a Twitter campaign.

Ofcom received 696 complaints relating to Sky News&#x27;s then political editor Adam Boulton&#x27;s conduct during a May 2010 interview with Alastair Campbell.

In 2014, Sky News journalist Colin Brazier rifled through a Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 victim&#x27;s possessions on live TV. He picked up objects and briefly described what he had before putting them down and saying &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t really be doing this I suppose, really&quot;. 110 complaints were submitted to Ofcom. Sky News stated both Brazier and Sky News &quot;apologise profusely for any offence caused&quot;.

Sky News was again embroiled in controversy in October 2014, when crime correspondent Martin Brunt and his camera crew doorstepped Brenda Leyland, who had posted controversial comments concerning the McCann investigation on social media. Following the confrontation Leyland was found dead in a hotel, leading to calls on social media for Brunt to be sacked. During the inquest into Leyland&#x27;s death, Brunt expressed to the coroner that he was devastated at hearing the news of Leyland&#x27;s suicide. Following the inquest, Ofcom reported it had received 171 complaints in relation to the case and that it would consider these complaints in light of the coroner&#x27;s verdict.

In 2015, Kay Burley caused further controversy when, in response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, she tweeted a photograph of a Golden Retriever dog, to which she had added, &quot;Sadness in his eyes #parisattacks&quot;.

In February 2023, Sky News faced further criticism over its handling and reporting of missing person Nicola Bulley.

===Fabrication===
In April 2003, Sky News carried a report from James Forlong aboard the British nuclear submarine HMS &quot;Splendid&quot; purportedly showing a live firing of a cruise missile during the Iraq war. The report was a fabrication, with the crew acting along for the benefit of the cameras. The &quot;Sky News&quot; team did not accompany the submarine when it left port and the scenes were recorded whilst the vessel was docked. The shot of the missile launch had been obtained from stock footage.

The faked report was revealed because another film crew did accompany the vessel to sea, and its footage showed that a modern missile is not launched by a crew member pressing a red button marked with the word &quot;FIRE&quot;, as had been portrayed in the Sky News report, but is launched with a left mouse click. When the fabrication was exposed, Forlong and his producer were suspended. The next day, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Forlong had resigned following an internal investigation. In a follow-up article, &quot;The Guardian&quot; speculated on the long-term effects on Sky News credibility. In October 2003, Forlong was found dead by his wife after committing suicide. In December, Sky News was fined £50,000 by the Independent Television Commission for breaching accuracy regulations.

In August 2016 Sky News was criticised after allegedly paying €2,000 to a group of Romanians to pretend they were part of an eastern European gang selling guns to terrorists in Syria. The Romanians were arrested by Romanian DIICOT and confessed that they were paid by Sky News journalist Stuart Ramsay to pretend they were gun traffickers. The guns featured in the report were legally owned and were hunting weapons. Sky News has said it stands by the story.

=== Accusations of bias in Sky News&#x27; coverage of November 2024 Amsterdam incident ===

==== Background ====
In November 2024, Sky News faced criticism for its coverage of an incident involving Israeli soccer fans from Maccabi Tel Aviv and anti-Israel protesters in Amsterdam. Initially, Sky News aired footage suggesting the Israeli fans were instigators in the violence, capturing clashes and confrontational behavior reportedly initiated by Maccabi fans following a match. Shortly afterward, portions of the footage were reportedly edited or removed by Sky News, reframing the incident to imply that Israeli fans were predominantly victims of unprovoked antisemitic attacks, sparking accusations of selective editing and bias.

==== Reactions and criticism ====
The re-editing of the footage was met with criticism from media analysts and audience members who argued that Sky News&#x27; choices potentially misrepresented the events. Some commentators suggested that the revisions favored a pro-Israel stance by portraying the Maccabi fans as passive victims, which they argued oversimplified the conflict and the complexity of the incident. Critics contended that such selective editing could skew public perception and amplify existing tensions, especially amid ongoing global conflicts related to Israel.

The backlash against Sky News was further compounded by similar incidents in recent months, where the network’s reporting on Israeli and Palestinian conflicts was scrutinized for potential bias. This controversy has added to broader discussions about the role of media outlets in objectively reporting politically sensitive incidents.
==Legal cases==
In November 2008 BSkyB paid substantial undisclosed libel damages to Robert Murat in relation to their reporting of the abduction of Madeleine McCann. Sky News had falsely suggested that Murat, who was assisting in the search of McCann, had acted like child murderer Ian Huntley following McCann&#x27;s disappearance. Sky News also falsely accused Murat of misleading journalists into thinking he was working for the police. An apology was also placed on the Sky News website, the libellous material removed and Murat&#x27;s costs were paid.

In November 2010 the Attorney General for England and Wales, Dominic Grieve QC, was given the right to launch contempt of court proceedings against Sky News over the broadcaster&#x27;s alleged breach of a media injunction. It was in relation to the reporting of the story of Paul and Rachel Chandler, a Kent couple who were held captive by Somali pirates for 13 months. The media was blocked from publishing details of the couple&#x27;s &quot;health and welfare&quot; prior to their being freed on 14 November 2010. Sky claims that it &quot;scrupulously observed the terms of the injunction&quot;, but also admitted that it &quot;followed the spirit, if not the letter&quot; of the order. At the time, lawyers representing the Chandlers obtained the court order over fears that their lives could be put in danger by the media reporting their capture. Sky News was alleged to have breached the injunction on the day of their release around from Somalia, leading the Attorney General to seek permission at the High Court to bring contempt proceedings. The Attorney General dropped the case in January 2012; a spokesperson for his office said that continuing with proceedings would no longer be in the public interest.

In March 2013 Sky News journalist Mark Stone and his camera operator were detained in Tiananmen Square live on television, in what he described as a surreal but telling episode about reporting in China. Viewers saw Stone being directed into a police van live from Beijing. A police officer was filmed asking the Sky team to switch off their camera, saying they were now inside the Forbidden City and did not have permission to film there. While they had permission to film in the square, Stone said police told him the team were not displaying their passes correctly.

==Awards==
Sky News won BAFTA awards for coverage of the 11 September 2001 attacks and the 2002 Soham murders.

Sky News&#x27;s coverage of the 7 July 2005 London bombings won the 2006 International Emmy for Breaking News award. The coverage was commended as &quot;fast and accurate&quot;.

In June 2007, Sky News was named Best News Channel at the Broadcast Digital Channel Awards. It beat several other national and international broadcasters, including Al Jazeera English and the BBC.

The channel won a BAFTA Award in the News Category on 10 May 2015, for Alex Crawford&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 Ebola crisis.

In 2018, Sky News was named Royal Television Society News Channel of the Year, the eleventh time the channel had won the award.

Sky News won a BAFTA Award in the News Category on 13 May 2018 for &quot;The Rohingya Crisis&quot;. Special Correspondent Alex Crawford, cameraman Martin Smith and producer Neville Lazarus travelled into Myanmar to bring a first-hand report of what was happening in Rakhine State. The same programme also won an International Emmy Award for News in October 2018.

==Sponsorship==
In November 2014, Sky News sponsored the Young Person in Business category of the National Chamber Awards. It was won by Oliver Bryssau of Origin Broadband, which was named Business of the Year.

==Online==
news.sky.com is the channel&#x27;s main website. It provides news, sport, weather, showbiz, and business stories.

In 2009, the website changed to bring it in line with the on-screen look of Sky News. The site made use of Flash video encoding to match the visual style of the TV channel with pictures and breaking news. The site underwent a further refresh in 2012, when both the look of the pages and the content management system were updated.

In 2021, to bring the website in line with the new Sky News branding on-screen minor tweaks were made such as font updates and updated breaking news graphics.

==Virgin Media dispute==
On 1 March 2007, Sky&#x27;s agreement to provide its basic channels (including Sky News) to Virgin Media expired. At midnight, Sky News was removed and the EPG entry for the channel was changed to &quot;Sky Snooze Try BBC&quot; until Sir Richard Branson demanded the message be removed, saying: &quot;I have asked them to take it down. We do not mean any disrespect to Sky News. I think it is a very good news channel.&quot;

Sky News, and the other Sky channels that had been removed, reappeared on Virgin Media on 13 November 2008.

==Audience figures==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported in November 2021, &quot;Sky&#x27;s top performing shows, including &quot;Trevor Phillips on Sunday&quot;, average around 160,000 viewers&quot;.

In the period from 22 November 2022 to 21 December 2022, Sky News averaged 52,230 each day for its prime-time audience (between 7pm and 11pm). Its all-day average was 53,350.

==Organisation==

===Budget===
As of 2018, Sky News had an estimated £90 million annual budget, employs about 500 staff, but it makes a loss of between £15 million and £20 million a year, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

<text>Robert Merton Solow,  (; August 23, 1924 – December 21, 2023) was an American economist who received the 1978 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, and whose work on the theory of economic growth culminated in the exogenous growth model named after him.

He was Institute Professor Emeritus of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a professor from 1949 on. He was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal in 1961, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1987, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. Four of his PhD students, George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz, Peter Diamond, and William Nordhaus, later received Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic Sciences in their own right.

== Biography ==
Robert Solow was born in Brooklyn, New York, into a Jewish family on August 23, 1924, the oldest of three children. He attended local public school and excelled academically early in life. In September 1940, Solow went to Harvard College with a scholarship at the age of 16. At Harvard, his first studies were in sociology and anthropology as well as elementary economics.

In 1942, Solow left the university and joined the U.S. Army. Because he was fluent in German, the Army put him on a task force whose primary purpose was to intercept, interpret, and send back German messages to base. He served briefly in North Africa and Sicily, and later in Italy until he was discharged in August 1945. Shortly after returning, he proceeded to marry his girlfriend, Barbara Lewis (died 2014), whom he had been dating for six weeks.

Solow returned to Harvard in 1945, and studied under Wassily Leontief. As Leontief&#x27;s research assistant he produced the first set of capital-coefficients for the input–output model. Then he became interested in statistics and probability models. From 1949 to 1950, he spent a fellowship year at Columbia University to study statistics more intensively. During that year he also worked on his Ph.D. thesis, an exploratory attempt to model changes in the size distribution of wage income using interacting Markov processes for employment-unemployment and wage rates.

In 1949, just before going off to Columbia, he was offered and accepted an assistant professorship in the Economics Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT he taught courses in statistics and econometrics. Solow&#x27;s interest gradually changed to macroeconomics. For almost 40 years, Solow and Paul Samuelson worked together on many landmark theories: von Neumann growth theory (1953), theory of capital (1956), linear programming (1958) and the Phillips curve (1960).

Solow also held several government positions, including senior economist for the Council of Economic Advisers (1961–62) and member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Income Maintenance (1968–70). His studies focused mainly in the fields of employment and growth policies, and the theory of capital.

In 1961 he won the American Economic Association&#x27;s John Bates Clark Award, given to the best economist under age forty. In 1979 he served as president of that association. In 1987, he won the Nobel Prize for his analysis of economic growth and in 1999, he received the National Medal of Science. In 2011, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Science from Tufts University.

Solow was the founder of the Cournot Foundation and the Cournot Centre. After the death of his colleague Franco Modigliani, Solow accepted an appointment as new Chairman of the I.S.E.O Institute, an Italian nonprofit cultural association which organizes international conferences and summer schools. He was a founding trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security.

Solow&#x27;s students include Nobel Prize winners Peter Diamond, George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz, and William Nordhaus, as well as Michael Rothschild, Halbert White, Charlie Bean, Michael Woodford, and Harvey Wagner. 

Solow was one of the signees of a 2018 &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief that expressed support for Harvard University in the &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College&quot; lawsuit. Signers of the brief include Alan B. Krueger, George A. Akerlof, Janet Yellen, and Cecilia Rouse.

Solow was one of the supporters of Joe Biden&#x27;s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Solow died at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts, on December 21, 2023, at the age of 99.

== Model of economic growth ==
Solow&#x27;s model of economic growth, often known as the Solow–Swan neoclassical growth model as the model was independently discovered by Trevor W. Swan and published in &quot;The Economic Record&quot; in 1956, allows the determinants of economic growth to be separated into increases in inputs (labour and capital) and technical progress. The reason these models are called &quot;exogenous&quot; growth models is the saving rate is taken to be exogenously given. Subsequent work derives savings behavior from an inter-temporal utility-maximizing framework. Using his model, Solow (1957) calculated that about four-fifths of the growth in US output per worker was attributable to technical progress.

Solow also was the first to develop a growth model with different vintages of capital. The idea behind Solow&#x27;s vintage capital growth model is that new capital is more valuable than old (vintage) capital because new capital is produced through known technology. He first states that capital must be a finite entity because all of the resources on the earth are indeed limited. Within the confines of Solow&#x27;s model, this known technology is assumed to be constantly improving. Consequently, the products of this technology (the new capital) are expected to be more productive as well as more valuable.

The idea lay dormant for some time perhaps because Dale W. Jorgenson (1966) argued that it was observationally equivalent with disembodied technological progress, as advanced earlier in Solow (1957). It was successfully advanced in subsequent research by Jeremy Greenwood, Zvi Hercowitz and Per Krusell (1997), who argued that the secular decline in capital goods prices could be used to measure embodied technological progress. They labeled the notion investment-specific technological progress. Solow (2001) approved. Both Paul Romer and Robert Lucas, Jr. subsequently developed alternatives to Solow&#x27;s neoclassical growth model.

To better communicate the meaning behind his work, Solow used a graphical design to illustrate his concepts. On the x-axis he puts capital per worker and for the y-axis he uses output per worker. The reason for graphing capital and output per worker is due to his assumption that the nation is at full employment. The first (top) curve represents the output produced at each given level of capital. The second (middle) curve shows the depreciating nature of capital which remains constantly positive. The third curve (bottom) conveys savings/investment per worker. As the old machinery wears down and breaks, new capital goods must be bought to replace the old. The point where the two lines meet is known as the steady state level, which means that the nation is producing just enough to be able to replace the old capital. Countries that are closer to the steady state level, on the left side, grow more slowly when compared to countries closer to the vertex of the graph. When countries are to the right of the steady state level, they are not growing because all the returns they create need to go to replacing and repairing their old capital.

Since Solow&#x27;s initial work in the 1950s, many more sophisticated models of economic growth have been proposed, leading to varying conclusions about the causes of economic growth. For example, rather than assuming, as Solow did, that people save at a given constant rate, subsequent work applied a consumer-optimization framework to derive savings behavior endogenously, allowing saving rates to vary at different points in time, depending on income flows, for example. 
In the 1980s efforts have focused on the role of technological progress in the economy, leading to the development of endogenous growth theory (or new growth theory). Today, economists use Solow&#x27;s sources-of-growth accounting to estimate the separate effects on economic growth of technological change, capital, and labor.

In 2022, Solow was still an emeritus Institute Professor in the MIT economics department..

<text>Food security is the state of having reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. The availability of food for people of any class and state, gender or religion is another element of food security. Similarly, household food security is considered to exist when all the members of a family, at all times, have access to enough food for an active, healthy life. Individuals who are food-secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation. Food security includes resilience to future disruptions of food supply. Such a disruption could occur due to various risk factors such as droughts and floods, shipping disruptions, fuel shortages, economic instability, and wars. Food insecurity is the opposite of food security: a state where there is only limited or uncertain availability of suitable food.

The concept of food security has evolved over time. The four pillars of food security include availability, access, utilization, and stability. In addition, there are two more dimensions that are important: agency and sustainability. These six dimensions of food security are reinforced in conceptual and legal understandings of the right to food. The World Food Summit in 1996 declared that &quot;food should not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure.&quot;

There are many causes of food insecurity. The most important ones are high food prices and disruptions in global food supplies for example due to war. There is also climate change, water scarcity, land degradation, agricultural diseases, pandemics and disease outbreaks that can all lead to food insecurity.

The effects of food insecurity can include hunger and even famines. Chronic food insecurity translates into a high degree of vulnerability to hunger and famine. Chronic hunger and malnutrition in childhood can lead to stunted growth of children. Once stunting has occurred, improved nutritional intake after the age of about two years is unable to reverse the damage. Severe malnutrition in early childhood often leads to defects in cognitive development.

==Definition==
&quot;Food security,&quot; as defined by the World Food Summit in 1996, is &quot;when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to &quot;sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&quot;.

&quot;Food insecurity&quot;, on the other hand, as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is a situation of &quot;limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.&quot;

At the 1974 World Food Conference, the term &quot;food security&quot; was defined with an emphasis on supply; it was defined as the &quot;availability at all times of adequate, nourishing, diverse, balanced and moderate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset the fluctuations in production and prices.&quot; Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The first World Food Summit, held in 1996, stated that food security &quot;exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.&quot;

Chronic (or permanent) food insecurity is defined as the long-term, persistent lack of adequate food. In this case, households are constantly at risk of being unable to acquire food to meet the needs of all members. Chronic and transitory food insecurity are linked since the reoccurrence of transitory food security can make households more vulnerable to chronic food insecurity.

, the concept of food security has mostly focused on food calories rather than the quality and nutrition of food. The concept of &quot;nutrition security&quot; or &quot;nutritional security&quot; evolved as a broader concept. In 1995, it was defined as &quot;adequate nutritional status in terms of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals for all household members at all times.&quot;
It is also related to the concepts of nutrition education and nutritional deficiency.

== Measurement ==

Food security can be measured by the number of calories to digest per person per day, available on a household budget. In general, the objective of food security indicators and measurements is to capture some or all of the main components of food security in terms of food availability, accessibility, and utilization/adequacy. While availability (production and supply) and utilization/adequacy (nutritional status/ anthropometric measurement) are easier to estimate and therefore more popular, accessibility (the ability to acquire a sufficient quantity and quality of food) remains largely elusive. The factors influencing household food accessibility are often context-specific.

FAO has developed the &quot;Food Insecurity Experience Scale&quot; (FIES) as a universally applicable experience-based food security measurement scale derived from the scale used in the United States. Thanks to the establishment of a global reference scale and the procedure needed to calibrate measures obtained in different countries, it is possible to use the FIES to produce cross-country comparable estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity in the population. Since 2015, the FIES has been adopted as the basis to compile one of the indicators included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring framework.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) collaborate every year to produce &quot;The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World&quot;, or SOFI report (known as &quot;The State of Food Insecurity in the World&quot; until 2015).

The SOFI report measures chronic hunger (or undernourishment) using two main indicators, the &quot;Number of undernourished&quot; (NoU) and the &quot;Prevalence of undernourishment&quot; (PoU). Beginning in the early 2010s, FAO incorporated more complex metrics into its calculations, including estimates of food losses in retail distribution for each country and the volatility in agri-food systems. Since 2014, it has also reported the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity based on the FIES. 

Several measurements have been developed to capture the access component of food security, with some notable examples developed by the USAID-funded Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) project. These include:
* &quot;Household Food Insecurity Access Scale&quot; – measures the degree of food insecurity (inaccessibility) in the household in the previous month on a discrete ordinal scale.
* &quot;Household Dietary Diversity Scale&quot; – measures the number of different food groups consumed over a specific reference period (24hrs/48hrs/7days).
* &quot;Household Hunger Scale&quot; – measures the experience of household food deprivation based on a set of predictable reactions, captured through a survey and summarized in a scale.
* &quot;Coping Strategies Index&quot; (CSI) – assesses household behaviors and rates them based on a set of varied established behaviors on how households cope with food shortages. The methodology for this research is based on collecting data on a single question: &quot;What do you do when you do not have enough food, and do not have enough money to buy food?&quot;

==Prevalence of food insecurity==

Close to 12 percent of the global population was severely food insecure in 2020, representing 928 million people -148 million more than in 2019. A variety of reasons lie behind the increase in hunger over the past few years. Slowdowns and downturns since the 2008–9 financial crisis have conspired to degrade social conditions, making undernourishment more prevalent. Structural imbalances and a lack of inclusive policies have combined with extreme weather events, altered environmental conditions, and the spread of pests and diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, triggering stubborn cycles of poverty and hunger. In 2019, the high cost of healthy diets together with persistently high levels of income inequality put healthy diets out of reach for around 3 billion people, especially the poor, in every region of the world.

Inequality in the distributions of assets, resources and income, compounded by the absence or scarcity of welfare provisions in the poorest of countries, is further undermining access to food. Nearly a tenth of the world population still lives on US$1.90 or less a day, with sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia the regions most affected.

High import and export dependence ratios are meanwhile making many countries more vulnerable to external shocks. In many low-income economies, debt has swollen to levels far exceeding GDP, eroding growth prospects.

Finally, there are increasing risks to institutional stability, persistent violence, and large-scale population relocation as a consequence of the conflicts. With the majority of them being hosted in developing nations, the number of displaced individuals between 2010 and 2018 increased by 70% between 2010 and 2018 to reach 70.8 million.

Recent editions of the SOFI report (&quot;The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World)&quot; present evidence that the decades-long decline in hunger in the world, as measured by the number of undernourished (NoU), has ended. In the 2020 report, FAO used newly accessible data from China to revise the global NoU downwards to nearly 690 million, or 8.9 percent of the world population – but having recalculated the historic hunger series accordingly, it confirmed that the number of hungry people in the world, albeit lower than previously thought, had been slowly increasing since 2014. On broader measures, the SOFI report found that far more people suffered some form of food insecurity, with 3 billion or more unable to afford even the cheapest healthy diet. Nearly 2.37 billion people did not have access to adequate food in 2020 – an increase of 320 million people compared to 2019.

FAO&#x27;s 2021 edition of &quot;The State of Food and Agriculture&quot; (SOFA) further estimates that an additional 1 billion people (mostly in lower- and upper-middle-income countries) are at risk of not affording a healthy diet if a shock were to reduce their income by a third.

The 2021 edition of the SOFI report estimated the hunger excess linked to the COVID-19 pandemic at 30 million people by the end of the decade – FAO had earlier warned that even without the pandemic, the world was off track to achieve Zero Hunger or Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals – it further found that already in the first year of the pandemic, the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) had increased 1.5 percentage points, reaching a level of around 9.9 percent. This is the mid-point of an estimate of 720 to 811 million people facing hunger in 2020 – as many as 161 million more than in 2019. The number had jumped by some 446 million in Africa, 57 million in Asia, and about 14 million in Latin America and the Caribbean.

At the global level, the prevalence of food insecurity at a moderate or severe level, and severe level only, is higher among women than men, magnified in rural areas.

In 2023, the Global Report on Food Crises revealed that acute hunger affected approximately 282 million people across 59 countries, an increase of 24 million from the previous year. This rise in food insecurity was primarily driven by conflicts, economic shocks, and extreme weather. Regions like the Gaza Strip and South Sudan were among the hardest hit, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions to address and mitigate global hunger effectively.

=== Vulnerable groups most affected ===

==== Children ====
Food insecurity in children can lead to developmental impairments and long term consequences such as weakened physical, intellectual and emotional development.

By way of comparison, in one of the largest food producing countries in the world, the United States, approximately one out of six people are &quot;food insecure,&quot; including 17 million children, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2009. A 2012 study in the &quot;Journal of Applied Research on Children&quot; found that rates of food security varied significantly by race, class and education. In both kindergarten and third grade, 8% of the children were classified as food insecure, but only 5% of white children were food insecure, while 12% and 15% of black and Hispanic children were food insecure, respectively. In third grade, 13% of black and 11% of Hispanic children were food insecure compared to 5% of white children.

==== Women ====

Gender inequality both leads to and is a result of food insecurity. According to estimates, girls and women make up 60% of the world&#x27;s chronically hungry and little progress has been made in ensuring the equal right to food for women enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

At the global level, the gender gap in the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity grew even larger in the year of COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 SOFI report finds that in 2019 an estimated 29.9 percent of women aged between 15 and 49 years around the world were affected by anemia.

The gap in food insecurity between men and women widened from 1.7 percentage points in 2019 to 4.3 percentage points in 2021.

Women play key roles in maintaining all four pillars of food security: as food producers and agricultural entrepreneurs; as decision-makers for the food and nutritional security of their households and communities and as &quot;managers&quot; of the stability of food supplies in times of economic hardship.

The gender gap in accessing food increased from 2018 to 2019, particularly at moderate or severe levels.

==History==
Famines have been frequent in world history. Some have killed millions and substantially diminished the population of a large area. The most common causes have been drought and war, but the greatest famines in history were caused by economic policy. One economic policy example of famine was the Holodomor (Great Famine) induced by the Soviet Union&#x27;s communist economic policy resulting in 7–10 million deaths.

In the late 20th century the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen observed that &quot;there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem.&quot; While drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger famine conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur. The 20th century has examples of governments, such as Collectivization in the Soviet Union or the Great Leap Forward in the People&#x27;s Republic of China undermining the food security of their nations. Mass starvation is frequently a weapon of war, as in the blockade of Germany in World War I and World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic, and the blockade of Japan during World War I and World War II and in the Hunger Plan enacted by Nazi Germany.

==Pillars of food security==
The WHO states that three pillars that determine food security: food availability, food access, and food use and misuse. The FAO added a fourth pillar: the stability of the first three dimensions of food security over time. In 2009, the World Summit on Food Security stated that the &quot;four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization, and stability.&quot;
Two additional pillars of food security were recommended in 2020 by the High-Level Panel of Experts for the Committee on World Food Security: agency and sustainability.

===Availability===
Food availability relates to the supply of food through production, distribution, and exchange. Food production is determined by a variety of factors including land ownership and use; soil management; crop selection, breeding, and management; livestock breeding and management; and harvesting. Crop production can be affected by changes in rainfall and temperatures. The use of land, water, and energy to grow food often compete with other uses, which can affect food production. Land used for agriculture can be used for urbanization or lost to desertification, salinization or soil erosion due to unsustainable agricultural practices. Crop production is not required for a country to achieve food security. Nations do not have to have the natural resources required to produce crops to achieve food security, as seen in the examples of Japan and Singapore.

Because food consumers outnumber producers in every country, food must be distributed to different regions or nations.
Food distribution involves the storage, processing, transport, packaging, and marketing of food. Food-chain infrastructure and storage technologies on farms can also affect the amount of food wasted in the distribution process. Poor transport infrastructure can increase the price of supplying water and fertilizer as well as the price of moving food to national and global markets. Around the world, few individuals or households are continuously self-reliant on food. This creates the need for a bartering, exchange, or cash economy to acquire food. The exchange of food requires efficient trading systems and market institutions, which can affect food security. Per capita world food supplies are more than adequate to provide food security to all, and thus food accessibility is a greater barrier to achieving food security.

===Access===

Food access refers to the affordability and allocation of food, as well as the preferences of individuals and households. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that the causes of hunger and malnutrition are often not a scarcity of food but an inability to access available food, usually due to poverty. Poverty can limit access to food, and can also increase how vulnerable an individual or household is to food price spikes. Access depends on whether the household has enough income to purchase food at prevailing prices or has sufficient land and other resources to grow its food. Households with enough resources can overcome unstable harvests and local food shortages and maintain their access to food.

There are two distinct types of access to food: direct access, in which a household produces food using human and material resources, and economic access, in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere. Location can affect access to food and which type of access a family will rely on. The assets of a household, including income, land, products of labor, inheritances, and gifts can determine a household&#x27;s access to food. However, the ability to access sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services. Demographics and education levels of members of the household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household, which influences the type of food that is purchased. A household&#x27;s access to adequate nutritious food may not assure adequate food intake for all household members, as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each member of the household. The USDA adds that access to food must be available in socially acceptable ways, without, for example, resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies.

The monetary value of global food exports multiplied by 4.4 in nominal terms between 2000 and 2021, from US$380 billion in 2000 to US$1.66 trillion in 2021.

===Utilization===
The next pillar of food security is food utilization, which refers to the metabolism of food by individuals. Once the food is obtained by a household, a variety of factors affect the quantity and quality of food that reaches members of the household. To achieve food security, the food ingested must be safe and must be enough to meet the physiological requirements of each individual. Food safety affects food utilization, and can be affected by the preparation, processing, and cooking of food in the community and household.

Nutritional values of the household determine food choice, and whether food meets cultural preferences is important to utilization in terms of psychological and social well-being. Access to healthcare is another determinant of food utilization since the health of individuals controls how the food is metabolized. For example, intestinal parasites can take nutrients from the body and decrease food utilization. Sanitation can also decrease the occurrence and spread of diseases that can affect food utilization. Education about nutrition and food preparation can affect food utilization and improve this pillar of food security.

===Stability===
Food stability refers to the ability to obtain food over time. Food insecurity can be transitory, seasonal, or chronic. In transitory food insecurity, food may be unavailable during certain periods of time. At the food production level, natural disasters and drought result in crop failure and decreased food availability. Civil conflicts can also decrease access to food. Instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause transitory food insecurity. Other factors that can temporarily cause food insecurity are loss of employment or productivity, which can be caused by illness. Seasonal food insecurity can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production.

===Agency===
Agency refers to the capacity of individuals or groups to make their own decisions about what foods they eat, what foods they produce, how that food is produced, processed, and distributed within food systems, and their ability to engage in processes that shape food system policies and governance. This term shares similar values to those of another important concept, Food sovereignty.

===Sustainability===
Sustainability refers to the long-term ability of food systems to provide food security and nutrition in a way that does not compromise the economic, social, and environmental bases that generate food security and nutrition for future generations.

==Causes of food insecurity ==

=== High food prices ===
==== Pandemics and disease outbreaks ====

The World Food Programme has stated that pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic risk undermining the efforts of humanitarian and food security organizations to maintain food security. The International Food Policy Research Institute expressed concerns that the increased connections between markets and the complexity of food and economic systems could cause disruptions to food systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically affecting the poor. 

The Ebola outbreak in 2014 led to increases in the prices of staple foods in West Africa. Stringent lockdowns, travel restrictions, and disruptions to labor forces resulted in bottlenecks affecting the production and distribution of goods. Notably, the food supply chain experienced significant disruptions as the pandemic strained logistics, labor availability, and demand patterns. While progress in combating COVID-19 has provided some relief, the pandemic&#x27;s lasting effects persist, including shifts in consumer behavior and the ongoing necessity for health and safety measures.

==== Fossil fuel dependence ====

Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation.

Natural gas is a major feedstock for the production of ammonia, via the Haber process, for use in fertilizer production. The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth — it has been estimated that almost half the people on Earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use.

==== Agricultural diseases ====
Diseases affecting livestock or crops can have devastating effects on food availability especially if there are no contingency plans in place.
For example, Ug99, a lineage of wheat stem rust, which can cause up to 100% crop losses, is present in wheat fields in several countries in Africa and the Middle East and is predicted to spread rapidly through these regions and possibly further afield, potentially causing a wheat production disaster that would affect food security worldwide.

==== Disruption in global food supplies due to war ====
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global food supplies. The conflict has severely impacted food supply chains with noteworthy effects on production, sourcing, manufacturing, processing, logistics, and significant shifts in demand among nations reliant on imports from Ukraine. The European Union&#x27;s imposition of sanctions on Russia has added complexity to trade relations. In Asia and the Pacific, many of those regions&#x27; countries depend on the importation of basic food staples such as wheat and also fertilizer, with nearly 1.1 billion lacking a healthy diet caused by poverty and ever-increasing food prices.

=== Environmental degradation and overuse ===
==== Land degradation ====

Intensive farming often leads to a vicious cycle of exhaustion of soil fertility and a decline of agricultural yields. Other causes of land degradation include for example deforestation, overgrazing, and over-exploitation of vegetation for use. Approximately 40 percent of the world&#x27;s agricultural land is seriously degraded.

While the Green Revolution was critical in supporting a larger population through the mid-1900s to now by increasing crop yields, it has also resulted in environmental degradation particularly through land use, soil degradation, and deforestation. Over-farming of agricultural land due to the Green Revolution has caused contamination and erosion of soil, and a reduction in biodiversity due to pesticide usage (as well as deforestation). Malnutrition rates and food insecurity could increase again as land and water resources are depleted.

==== Water scarcity ====

Regionally, Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest number of water-stressed countries of any place on the globe, as of an estimated 800 million people who live in Africa, 300 million live in a water-stressed environment. It is estimated that by 2030, 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be living in areas of high water stress, which will likely displace anywhere between 24 million and 700 million people as conditions become increasingly unlivable. Because the majority of Africa remains dependent on an agricultural lifestyle and 80 to 90 percent of all families in rural Africa rely upon producing their food, water scarcity translates to a loss of food security.

==== Overfishing ====
The overexploitation of fish stocks can pose serious risks to food security. Risks can be posed both directly by overexploitation of food fish and indirectly through overexploitation of the fish that those food fish depend on for survival. In 2022 the United Nations called attention &quot;considerably negative impact&quot; on food security of the fish oil and fishmeal industries in West Africa.

===Food loss and waste===
Food waste may be diverted for alternative human consumption when economic variables allow for it. In the 2019 edition of the State of Food and Agriculture, FAO asserted that food loss and waste have potential effects on the four pillars of food security. However, the links between food loss and waste reduction and food security are complex, and positive outcomes are not always certain. Reaching acceptable levels of food security and nutrition inevitably implies certain levels of food loss and waste. Maintaining buffers to ensure food stability requires a certain amount of food to be lost or wasted. At the same time, ensuring food safety involves discarding unsafe food, which then is counted as lost or wasted, while higher-quality diets tend to include more highly perishable foods.

How the impacts on the different dimensions of food security play out and affect the food security of different population groups depends on where in the food supply chain the reduction in losses or waste takes place as well as on where nutritionally vulnerable and food-insecure people are located geographically.

=== Climate change ===
In 2023, climate change significantly impacted food security, with extreme weather events being primary drivers in 18 countries, affecting over 77 million people. The year marked the hottest on record, leading to severe climatic disturbances such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes. These events disrupted agriculture, damaged crops, and decreased food availability, underlining the crucial need for urgent global action to adapt to and mitigate climate impacts to protect food sources.

==== Effects ====
==== Multiple breadbasket failure ====
==Effects of food insecurity==

=== Social and economic impacts ===
Famine and hunger are both rooted in food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity translates into a high degree of vulnerability to famine and hunger; ensuring food security presupposes the elimination of that vulnerability.

Food insecurity can force individuals to undertake risky economic activities such as prostitution.

The International Monetary Fund cautioned in September 2022 that &quot;the impact of increasing import costs for food and fertilizer for those extremely vulnerable to food insecurity will add $9 billion to their balance of payments pressures – in 2022 and 2023.&quot; This would deplete countries&#x27; foreign reserves as well as their capacity to pay for food and fertilizer imports.&quot;

===Stunting and chronic nutritional deficiencies===

Many countries experience ongoing food shortages and distribution problems. These result in chronic and often widespread hunger amongst significant numbers of people. Human populations can respond to chronic hunger and malnutrition by decreasing body size, known in medical terms as stunting or stunted growth. This process starts &quot;in utero&quot; if the mother is malnourished and continues through approximately the third year of life. It leads to higher infant and child mortality, but at rates far lower than during famines. Once stunting has occurred, improved nutritional intake after the age of about two years is unable to reverse the damage. Severe malnutrition in early childhood often leads to defects in cognitive development. It, therefore, creates a disparity a between children who did not experience severe malnutrition and those who experience it.

Worldwide, the prevalence of child stunting was 21.3 percent in 2019, or 144 million children. Central Asia, Eastern Asia, and the Caribbean have the largest rates of reduction in the prevalence of stunting and are the only subregions on track to achieve the 2025 and 2030 stunting targets. Between 2000 and 2019, the global prevalence of child stunting declined by one-third.

Data from the 2021 FAO SOFI showed that in 2020, 22.0 percent (149.2 million) of children under 5 years of age were affected by stunting, 6.7 percent (45.4 million) were suffering from wasting and 5.7 percent (38.9 million) were overweight. FAO warned that the figures could be even higher due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Africa and Asia account for more than nine out of ten of all children with stunting, more than nine out of ten children with wasting, and more than seven out of ten children who are affected by being overweight worldwide.

===Mental health outcomes===
Food insecurity is one of the social determinants of mental health. A recent comprehensive systematic review showed that over 50 studies have shown that food insecurity is strongly associated with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. For depression and anxiety, food-insecure individuals have almost a threefold risk increase compared to food-secure individuals. Adolescents experiencing food insecurity are more likely to experience suicidal ideation, suicide planning and suicide attempts than those who are food-secure.  This is more common in countries where food insecurity is less common, potentially because it indicates a reduced standard of living and low social standing within that country.  Research has also found that food insecurity is linked to an increased risk of disordered eating behaviors. 

==Approaches to food security==
=== Agrifood systems resilience ===
Resilient agrifood systems can achieve food security. The resilience of agrifood systems refers to the capacity over time of agrifood systems, in the face of any disruption, to sustainably ensure availability of and access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for all, and sustain the livelihoods of agrifood systems&#x27; actors. Truly resilient agrifood systems must have a robust capacity to prevent, anticipate, absorb, adapt and transform in the face of any disruption, with the functional goal of ensuring food security and nutrition for all and decent livelihoods and incomes for agrifood systems&#x27; actors. Such resilience addresses all dimensions of food security, but focuses specifically on stability of access and sustainability, which ensure food security in both the short and the long term. Resilience-building involves preparing for disruptions, particularly those that cannot be anticipated, in particular through: diversity in domestic production, in imports, and in supply chains; robust food transport networks; and guaranteed continued access to food for all.

The FAO finds that there are six pathways to follow towards food systems transformation:

# integrating humanitarian, development and peacebuilding policies in conflict-affected areas;
# scaling up climate resilience across food systems;
# strengthening resilience of the most vulnerable to economic adversity;
# intervening along the food supply chains to lower the cost of nutritious foods;
# tackling poverty and structural inequalities, ensuring interventions are pro-poor and inclusive; and
# strengthening food environments and changing consumer behaviour to promote dietary patterns with positive impacts on human health and the environment.

===Approaches by FAO===
Over the last decade, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has proposed a &quot;twin track&quot; approach to fight food insecurity that combines sustainable development and short-term hunger relief. Development approaches include investing in rural markets and rural infrastructure. In general, FAO proposes the use of public policies and programs that promote long-term economic growth that will benefit the poor. To obtain short-term food security, vouchers for seeds, fertilizer, or access to services could promote agricultural production. The use of conditional or unconditional food or cash transfers is another approach promoted by FAO. Conditional transfers may include school feeding programs, while unconditional transfers could include general food distribution, emergency food aid or cash transfers. A third approach is the use of subsidies as safety nets to increase the purchasing power of households. FAO has stated that &quot;approaches should be human rights-based, target the poor, promote gender equality, enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty.&quot;

FAO has noted that some countries have been successful in fighting food insecurity and decreasing the number of people suffering from undernourishment. Bangladesh is an example of a country that has met the Millennium Development Goal hunger target. The FAO credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security. Irrigation systems were established through infrastructure development programs.

In 2020, FAO deployed intense advocacy to make healthy diets affordable as a way to reduce global food insecurity and save vast sums in the process. The agency said that if healthy diets were to become the norm, almost all of the health costs that can currently be blamed on unhealthy diets (estimated to reach US$1.3 trillion a year in 2030) could be offset; and that on the social costs of greenhouse gas emissions that are linked to unhealthy diets, the savings would be even greater (US$1.7 trillion, or over 70 percent of the total estimated for 2030).

FAO urged governments to make nutrition a central plank of their agricultural policies, investment policies and social protection systems. It also called for measures to tackle food loss and waste, and to lower costs at every stage of food production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing. Another FAO priority is for governments to secure better access to markets for small-scale producers of nutritious foods.

The World Summit on Food Security, held in Rome in 1996, aimed to renew a global commitment to the fight against hunger. The conference produced two key documents, the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action. The Rome Declaration called for the members of the United Nations to work to halve the number of chronically undernourished people on the Earth by 2015. The Plan of Action set several targets for government and non-governmental organizations for achieving food security, at the individual, household, national, regional, and global levels.

Another World Summit on Food Security took place at the FAO&#x27;s headquarters in Rome between November 16 and 18, 2009.

FAO has also created a partnership that will act through the African Union&#x27;s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the Right to Food into national legislation.

===Improving agricultural productivity to benefit the rural poor===

According to the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, a major study led by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), managing rainwater and soil moisture more effectively, and using supplemental and small-scale irrigation, hold the key to helping the greatest number of poor people. It has called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and runoff. Increased agricultural productivity enables farmers to grow more food, which translates into better diets and, under market conditions that offer a level playing field, into higher farm incomes.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) proposes several key steps to increasing agricultural productivity, which is in turn key to increasing rural income and reducing food insecurity. They include:
* Boosting agricultural science and technology. Current agricultural yields are insufficient to feed the growing populations. Eventually, the rising agricultural productivity drives economic growth.
* Securing property rights and access to finance
* Enhancing human capital through education and improved health
* Conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms and democracy and governance based on principles of accountability and transparency in public institutions and the rule of law are basic to reducing vulnerable members of society.
=== Development aid activities ===

In September 2022, the United States announced a $2.9 billion contribution to aid efforts of global food security at the UN General Assembly in New York. $2 billion will go to the U.S. Agency for International Development for its humanitarian assistance efforts around the world, along with $140 million for the agency&#x27;s Feed the Future Initiative. The United States Department of Agriculture will receive $220 million to fund eight new projects, all of which is expected to benefit nearly a million children residing in food-insecure countries in Africa and East Asia. The USDA will also receive another $178 million for seven international development projects to support U.S. government priorities on four continents.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is an agency of the United Nations that uses food aid to promote food security and eradicate hunger and poverty. In particular, the WFP provides food aid to refugees and to others experiencing food emergencies. It also seeks to improve nutrition and quality of life to the most vulnerable populations and promote self-reliance. An example of a WFP program is the &quot;Food For Assets&quot; program in which participants work on new infrastructure, or learn new skills, that will increase food security, in exchange for food.

In April 2012, the Food Assistance Convention was signed, the world&#x27;s first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 Copenhagen Consensus recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against malaria and AIDS.

===Alternative diets===
Food security could be increased by integrating alternative foods that can be grown in compact environments, that are resilient to pests and disease, and that do not require complex supply chains. Foods meeting these criteria include algae, mealworm, and fungi-derived mycoprotein. While unpalatable on their own to most people, such raw ingredients might be processed into more palatable foods.

With over 2000 identified edible insects, there are many options for consumption. Insects may provide a sustainable option for protein sources containing 13-77% protein by dry weight. The energy obtained by eating insects can be similar to other food sources like beef and chicken depending on what kind of insect is eaten. Insects may be a sustainable commercial farming option to support populations struggling with food security due to their nutrition and farming capacities, taking less room to cultivate than other protein sources.
=== Food Justice Movement ===
The Food Justice Movement is a multifaceted movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It has been described as a movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to environmental justice, improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities.

==By country==
===Afghanistan===
In Afghanistan, about 35.5% of households are food insecure (as of 2018). The prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting in children under five years of age is also very high. In October 2021, more than half of Afghanistan&#x27;s 39 million people faced an acute food shortage. On 11 November 2021, &quot;Human Rights Watch&quot; reported that Afghanistan is facing widespread famine due to collapsed economy and broken banking system. The UN World Food Program has also issued multiple warnings of worsening food insecurity.

=== Australia ===
In 2012, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) conducted a survey measuring nutrition, which included food security. It was reported that 4% of Australian households were food insecure. 1.5% of those households were severely food insecure. Additionally, the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS), reported that certain demographics are more vulnerable to being food insecure; such as indigenous, elderly, regional, and single-parent households. Financial issues were cited as the main cause of food insecurity.

Climate change may present future challenges for Australia regarding food security, as Australia already experiences extreme weather. Australia&#x27;s history in biofuel production and use of fertilizers has reduced the quality of the land. Increased extreme weather is projected to affect crops, livestock, and soil quality. Wheat production, one of Australia&#x27;s main food exports, is projected to decrease by 9.2% by 2030. Beef production is also expected to fall by 9.6%.

=== Canada ===
Since 2005, Canada has monitored the level of food insecurity by province and territory. Rates of food insecurity in Canada ranged from 11.1% in Québec to 57% in Nunavut as of a 2017-2018 survey. Of the 57% of household affected by food insecurity in Nunavut, almost half of them are severely food insecure. These rates of food security equal 4.4 million people, of which 1.2 million were under the age of 18. Some common co-occurring conditions were households with lower incomes, single-income, and renting rather than owning their home. Food insecurity is more prevalent in households that receive social assistance, Employment Insurance, and Worker&#x27;s Compensation, as well as in pension-reliant homes. People who identified as Indigenous or Black also face higher rates of food insecurity than those who identify otherwise.

Food insecurity has been associated with a poorer quality of diet including a significant difference in micronutrient intake which varies across age and sex. In a 2015 study, the caloric intake was higher in severely food insecure households however with fewer micronutrients indicating a shift towards less nutrient-dense food options. In addition to micronutrient deficiencies across all age groups, food insecurity is correlated with higher rates of chronic disease biomarkers. In Canada, food insecurity is associated with worse mental health and higher mortality rates.

=== China ===
The persistence of wet markets has been described as &quot;critical for ensuring urban food security,&quot; particularly in Chinese cities. The influence of wet markets on urban food security includes food pricing and physical accessibility.

Calling food waste &quot;shameful&quot;, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, launched the Clean Plate campaign. Xi stressed that there should be a sense of crisis regarding food security. In 2020, China witnessed a rise in food prices, due to the COVID-19 outbreak and mass flooding that wiped out the country&#x27;s crops, which made food security a priority for Xi. As part of its goals of ensuring food security, the Chinese Communist Party emphasizes agricultural research, including at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

=== Democratic Republic of Congo ===
In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), about 33% of households are food insecure, and nearly 60% in eastern provinces. Millions of DRC inhabitants are living below the poverty line, contributing to this widespread hunger in the country that in some cases is so severe, that families can&#x27;t afford to eat everyday. A study showed the correlation of food insecurity and its negative effects on at-risk HIV adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo, exacerbating the vulnerability of these populations even further.

The state of food insecurity in the DRC has been long prevalent, but worsened greatly following the Congolese Wars (1996–1998; 1998–2003). In 2002, about 80% of the population lived below the poverty line, and more than 90% of the rural population had no easy access to safe drinking water. This contributed to the food insecurity of the nation, in which chronic infant malnutrition was over 45% for children under 5 years old. The nation&#x27;s lack of access to markets, limited financial means, and low levels of food production have been other contributors to their poor levels of food security.

Furthermore, the nation has an influx of imported food products that are often of poor nutritional quality, but are placed at competitive prices that the nation can afford. This results in the majority of households turning to cheaper, high-calorie food products over more healthy, unaffordable, high-protein foods that are not as accessible to them. This then results in unbalanced and unhealthy diets that contribute to poor health outcomes for these populations. Furthermore, many urban areas are forced to turn to mainly consume bushmeat as their primary source of protein, because they cannot afford to access other types of safer, healthier and even more legal options.

=== Mexico ===
===Singapore===

Singapore’s population increased from just over 3 million to around 5.7 million people (as of 2019). Following their significant increase in population, Singapore then faced a significant decrease in agricultural land (from 25% allocated land in 1965 to less than 1% in 2014) making food production rates decline drastically. Due to the minimal amount of agricultural output, Singapore imports about 90% of their food. Singapore was rated as the top country in affordability, availability, quality, and safety. These conditions contribute to a high rate of food secure individuals, about 92.5% of the population have experienced no food security concerns. A challenge with this structure is that importing food leaves the country’s food supply chain vulnerable to price changes in the global food market from factors such as, disease (like Coronavirus) and climate change which can cause droughts and floods disrupting agriculture in countries like Thailand which Singapore relies on.

Singapore is implementing many different methods and techniques to increase internal agricultural output.

In 2019 the Singapore government launched the &quot;30 by 30&quot; program which aims to drastically reduce food insecurity through hydroponics and aquaculture.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, between a quarter and a third of households are food insecure. Following the COVID-19 lockdowns, child and household hunger have not decreased. In contrast, hunger has stabilized at a higher rate than pre-pandemic rates. This increase in hunger may be due to slow economic growth, low employment and a loss of government financial support following the pandemic. The social grants given by the government along with the child support grants, school food initiatives, and the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Programme have all been influential in lowering the food insecurity rate particularly before the Coronavirus outbreak.

===Sudan===
===United States===
===Uganda===
In 2022, 28% of Ugandan households experienced food insecurity. This insecurity has negative effects on HIV transmission and household stability.

Uganda faces challenges associated with food security related to agricultural soil management, forest destruction, and anthropogenic pressure on the land. This is an issue as agriculture is the main form of food acquisition in places such as Tororo and Busia. In these areas the 90% of families rely on farming so disruptions to their farming could increase their chances of economic instability and food insecurity. Many families report that lack of funds, disease, and lack of land, among other variables, are significant barriers to food security. In the wetlands system associated in Uganda, 93% of families are food insecure with 75% of inhabitants eating 2 meals and 8% eating only 1 meal a day. This was made worse by socioeconomic factors like disease (HIV/AIDS), poverty, and agricultural reasons like land degradation or management (regulation of food production using wetlands).

=== Yemen ===
Food insecurity is highly prevalent in Yemen, with 60% of the population being affected by agricultural decline. The Integrated Security Phase Classification system places 53% of Yemenis as at risk (36%) or as an emergency (17%). Between 23 and 30% of Yemenis must change their choice of food and compromise on the quality of their food to account for food shortages while 8 to 13% of Yemenis admit to decreasing the number of meals they eat. The state of nutrition is most dire for vulnerable populations like children who face developmental issues like stunting or wasting as a result of malnutrition. Over 462,000 Yemeni children are severely acutely malnourished which increases their risk of disease. In a 2019 study, children with severe acute malnutrition were reported to have an increased rate of measles, diarrhea, fever, and cough when compared to non-severely acutely malnourished children.

===Food security related UN days===
October 16 has been chosen as World Food Day, in honour of the date FAO was founded in 1945. On this day, FAO hosts a variety of events at its headquarters in Rome and around the world, as well as seminars with UN officials.

=== Human rights approach ===
The United Nations (UN) recognized the Right to Food in the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and has since said that it is vital for the enjoyment of all other rights.

===United Nations Goals===
The UN Millennium Development Goals were one of the initiatives aimed at achieving food security in the world. The first Millennium Development Goal states that the UN &quot;is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty&quot; by 2015. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, advocates for a multidimensional approach to food security challenges. This approach emphasizes the physical availability of food; the social, economic and physical access people have to food; and the nutrition, safety and cultural appropriateness or adequacy of food.

Multiple different international agreements and mechanisms have been developed to address food security. The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty is in the Sustainable Development Goals. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. Although there has been some progress, the world is not on track to achieve the global nutrition targets, including those on child stunting, wasting and overweight by 2030.

<text>University of Arizona Biosphere 2 is an American Earth system science research facility located in Oracle, Arizona. Its mission is to serve as a center for research, outreach, teaching, and lifelong learning about Earth, its living systems, and its place in the universe. It is a structure originally built to be an artificial, materially closed ecological system, or vivarium. It remains the largest closed ecological system ever created.

Constructed between 1987 and 1991, Biosphere 2 was originally meant to demonstrate the viability of closed ecological systems to support and maintain human life in outer space as a substitute for Earth&#x27;s biosphere. It was designed to explore the web of interactions within life systems in a structure with different areas based on various biological biomes. In addition to the several biomes and living quarters for people, there was an agricultural area and work space to study the interactions between humans, farming, technology and the rest of nature as a new kind of laboratory for the study of the global ecology. Its mission was a two-year closure experiment with a crew of eight humans. Long-term it was seen as a precursor to gaining knowledge about the use of closed biospheres in space colonization. As an experimental ecological facility it allowed the study and manipulation of a mini biospheric system without harming Earth&#x27;s biosphere.

Its seven biome areas were a rainforest, an ocean with a coral reef, a mangrove wetlands, a savannah grassland, a fog desert, and two anthropogenic biomes: a agricultural system and a human habitat with living spaces, laboratories and workshops. Below ground was an extensive part of the technical infrastructure. Heating and cooling water circulated through independent piping systems and passive solar input through the glass space frame panels covering most of the facility, and electrical power was supplied into Biosphere 2 from an onsite natural gas power plant.

Biosphere 2 was only used twice for its original intended purposes as a closed-system experiment: once from 1991 to 1993, and the second time from March to September 1994. Both attempts ran into problems including low amounts of food and oxygen, die-offs of many animals and plants included in the experiment (though this was anticipated since the project used a strategy of deliberately &quot;species-packing&quot; anticipating losses as the biomes developed), group dynamic tensions among the resident crew, outside politics, and a power struggle over management and direction of the project. The second closure experiment achieved total food sufficiency and did not require injection of oxygen.

In June 1994, during the middle of the second experiment, the managing company, Space Biosphere Ventures, was dissolved, and the facility was left in limbo. Columbia University assumed management of the facility in 1995 and used it to run experiments until 2003. It then appeared to be in danger of being demolished to make way for housing and retail stores, but was taken over for research by the University of Arizona in 2007. The University of Arizona took full ownership of the structure in 2011. Research continues at the facility while also being a place that is open to the public.

Biosphere 2 is one of two enclosed artificial ecosystems in the Americas that are open to the public, the other being the Montreal Biodome. 

== Planning and construction ==

The Biosphere 2 project was launched in 1984 by businessman and billionaire philanthropist Ed Bass and systems ecologist John P. Allen, with Bass providing US$150 million in funding until 1991. Bass and Allen had met in the 1970s at the Synergia Ranch, a counterculture community led by Allen, who advocated Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; concept and explored the idea of biospheres as a refuge from disasters such as nuclear war. Several other former members of Synergia Ranch also joined the Biosphere 2 project.

Construction was carried out between 1987 and 1991 by Space Biosphere Ventures, a joint venture whose principal officers were John P. Allen, inventor and executive chairman; Margaret Augustine, CEO; Marie Harding, vice-president of finance; Abigail Alling, vice president of research; Mark Nelson, director of space and environmental applications, William F. Dempster, director of system engineering, and Norberto Alvarez-Romo, vice president of mission control.

It was named &quot;Biosphere 2&quot; because it was meant to be the second fully self-sufficient biosphere, after the Earth itself (&quot;Biosphere 1&quot;).

== Location ==
The glass and spaceframe facility is located in Oracle, Arizona, at the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains, about 50 minutes north of Tucson. Its elevation is around above sea level.

== Engineering ==

The above-ground physical structure of Biosphere 2 was made of steel tubing and high-performance glass and steel frames. The frame and glazing materials were designed and made to specification by a firm run by a one-time associate of Buckminster Fuller, Peter Jon Pearce (Pearce Structures, Inc.). The window seals and structures had to be designed to be almost perfectly airtight, such that the air exchange would be extremely low, permitting tracking of subtle changes over time. The patented airtight sealing methods, developed by Pearce and William Dempster, achieved a leak rate of less than 10% per year. Without such tight closure, the slow decline of oxygen which occurred at a rate of less than % per month during the first two-year closure experiment might not have been detected.

During the day, the heat from the sun caused the air inside to expand and during the night it cooled and contracted. To avoid having to deal with the huge forces that maintaining a constant volume would create, the structure had large diaphragms kept in domes called &quot;lungs&quot; or variable volume structures.

Since opening a window was not an option, the structure also required a sophisticated system to regulate temperatures within desired parameters, which varied for the different biomic areas. Though cooling was the largest energy need, heating had to be supplied in the winter and closed loop pipes and air handlers were key parts of the energy system. An energy center on site provided electricity and heated and cooled water, employing natural gas and backup generators, ammonia chillers and water cooling towers.

== First mission ==

The first closed mission lasted from September 26, 1991, to September 26, 1993. The crew were: medical doctor and researcher Roy Walford, Jane Poynter, Taber MacCallum, Mark Nelson, Sally Silverstone, Abigail Alling, Mark Van Thillo, and Linda Leigh.

The agricultural system produced 83% of the total diet, which included crops of bananas, papayas, sweet potatoes, beets, peanuts, lablab and cowpea beans, rice, and wheat. Especially during the first year, the eight inhabitants reported continual hunger. Calculations indicated that Biosphere 2&#x27;s farm was among the highest producing in the world &quot;exceeding by more than five times that of the most efficient agrarian communities of Indonesia, southern China, and Bangladesh&quot;.

They consumed the same low-calorie, nutrient-dense diet that Roy Walford had studied in his research on extending lifespan through diet. Medical markers indicated the health of the crew during the two years was excellent. They showed the same improvement in health indices such as lowering of blood cholesterol, blood pressure, and enhancement of immune system. They lost an average of 16% of their pre-entry body weight before stabilizing and regaining some weight during their second year. Subsequent studies showed that the biospherians&#x27; metabolism became more efficient at extracting nutrients from their food as an adaptation to the low-calorie, high-nutrient diet.

Some of the domesticated animals that were included in the agricultural area during the first mission included: four African pygmy goat does and one billy; 35 hens and three roosters (a mix of Indian jungle fowl (&quot;Gallus gallus&quot;), Japanese silky bantam, and a hybrid of these); two sows and one boar Ossabaw dwarf pigs; and tilapia fish grown in a rice and azolla pond system originating millennia ago in China.
A strategy of &quot;species-packing&quot; was practiced to ensure that food webs and ecological function could be maintained if some species did not survive. The fog desert area became more chaparral in character due to condensation from the space frame. The savannah was seasonally active; its biomass was cut and stored by the crew as part of their management of carbon dioxide. Rainforest pioneer species grew rapidly, but trees there and in the savannah suffered from etiolation and weakness caused by lack of stress wood, normally created in response to winds in natural conditions. Corals reproduced in the ocean area, and crew helped maintain ocean system health by hand-harvesting algae from the corals, manipulating calcium carbonate and pH levels to prevent the ocean from becoming too acidic, and by installing an improved protein skimmer to supplement the algae turf scrubber system originally installed to remove excess nutrients. The mangrove area developed rapidly but with less understory than a typical wetland, possibly because of reduced light levels. Nevertheless, it was judged to be a successful analogue to the Everglades area of Florida where the mangroves and marsh plants were collected.

Biosphere 2, because of its small size and buffers, and concentration of organic materials and life, had greater fluctuations and more rapid biogeochemical cycles than are found in Earth&#x27;s biosphere. Most of the introduced vertebrate species and virtually all of the pollinating insects died, though there was reproduction of plants and animals. Insect pests, like cockroaches, flourished. A globally invasive tramp ant species, &quot;Paratrechina longicornis&quot; had come to dominate other ant species. The planned ecological succession in the rainforest and strategies to protect the area from harsh incident sunlight and salt aerosols from the ocean worked well, and a surprising amount of the original biodiversity persisted. Biosphere 2 in its early ecological development was likened to an island ecology.

===Group dynamics: psychology, conflict, and cooperation===
Much of the evidence for isolated human groups comes from psychological studies of scientists overwintering in Antarctic research stations. The study of this phenomenon is &quot;confined environment psychology&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; environmental psychology); according to Jane Poynter, it was known to be a challenge and crews often split into factions.

Before the first closure mission was half over, the group had split into two factions and, according to Poynter, people who had been intimate friends had become implacable enemies, barely on speaking terms. &quot;Appreciation of the value of biosphere interconnectedness and interdependency was appreciated as both an everyday beauty and a challenging reality,&quot; Walford later acknowledged, &quot;I don&#x27;t like some of them, but we were a hell of a team. That was the nature of the factionalism... but despite that, we ran the damn thing and we cooperated totally.&quot;

The factions inside the bubble formed from a rift and power struggle between the joint venture partners on how the science should proceed, as biospherics or as specialist ecosystem studies (perceived as reductionist). The faction that included Poynter felt strongly that increasing research should be prioritized over degree of closure. The other faction backed project management and the overall mission objectives. On February 14, a portion of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) resigned. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Now, the veneer of credibility, already bruised by allegations of tamper-prone data, secret food caches and smuggled supplies, has cracked ... the two-year experiment in self-sufficiency is starting to look less like science and more like a $150 million stunt.&quot; The SAC was dissolved because it had deviated from its mandate to review and improve scientific research and became involved in advocating management changes. Some SAC members chose to remain as consultants to Biosphere 2. The SAC&#x27;s recommendations in their report were implemented including a new Director of Research Jack Corliss, allowing import/export of scientific samples and equipment through the facility airlocks to increase research and decrease crew labor, and to generate the lacking formal research program. Some sixty-four projects were included in the research program that Walford and Alling spearheaded developing.
Undoubtedly the reduced oxygen and the calorie-restricted, nutrient-dense diet contributed to low morale. The Alling faction feared that the Poynter group were prepared to go so far as to import food, if it meant making them fitter to carry out research projects. They considered that would be a project failure by definition.

In November 1992, the hungry Biospherians began eating seed stocks that had not been grown inside the Biosphere 2. Poynter made Chris Helms, PR Director for the enterprise, aware of this. She was promptly dismissed by Margret Augustine, CEO of Space Biospheres Ventures, and told to come out of the biosphere. This order was, however, never carried out. Poynter writes that she simply decided to stay put, correctly reasoning that the order could not be enforced without effectively terminating the closure.

Isolated groups tend to attach greater significance to group dynamic and personal emotional fluctuations common in all groups. Some reports from polar station crews exaggerated psychological problems. Although some of the first closure team thought they were depressed, psychological examination of the biospherians showed no depression and fit the explorer/adventurer profile, with both women and men scoring very similarly to astronauts.

===Challenges===

Among the problems and miscalculations encountered in the first mission were unanticipated condensation making the &quot;desert&quot; too wet, population explosions of greenhouse ants and cockroaches, morning glories overgrowing the rainforest area blocking out other plants, and less sunlight (40–50% of outside light) entering the facility than originally anticipated. Biospherians intervened to control invasive plants when needed to preserve biodiversity, functioning as &quot;keystone predators&quot;. In addition, construction itself was a challenge; for example, it was difficult to manipulate the bodies of water to have waves and tidal changes.

There was controversy when the public learned that the project had allowed an injured member to leave and return, carrying new material inside. The team claimed the only new supplies brought in were plastic bags, but others accused them of bringing food and other items. More criticism was raised when it was learned that, likewise, the project injected oxygen in January 1993 to make up for a failure in the balance of the system that resulted in the amount of oxygen steadily declining. Some thought that these criticisms ignored that Biosphere 2 was an experiment where the unexpected would occur, adding to knowledge of how complex ecologies develop and interact, not a demonstration where everything was known in advance. H. T. Odum noted: &quot;The management process during 1992–1993 using data to develop theory, test it with simulation, and apply corrective actions was in the best scientific tradition. Yet some journalists crucified the management in the public press, treating the project as if it was an Olympic contest to see how much could be done without opening the doors&quot;.

The oxygen inside the facility, which began at 20.9%, fell at a steady pace and after 16 months was down to 14.5%. This is equivalent to the oxygen availability at an elevation of . Since some biospherians were starting to have symptoms like sleep apnea and fatigue, Walford and the medical team decided to boost oxygen with injections in January and August 1993. The oxygen decline and minimal response of the crew indicated that changes in air pressure are what trigger human adaptation responses. These studies enhanced the biomedical research program.
Managing levels was a particular challenge. Daily fluctuation of carbon dioxide dynamics was typically 600 ppm because of the strong drawdown during sunlight hours by plant photosynthesis, followed by a similar rise during the nighttime when system respiration dominated. As expected, there was also a strong seasonal signature to levels, with wintertime levels as high as 4,000–4,500 ppm and summertime levels near 1,000 ppm.

The crew worked to manage the by occasionally turning on a scrubber, after realizing that activating and de-activating the desert and savannah through control of irrigation water, cutting and storing biomass to sequester carbon, and utilizing all potential planting areas with fast-growing species to increase system photosynthesis, wouldn&#x27;t be enough to sustain human life. In November 1991, investigative reporting in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; alleged that the crew had secretly installed the scrubber device, and claimed that this violated Biosphere 2&#x27;s advertised goal of recycling all materials naturally. Others pointed out there was nothing secret about the carbon dioxide device and it constituted another technical system augmenting ecological processes. The carbon precipitator could reverse the chemical reactions and thus release the stored carbon dioxide in later years when the facility might need additional carbon.

The soils were selected to have enough carbon to provide for the plants of the ecosystems to grow from infancy to maturity, a plant mass increase calculated to be . The release rate of that soil carbon as carbon dioxide by respiration of soil microbes was an unknown that the Biosphere 2 experiment was designed to reveal. Subsequent research showed that Biosphere 2&#x27;s farm soils had reached a more stable ratio of carbon and nitrogen, lowering the rate of release, by 1998.

The respiration rate was faster than the photosynthesis (possibly in part due to relatively low light penetration through the glazed structure and the fact that Biosphere 2 started with a small but rapidly increasing plant biomass) resulting in a slow decrease of oxygen. A mystery accompanied the oxygen decline: the corresponding increase in carbon dioxide did not appear. This concealed the underlying process until an investigation by Jeff Severinghaus and Wallace Broecker of Columbia University&#x27;s Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory using isotopic analysis showed that carbon dioxide was reacting with exposed concrete inside Biosphere 2 to form calcium carbonate in a process called carbonatation, thereby sequestering both carbon and oxygen.

==Second mission==

After Biosphere 2&#x27;s first mission, extensive research and system improvements were undertaken, including sealing concrete to prevent the uptake of carbon dioxide. The second mission began on March 6, 1994, with an announced run of ten months. The crew was Norberto Alvarez-Romo (Capt.), John Druitt, Matt Finn, Pascale Maslin, Charlotte Godfrey, Rodrigo Romo and Tilak Mahato. The second crew achieved complete sufficiency in food production.

On April 1, 1994, a severe dispute within the management team led to the ousting of the on-site management by federal marshals serving a restraining order, and financier Ed Bass hired Steve Bannon, then-manager of the Bannon &amp; Co. investment banking team from Beverly Hills, California, to run Space Biospheres Ventures. The project was put into receivership and an outside management team was installed for the receiver to turn around the floundering project. The reason for the dispute was threefold. Mismanagement of the mission had caused terrible publicity, financial mismanagement and lack of research. People alleged gross financial mismanagement of the project, leading to a loss of $25 million in fiscal year 1992. Some crew members and staff were concerned about Bannon, who had previously investigated cost overruns at the site; two former Biosphere 2 crew members flew back to Arizona to protest the hire and broke into the compound to warn the crew members that Bannon and the new management would jeopardize their safety.

At 3 a.m. on April 5, 1994, Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo, members of the first crew, allegedly vandalized the project from outside, opening one double-airlock door and three single door emergency exits, leaving them open for about 15 minutes. Five panes of glass were also broken. Alling later told the Chicago Tribune that she &quot;considered the Biosphere to be in an emergency state ... In no way was it sabotage. It was my responsibility.&quot; About 10% of the Biosphere&#x27;s air was exchanged with the outside during this time, according to systems analyst Donella Meadows, who received a communication from Alling saying that she and Van Thillo judged it their ethical duty to give those inside the choice of continuing with the drastically changed human experiment or leaving, as they didn&#x27;t know what the crew had been told of the new situation. &quot;On April 1, 1994, at approximately 10 AM ... limousines arrived on the biosphere site ... with two investment bankers hired by Mr. Bass ... They arrived with a temporary restraining order to take over direct control of the project ... With them were 6-8 police officers hired by the Bass organization ... They immediately changed locks on the offices ... All communication systems were changed (telephone and access codes), and [we] were prevented from receiving any data regarding safety, operations, and research of Biosphere 2.&quot; Alling emphasized several times in her letter that the &quot;bankers&quot; who suddenly took over &quot;knew nothing technically or scientifically, and little about the biospherian crew&quot;.

Four days later, the captain Norberto Alvarez-Romo (by then married to Biosphere 2 chief executive Margaret Augustine) precipitously left the Biosphere for a &quot;family emergency&quot; after his wife&#x27;s suspension. He was replaced by Bernd Zabel, who had been nominated as captain of the first mission but who was replaced at the last minute. Two months later, Matt Smith replaced Matt Finn.

The ownership and management company Space Biospheres Ventures was dissolved on June 1, 1994. This left the scientific and business management of the mission to the interim turnaround team, who had been contracted by the financial partner, Decisions Investment Co.

Mission 2 was ended prematurely on September 6, 1994. No further total system science has emerged from Biosphere 2 as the facility was changed by Columbia University from a closed ecological system to a &quot;flow-through&quot; system where could be manipulated at desired levels.

Steve Bannon left Biosphere 2 after two years, but his departure was marked by an &quot;abuse of process&quot; civil lawsuit filed against Space Biosphere Ventures by the former crew members who had broken in. Leading managers of Biosphere 2 from the original founding group stated both abusive behaviour by Bannon and others, and that the bankers&#x27; actual goal was to destroy the experiment. During a 1996 trial, Bannon testified that he had called one of the plaintiffs, Abigail Alling, a &quot;self-centered, deluded young woman&quot; and a &quot;bimbo&quot;. He also testified that when the woman submitted a five-page complaint outlining safety problems at the site, he promised to shove the complaint &quot;down her throat&quot;. Bannon attributed this to &quot;hard feelings and broken dreams&quot;. At the end of the trial, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered Space Biosphere Ventures to pay them $600,000.

== Science ==

A special issue of the &quot;Ecological Engineering&quot; journal edited by Marino and Howard T. Odum and published in 1999 as &quot;Biosphere 2: Research Past and Present&quot; represents the most comprehensive assemblage of collected papers and findings from Biosphere 2. The papers range from calibrated models that describe the system metabolism, hydrologic balance, and heat and humidity, to papers that describe rainforest, mangrove, ocean, and agronomic system development in this carbon dioxide-rich environment. Though several dissertations and many scientific papers used data from the early closure experiments at Biosphere 2, much of the original data has never been analyzed and is unavailable or lost, perhaps due to scientific politics and in-fighting.

Science historian Rebecca Redier has claimed that because Biosphere 2&#x27;s creators were perceived as outsiders to academic science, the project was scrutinized but poorly understood in the media, and that this scrutiny ceased after Columbia University assumed management, because it was assumed they were &quot;proper&quot; scientists.

=== Praise and criticism ===

One view of Biosphere 2 was that it was &quot;the most exciting scientific project to be undertaken in the United States since President John F. Kennedy launched us toward the moon&quot;. Others called it &quot;New Age drivel masquerading as science&quot;. John Allen and Roy Walford did have mainstream credentials. John Allen held a degree in Metallurgical-Mining Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines, and an MBA from the Harvard Business School. Roy Walford received his doctorate of medicine from the University of Chicago and taught at UCLA as a Professor of Pathology for 35 years. Mark Nelson obtained his Ph.D. in 1998 under Professor H.T. Odum in ecological engineering further developing the constructed wetlands used to treat and recycle sewage in Biosphere 2, to coral reef protection along the Yucatán coast where the corals were collected. Linda Leigh obtained her PhD with a dissertation on biodiversity and the Biosphere 2 rainforest working with Odum. Abigail Alling, Mark van Thillo and Sally Silverstone helped start the Biosphere Foundation where they worked on coral reef and marine conservation and sustainable agricultural systems. Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum co-founded Paragon Space Development Corporation which has studied the first mini-closed system and the first full animal life cycle in space and assisted in setting world records in high altitude descents.

Questioning the credentials of the participants, Marc Cooper wrote in 1991 that &quot;the group that built, conceived, and directs the Biosphere project is not a group of high-tech researchers on the cutting edge of science but a clique of recycled theater performers that evolved out of an authoritarian—and decidedly non-scientific—personality cult&quot;. He was referring to the Synergia Ranch in New Mexico, where indeed many of the Biospherians did practice theater under John Allen&#x27;s leadership, and began to develop the ideas behind Biosphere 2. They also founded the Institute of Ecotechnics.

One of their own scientific consultants was earlier critical. Ghillean Prance, director of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, designed the rainforest biome inside the Biosphere. Although he later changed his opinion, acknowledging the unique scope of this experiment and contributed to its success as a consultant, in a 1983 interview (8 years before the start of the experiment), Prance said, &quot;I was attracted to the Institute of Ecotechnics because funds for research were being cut and the institute seemed to have a lot of money which it was willing to spend freely. Along with others, I was ill-used. Their interest in science is not genuine. They seem to have some sort of secret agenda, they seem to be guided by some sort of religious or philosophical system.&quot; Prance went on in the 1991 newspaper interview to say &quot;they are visionaries ... And maybe to fulfill their vision they have become somewhat cultlike. But they are not a cult, per se ... I am interested in ecological restoration systems. And I think all sorts of scientific things can come of this experiment, far beyond the space goal ... When they came to me with this new project, they seemed so well organized, so inspired, I simply decided to forget the past. You shouldn&#x27;t hold their past against them.&quot;

Poynter in her memoir rebuts the critique that because some of the creative team of Biosphere 2 were not credentialed scientists, the results of the endeavor are invalid. &quot;Some reporters hurled accusations that we were unscientific. Apparently because many of the SBV managers were not themselves degreed scientists, this called into question the entire validity of the project, even though some of the world&#x27;s best scientists were working vigorously on the project&#x27;s design and operation. The critique was not fair. Since leaving Biosphere 2, I have run a small business for ten years that sent experiments on the shuttle and to the space station, and is designing life support systems for the replacement shuttle and future moon base. I do not have a degree, not even an MBA from Harvard, as John [Allen] had. I hire scientists and top engineers. Our company&#x27;s credibility is not called into question because of my credentials: we are judged on the quality of our work&quot;. H.T. Odum noted that mavericks and outsiders have often contributed to the development of science: &quot;The original management of Biosphere 2 was regarded by many scientists as untrained for lack of scientific degrees, even though they had engaged in a preparatory study program for a decade, interacting with the international community of scientists including the Russians involved with closed systems. The history of science has many examples where people of atypical background open science in new directions, in this case implementing mesocosm organization and ecological engineering with fresh hypotheses&quot;.

In its report of August 1992, the Biosphere 2 Science Advisory Committee, chaired by Tom Lovejoy of the Smithsonian Institution, reported: &quot;The committee is in agreement that the conception and construction of Biosphere 2 were acts of vision and courage. The scale of Biosphere 2 is unique and Biosphere 2 is already providing unexpected scientific results not possible through other means (notably the documented, unexpected decline in atmospheric oxygen levels.) Biosphere 2 will make important scientific contributions in the fields of biogeochemical cycling, the ecology of closed ecological systems, and restoration ecology.&quot; Columbia University assembled outside scientists to evaluate the potential of the facility after they took over management, and concluded the following: &quot;A group of world-class scientists got together and decided the Biosphere 2 facility is an exceptional laboratory for addressing critical questions relative to the future of Earth and its environment.&quot;

==Management by Columbia University==
In December 1995, the Biosphere 2 owners transferred management to Columbia University of New York City. Columbia ran Biosphere 2 as a research site and campus until 2003. Subsequently, management reverted to the owners.

In 1996, Columbia University changed the virtually airtight, materially closed structure designed for closed system research, to a &quot;flow-through&quot; system, and halted closed system research. They manipulated carbon dioxide levels for global warming research, and injected desired amounts of carbon dioxide, venting as needed. During Columbia&#x27;s tenure, students from Columbia and other colleges and universities would often spend one semester at the site.

Research during Columbia&#x27;s tenure demonstrated the devastating impacts on coral reefs from elevated atmospheric and acidification that will result from continued global climate change. Frank Press, former president of the National Academy of Sciences, described these interactions between atmosphere and ocean, taking advantage of the highly controllable ocean mesocosm of Biosphere 2, as the &quot;first unequivocal experimental confirmation of the human impact on the planet&quot;.

Studies in Biosphere 2&#x27;s terrestrial biomes showed that a saturation point was reached with elevated beyond which they are unable to uptake more. The studies&#x27; authors noted that the striking differences between the Biosphere 2 rainforest and desert biomes in their whole system responses &quot;illustrates the importance of large-scale experimental research in the study of complex global change issues&quot;.

== Site sold ==

In January 2005, Decisions Investments Corporation, owner of Biosphere 2, announced that the project&#x27;s campus was for sale. They preferred a research use to be found for the complex but were not excluding buyers with different intentions, such as big universities, churches, resorts, and spas. In June 2007, the site was sold for $50 million to CDO Ranching &amp; Development, L.P. 1,500 houses and a resort hotel were planned, but the main structure was still to be available for research and educational use.

== Acquisition by University of Arizona ==

On June 26, 2007, the University of Arizona announced it would take over research at the Biosphere 2. The announcement ended fears that the structure would be demolished. University officials said private gifts and grants enabled them to cover research and operating costs for three years with the possibility of extending funding for ten years. It was extended for ten years, and engaged in research projects including research into the terrestrial water cycle and how it relates to ecology, atmospheric science, soil geochemistry, and climate change. One of these gifts in 2009 included 470 photovoltaic solar panels added to the site. In June 2011, the university announced that it would assume full ownership of Biosphere 2, effective July 1.

CDO Ranching &amp; Development donated the land, Biosphere buildings and several other support and administrative buildings. In 2011, the Philecology Foundation (a nonprofit research foundation founded by Ed Bass) pledged US$20 million for the ongoing science and operations. In 2017, Ed Bass donated another $30 million to the University of Arizona in support of Biosphere 2, endowing two academic positions and setting up the &quot;Philecology Biospheric Research Endowment Fund&quot;.

Science camps are also held on the premises. These have included a week-long &#x27;space camp&#x27; for university undergraduates, and overnight camps for school students. In 2011 it was reported that there were an average of 100,000 visitors per year visiting the Biosphere 2 campus.

==Later research==

There are many small-scale research projects at Biosphere 2, as well as several large-scale research projects including:
* the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO), a project which uses 1,800 sensors to monitor millions of pounds of abiotic volcanic rock to track how this nonliving soil slowly develops over several years into a rich soil which is able to support microbial and vascular plant life. Structurally, this involved building three large steel-framed &quot;hillsides&quot; inside the pre-existing domes as the world&#x27;s largest weighing lysimeter, with design and implementation construction constrained by the limited accessibility into the existing structure.
* the Lunar Greenhouse, a second prototype of the Controlled Environment Agriculture Center which seeks to understand how to grow vegetables on the Moon or Mars by developing a bioregenerative life support system which recycles and purifies water through plant transpiration.
* a vertical farming project to be built in Biosphere 2&#x27;s west lung, in collaboration with the private company Civic Farms, in an effort to develop an indoor plant growth cycle with LED lamps configured to specific wavelengths aimed at increasing water efficiency, producing zero farm runoff, with no pests or pesticides, and zero effect from external weather conditions.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, a 1996 comedy film based on Biosphere 2
* &quot;The Terranauts&quot;, a 2016 novel based on Biosphere 2
* &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot;, a 2020 documentary film on Biosphere 2

<text>USS &quot;Shiloh&quot; (CG-67) is a guided missile cruiser of the United States Navy, named in remembrance of the Battle of Shiloh during the American Civil War. She was built at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine.

With her guided missiles and guns, she is capable of facing and defeating threats in the air, on or under the sea, and ashore. She also carries two Seahawk LAMPS multi-purpose helicopters, mainly for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).

==History==
===1990s===
On 3 September 1996, while in the carrier battle group, &quot;Shiloh&quot; launched six Tomahawk cruise missiles in Operation Desert Strike against Iraq.
===2000s===
She deployed with the Battle Group again in July 2002, and was among the first cruisers to launch missiles in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In March 2003 &quot;Shiloh&quot; was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three. The &quot;Shiloh&quot; returned to her homeport San Diego, California on 25 April 2003, ending an unusually long nine-month deployment.

In January 2005, she participated in Operation Unified Assistance, rendering aid to those who suffered from the 26 December 2004 tsunami off the coast of Aceh, Indonesia. &quot;Shiloh&quot; was one of the first American ships to arrive on scene.

On 22 June 2006, a Standard Missile Three (or SM-3) launched from &quot;Shiloh&quot; intercepted a multi-stage ballistic missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility at Barking Sands, Hawaii.

In August 2006, she arrived on station at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan, replacing , as part of a joint U.S.-Japanese ballistic missile defense program.

On 8 July 2009, Petty Officer 1st Class Christopher Geathers fell from the ship&#x27;s fantail into Tokyo Bay while rigging shore power cables. A two-and-a-half-day search failed to locate Geathers and he was declared missing and later was declared dead. A Navy investigation, led by Rear Admiral Kevin Donegan, commander of Task Force 70, found that the accident was preventable, in part because &quot;Shiloh&quot; personnel had observed Geathers working without proper safety equipment, but had failed to intervene. Nevertheless, the report did not recommend disciplinary action against any of the ship&#x27;s crewmembers.

===2010s===
In June 2017, a gas turbine systems technician named Peter Mims thought to have been lost at sea was found after seven days hiding in the engine room. Following the Mims incident, several sailors contacted the &quot;Navy Times&quot; about severe morale problems on the ship to which they attributed the Mims incident. The &quot;Navy Times&quot; requested &quot;command climate surveys&quot; through a Freedom of Information Act request.

These surveys, completed voluntarily by sailors on the ship, reported extensive morale problems universally blamed on the CO, Captain Adam M. Aycock. Among the complaints were widespread depression and suicidal tendencies, a dysfunctional ship that sailors felt was ill-prepared for combat, an overworked and deeply stressed crew, and a constant worry of extreme punishment for minor infractions. Sailors were dismayed that despite a significant number of the ship&#x27;s crew filing severely critical complaints of Aycock&#x27;s leadership in the command climate surveys, the only action taken by the Navy was to counsel him. Capt. Aycock was relieved of command after completing his full 26-month tour.

===2020s===

In 2020, a US Navy budget plan proposed putting &quot;Shiloh,&quot; as well as her sisters , , and , on a path to early decommissioning, as they had not been modernized.

In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2024.

In the US Navy&#x27;s 2024 proposed budget, presented in 2023, &quot;Shiloh&quot; was proposed for retirement. Navy Undersecretary Erik Raven stated that this was due to the ship&#x27;s &quot;material condition, life remaining, cost, ... time to upgrade ... and the warfighting value.&quot;

September 2023, USS &quot;Shiloh&quot; departs Yokosuka, Japan after 17 years of forward-deployed service. She will be homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. &quot;Shiloh&quot; is projected to be inactivated during FY2025.

<text>Carrier Strike Group 9 (CSG-9 or CARSTRKGRU 9) is a U.S. Navy carrier strike group. Commander Carrier Strike Group 9 (COMCARSTRKGRU 9 or CCSG 9) is responsible for unit-level training, integrated training, and material readiness for the ships and aviation squadrons assigned to the group. The group reports to Commander, U.S. Third Fleet, which also supervises its pre-deployment training and certification that includes Composite Unit Training Exercises.

It is currently assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier is the group&#x27;s current flagship. Other group units include Carrier Air Wing 11, the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; (CG-70), and the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer&#x27;s USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; (DDG-56), USS Halsey (DDG-97), and the USS &quot;Daniel Inouye&quot; (DDG-118).

The strike group traces its history to Cruiser-Destroyer Group 3, created on 30 June 1973, by the re-designation of Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 11. From 2004, the strike group has made multiple Middle East deployments providing air forces over Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as conducting Maritime Security Operations. The strike group received the Humanitarian Service Medal in recognition of its disaster relief efforts in Indonesia during Operation Unified Assistance in 2004–05.

==Historical background==
 flew the flag of the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 11 from 1 August to 11 November 1962.

Effective 30 June 1973, Commander Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 11 was re-designated as Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three (CCDG-3). was part of Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three in 1975. In 1978, the Group directed Destroyer Squadron 7, Destroyer Squadron 17, and Destroyer Squadron 27 (Naval Reserve Force), all at San Diego. On 10 December 1981, the group staff embarked on board the aircraft carrier to prepare for its first Carrier Battle Group deployment. Since that date, deployments have been made on the , , , and .

Rear Admiral Jonathan Howe commanded the group in 1984–86. During 1986, &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s battle group deployment was directed by Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three.

In early 1991, Rear Admiral P. M. Quast, commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three, led Battle Group Bravo on deployment to the Middle East. The group consisted of USS &quot;Nimitz&quot;, USS &quot;Texas&quot;, USS &quot;Rentz&quot;, , , , and , along with commander, Destroyer Squadron 21 and Carrier Air Wing Nine embarked in &quot;Nimitz&quot;.

In April 1992, the Navy implemented the &#x27;core battle group&#x27; concept. From this point each carrier battle group was planned to consist of an aircraft carrier; an embarked carrier air wing; cruisers, destroyers, and frigates; and two nuclear-powered attack submarines. This reorganization set off a round of ship arrivals and reassignments for the group. From April 1992 the group was assigned as permanent Immediate Superior in Command for , , and . was assigned to CCDG-3, but was decommissioned in January 1994. In August 1992, and Carrier Air Wing Fourteen were added, and CCDG-3 took on the additional title of Commander, Carl Vinson Battle Group. In October 1992, Surface Squadron 5 was redesignated Destroyer Squadron 5 and assigned under CCDG-3. The addition of , , , and rounded out the Vinson Battle Group&#x27;s forces. In December 1992, two submarines, and were added. joined the group in March 1993 and joined in September 1994.

Following this round of reassignments, Polmar reported in 1993 that the group had the following structure:
;Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three, late 1992
The group completed a very successful deployment to the Persian Gulf in August 1994.
In January 1996, the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Battle Group was redesignated the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Task Group, and Destroyer Squadron 5 was reassigned to Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific in Hawaii on 1 February 1996. The Carl Vinson Task Group successfully completed all predeployment examinations and deployed in May 1996 with USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, , , , , , , , and Carrier Air Wing Fourteen.

In June 1998 CCDG-3 deployed to the Persian Gulf. The deployment was the first on board the USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. On 20 August 1998, the group took part in Operation Infinite Reach, launching Tomahawk cruise missiles against the Sudanese Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory. This factory was suspected of assisting Osama bin Laden in making chemical weapons. The Battle Group also launched a second wave of Tomahawk cruise missiles against Bin Laden&#x27;s terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. These cruise missile strikes were ordered by President Bill Clinton 13 days after terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Rear Admiral Kevin Green transferred command of the group to incoming Rear Adm. Phillip Balisle on 3 December 1999, aboard the flagship &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot;

In 2002, the battle group deployed to the Persian Gulf to fly operations over Afghanistan the group carried out combat operations against Iraqi military forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; Carrier Battle Group received a Navy Unit Commendation for its support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Iraqi Freedom during the period of 1 September 2001 to 30 April 2003, completing of an overseas deployment of 290 days. The Battle Group received its second NUC as part of the U.S. Fifth Fleet&#x27;s battle/strike force, Task Force 50, during August 1998, and it received its third NUC for operations between 4 March to 1 May 2003.

The battle group also received a Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for its support of Operation Southern Watch during the period of 11 June to 11 December 1998, in which was also included its support of Operation Infinite Reach. The Battle Group received a second MUC for its operations during the period of 1 January 1999 to 10 September 2001, including OSW air combat operations.

On 1 October 2004, Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three was re-designated as Carrier Strike Group 9.

==Command structure==
When deployed overseas, the strike group comes under the command of the numbered fleet in whose area it is operating (Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, or Seventh Fleets). When deployed like this, the group utilizes a task force or task group designator, for example, Task Group 50.1 in the Fifth Fleet area.

Group commanders since 2004 have been:
==Operational history==

===2004–2009 operations===

Between 2004 and 2009, the strike group completed three Western Pacific deployments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the War in Iraq, and the War in Afghanistan, as well as providing support for regional Maritime Security Operations. Additionally, the group also participated in such major military exercises as RSOI/Foal Eagle 2006, Valiant Shield, and RIMPAC 2006, as well as Operation Unified Assistance, the U.S. military response to the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In recognition of its disaster-relief mission to Indonesia, the group received the Humanitarian Service Medal.
During its 2004–2005 deployment, Carrier Strike Group 9 executed 4400 fixed-wing sorties and completed 4455 flight deck landings (traps) for a total of 7588 flight hours. Also, the group executed 1518 rotary-wing sorties for a total of 4401 flight hours, including flying 1737 humanitarian relief missions in support of Operation Unified Assistance (&quot;pictured&quot;) between 26 December 2004 and 3 February 2005 following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The strike group received the Humanitarian Service Medal in recognition of its disaster relief efforts during this operation. Finally, helicopter squadron HSL-47 was the first LAMPS helicopter squadron deployed in its entirety on board an aircraft carrier, with the squadron providing LAMPS detachments to the other ships within the strike group while being supported by the carrier&#x27;s aviation facilities.

During its 2006 deployment, the strike group participated in three major exercises, Foal Eagle, Valiant Shield and Exercise RIMPAC, as well as several passing exercises and port visits. Carrier Air Wing Two flew 7,871 sorties, with a total of 7,578 catapult launches from the flight deck of the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. Also, on 15 April 2006, squadron HSL-47 helicopters and the guided-missile destroyer provided aid to a fishing vessel in distress while operating in the South China Sea.

During its 2008 deployment, the strike group operated in the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea. It launched many sorties supporting U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2) flew approximately 7,100 sorties, totaling more than 22,000 flight hours, which included 2,307 combat sorties that dropped 255,963 pounds (116,102,863.8 kg) of ordnance. Also, on 9 May, while operating with Combined Task Force 150, the guided-missile destroyer assisted a disabled dhow by towing it from the Gulf of Aden to Mukalla, Yemen.

The strike group&#x27;s Composite Unit Training Exercise included Mobile Security Squadron 2 (MSRON-2), Helicopter Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (HVBSS) Team 1, a first for West Coast-based U.S. Navy ships. The Team specializes in boarding non-compliant ships at sea in the dead of night, detaining the crew if necessary, and identifying suspected terrorists or subjects of interest, using the element of surprise afforded by helicopter insertion and night vision equipment. MSRON-2 HVBSS Team 1 was established in 2004 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, and it was the first team of its kind to reach operational status.

On 26 March 2007, Rear Admiral Scott R. Van Buskirk took command of the group, becoming only the second former nuclear submarine commanding officer to lead a carrier strike group. Admiral Van Buskirk subsequently commanded the U.S. Seventh Fleet and lead U.S. naval forces during Operation Tomodachi, providing assistance to Japan following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

===2010–2011 deployment===

On 11 September 2010, the strike group departed Naval Base San Diego, for its 2010 deployment under the command of Rear Admiral Mark D. Guadagnini. While en route, the strike group executed carrier qualifications and anti-piracy training, as well as anti-submarine warfare exercises off Guam with the attack submarine . On 25 September 2010, the strike group enter the U.S. Seventh Fleet area of responsibility. On 8 October 2010, the strike group paid its first foreign port call at Port Klang, Malaysia, which was followed by a multi-unit ASW exercises held on 23 October.

On 17 October 2010, the strike group arrived in the U.S. Fifth Fleet area, joining Carrier Strike Group Ten as part of Task Force 50 (&quot;pictured&quot;). For long-range air combat missions over Afghanistan, U.S. Air Force KC-135 and KC-10s provided aerial tanker support. The French carrier task group led by the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; joined the strike group operating in the Persian Gulf (&quot;pictured&quot;). On 18 November 2010, the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; hosted seven ambassadors during a port visit to Manama, Bahrain, and on 6 December 2010, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates visited the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; while operating in the Arabian Sea. A total of 999 War in Afghanistan-related sorties and 76 Operation New Dawn-related sorties were flown during the 2010–2011 Western Pacific deployment. On 28 December, with the carrier strike group operating in the Arabian Sea, Carrier Air Wing Two flew its 1000th sortie, amassing thus far a total of more than 5,884 hours flown supporting Afghanistan operations during this Western Pacific deployment. Carrier Strike Group Nine completed its final air operations over Afghanistan on 3 February 2011. Since 20 October 2010, Carrier Air Wing Two has launched more than 1,800 combat sorties in excess of 10,000 flight hours with a 100 percent completion rate for Afghanistan related missions. On 10 February 2011, Carrier Strike Group Nine completed its 45th day of at-sea operations, with Carrier Air Wing Two having launched over 7,000 sorties including nearly 2,000 directly supporting ground combat troops. Aircraft from Carrier Strike Group Nine also participated in joint aerial combat training exercises with the Royal Malaysian Air Force on 14 February 2011. On 22 February 2011, the strike group flagship &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; hosted a Brunei military delegation led by Deputy Minister of Defense Dato Paduka Mustappa Sirat.

Surface warships of Carrier Strike Group participated in maritime security operations during the group&#x27;s 2010–2011 deployment with the U.S. Fifth Fleet. The guided-missile destroyer &quot;Halsey&quot; was assigned to counter-piracy operations in and around the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea; and &quot;Momsen&quot; operated with Combined Task Force 152 in the Persian Gulf. On 5 December 2010, the &quot;Halsey&quot; and the French frigate &quot;Tourville&quot; participated in a bi-lateral naval gunnery exercise in the Arabian Sea to enhance coalition maritime forces training and coordination.

On 18 January 2011, a sailor from the guided-missile destroyer &quot;Halsey&quot; was reported overboard in the Gulf of Oman, initiating a search-and-rescue mission involving helicopters from the &quot;Halsey&quot;, the fast combat support ship , and the British guided-missile frigate , as well as land-based P-3 maritime patrol aircraft and FA-18 strike fighters from Carrier Air Wing Two based on the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. On 19 January, the body of the missing sailor was recovered 75 miles (120.7 km) east of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, and was identified as Petty Officer Dominique Cruz, 26, of Panama City, Florida.

On 31 January 2011, the cruiser &quot;Cape St. George&quot; responded to a distress call from a sinking Iranian dhow by dispatching a rescue team via a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) (&quot;pictured&quot;). The U.S. naval team attempted to repair the dhow&#x27;s dewatering pumps, but they were unable to stop the flooding. The Iranian fishermen were brought aboard the &quot;Cape St. George&quot;, where they were examined by the medical staff before being transferred to an Iranian customs vessel.

On 2 February 2011, the destroyer &quot;Momsen&quot;, with the cruiser , responded to a distress call from the Panamanian-flag merchant vessel &quot;Duqm&quot; in the Gulf of Oman. Both ships disrupted a pirate attack on the &quot;Duqm&quot;, tracked the two pirate skiffs back to their mothership, and destroyed the two skiffs to prevent their use in future pirate attacks (&quot;pictured&quot;).

Following its rotation with the Fifth Fleet and the Seventh Fleet, the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, with the destroyers &quot;Momsen&quot; and &quot;Shoup&quot;, arrived at Naval Air Station San Diego, California, on 19 March, and subsequently to their homeport of Everett, Washington, on 24 March 2011. The destroyer &quot;Halsey&quot; arrived at San Diego on 14 March 2011. Squadrons from Carrier Air Wing 2 also returned to their bases on 18 March.

During its 2010–2011 deployment, Carrier Air Wing Two flew more than 8,300 sorties and completed more than 23,500 flying hours, of which more than 3,600 sorties and almost 11,000 hours were flown in support of U.S. and coalition ground forces in Afghanistan. Carrier Strike Group Nine conducted military exercises with France, Bahrain, Malaysia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. Strike group warships , , , , and assisted mariners in distress and provided humanitarian assistance to more than 10 vessels. Finally, Helicopter Strike Maritime Squadron (HSM-77) was named as a top U.S. Navy helicopter squadron based on the U.S. west coast, earning a Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

===2011–2012 deployment===


On 7 December 2011, the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; departed from Naval Station Everett, Washington, and the cruiser &quot;Cape St. George&quot; from Naval Base San Diego, California, to start their 2011-2011 deployment under the command of Rear Admiral Troy M. (&quot;Mike&quot;) Shoemaker. The destroyer &quot;Sterett&quot; departed San Diego on 6 December 2011 to join up with the other units of Carrier Strike Group Nine.

On 13 December 2011, helicopter squadron HSM-77 flew from Naval Air Station North Island, California, to Carrier Strike Group Nine. Squadron HSM-77 as part of Carrier Air Wing Two aboard the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. HSM-77 detachments Two, Three, and Five deployed earlier that month to the cruiser &quot;Cape St. George&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Sterret&quot; and USS &quot;Momsen&quot;, respectively, with two helicopters per detachment. The squadron serves as the eyes and ears for the carrier strike group, providing important anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. Also, Squadron HSM-77 flew cross-country to return to NAS North Island following the conclusion of this deployment.

On 9 January 2012, Carrier Strike Groups 1 and 3, rendezvoused in the North Arabian Sea, while Carrier Strike Group Nine was en route to the Arabian Sea, amid rising tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran over U.S. naval access to the Strait of Hormuz. On 19 January 2012, Carrier Strike Group Nine entered the U.S. Fifth Fleet&#x27;s area of responsibility and relieved Carrier Strike Group One (&quot;pictured&quot;).

On 22 January 2012, the group was joined by the British Type 23 frigate and French frigate &quot;La Motte-Picquet&quot; and together this American-British-French naval flotilla transited the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf without incident. Three weeks later, the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, the cruiser &quot;Cape St. George&quot;, and the destroyer &quot;Sterett&quot; transited through Strait of Hormuz into the northern Arabian Sea on 14 February 2012, concluding Carrier Strike Group Nine&#x27;s initial operations in the Persian Gulf. The strike group&#x27;s movements were monitored by Iranian patrol boats and aircraft during its transit. In addition to combat air support for coalition forces in Afghanistan, Carrier Strike Group Nine maintained flights operations some off the coast of Iran. Also, the new British guided-missile destroyer operated with Carrier Strike Group One and Carrier Strike Group Nine in the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea, respectively, during that ship&#x27;s maiden overseas deployment.

On 17 January 2012, the guided-missile destroyer conducted a boarding party with Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 1131 based on the aircraft carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. The EOD team fast-roped onto &quot;Momsen&quot; from a hovering helicopter from squadron HSC-12; such training exercises helped to maintain the proficiency and qualifications for both the EOD personnel and the helicopter pilots. Following that training exercise, the EOD team also conducted training with the &quot;Momsen&quot;″s 12-man boarding party team. These exercises were vital in an anti-piracy and boarding operations.

On 31 January 2012, at 12:37pm local time, an MH-60S Seahawk helicopter from HSC-12 spotted a disabled Iranian fishing dhow, the M/V &quot;Sohaila&quot;, with nine crew members aboard (&quot;pictured&quot;). The dhow&#x27;s distress call reported that &quot;Sohaila&quot;″s engine had overheated, prevented the vessel from operating. A boarding team from the destroyer responded and they were joined by a diving team from Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 1131 flown from &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. The &quot;Sohaila&quot;″s engine was repaired, and after determining that the Iranian mariners had ample supplies and fuel, the U.S. boarding party departed.

The guided-missile destroyer &quot;Sterrett&quot; served as the flagship for the Kuwaiti-led exercise &quot;Stakenet&quot; held 5–9 February 2012 in the Persian Gulf under the operational command of Combined Task Force 152 (CTF-152), the Persian Gulf maritime security task force of the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) multilateral naval command. Warships that participated in Stakenet 2012 included the U.S. guided-missile destroyers &quot;Sterrett&quot; and and the coastal patrol vessels and ; the British frigate ; and the Kuwaiti fast-attack craft &quot;Al Nokhetna&quot; and &quot;Maskan&quot;. Air units included U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters, U.S. Navy P-3 maritime patrol aircraft, and U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters.

On 16 February 2012, from the North Arabian Sea, the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and its embarked Carrier Air Wing Two began flying air combat missions in support of coalition ground forces in Afghanistan (&quot;pictured&quot;). To assist the strike group&#x27;s combat air operations, U.S. Army ground liaison officers from the 4th Battlefield Coordination Detachment served as communications links between ground forces in Afghanistan and Carrier Air Wing Two. On 14 May 2012, during its 2012 deployment, HSM-77 Detachment Five completed its temporary operational rotation on board the British replenishment oiler &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; which was serving as the flagship for Combined Task Force 151. This was the first time that a MH-60R helicopter had ever operated from a Royal Navy ship. The detachment&#x27;s helicopters primarily concentrated on anti-piracy surveillance missions during this two-week period. 
On 1 May 2012, Carrier Strike Group Twelve, led by the carrier , joined Carrier Strike Group Nine, becoming the second carrier strike group currently operating in the Fifth Fleet&#x27;s area of responsibility.

On 9 July 2012, Carrier Strike Group Nine concluded air combat operations in support of coalition ground forces in Afghanistan (&quot;pictured&quot;), having flown over 2,400 sorties in excess of 14,000 flight hours with a 100 percent completion rate during the 172 days the strike group operated in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. During the entire 2011–2012 deployment, aircraft from Carrier Air Wing Two flew over 11,000 sorties totaling in excess of 32,000 flight hours. This deployment is the final combat flight operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom for Carrier Strike Group Nine, Carrier Air Wing Two, and the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot; On 16 July 2012, Carrier Strike Group Nine transited the Suez Canal and entered the U.S. Sixth Fleet&#x27;s area of responsibility.

On 5 July 2012, the guided-missile destroyer &quot;Sterrett&quot; returned to Naval Base San Diego, California, completing a seven-month-long deployment to the U.S. Fifth Fleet as a unit of Carrier Strike Group Nine. On 7 August 2012, the aircraft carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; arrived at its new homebase of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, to start its upcoming four-year-long, mid-life overhaul at the Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard. During its 2011–2012 deployment, the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; steamed over over 245 days underway, including 105 days in the Arabian Sea supporting coalition forces in Afghanistan.

On 9 December 2010, the U.S. Navy announced that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; will undergo its scheduled four-year Refueling and Complex Overhaul at the Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard in Virginia. The refit was scheduled to begin in 2013. On 1 August 2011, the Navy announced that the group would change station from Naval Station Everett to Naval Base San Diego, effective 14 December 2012. The carrier has been reassigned as the group flagship following the de-activation of Carrier Strike Group Seven. On 10 January 2012, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; sailed into Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for its 12-month, US$218 million docking planned incremental availability (DPIA) overhaul. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; completed its year-long dry-docked maintenance overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Bremerton, Washington, and on 18 March 2013, departed for San Diego, arriving on 21 March 2013.

===2013–2015 operations===
On 18 November 2013, Carrier Strike Group Nine completed its four-day Fleet Synthetic Training-Joint (FST-J) exercise. Such FST-J exercises simulate virtual at-sea training involving real-world battle scenarios while the ships of the strike group remained docked in port. Such in-port training allowed shipboard maintenance to be done without delaying required training for upcoming deployments. This FST-J exercise also involved joint forces training in tactics and operations, with units of the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Air Force participating.

On 18 November 2013, Carrier Strike Group Nine completed its independent deployer certification exercise (IDCERTEX) held in the U.S. Third Fleet area of operations. The two-phase IDCERTEX involved intermediate and advanced training for the strike group across the full spectrum of naval warfare operations. The first phase involved such unit-level training as shipboard firefighting; man overboard drills; visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS); and other ship-specific functions. The second phase involved integrated training between the ships and aircraft of the strike group, and it consisted of flight operations, submarine tracking, strait transit formations, replenishment-at-sea, and other required mission operations.

On 27 November 2013, Carrier Strike Group Nine was underway to complete its Tailored Ship&#x27;s Training Assessment (TSTA) pre-deployment exercises as well as prepare for its upcoming Final Evaluation Problem (FEP) exercises. TSTA exercises are designed to prepare the carrier strike group for sustained at-sea combat operations. This involves the strike group conducting multiple combat missions simultaneously as well as testing shipboard damage control readiness.

Between 4–12 December 2013, the USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was underway conducting routine training in the southern California operations area, and at the start of 2014, the carrier was in port and not underway. Between 23 and 30 January 2014, the &quot;Reagan&quot; departed Naval Station San Diego, California, for carrier qualifications prior to undertaking exercises for Carrier Strike Group Nine. On 17 March 2014, the &quot;Reagan&quot; resumed its Tailored Ship&#x27;s Training Availability (TSTA) pre-deployment training exercises (&quot;pictured&quot;).

On 17 April 2015, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; departed Naval Air Station North Island, California, for sea trials following the completion of its seven-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) refit and upkeep cycle. The &quot;Reagan&quot; subsequently completed CVW-11/FRS/TRACOM carrier qualifications (CQ) and Combat System Ship&#x27;s Qualification Trials (CSSQT) before on-loading ammunition from the dry cargo ship .
;2013–2014 exercises and port visits
===Unit changes===
On 14 January 2014, the U.S. Navy announced that the &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; will replace the as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group Five, the only forward-based carrier strike group home-ported at Yokosuka, Japan, as part of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The &quot;George Washington&quot; is scheduled to undergo its mid-life complex refueling and overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard in Newport News, Virginia.

<doc id="216381" wikidata="Q875716" url="?curid=216381" title="Boot sector">
<text>A boot sector is the sector of a persistent data storage device (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, optical disc, etc.) which contains machine code to be loaded into random-access memory (RAM) and then executed by a computer system&#x27;s built-in firmware (e.g., the BIOS).

Usually, the first sector of the hard disk is the boot sector, regardless of sector size (512 or 4096 bytes) and partitioning flavor (MBR or GPT).

The purpose of defining one particular sector as the &quot;boot sector&quot; is inter-operability between firmware and various operating systems.

The purpose of chain loading first a firmware (e.g., the BIOS), then some code contained in the boot sector, and then, for example, an operating system, is maximal flexibility.

== The IBM PC and compatible computers ==

On an IBM PC compatible machine, the BIOS selects a boot device, then copies the first sector from the device (which may be a MBR, VBR or any executable code), into physical memory at memory address 0x7C00. On other systems, the process may be quite different.

== Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) ==

The UEFI (not legacy boot via CSM) does not rely on boot sectors, UEFI system loads the boot loader (EFI application file in USB disk or in the EFI system partition) directly. Additionally, the UEFI specification also contains &quot;secure boot&quot;, which basically wants the UEFI code to be digitally signed.

== Damage to the boot sector ==

In case a boot sector receives physical damage, the hard disk will no longer be bootable, unless used with a custom BIOS that defines a non-damaged sector as the boot sector. However, since the very first sector additionally contains data regarding the partitioning of the hard disk, the hard disk will become entirely unusable except when used in conjunction with custom software.

== Partition tables ==

A disk can be partitioned into multiple partitions and, on conventional systems, it is expected to be. There are two definitions on how to store the information regarding the partitioning:

* A master boot record (MBR) is the first sector of a data storage device that has been partitioned. The MBR sector may contain code to locate the active partition and invoke its volume boot record.
* A volume boot record (VBR) is the first sector of a data storage device that has &quot;not&quot; been partitioned, or the first sector of an individual partition on a data storage device that has been partitioned. It may contain code to load an operating system (or other standalone program) installed on that device or within that partition.

The presence of an IBM PC compatible boot loader for x86-CPUs in the boot sector is by convention indicated by a two-byte hexadecimal sequence 0x55 0xAA (called the boot sector signature) at the end of the boot sector (offsets 0x1FE and 0x1FF). This signature indicates the presence of at least a dummy boot loader which is safe to be executed, even if it may not be able actually to load an operating system. It does not indicate a particular (or even the presence of) file system or operating system, although some old versions of DOS 3 relied on it in their process to detect FAT-formatted media (newer versions do not). Boot code for other platforms or CPUs should not use this signature, since this may lead to a crash when the BIOS passes execution to the boot sector assuming that it contains valid executable code. Nevertheless, some media for other platforms erroneously contain the signature, anyway, rendering this check not 100% reliable in practice.

The signature is checked for by most system BIOSes since (at least) the IBM PC/AT (but not by the original IBM PC and some other machines). Even more so, it is also checked by most MBR boot loaders before passing control to the boot sector. Some BIOSes (like the IBM PC/AT) perform the check only for fixed disk/removable drives, while for floppies and superfloppies, it is enough to start with a byte greater or equal to 06h and the first nine words not to contain the same value, before the boot sector is accepted as valid, thereby avoiding the explicit test for 0x55, 0xAA on floppies. Since old boot sectors (e.g., very old CP/M-86 and DOS media) sometimes do not feature this signature despite the fact that they can be booted successfully, the check can be disabled in some environments.
If the BIOS or MBR code does not detect a valid boot sector and therefore cannot pass execution to the boot sector code, it will try the next boot device in the row. If they all fail it will typically display an error message and invoke INT 18h. This will either start up optional resident software in ROM (ROM BASIC), reboot the system via INT 19h after user confirmation or cause the system to halt the bootstrapping process until the next power-up.

Systems not following the above described design are:

* CD-ROMs usually have their own structure of boot sectors; for IBM PC compatible systems this is subject to El Torito specifications.
* C128 or C64 software on Commodore DOS disks where data on Track 1, Sector 0 began with a magic number corresponding to string &quot;CBM&quot;.
* IBM mainframe computers place a small amount of boot code in the first and second track of the first cylinder of the disk, and the root directory, called the Volume Table of Contents, is also located at the fixed location of the third track of the first cylinder of the disk.
* Other (non IBM-compatible) PC systems may have different boot sector formats on their disk devices.

== Operation ==

On IBM PC compatible machines, the BIOS is ignorant of the distinction between VBRs and MBRs, and of partitioning. The firmware simply loads and runs the first sector of the storage device. If the device is a floppy or USB flash drive, that will be a VBR. If the device is a hard disk, that will be an MBR. It is the code in the MBR which generally understands disk partitioning, and in turn, is responsible for loading and running the VBR of whichever primary partition is set to boot (the &quot;active&quot; partition). The VBR then loads a second-stage bootloader from another location on the disk.

Furthermore, whatever is stored in the first sector of a floppy diskette, USB device, hard disk or any other &quot;bootable&quot; storage device, is not required to immediately load any bootstrap code for an OS, if ever. The BIOS merely passes control to whatever exists there, as long as the sector meets the very simple qualification of having the boot record signature of 0x55, 0xAA in its last two bytes. This is why it is easy to replace the usual bootstrap code found in an MBR with more complex loaders, even large multi-functional boot managers (programs stored elsewhere on the device which can run without an operating system), allowing users a number of choices in what occurs next. With this kind of freedom, abuse often occurs in the form of boot sector viruses.

== Boot-sector viruses ==

Since code in the boot sector is executed automatically, boot sectors have historically been a common attack vector for computer viruses.

To combat this behavior, the system BIOS often includes an option to prevent software from writing to the first sector of any attached hard drives; it could thereby protect the master boot record containing the partition table from being overwritten accidentally, but not the volume boot records in the bootable partitions. Depending on the BIOS, attempts to write to the protected sector may be blocked with or without user interaction. Most BIOSes, however, will display a popup message giving the user a chance to override the setting.
The BIOS option is disabled by default because the message may not be displayed correctly in graphics mode and blocking access to the MBR may cause problems with operating system setup programs or disk access, encryption or partitioning tools like FDISK, which may not have been written to be aware of that possibility, causing them to abort ungracefully and possibly leaving the disk partitioning in an inconsistent state.

As an example, the malware NotPetya attempts to gain administrative privileges on an operating system, and then would attempt to overwrite the boot sector of a computer. The CIA has also developed malware that attempts to modify the boot sector in order to load additional drivers to be used by other malware.
Another Malware that overwrites boot sector is the MEMZ

<text>National Review is an American conservative editorial magazine, focusing on news and commentary pieces on political, social, and cultural affairs. The magazine was founded by William F. Buckley Jr. in 1955. Its editor-in-chief is Rich Lowry, and its editor is Ramesh Ponnuru.

Since its founding, the magazine has played a significant role in the development of conservatism in the United States, helping to define its boundaries and promoting fusionism while establishing itself as a leading voice on the American right.

==History==

=== Background ===

Before &quot;National Review&quot;″s founding in 1955, the American right was a largely unorganized collection of people who shared intertwining philosophies but had little opportunity for a united public voice. They wanted to marginalize the antiwar, noninterventionistic views of the Old Right.

In 1953, moderate Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, and many major magazines such as the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; were strongly conservative and anticommunist, as were many newspapers including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot;. A few small-circulation conservative magazines, such as &quot;Human Events&quot; and &quot;The Freeman&quot;, preceded &quot;National Review&quot; in developing Cold War conservatism in the 1950s.

In 1953, Russell Kirk published &quot;The Conservative Mind&quot;, which traced an intellectual bloodline from Edmund Burke to the Old Right in the early 1950s. This challenged the notion among intellectuals that no coherent conservative tradition existed in the United States.

A young William F. Buckley Jr. was greatly influenced by Kirk&#x27;s concepts. Buckley had money; his father grew rich from oil fields in Mexico. He first tried to purchase &quot;Human Events&quot;, but was turned down. He then met Willi Schlamm, the experienced editor of &quot;The Freeman&quot;; they would spend the next two years raising the $300,000 necessary to start their own weekly magazine, originally to be called &quot;National Weekly&quot;. (A magazine holding the trademark to the name prompted the change to &quot;National Review&quot;.) The statement of intentions read:

Middle-of-the-Road, qua Middle of the Road, is politically, intellectually, and morally repugnant. We shall recommend policies for the simple reason that we consider them right (rather than &quot;non-controversial&quot;); and we consider them right because they are based on principles we deem right (rather than on popularity polls)... The New Deal revolution, for instance, could hardly have happened save for the cumulative impact of &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and a few other publications, on several American college generations during the twenties and thirties.

===Founding===

On November 19, 1955, Buckley&#x27;s magazine began to take shape. Buckley assembled an eclectic group of writers: traditionalists, Catholic intellectuals, libertarians, and ex-Communists. The group included Revilo P. Oliver, Russell Kirk, James Burnham, Frank Meyer, and Willmoore Kendall, and Catholics L. Brent Bozell and Garry Wills. The former &quot;Time&quot; editor Whittaker Chambers, who had been a Communist spy in the 1930s and then turned intensely anti-Communist, became a senior editor. In the magazine&#x27;s founding statement Buckley wrote:

The launching of a conservative weekly journal of opinion in a country widely assumed to be a bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if &quot;National Review&quot; is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.

As editors and contributors, Buckley sought out intellectuals who were ex-Communists or had once worked on the far left, including Whittaker Chambers, William Schlamm, John Dos Passos, Frank Meyer, and James Burnham. When James Burnham became one of the original senior editors, he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center. Smant (1991) finds that Burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board (including Meyer, Schlamm, William Rickenbacker, and the magazine&#x27;s publisher William A. Rusher), and had a significant effect on both the editorial policy of the magazine and on the thinking of Buckley himself.

&quot;National Review&quot; aimed to make conservative ideas respectable in an age when the dominant view of conservative thought was, as expressed by Columbia professor Lionel Trilling,

[L]iberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. For it is the plain fact that nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation... the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not... express themselves in ideas but only... in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.

Buckley said that &quot;National Review&quot; &quot;is out of place because, in its maturity, literate America rejected conservatism in favor of radical social experimentation... since ideas rule the world, the ideologues, having won over the intellectual class, simply walked in and started to... run just about everything. There never was an age of conformity quite like this one, or a camaraderie quite like the Liberals.&#x27;

===Goldwater era===
&quot;National Review&quot; promoted Barry Goldwater heavily during the early 1960s. Buckley and others involved with the magazine took a major role in the &quot;Draft Goldwater&quot; movement in 1960 and the 1964 presidential campaign. &quot;National Review&quot; spread his vision of conservatism throughout the country.

The early &quot;National Review&quot; faced occasional defections from both left and right. Garry Wills broke with &quot;National Review&quot; and became a liberal commentator. Buckley&#x27;s brother-in-law, L. Brent Bozell Jr. left and started the short-lived traditionalist Catholic magazine, &quot;Triumph&quot; in 1966.

Buckley and Meyer promoted the idea of enlarging the boundaries of conservatism through fusionism, whereby different schools of conservatives, including libertarians, would work together to combat what were seen as their common opponents.

Buckley and his editors used his magazine to define the boundaries of conservatism—and to exclude people or ideas or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title. Therefore, they attacked the John Birch Society (JBS), George Wallace, and anti-Semites. Buckley&#x27;s goal was to increase the respectability of the conservative movement; in 2004, current editor Rich Lowry, compiled various quotes of articles commenting on Buckley&#x27;s retirement including from &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;: &quot;Mr. Buckley&#x27;s first great achievement was to purge the American right of its kooks. He marginalized the anti-Semites, the John Birchers, the nativists and their sort.&quot; However, others such as political historian Matthew Dallek, contend that while the mainstream view has long been that Buckley excluded Bircherism, his &quot;gesture toward kicking out the Birchers was far more concerned with cordoning off [JBS founder] Robert Welch while retaining the support of the rank-and-file members.&quot;

In 1957, &quot;National Review&quot; editorialized in favor of white leadership in the South, arguing that &quot;the central question that emerges... is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes – the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race.&quot; By the 1970s &quot;National Review&quot; advocated colorblind policies and the end of affirmative action.

In the late 1960s, the magazine denounced segregationist George Wallace, who ran in Democratic primaries in 1964 and 1972 and made an independent run for president in 1968. During the 1950s, Buckley had worked to remove anti-Semitism from the conservative movement and barred holders of those views from working for &quot;National Review&quot;. In 1962, Buckley denounced Robert W. Welch Jr. and the John Birch Society as &quot;far removed from common sense&quot; and urged the Republican Party to purge itself of Welch&#x27;s influence.

===Supporting Reagan===
After Goldwater was defeated by Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Buckley and &quot;National Review&quot; continued to champion the idea of a conservative movement, which was increasingly embodied in Ronald Reagan. Reagan, a longtime subscriber to &quot;National Review&quot;, became politically prominent during Goldwater&#x27;s campaign. &quot;National Review&quot; supported his challenge to President Gerald Ford in 1976 and his successful 1980 campaign.

During the 1980s, &quot;National Review&quot; called for tax cuts, supply-side economics, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and support for President Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy against the Soviet Union. The magazine criticized the welfare state and would support the welfare reform proposals of the 1990s. The magazine also regularly criticized President Bill Clinton. It first embraced and then rejected Pat Buchanan in his political campaigns. A lengthy 1996 &quot;National Review&quot; editorial called for a &quot;movement toward&quot; drug legalization.

In 1985, &quot;National Review&quot; and Buckley were represented by attorney J. Daniel Mahoney during the magazine&#x27;s $16 million libel suit against &quot;The Spotlight&quot;.

== Political views and content ==
Victor Davis Hanson, a regular contributor since 2001, sees a broad spectrum of conservative and anti-liberal contributors:

The magazine has been described as &quot;the bible of American conservatism&quot;.

===Trump era===
In 2015, the magazine published an editorial titled &quot;Against Trump&quot;, calling Donald Trump a &quot;philosophically unmoored political opportunist&quot; and announcing its adamant and uniform opposition to his presidential candidacy for the Republican nomination for president. After Trump&#x27;s 2016 electoral victory over Hillary Clinton, and through his administration, the &quot;National Review&quot; editorial board continued to criticize him. However, some &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;National Review Online&quot; contributors took more varied positions on Trump. Hanson, for instance, supports him, while others, such as editor Ramesh Ponnuru and contributor Jonah Goldberg, have remained uniformly critical of Trump. In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; feature on conservative magazines, T.A. Frank noted: &quot;From the perspective of a reader, these tensions make &quot;National Review&quot; as lively as it has been in a long time.&quot;

===Biden era===
As Trump announced his run for reelection in 2022 and throughout 2023, &quot;National Review&quot; editorialized regularly against him and his candidacy.

== &quot;National Review Online&quot; ==
A popular web version of the magazine, &quot;National Review Online&quot; (&quot;N.R.O.&quot;), includes a digital version of the magazine, with articles updated daily by &quot;National Review&quot; writers, and conservative blogs. The online version is called &quot;N.R.O.&quot; to distinguish it from the printed magazine. It also features free articles, though these deviate in content from its print magazine. The site&#x27;s editor is Phillip Klein, who replaced Charles C. W. Cooke.

Each day, the site posts new content consisting of conservative, libertarian, and neoconservative opinion articles, including some syndicated columns, and news features.

It also features two blogs:
* The Corner is a selection of postings from a group of the site&#x27;s editors and affiliated writers discussing the issues of the day.
* Bench Memos provides legal and judicial news and commentary.

Markos Moulitsas, who runs the liberal &quot;Daily Kos&quot; web-site, told reporters in August 2007 that he does not read conservative blogs, with the exception of those on N.R.O.: &quot;I do like the blogs at the &quot;National Review&quot;—I do think their writers are the best in the [conservative] blogosphere,&quot; he said.

== National Review Institute ==
The N.R.I. works in policy development and helping establish new advocates in the conservative movement. National Review Institute was founded by William F. Buckley Jr. in 1991 to engage in policy development, public education, and advocacy that would advance the conservative principles he championed.

In 2019, the Whittaker Chambers family prevailed on the N.R.I. to cease an award in Chambers&#x27; name, after an award to people whom the family found objectionable.

== Finances ==
As with most political opinion magazines in the United States, &quot;National Review&quot; carries little corporate advertising. The magazine stays afloat from subscription fees, donations, and black-tie fundraisers around the country. The magazine also sponsors cruises featuring &quot;National Review&quot; editors and contributors as lecturers.

Buckley said in 2005 that the magazine had lost about $25,000,000 over 50 years.

== Presidential primary endorsements ==
&quot;National Review&quot; sometimes endorses a candidate during the primary election season. Editors at &quot;National Review&quot; have said, &quot;Our guiding principle has always been to select the most conservative viable candidate.&quot; This statement echoes what has come to be called &quot;The Buckley Rule&quot;. In a 1967 interview, in which he was asked about the choice of presidential candidate, Buckley said, &quot;The wisest choice would be the one who would win... I&#x27;d be for the most right, viable candidate who could win.&quot;

These candidates were endorsed by &quot;National Review&quot;:
* 1956: Dwight Eisenhower
* 1960: &quot;No endorsement&quot;
* 1964: Barry Goldwater
* 1968: Richard Nixon
* 1972: John M. Ashbrook
* 1976: Ronald Reagan
* 1980: &quot;No endorsement&quot;
* 1984: Ronald Reagan
* 1988: George H. W. Bush
* 1992: &quot;No endorsement&quot;
* 1996: &quot;No endorsement&quot;
* 2000: George W. Bush
* 2004: &quot;No endorsement&quot;
* 2008: Mitt Romney
* 2012: &quot;No endorsement&quot;
* 2016: Ted Cruz
* 2020: &quot;No endorsement&quot;
== Editors and contributors ==

The magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief is Rich Lowry. Many of the magazine&#x27;s commentators are affiliated with think-tanks such as The Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute. Prominent guest authors have included Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Peter Thiel, and Ted Cruz in the online and print edition.

== Controversies ==

=== Climate change denial ===
According to Philip Bump of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot; &quot;has regularly criticized and rejected the scientific consensus on climate change&quot;. In 2015, the magazine published an intentionally deceptive graph which suggested that there was no climate change. The graph set the lower and upper bounds of the chart at -10 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit and zoomed out so as to obscure warming trends.

In 2017, &quot;National Review&quot; published an article alleging that a top NOAA scientist claimed that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration engaged in data manipulation and rushed a study based on faulty data in order to influence the Paris climate negotiations. The article largely repeated allegations made in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; without independent verification. The scientist in question later rejected the claims made by &quot;National Review&quot;, noting that he did not accuse NOAA of data manipulation but instead raised concerns about &quot;the way data was handled, documented and stored, raising issues of transparency and availability&quot;.

In 2014, climate scientist Michael E. Mann sued &quot;National Review&quot; for defamation after columnist Mark Steyn accused Mann of fraud and referenced a quote from Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) writer Rand Simberg that called Mann &quot;the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data.&quot; Civil liberties organizations such as the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and several publications such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; expressed support for &quot;National Review&quot; in the lawsuit, filing amicus briefs in their defense. In February 2024, Mann was awarded over $1 million from Steyn and Simberg. He intends to appeal a 2021 ruling saying that the CEI and &quot;National Review&quot; could not be held liable.

=== Barack Obama ===

In June 2008, &quot;National Review&quot; correspondent Jim Geraghty published an article encouraging Barack Obama to release his birth certificate in order to debunk false rumors circulating on conservative forums and blogs. Geraghty&#x27;s column may have brought these conspiracy theories about Obama to mainstream attention. Karen Tumulty wrote in &quot;Time&quot; that Geraghty&#x27;s article &quot;became fodder for cable television.&quot; Obama released his birth certificate a few days after Geraghty&#x27;s column, and Geraghty wrote that there was &quot;no reason&quot; to doubt its authenticity. In a July 2009 column, the &quot;National Review&quot; editorial board called conspiracies about Obama&#x27;s citizenship &quot;untrue.&quot;

One &quot;National Review&quot; article suggested Obama&#x27;s parents could be communists because &quot;for a white woman to marry a black man in 1958, or &#x27;60, there was almost inevitably a connection to explicit Communist politics&quot;.

=== Ann Coulter 9/11 column ===
Two days after the September 11 attacks, &quot;National Review&quot; published a column by Ann Coulter in which she wrote of Muslims, &quot;This is no time to be precious about locating the exact individuals directly involved in this particular terrorist attack. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren&#x27;t punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That&#x27;s war. And this is war.&quot; &quot;National Review&quot; later called the column a &quot;mistake&quot; and fired Coulter as a contributing editor.

=== Jeffrey Epstein ===
In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;National Review&quot; was one of three news outlets (along with &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;HuffPost&quot;) that had published stories written by Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s publicists. The &quot;National Review&quot; article was written by Christina Galbraith, Epstein&#x27;s publicist at the time the article was published in 2013. The &quot;National Review&quot; bio for Galbraith described her as a science writer. &quot;National Review&quot; retracted the article in July 2019 with apologies and spoke of new methods being used to better filter freelance content.

=== Rashida Tlaib===
After the 2024 Lebanon pager explosions, the &quot;National Review&quot; published a cartoon of US Representative Rashida Tlaib with an exploding pager. It was condemned by Tlaib as racist and Islamophobic. Dearborn mayor Abdullah Hammoud called the cartoon &quot;anti-Arab bigotry&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the Hilbert cube, named after David Hilbert, is a topological space that provides an instructive example of some ideas in topology. Furthermore, many interesting topological spaces can be embedded in the Hilbert cube; that is, can be viewed as subspaces of the Hilbert cube (see below).

==Definition==

The Hilbert cube is best defined as the topological product of the intervals formula_1 for formula_2 That is, it is a cuboid of countably infinite dimension, where the lengths of the edges in each orthogonal direction form the sequence formula_3

The Hilbert cube is homeomorphic to the product of countably infinitely many copies of the unit interval formula_4 In other words, it is topologically indistinguishable from the unit cube of countably infinite dimension. Some authors use the term &quot;Hilbert cube&quot; to mean this Cartesian product instead of the product of the formula_5.

If a point in the Hilbert cube is specified by a sequence formula_6 with formula_7 then a homeomorphism to the infinite dimensional unit cube is given by formula_8

==The Hilbert cube as a metric space==

It is sometimes convenient to think of the Hilbert cube as a metric space, indeed as a specific subset of a separable Hilbert space (that is, a Hilbert space with a countably infinite Hilbert basis).
For these purposes, it is best not to think of it as a product of copies of formula_9 but instead as
formula_10
as stated above, for topological properties, this makes no difference.
That is, an element of the Hilbert cube is an infinite sequence
formula_11
that satisfies
formula_12

Any such sequence belongs to the Hilbert space formula_13 so the Hilbert cube inherits a metric from there. One can show that the topology induced by the metric is the same as the product topology in the above definition.

==Properties==

As a product of compact Hausdorff spaces, the Hilbert cube is itself a compact Hausdorff space as a result of the Tychonoff theorem.
The compactness of the Hilbert cube can also be proved without the axiom of choice by constructing a continuous function from the usual Cantor set onto the Hilbert cube.

In formula_13 no point has a compact neighbourhood (thus, formula_15 is not locally compact). One might expect that all of the compact subsets of formula_15 are finite-dimensional.
The Hilbert cube shows that this is not the case.
But the Hilbert cube fails to be a neighbourhood of any point formula_17 because its side becomes smaller and smaller in each dimension, so that an open ball around formula_17 of any fixed radius formula_19 must go outside the cube in some dimension.

Any infinite-dimensional convex compact subset of formula_15 is homeomorphic to the Hilbert cube. The Hilbert cube is a convex set, whose span is dense in the whole space, but whose interior is empty. This situation is impossible in finite dimensions. The closed tangent cone to the cube at the zero vector is the whole space.

Every subset of the Hilbert cube inherits from the Hilbert cube the properties of being both metrizable (and therefore T4) and second countable. It is more interesting that the converse also holds: Every second countable T4 space is homeomorphic to a subset of the Hilbert cube.

In particular, every Gδ-subset of the Hilbert cube is a Polish space, a topological space homeomorphic to a separable and complete metric space. Conversely, every Polish space is homeomorphic to a Gδ-subset of the Hilbert cube.

<text>The Reform Party of Canada () was a right-wing populist and conservative federal political party in Canada that existed from 1987 to 2000. Reform was founded as a Western Canada-based protest movement that eventually became a populist conservative party, with strong social conservative and fiscal conservative elements. It was initially motivated by profound Western Canadian discontent with the Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) government of Brian Mulroney.

Led by its founder Preston Manning throughout its existence, Reform was considered a populist movement that rapidly gained popularity and momentum in Western Canada during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In addition to attracting social conservatives, the party was popular among Western Canadians who were disillusioned with Mulroney&#x27;s perceived prioritization of Quebec (during his attempts to reform the Constitution) as well as fiscal conservatives who were critical of the Mulroney government&#x27;s tax increases and inability to reduce the budget deficit. In a 1989 by-election, Reform won its first-ever seat in the House of Commons before making a major electoral breakthrough in the 1993 federal election, when it supplanted the PCs as the largest conservative party in Canada. In opposition, the party advocated for spending restraint, tax cuts, reductions in immigration, and wider reform of Canada&#x27;s political institutions such as the Senate. In the 1997 federal election, the party attempted to make a national breakthrough by running candidates in all provinces and territories. Although they became the Official Opposition, a Liberal majority and disappointment with the lack of Eastern seats led many members to question the future direction of the party.

In an attempt to move beyond its Western Canadian regional base and broaden its platform to encompass ideas from Eastern Canada, the party changed its name to the Canadian Alliance in 2000. That same year, the Alliance lost an election to a third Liberal majority. In 2003, the Unite the Right movement culminated in the Alliance merging with the Progressive Conservative Party to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada. Reform&#x27;s impact on the Conservative Party&#x27;s leaders and policies has been significant; three of its four permanent leaders were once Reform Party members.

== History ==
=== Political roots and background ===

Prior to World War I, Western Canada featured broadly the same political climate as the rest of the country, with a two-party system consisting of the Liberal and Conservative parties. Following the conflict, regional parties began to be seen as more effective at representing Western interests at the federal level, including the Progressive Party and United Farmers of Alberta, and later the Social Credit Party and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. This continued until the 1958 Canadian federal election, when the landslide victory of the Progressive Conservatives (PC) under Western populist Prime Minister John Diefenbaker largely eliminated Social Credit as a serious competitor in Western Canada (albeit its provincial branches in Alberta and British Columbia dominated their legislative assemblies until 1970 and 1991 respectively), and left political contests in the region largely polarised between the Progressive Conservatives and the CCF&#x27;s successor, the New Democratic Party.

Social Credit continued to provide a nominal alternative to the Progressive Conservatives for right-wing voters, but from 1968 onwards the party would only successfully elect MPs in Quebec, and a backlash over the party&#x27;s failure to take a stance on supporting a motion of non-confidence in Joe Clark&#x27;s government in 1979 resulted in its complete collapse as a political force. Some former Social Credit members attempted to form the Confederation of Regions Party as another alternative right-wing party, with Western alienation (which had been largely ignored by Social Credit in their final years in favour of a focus on Quebec issues) as a key platform plank. While they made little headway against the Progressive Conservatives, who won another landslide victory in 1984, they had one of the stronger performances among the minor parties that year.

In May 1987, a conference called &quot;A Western Assembly on Canada&#x27;s Economic and Political Future&quot; was held in Vancouver, British Columbia. This conference led to the formation of the Reform Party in Winnipeg in October of that year. The party&#x27;s founding occurred as the coalition of Western Prairie populists, Quebec nationalists, Ontario business leaders, and Atlantic Red Tories that made up Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party began to fracture.

The party was the brainchild of a group of discontented Western interest groups who were upset with the PC government and the lack of a voice for Western concerns at the national level. Leading figures in this movement included Ted Byfield, Stan Roberts, Francis Winspear, and Preston Manning. A major intellectual impetus at the time was provided by Peter Brimelow&#x27;s 1986 book, &quot;The Patriot Game&quot;. They believed the West needed its own party if it was to be heard. Their main complaints against the Mulroney government were its alleged favouritism towards Quebec, lack of fiscal responsibility, and a failure to support a program of institutional reform (for example, of the Senate). The roots of this discontent lay mainly in their belief that a package of proposed constitutional amendments, called the Meech Lake Accord, failed to meet the needs of Westerners and Canadian unity overall.

=== 1987–1990: Foundation and early success ===

The Reform Party was founded in October 1987 at a convention in Winnipeg, Manitoba led by three principal organizers: Preston Manning, son of Alberta premier Ernest Manning; Stan Roberts, former Liberal Party MP; and Robert Muir, former president of the Canadian Petroleum Law Foundation. On November 1, 1987, at the convention, Manning was unanimously named leader after Roberts left the convention in protest over the new party&#x27;s finances. The party&#x27;s delegates discussed a variety of topics to formulate policies such as calling for the party to endorse a Triple-E Senate amendment to be added to the Meech Lake Accord, advocating the addition of property rights into the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and other issues such as &quot;provincial resource rights, deficit reduction, free trade, economic diversification, welfare reform, and regional fairness in federal procurements&quot;. The convention briefly discussed the contentious topic of western separation, which was not a serious concern as most of the delegates rejected the idea and Manning stated that he would refuse to lead a western separatist party and went on to say &quot;We want to tell the rest of the country not that the West is leaving, but that the West is arriving.&quot;

The party fought in the 1988 federal election, but was never considered more than a fringe element, and none of its 72 candidates won election. However, the party ran second to the governing Tories in many Western ridings and earned 2.1% of the total national vote. The party clearly identified itself as a Western-based political party in 1988 with its slogan &quot;The West Wants In&quot;. The party advocated controversial policies such as its opposition to official bilingualism and multiculturalism and its opposition for distinct society status for Quebec, which all mainstream political parties at the time supported.

In 1989, following the sudden death of John Dahmer, PC MP for Beaver River in Alberta, the Reform Party gained its first MP when Deborah Grey won the resulting by-election. Grey had finished fourth in the 1988 election. As the party&#x27;s first MP, she was named Reform&#x27;s deputy leader, a position she held for the remainder of the party&#x27;s history. Also in 1989, Stanley Waters won Alberta&#x27;s first senatorial election under the banner of the Reform Party of Alberta. In 1990, he became Reform&#x27;s first (and only) federal Senator, remaining in office until his untimely death one year later. Waters&#x27; appointment, following his election victory, has led some to describe him as Canada&#x27;s first elected senator.

=== 1991–1993: Breakthrough ===
In 1991 and 1992, support for Reform rose not only in Western Canada, but also in other parts of Canada as well, including Ontario. The party took note of this new support and changed its position from being a Western-based political party to being a national party. However, it did not stand candidates in Quebec, as there was little support from francophone Quebecers due to Reform&#x27;s opposition to a distinct society clause for Quebec.

In 1992, the Mulroney government made another attempt at amending Canada&#x27;s constitution. The Charlottetown Accord was even more ambitious than the Meech Lake Accord, but it failed to win support in a nationwide referendum. The Reform Party was one of the few groups to oppose the accord. The constitutional debacle, together with unpopular initiatives such as the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) and a series of high-profile scandals, contributed to the implosion of the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; &quot;grand coalition&quot; ahead of the 1993 election.

The Reform Party achieved a major breakthrough in the 1993 federal election. The Progressive Conservatives suffered the worst defeat ever for a governing party at the federal level, falling from 151 to only two seats, while the Liberals under Jean Chrétien won a majority government. Reform was the major beneficiary of the Tory collapse: with few exceptions, the PCs&#x27; Western support transferred &quot;en masse&quot; to Reform. It won all but four seats in Alberta and dominated British Columbia as well. The party also won four seats in Saskatchewan and one seat in Manitoba. Besides taking over nearly all of the PC seats in the West, Reform also won several ridings held by the social democratic New Democratic Party (NDP). Despite sharp ideological differences, Reform&#x27;s populism struck a responsive chord with many NDP voters who were dissatisfied with Audrey McLaughlin&#x27;s leadership. Ultimately, Reform won 52 seats — just two behind the Bloc Québécois, which became the Official Opposition — and came second in the nationwide popular vote, with 16%.

However, Reform did not do as well as hoped east of Manitoba. It was entirely shut out of Atlantic Canada – a region where a much more moderate strain of conservatism has traditionally prevailed. Many Red Tory voters in both Atlantic Canada and Ontario were fed up with the PCs, but found Reform&#x27;s agenda too extreme and shifted to the Liberals. Despite strong support in rural Ontario, vote splitting with the PCs meant that Reform only one seat, Simcoe Centre. As it turned out, this was Reform&#x27;s only victory east of Manitoba, ever. The party also did not run any candidates in Quebec.

The Reform Party&#x27;s success in 1993 was related to the mobilization of people who were opposed to the welfare state, but this represents only one dimension of the party&#x27;s appeal. Jenkins (2002) examines the effect of issues on Reform support during the campaign and considers the actual process by which issues affected party support. Although candidates can prime or stress certain issues for voters, the priming label is sometimes misused. Jenkins makes a distinction between campaign learning and priming. If voters do not know where a party stands on an issue, they cannot adequately employ this information in their overall evaluation. Evidence demonstrates that the increased importance of attitudes toward the welfare state was largely a function of the distribution of new information or learning, while the increased importance of cultural questions represented priming.

===1994–1999: In Parliament===
In one election, the Reform Party had effectively replaced the Progressive Conservative Party as the major right-wing party in Canada. Despite not forming the Official Opposition, the Liberals treated Reform as their main opposition on issues that were not specific to Quebec. Also, when Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard&#x27;s position as Leader of the Opposition granted him a meeting with visiting US President Bill Clinton, Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to defuse Bouchard&#x27;s separatist leverage.

Reform&#x27;s ambitions of becoming a national party and spreading into the east, particularly into Ontario, were helped by the rise of Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris to power in 1995. Harris&#x27; Common Sense Revolution agenda shared much of Reform&#x27;s fiscally neoliberal ideology, including deep spending cuts, privatization of social services, and tax cuts. The party continued to show its ties to Harris as a means to diminish support for the federal PC Party.

Reform claimed credit for pressuring the Liberal government to initiate spending cuts and focus on deficit reduction in 1995, though the party had wanted even deeper cuts. It also managed to put forward its own strategy for national unity after the slim federalist victory in the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty, which advocated deep decentralization of powers from the federal government to the provinces and territories. Manning was critcized, however, for not appearing at federalist rallies in Quebec, as Prime Minister Chrétien and new Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest had done.

Despite some steps forward, Reform came under considerable attack during its tenure in Parliament from 1994 to 1997. The party&#x27;s staunch social conservative stances on bilingualism, immigration, abortion, gay rights, women&#x27;s rights, minority rights, and aboriginal rights led to a large number of Reform MPs making statements that were considered to be intolerant.
From 1996 to the 1997 election, the party&#x27;s executive tried to refurbish the party&#x27;s image and shed its controversial past. A number of ethnic minorities were sought out as Reform candidates for the upcoming 1997 election. Also, Reform changed tactics by running a candidate in every riding in Canada, including those in Quebec. The party increased its total seats to 60 and became the Official Opposition. Despite this breakthrough, however, Reform failed to win any seats east of Manitoba, even losing the one Ontario seat they had. The 1997 election also saw the return of the Progressive Conservative Party to official party status following their electoral dominance of the conservative vote in eastern Canada. The party was considerably hampered in its efforts to reach Francophone voters because of Manning&#x27;s inability to speak fluent French. There was also a perception of the party as being anti-Quebec due to its position on official bilingualism and its opposition to the Meech Lake Accord.

During this time, Reform again came under fire for ostensibly being extremist. The party ran an election ad in which the faces of four key Quebec leaders (Prime Minister Chrétien, PC leader Charest, former Bloc Québécois chief Lucien Bouchard, and new Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe) were crossed out, saying that Canada had been governed too long by Quebec politicians. The response to this ad was negative, and the leaders of the other parties claimed that the ad was an attack on Quebec and that Manning was a bigot.

Disillusionment with the traditional political parties in general had been the impetus behind Reform&#x27;s initial growth, but that growth was now felt to have stalled. Its populist claims were called into question in 1997, when Manning accepted an offer to live at Stornoway, the official residence provided to the leader of the Official Opposition. Manning had previously said that Stornoway was a waste of taxpayer money and that he would not reside there..

In 1997, the Reform Party had also failed to establish itself as the clear right-wing alternative to the Liberal Party. The Progressive Conservative Party, which had been steadily rebuilt under Charest, enjoyed a modest revival in the 1997 election. It won 20 seats, up from the two it had won in the 1993 election. The split in the right-wing vote between Reform and the PCs possibly aided the Liberals to win a second majority government. Some political pundits claimed that it was a divided right which allowed the Liberals to gain a second majority government, and claimed that if the two parties did not put away their differences, the result could repeat itself.

Manning recognized the frustration by Canada&#x27;s right-wing proponents and began discussions towards the launch of a new pan-Canadian party, using &quot;United Alternative&quot; (&quot;UA&quot;) forums to bring grassroots Reformers together with Tories. The goal was to create a small-c conservative political alternative to the Liberals that could woo Ontarian and Atlantic Canadian voters. Manning was supported by the more right-of-centre &quot;Focus Federally For Reform,&quot; while &quot;Grassroots United Against Reform&#x27;s Demise&quot; (&quot;GUARD&quot;) opposed the initiative. The United Alternative proposal created a strong debate in the Reform Party. Manning himself wrote a letter to the effect that he did not want to lead Reform anymore, but would only lead a new party. A leadership review in 1998 managed to officially put aside the differences, with Manning winning a large majority in support of his leadership. Afterwards, Reform steadily progressed towards creating the United Alternative.

=== 2000: Rebranding and aftermath ===
The outcome was the renaming of the Reform Party effective March 27, 2000, as the Canadian Alliance (officially the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance). Manning stood in the first leadership race for the new party, but lost to the younger and Stockwell Day, the treasurer (finance minister) and deputy premier of Alberta. Though the Canadian Alliance was intended to attract a broader base of right-of-centre voters, former Reform members dominated the newly named party. As a result, the Alliance was widely seen as a renamed Reform Party.

In the 2000 election, the Alliance increased its share of the popular vote to 25%, and gained six seats, including two in Ontario. However, the failure to win more than the two seats in Ontario led to questions over Day&#x27;s leadership and calls for greater cooperation with the Progressive Conservative Party. Ultimately, in 2003, the two parties merged to form the new Conservative Party of Canada.

The change of identity to &quot;Canadian Alliance&quot;, and its eventual merger in to the Conservative Party, alienated some of the old Reform populists, who saw the merger as the final demise of the former Reform Party and the return of Tory indifference to western Canadian concerns. This led to the creation of a new &quot;Reform Association of Canada&quot;. &quot;Bring Back Real Reform&quot; also was created by a fringe group of original Reformers from Ontario, with the aim of bringing back a federal Reform Party. Under the tag &quot;Operation Back to the Future&quot;, it was launched in Spring 2005 as an umbrella for all original Reformers across the nation who felt that they were still without a political home. Neither of these groups attracted any support.

==Policies==
A cornerstone of the Reform Party&#x27;s agenda was the rejection of the belief that Canada is a divided country, with division existing between English and French Canada. Instead, Preston Manning called for a &quot;New Canada&quot; with a new identity that would solve existing problems, stating in his book &quot;The New Canada&quot; (1992):

The leaders of Canada&#x27;s traditional federal parties continue to think of our country as &quot;an equal partnership between two founding races, the English and French&quot;—a federation of founding peoples and ethnic groups distinguished by official bilingualism, government-sponsored multiculturalism, and government enterprise. The approach to national unity is to grant special status to those Canadians who feel constitutionally or otherwise disadvantaged. This is Old Canada—and it has become &quot;a house divided against itself&quot;.
Reformers seek a New Canada—a Canada which may be defined as &quot;a balanced, democratic federation of provinces, distinguished by the sustainability of its environment, the viability of its economy, the acceptance of its social responsibilities, and the recognition of the equality and uniqueness of all of its citizens and provinces&quot;. New Canada must include a new deal for aboriginal peoples and a new Senate to address the problem of regional alienation. New Canada must be workable without Quebec, but it must be open and attractive enough to include a New Quebec.
The Reform Party saw the Canadian federal government as led by the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties as being consistently indifferent to Western Canada while focusing too much attention on Eastern Canada (especially Quebec). It noted that the National Energy Program of the 1980s, introduced by a federal Liberal government, involved major government intervention into Canada&#x27;s energy markets to regulate prices, resulting in economic losses to Alberta and benefits to Eastern Canada. It also cited the 1986 decision by a federal Progressive Conservative government to contract the construction of CF-18 military aircraft to an unprepared contractor in Quebec rather than a ready contractor in Winnipeg, Manitoba. To Reformers, these events served as evidence that Liberals and Progressive Conservatives consistently favoured Eastern Canada at the expense of Western Canada.

===Role of government===

====Decentralization and Senate reform====
The Reform Party called for a decentralized Canadian federation in which the provinces would have more authority and advocated that the Canadian federal government ensure provincial equality in Canada such as by creating a Triple-E Senate. The Senate of Canada would become a democratically elected chamber (then and now, the Senate continues to be an appointed body, appointments are still made by the Governor General, but now following the list offered by the Prime Minister) and each province would have an equal number of seats, so that no province would have more power than another. A Triple-E Senate was highly popular in Western Canada, especially Alberta, where the Reform Party drew large support.

====Reductions in government-provided services====
The Reform Party called for the privatization of various government services that the party believed could be better provided by the private sector. These government services included a number of state-owned corporations including Canada Post, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and Petro Canada. The Reform Party suggested that Canada&#x27;s government-funded universal health insurance system be replaced by a two-tier private and public health insurance system. Preston Manning asserted however that the Reform Party was committed to ensuring that all Canadians would be able to access health insurance and health services.

===Economic policy===

====International trade policies====
The Reform Party supported a classical liberal economic plan including support for free trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement.

====Taxation policies====
The Reform Party supported significant tax cuts for citizens and businesses and opposed the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

====Government spending====

In the 1993 federal election, Reform pledged to eliminate Canada&#x27;s chronic budget deficit within a period of three years. However, the Liberals won a majority government and pledged to eliminate the deficit too, though with a more moderate approach.

===Social policy===

====Aboriginal affairs====
The Reform Party called for major changes in the federal government&#x27;s relations with Aboriginal peoples, which included dismantling the Department of Indian Affairs and transferring its responsibilities directly to Aboriginal governing bodies to lessen Aboriginal peoples&#x27; dependence on the federal government.

====Gay rights====
The Reform Party strongly opposed extending marriage rights to gays and lesbians. Many members of the Reform Party saw homosexuality as a moral wrong. Reform leader Preston Manning himself once publicly stated that &quot;homosexuality is destructive to the individual, and in the long run, society&quot;.

====Immigration policy, language, and minority rights====
The Reform Party advocated an immigration policy based solely on the economic needs of Canada and differed from the other main parties by calling for more restrictions on immigration and for an annual limit on migration into Canada. Reform&#x27;s early policy proposals for immigration were seen as highly controversial in Canada including a policy pamphlet called &quot;Blue Sheet&quot; that was issued in mid-1991 stating that Reformers opposed &quot;any immigration based on race or creed or designed to radically or suddenly alter the ethnic makeup of Canada&quot;. The statement was considered too controversial and subsequent Reform Party policy documents did not declare any similar concern for a radical alteration of the ethnic make-up of Canada. By 1993, the party began to soften its image as intolerant of minorities and ahead of the 1997 election sought to both recruit candidates and appeal to voters from ethnic minority backgrounds. In an updated version of the party&#x27;s policy platform released as the &quot;Blue Book&quot; in 1996, Reform supported the acceptance and integration of immigrants and refugees that met the requirements of the UN 1951 Refugee Convention &quot;regardless of race, language or culture&quot; while calling for limits on family migration, barring non-citizens from claiming state unemployment welfare and stricter penalties against illegal immigration. However, the original &quot;Blue Sheet&quot; pamphlet and controversial opinions expressed by individuals within Reform raised the question over whether Reform was intolerant to non-white people and whether the party harboured racist members. Subsequent repeated accounts of xenophobic and racist statements by individual Reform party supporters and members spread this concern, though the party itself continuously denied that it supported such views.

The Reform Party declared its opposition to existing government-funded bilingualism and multiculturalism. Reformers claimed that efforts to create a bilingual country had not worked and that language policy should be a provincial issue. Reformers criticized government-sponsored multiculturalism for creating a &quot;hyphenated Canadian&quot; identity, rather than a single Canadian identity. The party&#x27;s platform called to an end to government initiatives to promote multiculturalism in Canada.

===National unity===
The Reform Party differed greatly with other major federal political parties in regards to national unity, as it did not treat the Francophone province of Quebec in a unique manner. Instead, it believed Quebec was just one province of Canada, all of which were equal and none having a special status. Unlike the other parties, Reform did not believe that Quebec secession should be sought to be avoided at all costs and by all means, because the party believed that this amounted to favouritism to Quebec. Reformers believed that Canada could continue to exist without Quebec, but hoped that offers of decentralization would satisfy the desire of the Quebec government for greater autonomy while still being equitable to all the provinces.

===Public controversies regarding Reform&#x27;s policies===
Manning denied that he and most Reformers based their policies on intolerant views, but admitted that the party&#x27;s populism had an inadvertent effect of drawing in some intolerant people whom Manning claimed he had always sought to keep out. Manning claimed that he was just as committed to purging extremists from the Reform Party as his father Ernest Manning had been when he purged anti-Semites from the Alberta Social Credit Party. He stated that during the 1988 election he was faced with just such an extremist, Doug Collins, who was seeking nomination as a Reform candidate. Many Reform supporters condemned Collins as being racist and said that they would leave the party if he were nominated. Manning responded by sending a letter to the constituency association which called for all candidates to accept the Reform Party&#x27;s denouncement of racism and demanded that Collins accept this. Collins and his supporters refused, and he subsequently failed to win the nomination.

In 1993, Manning was again confronted by an example of intolerance by a Reform Party candidate, John Beck, who made a series of anti-immigrant remarks in an interview with Excalibur, the York University student paper. York students confronted Manning with the remarks, and within an hour, Beck was forced to withdraw his candidacy. Reform Members of Parliament (MP) such as Deborah Grey joined Manning in denouncing such intolerant people who joined the party. Reform MPs Jan Brown and Stephen Harper (who would later become Prime Minister) went against the majority of Reform delegates at the 1994 party convention by refusing to support a motion that called for the party to oppose the allowance of homosexual couples to be treated the same as heterosexual couples. In 1996, after Reform MP Bob Ringma stated in a newspaper interview that store owners should be free to move gays and &quot;ethnics&quot; &quot;to the back of the shop&quot;, or even to fire them if the presence of that individual offended a bigoted customer, and following Reform MP David Chatters&#x27; remark that it would be acceptable for a school to prevent a homosexual person from teaching in school, a crisis erupted in the Reform Party caucus after Manning did not censure their comments. MPs Jan Brown and Jim Silye demanded that Manning reprimand Ringma and Chatters, threatening that they and other moderate Reformers would leave the party if no reprimand was taken. Manning proceeded to suspend Ringma and Chatters for several months but also reprimanded Brown and Silye for speaking out against the party. Brown and Silye both subsequently left the Reform Party and later ran as Progressive Conservative candidates.

In spite of official objections to intolerance by the party leadership and some Reformer MPs, comments and decisions made at party conventions by Reform Party supporters on a number of issues were considered highly intolerant by onlookers. In 1991, Manning was humiliated at a Reform Party rally when a supporter praised him in racist terms, saying, &quot;You&#x27;re a fine white person. You know, we are letting in too many people from the Third World, the low blacks, the low Hispanics. They&#x27;re going to take over the province.&quot; Later in the same rally, another supporter stood up and said, &quot;Let them [Quebeckers] go. We don&#x27;t need Quebec.&quot; Long-time Progressive Conservative member and political commentator Dalton Camp observed the 1994 Reform convention in Ottawa and was personally disgusted with what he heard, saying, &quot;The speechifying gives off acrid whiffs of xenophobia, homophobia, and paranoia—like an exhaust—in which it seems clear both orator and audience have been seized by some private terror: immigrants, lesbians, people out of work or from out of town and criminals.&quot; During the Reform Party policy convention in 1995, Manning urged members to avoid extremism, and a motion was passed saying that the Reform Party recognized the equality of every individual, but only after the delegates demanded that the words &quot;without discrimination&quot; be removed from the motion. The 1995 convention controversially called for the removal of group specification in all human rights legislation which was accepted in the convention by a 93 percent vote in favour. Another controversial motion in the 1995 convention called for tighter regulation of people infected with HIV, which was supported by 84 percent of the delegates. One Reformer delegate raised concern that such a policy on HIV would make the party look anti-homosexual, but another delegate responded to this by saying &quot;I did not join the Reform Party to bow down at the altar of political correctness.&quot;

The Reform Party was plagued by an influx of intolerant people who supported the party&#x27;s opposition to government-funded multicultural programs and bilingual programs. Some have claimed that the large problem of intolerance in the Reform Party was not a mere coincidence of its policies of opposing government-sponsored multicultural programs, but a deliberate effort by the party to rally such intolerant people and to push an intolerant agenda. The media focused on Reform&#x27;s troubles involving intolerant people within the party, which made the party appear to support such intolerance.

On the issue of episodes of racism and extremism within the Reform Party, Manning himself recognized the serious dangers that the political ideology of populism (which the Reform Party supported) posed should racists and extremists infiltrate it and spoke of the serious need for the party to repel such racism and extremism, saying that:

If a revival of grassroots democratic populism is to be characteristic of the revitalization of Canadian federal politics of the 1990s, especially in Quebec and the West, it is of primary importance that its leaders be well versed in ways and means of preventing populism from developing racist or other extremist overtones. (This, of course, is also the number-one challenge facing those attempting to lead the reform movements of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.)&quot;
By 1997, the Reform Party attempted to combat distaste for its views on immigration and minority rights by selecting multiple members of ethnic minority groups as candidates in that year&#x27;s federal election. As a result, multiple minorities became Reform MPs, including Rahim Jaffer (who became Canada&#x27;s first Muslim Member of Parliament), Gurmant Grewal (an Indo-Canadian Sikh who had immigrated to Canada six years earlier), Deepak Obhrai (who was born in Tanzania), and Inky Mark (a Chinese-Canadian). However, these attempts to refurbish the party&#x27;s image were damaged during the 1997 campaign, when Reform released a controversial television advertisement in which the faces of four Quebec politicians (Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest, and separatist Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard) were crossed out, followed by a message saying that Quebec politicians had dominated the federal government for too long and that Reform would end this favouritism towards Quebec. The other party leaders harshly criticized the advertisement and Manning was accused of being &quot;intolerant&quot; and a &quot;bigot&quot; for permitting the advertisement to be aired. Manning however has not held a public negative view of Quebec; in his 1992 book, &quot;The New Canada&quot;, he complimented Quebec for being open to populist third parties, mentioning the Bloc Populaire Canadien, the Ralliement créditiste du Québec, the Parti Québécois, and the Bloc Québécois as examples of populist third parties in the province.

==Related parties==

===Provincial wings===
The Reform Party of Canada had two official provincial wings, that were registered by the party to be kept in a mostly dormant state.

The Reform Party of Ontario ran only one candidate in each election to maintain registration, whilst the Reform Party of Alberta ran candidates in the first two senatorial elections. There were also two unaffiliated provincial parties, the Reform Party of British Columbia and the Reform Party of Manitoba. While they had no official connection to the federal party, they shared a similar political outlook. Both provincial parties are now largely inactive.

The Reform Party of Canada held close association with the provincial Progressive Conservative parties in Alberta under Ralph Klein and Ontario under Mike Harris which held similar economic policies. The Reform Party also supported the populist conservative Saskatchewan Party formed in 1997 as well as the Liberal Party of British Columbia under Gordon Campbell.

===Reform UK===
While there is no direct link between the defunct Canadian federal party and Reform UK, a British political party which has become a serious challenger to the Conservative Party&#x27;s longstanding the dominant right wing party in the United Kingdom, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has described himself as a &quot;great admirer&quot; of Manning and claimed the party&#x27;s current name (changed from Brexit Party in 2020) was largely inspired by Manning&#x27;s former party.

<text>Svetoslav or Svyatoslav Nikolayevich Roerich (; 23 October 1904 – 30 January 1993) was a Russian-Indian painter based in India. He was the son of Helena and Nicholas Roerich and studied from a young age under his father&#x27;s tutelage. He studied architecture in England in 1919 and entered Columbia University&#x27;s school of architecture in 1920. He won the Grand Prix of the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1926.

==Biography==

He lived for many years in India where Jawaharlal Nehru awarded him the International Award and the Padma Bhushan. His paintings of Nehru and Indira Gandhi, adorn the historic Central Parliament Hall in New Delhi. He was married in 1945 to an Indian movie star Devika Rani, who was once married to producer Himanshu Rai and known as &quot;The First Lady of the Indian Screen&quot;. Roerich was born a citizen of the Russian Empire, but became stateless after the Bolshevik Revolution. Resident in India since the 1930s, Roerich became an Indian citizen on 21 March 1960. Roerich died in 1993 at the age of 88 and is buried in Bangalore, India.

He was named an Honorary Academician of the Art Academy of the USSR, and was an honorary member of the Bulgarian Academy of Art.

He had a large plantation on the outskirts of Bangalore, called Tataguni, on Kanakpura road. He and Devika Rani lived here; after their respective deaths in August 2011, the Government of Karnataka acquired the estate after the Supreme Court of India passed the verdict in favour of them.

Roerich family&#x27;s residence in Manali, India, is now home for a gallery of paintings. It is managed by the International Roerich Trust and has been named Roerich Heritage Museum. The gallery was founded by Svetoslav Roerich in 1962.

==Work==
Roerich mainly painted landscapes and portraits.
His paintings were first exhibited in India in 1936–1937 

His portrait of Indira Gandhi was unveiled in the Central Hall of the Parliament of India.

European art historians have considered his paintings to be influenced by expressionism.

<text>Nikolai Konstantinovich Rerikh (), better known as Nicholas Roerich (; October 9, 1874 – December 13, 1947), was a Russian painter, writer, archaeologist, theosophist, philosopher, and public figure. In his youth he was influenced by Russian Symbolism, a movement in Russian society centered on the spiritual. He was interested in hypnosis and other spiritual practices and his paintings are said to have hypnotic expression.

Born in Saint Petersburg, to a well-to-do Baltic German father and to a Russian mother, Roerich lived in various places in the world until his death in Naggar, India. Trained as an artist and a lawyer, his main interests were literature, philosophy, archaeology, and especially art. Roerich was a dedicated activist for the cause of preserving art and architecture during times of war. He was nominated several times to the longlist for the Nobel Peace Prize. The so-called Roerich Pact (for the protection of cultural objects) was signed into law by the United States and most other nations of the Pan-American Union in April 1935.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Raised in late-19th-century St. Petersburg, Roerich enrolled simultaneously at St. Petersburg University and the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1893. He received the title of &quot;artist&quot; in 1897 and a degree in law the next year. He found early employment with the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, whose school he directed from 1906 to 1917. Despite early tensions with the group, he became a member of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s &quot;World of Art&quot; society and was its president from 1910 to 1916.

Artistically, Roerich became known as his generation&#x27;s most talented painter of Russia&#x27;s ancient past, a topic that was compatible with his lifelong interest in archeology. He also succeeded as a stage designer by achieving his greatest fame as one of the designers for Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. His best-known designs were for Alexander Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot; (1909 and later productions), and costumes and set for &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913), composed by Igor Stravinsky.

Along with Mikhail Vrubel and Mikhail Nesterov, Roerich is considered a major representative of Russian Symbolism in art. From an early period of his life, he was influenced by apocrypha and medieval sectarian writings such as the mysterious Dove Book.

Another of Roerich&#x27;s artistic subjects was architecture. His acclaimed publication &quot;Architectural Studies&quot; (1904–1905), consisting of dozens of paintings he made of fortresses, monasteries, churches, and other monuments during two long trips through Russia, inspired his decades-long career as an activist on behalf of artistic and architectural preservation. He also designed religious art for places of worship throughout Russia and Ukraine, most notably the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; fresco for the Church of the Holy Spirit, which the patroness Maria Tenisheva built near her Talashkino estate, and the stained glass windows for the Datsan Gunzechoinei in 1913–1915. His designs for the Talashkino church were so radical that the Orthodox church refused to consecrate the building.

During the first decade of the 1900s and in the early 1910s, Roerich, largely by the influence of his wife, Helena, developed an interest in eastern religions, as well as alternative belief systems such as Theosophy. Both Roerichs became avid readers of the Vedantist essays of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore, and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

The Roerichs&#x27; commitment to occult mysticism increased steadily. It was especially intense during World War I and the 1917 Russian Revolution to which the couple, like other many Russian intellectuals, accorded apocalyptic significance. The influence of Theosophy, Vedanta, Buddhism, and other mystical topics can be detected not only in many of Roerich&#x27;s paintings but also in the many short stories and poems that Roerich wrote before and after the 1917 revolutions, including the &quot;Flowers of Morya&quot; cycle, which was begun in 1907 and completed in 1921.

===Revolution and emigration to United States===

After the February Revolution of 1917 and the end of the czarist regime, Roerich, a political moderate who valued Russia&#x27;s cultural heritage more than ideology and party politics, had an active part in artistic politics. With Maxim Gorky and Aleksandr Benois, he participated with the so-called &quot;Gorky Commission&quot; and its successor organization, the Arts Union (SDI). Both attempted to gain the attention of the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet on the need to form a coherent cultural policy and, most urgently, to protect art and architecture from destruction and vandalism.

Meanwhile, illness forced Roerich to leave the capital and reside in Karelia, the district bordering Finland. He had already quit the presidency of the World of Art society, and he now quit the directorship of the School of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. After the October Revolution and the acquisition of power of Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik Party, Roerich became increasingly discouraged about Russia&#x27;s political future. During early 1918, he, Helena, and their two sons George and Svetoslav immigrated to Finland.

Two unresolved historical debates are associated with Roerich&#x27;s departure. First, it is often claimed that Roerich was a major candidate to direct a people&#x27;s commissariat of culture (the Soviet equivalent of a ministry of culture), which the Bolsheviks considered establishing in 1917–1918, but he refused to accept the job. In fact, Benois was the most likely choice to direct any such commissariat. It seems that Roerich was a preferred choice to manage its department of artistic education; the topic is rendered moot by the fact that the Soviets elected not to establish such a commissariat.

Second, when Roerich later wished to reconcile with the Soviet Union, he maintained that he had not left Soviet Russia deliberately, but that he and his family, living in Karelia, had been isolated from their homeland when the Finnish Civil War began. However, Roerich had an amply-documented extreme hostility to the Bolshevik regime, prompted not so much by a dislike of communism as by his revulsion at Lenin&#x27;s ruthlessness and his fear that Bolshevism would result in the destruction of Russia&#x27;s artistic and architectural heritage. He illustrated Leonid Andreyev&#x27;s anticommunist polemic &quot;S.O.S.&quot; and had a widely-published pamphlet, &quot;Violators of Art&quot; (1918–1919). Roerich believed that &quot;the triumph of Russian culture would come about through a new appreciation of ancient myth and legend.&quot;

After some months in Finland and Scandinavia, the Roerichs relocated to London, arriving in mid-1919. Engrossed with Theosophical mysticism, they now had millenarian expectations that a new age was imminent, and they wished to travel to India as soon as possible. They joined the English-Welsh chapter of the Theosophical Society. It was in London, in March 1920, that the Roerichs founded their own school of mysticism, &quot;Agni Yoga&quot;, which they described as &quot;the system of living ethics.&quot; While in London, Roerich also contributed scenic designs for LAHDA, a cooperative group of Russian theatrical artists led by Theodore Komisarjevsky.

To earn passage to India, Roerich worked as a stage designer for Thomas Beecham&#x27;s Covent Garden Theatre, but the enterprise ended unsuccessfully in 1920, and the artist never received full payment for his work. Among the notable people Roerich befriended while in England were the famed British Buddhist Christmas Humphreys, the philosopher-author H. G. Wells, and the poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (whose grand-niece Devika Rani would later marry Roerich&#x27;s son Svetoslav).

A successful exhibition in London resulted in an invitation from a director at the Art Institute of Chicago, offering to arrange for Roerich&#x27;s art to tour the United States. In the autumn of 1920, the Roerichs traveled to America by sea.

The Roerichs remained in the United States from October 1920 until May 1923. A large exhibition of Roerich&#x27;s art, organized partly by the U.S. impresario Christian Brinton and partly by the Chicago Art Institute, began in New York in December 1920 and toured the country, to San Francisco and back, in 1921 and early 1922. Roerich befriended acclaimed soprano Mary Garden of the Chicago Opera and received a commission to design a 1922 production of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; for her. During the exhibition, the Roerichs spent significant amounts of time in Chicago, New Mexico, and California.

Politically, Roerich was at first anti-Bolshevik. He gave lectures and wrote articles to White Russian populations in which he criticized the Soviet Union. However, his aversion to communism, &quot;the impertinent monster that lies to humanity,&quot; changed in America. Roerich claimed that his spiritual masters, the &quot;Mahatmas&quot; in the Himalayas, were communicating telepathically with him through his wife, Helena, who was a mystic and a clairvoyant.

The beings from an esoteric Buddhist community in India were said to have told Roerich that Russia was destined for a mission on Earth. That led him to formulate his &quot;Great Plan,&quot; which envisaged the unification of millions of Asian peoples through a religious movement using the Future Buddha, or Maitreya, into a &quot;Second Union of the East.&quot; There, the King of Shambhala would, following the Maitreya prophecies, make his appearance to fight a great battle against all evil forces on Earth. Roerich understood that as &quot;perfection towards Common Good.&quot; The new polity was to include southwestern Altai, Tuva, Buryatia, Outer and Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet, with its capital in &quot;Zvenigorod,&quot; the &quot;City of Tolling Bells,&quot; which was to be built at the foot of Mount Belukha, in Altai. According to Roerich, the same Mahatmas revealed to him in 1922 that he was an incarnation of the Fifth Dalai Lama.

Roerichs&#x27; collaboration with Bolshevik diplomats and aim to gather intelligence on the British, led several scholars to place Nicholas Roerich as a participant in the British-Russian colonial Great Game.

In 1923, Roerich, the &quot;practical idealist,&quot; set out to the Himalayas with his wife and his son Yuri. Roerich initially settled in Darjeeling in the same house that the 13th Dalai Lama had stayed during his exile in India. Roerich spent his time painting the Himalayas with visitors such as Frederick Marshman Bailey, Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton, and members of the 1924 British Everest Expedition, as well as Sonam Wangfel Laden La, Kusho Doring, and Tsarong Shape, influential Tibetans. According to British intelligence, lamas from the Moru monastery recognized Roerich as the incarnation of the Fifth Dalai Lama due to a mole pattern on his right cheek. It was during his stay in the Himalayas that Roerich learned about the flight of the 9th Panchen Lama, which he interpreted as the fulfillment of the Matreiya prophecies and the bringing about of the Age of Shambhala.

In 1924, the Roerichs returned to the West. On his way to America, Roerich stopped at the Soviet embassy in Berlin, where he told the local plenipotentiary about a Central Asian expedition he wanted to take. He asked for Soviet protection on his way, and shared his impressions of politics in India and Tibet. Roerich commented on the &quot;occupation of Tibet by the British&quot; by claiming that they &quot;infiltrate in small parties... conduct extensive anti-Soviet propaganda&quot; by talking about &quot;anti-religious activity of the Bolsheviks.&quot; The plenipotentiary later pointed out to one of Roerich&#x27;s old university classmates, Georgy Chicherin, that he had &quot;absolutely pro-Soviet leanings, which looked somewhat Buddho-Communistic,&quot; and that his son, who spoke 28 Asian languages, helped him in gaining the favor with the Indians and the Tibetans.

The Roerichs settled in New York City, which became the base of their many American operations. They founded several institutions during these years: &quot;Cor Ardens&quot; (&quot;Flaming Heart&quot;) and &quot;Corona Mundi&quot; (&quot;Crown of the World&quot;), both of which were meant to unite artists around the globe in the cause of civic activism; the Master Institute of United Arts, an art school with a versatile curriculum, and the eventual home of the first Nicholas Roerich Museum; and an American Agni Yoga Society. They also joined various theosophical societies; their activities with these groups dominated their lives.

===Asian expedition (1925–1929)===
After leaving New York, the Roerichs, together with their son George and six friends began the five-year Roerich Asian Expedition that in Roerich&#x27;s own words &quot;started from Sikkim through Punjab, Kashmir, Ladakh, the Karakoram Mountains, Khotan, Kashgar, Qara Shar, Urumchi, Irtysh, the Altai Mountains, the Oyrot region of Mongolia, the Central Gobi, Kansu, Tsaidam, and Tibet&quot; with a detour through Siberia to Moscow in 1926.

The Roerichs&#x27; Asian expedition attracted attention from the foreign services and intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. In fact, prior to this expedition, Roerich had solicited the help of the Soviet government and Bolshevik secret police to assist him in his expedition by promising in return to monitor British activities in the area, but he received only a lukewarm response from Mikhail Trilisser, the chief of the Soviet foreign intelligence.

The Bolsheviks assisted Roerich with logistics while he was traveling through Siberia and Mongolia. However, they did not commit themselves to his reckless project of the Sacred Union of the East, a spiritual utopia that boiled down to Roerich&#x27;s ambitious attempts to stir the Buddhist masses of inner Asia to create a highly spiritual co-operative commonwealth under the patronage of Bolshevik Russia.

The official mission of his expedition, as Roerich put it, was to act as the embassy of Western Buddhism to Tibet. To the Western media, it was presented as an artistic and scientific enterprise. Roerich reported seeing a metallic oval in the sky over the Tibet; decades later, UFO enthusiasts would claim the Roerich expedition witnessed a &quot;flying saucer&quot;.

Between the summer of 1927 and June 1928, the expedition was thought to have been lost, as communication with them had ceased. They had, in fact, been attacked in Tibet. Roerich wrote that only the &quot;superiority of our firearms prevented bloodshed... In spite of our having Tibet passports, the expedition was forcibly stopped by Tibetan authorities.&quot; They were detained by the government for five months and were forced to live in tents in sub-zero conditions and to subsist on meagre rations. Five men of the expedition died during this time. In March 1928 they were allowed to leave Tibet, and they trekked south to settle in India, where they founded a research center, the Himalayan Research Institute.

In 1929 Roerich was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the University of Paris. He received two more nominations in 1932 and 1935. 
His concern for peace resulted in his creation of the Pax Cultura, the &quot;Red Cross&quot; of art and culture. His work for this cause also resulted in the United States and the 20 other nations of the Pan-American Union signing the Roerich Pact, an early international instrument protecting cultural property, on April 15, 1935 at the White House.

===Manchurian expedition===
In 1934–1935, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, then headed by the Roerich admirer Henry A. Wallace, sponsored an expedition conducted by Roerich, his wife Helena, and its scientists H. G. MacMillan and James F. Stephens to Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and mainland China. The expedition&#x27;s purpose was to collect seeds of plants which prevented soil erosion.

The expedition consisted of two parts. In 1934, they explored the Greater Khingan mountains and Bargan plateau in western Manchuria. In 1935, they explored parts of Inner Mongolia: the Gobi Desert, Ordos Desert, and Helan Mountains. The expedition found almost 300 species of xerophytes, collected herbs, conducted archeological studies, and found antique manuscripts of great scientific importance.

=== Later life ===
Roerich was in India during World War II, where he painted Russian epic heroic and saintly themes, including &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, &quot;The Fight of Mstislav and Rededia,&quot; and &quot;Boris and Gleb&quot;.

In 1942, Roerich received Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, at his house in Kullu. Together they discussed the fate of the new world: &quot;We spoke about Indian–Russian cultural association [...] it is time to think about useful and creative co-operation.&quot;

Indira Gandhi would later recall several days spent together with Roerich&#x27;s family: &quot;That was a memorable visit to a surprising and gifted family where each member was a remarkable figure in himself, with a well-defined range of interests... Roerich himself stays in my memory. He was a man with extensive knowledge and enormous experience, a man with a big heart, deeply influenced by all that he observed.&quot;

During the visit, &quot;ideas and thoughts about closer co-operation between India and USSR were expressed. Now, after India wins independence, they have got its own real implementation. And as you know, there are friendly and mutually-understanding relationships today between both our countries.&quot;

In 1942, the American–Russian cultural Association (ARCA) was created in New York. Its active participants were Ernest Hemingway, Rockwell Kent, Charlie Chaplin, Emil Cooper, Serge Koussevitzky, and Valeriy Ivanovich Tereshchenko. Its activity was welcomed by scientists such as Robert Millikan and Arthur Compton.

Roerich had a lengthy correspondence with Henry Wallace, the 1948 Progressive Party candidate for US president.

==Death==
Roerich died in Kullu on December 13, 1947. His wife, philosopher
Helena Roerich, wrote about this day: “The day of cremation was exceptionally beautiful. Not a single breath of wind and all surrounding mountains were clad in fresh snowy attire.”

==Cultural legacy==


In the 21st century, the Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City is a major institution for Roerich&#x27;s artistic work. Numerous Roerich societies continue to promote his theosophical teachings worldwide. His paintings can be seen in several museums including the Roerich Department of the State Museum of Oriental Arts in Moscow; the Roerich Museum at the International Centre of the Roerichs in Moscow; the Russian State Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia; a collection in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow; a collection in the Art Museum in Novosibirsk, Russia; an important collection in the National Gallery for Foreign Art in Sofia, Bulgaria; a collection in the Art Museum in Nizhny Novgorod Russia; National Museum of Serbia; the Roerich Hall Estate in Naggar, India; the Sree Chitra Art Gallery, Thiruvananthapuram, India; in various art museums in India; and a selection featuring several of his larger works in The Latvian National Museum of Art. A memorial plaque marks the house in Lahaul valley where Roerich lived during summers from 1929 to 1932.

Roerich&#x27;s biography and his controversial expeditions to Tibet and Manchuria have been examined recently by a number of authors, including two Russians, Vladimir Rosov and Alexandre Andreyev, two Americans (Andrei Znamenski and John McCannon), and the German Ernst von Waldenfels.

A series of his studies on the Himalayan Ranges-donated by the artist&#x27;s son (36 works specifically) are even showcased in the Nicholas Roerich Gallery of the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath Museum based in Bangalore, India. The hypnotic, immersive nature of his works truly absorbs the onlooker, leaving one with a sense of peace and tranquility as one moves with the series through the gallery.

H. P. Lovecraft describes Roerich&#x27;s paintings of Asian mountain landscapes as &quot;strange and disturbing&quot; numerous times in his Antarctic horror story &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;.

Roerich was awarded Order of St. Sava. The minor planet 4426 Roerich in the Solar System was named in honor of Roerich. A crater on Mercury, near the south pole, is also named for Roerich.

In June 2013 during Russian Art Week in London, Roerich&#x27;s &quot;Madonna Laboris&quot; sold at auction at Bonhams shop for £7,881,250, including the buyer&#x27;s premium, making it the most valuable painting ever sold at a Russian art auction.

<doc id="216400" wikidata="Q179164" url="?curid=216400" title="Unitary state">
<text>A unitary state is a (sovereign) state governed as a single entity in which the central government is the supreme authority. The central government may create or abolish administrative divisions (sub-national or sub-state units). Such units exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. Although political power may be delegated through devolution to regional or local governments by statute, the central government may alter the statute, to override the decisions of devolved governments or expand their powers.

The modern unitary state concept originated in France; in the aftermath of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, national feelings that emerged from the war unified France. The war accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a unitary state. The French then later spread unitary states by conquests, throughout Europe during and after the Napoleonic Wars, and to the world through the vast French colonial empire. Presently, prefects remain an illustration of the French unitary state system, as the representatives of the State in each department, tasked with upholding central government policies.

Unitary states stand in contrast to federations, also known as &quot;federal states&quot;. A large majority of the UN member countries, 166 out of 193, have a unitary system of government, while significant population and land mass is under some kind of federation.

== Devolution compared with federalism ==
A unitary system of government can be considered to be the opposite of federalism. In federations, the provincial/regional governments share powers with the central government as equal actors through a written constitution, to which the consent of both is required to make amendments. This means that the sub-national units have a right to existence and powers that cannot be unilaterally changed by the central government.

== List of current unitary sovereign states ==
&quot;Italics&quot;: States with limited recognition from other sovereign states or intergovernmental organizations.

===Unitary monarchies===
The United Kingdom is an example of a unitary state. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have a degree of autonomous devolved power, but such power is delegated by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which may enact laws unilaterally altering or abolishing devolution.
Similarly in Spain, the devolved powers are delegated through the central government.

<text>Gwanghaegun or Prince Gwanghae (; 4 June 1575 – 7 August 1641), personal name Yi Hon (), was the 15th monarch of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. As he was deposed in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, he did not receive a temple name.

== Biography ==
=== Birth and background ===
Gwanghaegun was the second son of King Seonjo; born to Royal Noble Consort Gong, a concubine, who later died a year after his birth. He had one older brother.

When Japan invaded Joseon to attack the Ming Empire, he was installed as Crown Prince. When the king fled north to the border of Ming, he set up a branch court and fought defensive battles. During and after the Imjin Wars (1592–1598), despite being Crown Prince, he acted as the de facto ruler of the Joseon Dynasty in 1592, commanding battles and taking care of the reconstruction of the nation after the devastating wars, in the place of old and weak King Seonjo.

Although it brought prestige to him, his position was still unstable. He had an elder but incompetent full-brother Prince Imhae () and a younger but legitimate half-brother Grand Prince Yeongchang (), who was supported by the Lesser Northerners faction. Fortunately for Gwanghae, King Seonjo&#x27;s abrupt death made it impossible for his favorite son Yeongchang to succeed to the throne.

=== Violence of Greater Northerner faction ===
Before King Seonjo died in 1608, he named Prince Gwanghae as his official successor to the throne and ordered his advisers to make a royal document. However, Lyu Young-gyong of the Lesser Northerners faction hid the document and plotted to install Grand Prince Yeongchang as king, only to be found out by the head of the Great Northerners faction (), Jeong In-hong. Lyu was executed immediately.

After the incident, Gwanghae tried to bring officials from various political and regional background to his court, but his plan was interrupted by Greater Northerners including Yi I-cheom and Jeong In-hong. Then, Greater Northerners began to take members of other political factions out of the government, especially Lesser Northerners. In 1613, the Greater Northerners moved against Grand Prince Yeongchang; his maternal grandfather, Kim Je-nam, along with his maternal uncles, was found guilty of treason and executed, while Yeongchang was sent into exile, where he too was executed in 1614. At the same time, Greater Northerners suppressed the Lesser Northerners. In 1618, with the help of Court Lady Kim, Grand Prince Yeongchang&#x27;s mother, Queen Inmok, was stripped of her title and imprisoned along with his younger half-sister, Princess Jeongmyeong. Gwanghae had no power to stop this even though he was the official head of the government.

=== Achievements ===
Despite his poor reputation after his death, he was a talented and pragmatic politician. He endeavored to restore the country and sponsored the restoration of documents. As a part of reconstruction, he revised land ordinance and redistributed land to the people; he also ordered the rebuilding of Changdeokgung along with several other palaces. Additionally, he was responsible for the reintroduction of the &quot;hopae&quot; identification system after a long period of disuse.

In foreign affairs he sought a balance between the Ming Empire and the Manchus. Since he realized Joseon was unable to compete with Manchu military power, he tried to maintain friendly relationship with the Manchus while the kingdom was still under the suzerainty of Ming, which angered the Ming and dogmatic Confucian Koreans. The critically worsened Manchu-Ming relationship forced him to send ten thousand soldiers to aid Ming in 1619. However, the Battle of Sarhū ended in Manchu&#x27;s overwhelming victory. The Korean General Gang Hong-rip lost two-thirds of his troops and surrendered to Nurhaci. Gwanghaegun negotiated independently for peace with the Manchus and managed to avoid another war. He also restored diplomatic relationship with Japan in 1609 when he reopened trade with Japan through Treaty of Giyu, and sent his ambassadors to Japan in 1617.

In the domestic sphere, Gwanghaegun implemented the Daedong law, which let his subjects pay their taxes more easily. However, this law was activated only in Gyeonggi Province, which was the largest granary zone at that time, and it took a century for the law to be extended across the whole kingdom. He encouraged publishing in order to accelerate reconstruction and to restore the kingdom&#x27;s former prosperity. Many books were written during his reign, including the medical book Dongui Bogam, and several historical records were rewritten in this period. In 1616, tobacco was first introduced to Korea and it soon became popular amongst the Korean aristocracy.

=== Dethronement and later life ===

On April 11, 1623, Gwanghaegun was deposed in a coup by the Westerners faction. The coup directed by Kim Yu took place at night, Gwanghaegun fled but was captured later. He was confined first on Ganghwa Island and then on Jeju Island, where he died in 1641. He does not have a royal mausoleum like the other Joseon rulers. His and Lady Ryu&#x27;s remains were buried at a comparatively humble site in Namyangju in Gyeonggi Province. The Westerners faction installed Neungyanggun as the sixteenth king Injo who promulgated pro-Ming and anti-Manchu policies, which resulted in two subsequent Manchu invasions.

== Legacy ==
Gwanghaegun is one of only two deposed kings who were not restored and given a temple name (the other one being Yeonsangun).

He remains a polarizing figure among historians. Historian Oh Hang-nyeong strongly criticized the king, writing that he &quot;practically used up the country&#x27;s entire budget solely for the construction of palaces, his policies were flawed and moreover, he was absent in many of the cabinet meetings. Gwanghaegun failed to communicate with his servants and with his people.&quot; However, historian Lee Duk-il praised the king, did that he &quot;indeed made some political errors, but during his reign, the famous oriental medical book &#x27;Donguibogam&#x27; was published and he created the tax system &#x27;Daedong law&#x27; that was enforced for the benefit of the people.&quot; Despite the controversy over the king&#x27;s handling of domestic policies, most historians have a positive assessment of Gwanghae&#x27;s acts regarding foreign affairs.

<doc id="216404" wikidata="Q1587980" url="?curid=216404" title="Harvey Wallbanger">
<text>The Harvey Wallbanger is a mixed drink made with vodka, Galliano, and orange juice. It is a variant of the screwdriver, and was very popular in the United States in the 1970s.

==History==
The Harvey Wallbanger was created in 1969 as a marketing campaign by McKesson Imports Company, importer of Galliano, as a means of promoting Galliano. The campaign was headed by George Bednar, marketing director of McKesson, and a cartoon character was commissioned from graphic artist William J. &quot;Bill&quot; Young in Lima, New York, with the tagline that Bednar claimed to have penned: &quot;Harvey Wallbanger is the name. And I can be made!&quot; The Harvey Wallbanger character was a surfer, appearing in various ads during the campaign, and was mentioned in print as early as 1969, continuing into the 1970s. The recipe displayed in the ads is: &quot;6 oz. O.J., 1 oz. vodka, stir with ice, splash in oz. Galliano&quot;. 

The cocktail itself is credited to three-time world champion mixologist Donato &quot;Duke&quot; Antone, of Hartford, Connecticut, where he ran a bartending school, Bartending School of Mixology, and worked as a cocktail consultant. It is unclear if Antone designed the drink for Galliano (to advertise the ingredient), or renamed an existing drink, as suggested by his grandson, who claimed the earlier version was called &quot;Duke&#x27;s Screwdriver&quot;. An implausible story of the origin is that it was invented in 1952 by Antone, and named after a surfer frequenting Antone&#x27;s Blackwatch Bar on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. This is implausible because at the time, Antone was running a bartending school in Hartford, and there is no evidence of any &quot;Blackwatch Bar&quot; in Los Angeles at the time, so it is presumably a fabrication; spirits writer Robert Simonson goes so far as to say that &quot;no sane person ever believed that story.&quot;

Cocktail historian David Wondrich considers the Harvey Wallbanger the first successful consultant-created cocktail saying,

Antone is also credited with the Freddy Fudpucker, which swaps vodka for tequila, but this was not nearly as popular.

<text>The Club for Growth is a 501(c)(4) political organization active in the United States, with a fiscally conservative agenda focused on tax cuts and other economic policy issues.

Club for Growth&#x27;s largest funders are billionaires Jeff Yass and Richard Uihlein. The club has two political arms: Club for Growth PAC, a traditional political action committee, and Club for Growth Action, an independent-expenditure only committee or super-PAC.

According to its website, the Club for Growth&#x27;s policy goals include cutting income tax rates, repealing the estate tax, supporting limited government and a balanced budget amendment, entitlement reform (including Social Security reform, Medicare and Medicaid reform), tort reform, school choice, and deregulation.

In 2003 through 2004, the Club for Growth was the largest single funder for Republican House and Senate candidates, outside of the Republican Party itself.

The group has opposed government action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and called on President Trump to exit the Paris Climate Agreement.

The Club for Growth PAC endorses and raises money for candidates who meet its standards for fiscal conservatism. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, &quot;The Club for Growth is the pre-eminent institution promoting Republican adherence to a free-market, free-trade, anti-regulation agenda.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described the group as &quot;one of the biggest backers&quot; of Republicans who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 United States presidential election, having spent around $20 million on their campaigns in 2018 and 2020.

== History ==
The Club for Growth was founded in 1999 by Stephen Moore, Thomas L. Rhodes, and Richard Gilder. Moore served as the first president of the Club from 1999 until December 2004, when board members voted to remove Moore as president. In 2003 through 2004, the Club for Growth was the largest single fundraiser for Republican House and Senate candidates, outside of the Republican Party itself, raising nearly $22 million.

Future Pennsylvania United States Senator Pat Toomey served as president from 2005 until his resignation in April 2009. Former Indiana Congressman Chris Chocola succeeded Toomey. Chocola served as president through December 2014. He remains a member of the Club&#x27;s board. Former Indiana Congressman David McIntosh was named president in January 2015.

On September 19, 2005, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) filed suit against the Club for Growth alleging violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act for failing to register as a political action committee in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 congressional elections. In September 2007, the Citizens Club for Growth (the Club for Growth changed its name) and the FEC agreed to settle the lawsuit. According to their joint filing, Citizens Club for Growth said &quot;that it operated under the good faith belief that it had not triggered political committee status ... [and] [f]or the purposes of this settlement, and in order to avoid protracted litigation costs, without admitting or denying each specific basis for the [FEC&#x27;s] conclusions,&quot; Citizens Club for Growth no longer contested the alleged violations and agreed to pay $350,000 in civil penalties.

According to the Associated Press, the settlement was one of &quot;a series of actions by the FEC to penalize independent political groups that spent money to influence elections but did not register as political committees. The groups, called 527 organizations for the section of the IRS code ... , played a significant role in the 2004 congressional and presidential elections by raising unlimited amounts of money from labor groups, corporations and wealthy individuals.&quot; On June 25, 2012, U.S. District Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins issued an order stating that the FEC &quot;is FORMALLY REPRIMANDED as a sanction for violating explicitly clear orders&quot; (emphasis in original text) regarding confidentiality in the 2007 settlement agreement.&quot;

In 2010, the Club&#x27;s political arms spent about $8.6 million directly on candidates and bundled another $6 million from Club members, directing those funds to candidates. In 2012, according to OpenSecrets, Club members donated at least $4 million, and the Club&#x27;s political arms spent nearly $18 million on elections.

In 2013, the Club for Growth super PAC&#x27;s donors included Peter Thiel, an early backer of Facebook and a co-founder of PayPal, who gave $2 million; Virginia James ($1.2 million); John W. Childs ($1.1 million), chairman and founder of the Boston-based private equity firm J.W. Childs Associates; Robert D. Arnott ($750,000), the chairman and chief executive of California-based Research Affiliates; Robert Mercer, the co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies and part-owner of Cambridge Analytica, gave $600,000; and hedge fund manager Paul Singer gave $100,000.

The Club for Growth&#x27;s super PAC, which historically has been most active in Republican primary elections, spent more in general elections in the 2018 cycle than it ever had before. This trend was expected to continue into 2020. Club for Growth president David McIntosh described the Club&#x27;s evolution, saying &quot;We want to be the political arm of the conservative movement—inside the Republican Party.&quot;

In June 2020, &quot;The Hill&quot; wrote that the Club was &quot;flexing its financial muscle this year, doling out millions of dollars to conservative congressional candidates and outspending most other outside groups as it looks to help the GOP keep control of the Senate and improve Republican chances in the House.&quot; The Club for Growth raised $55 million in 2020, &quot;making 2020 its most lucrative cycle yet.&quot; The Club, which said it planned to spend at least $35 million in the 2020 election cycle, outspent most other groups not affiliated with presidential candidates. According to a Guardian analysis, the organization was one of the biggest backers of the Republican lawmakers who tried to overturn the 2020 US election results. It spent $20m to support its campaigns in 2018 and 2020. One of the largest donors was Jeffrey Yass who in 2020 donated $20.7m to the Club.

== Mission ==

Founder Stephen Moore has said, &quot;We want to be seen as the tax cut enforcer in the [Republican] party.&quot; Unlike many other political action committees, the Club for Growth&#x27;s PAC regularly participates in funding candidates for primary elections. The Club focuses more on open seats than on challenging sitting Republicans, but it has helped to unseat a number of incumbent Republicans. The Club for Growth has established a vetting process for potential candidates that involves one or more interviews, research on the race and the candidate&#x27;s record, and a poll conducted to establish whether the candidate has a viable chance for victory. Each election cycle, the Club&#x27;s PAC endorses candidates and encourages donors to support the endorsed candidates. Promoting a more conservative agenda, the Club is known for targeting &quot;establishment&quot; Republican candidates.

== Issue advocacy ==

=== 2003 ===
In 2003, the original Club for Growth strongly opposed the Medicare prescription drug benefit proposal. The Club for Growth strongly supported the Bush tax cuts of 2003 and ran television ads against two Republicans who voiced opposition to the tax cuts. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Last spring, [Club for Growth president Steve] Moore attacked two Republican Senators who were resisting the latest tax cut: George Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia Snowe of Maine. He ran ads in each of their states in which he compared them with the French president, Jacques Chirac. Karl Rove, President Bush&#x27;s political advisor, stated that the ads were &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;counterproductive&quot;.

=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Pat Toomey became president and the Club for Growth created a congressional scorecard. The Club&#x27;s first key vote alert was an amendment sponsored by a Democrat. Representative Earl Blumenauer offered an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that would have reduced the sugar program by 6 percent. The Club for Growth supported the amendment, which failed, 146–280.

The Club fought to support the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2005, running print advertisements in local Beltway publications in the Washington, DC area. According to &quot;Roll Call&quot;, &quot;Former Rep. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), president of the Club for Growth, a CAFTA supporter, said his group continued running advertisements before the Congressional vote.&quot;

The Club opposed the 2005 highway bill. President Bush threatened to veto the bill but did sign it. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; quoted David Keating saying, &quot;For fiscal conservatives, it&#x27;s frustrating to watch ... He&#x27;s beginning to lose all credibility with these veto threats.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Club for Growth, a conservative group that funds like-minded candidates for Congress, has turned the highway legislation into a bumper sticker for the GOP&#x27;s fiscal failings.

Keating said to the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;It is a pork-laden bill.&quot; &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported Toomey saying,

&quot;This is a defining moment. The Republican Party came to power in 1995 by advocating limited government. But in the last four to five years, there has been no evidence that the Republican officials in the federal government have any remaining commitment to this vital principle.&quot;

During the debate on the highway bill, the Club supported an amendment by Tom Coburn that would defund the noted Gravina Island Bridge, from Ketchikan to the island in Southeast Alaska.

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot; decision, the Club gained an appropriations amendment by Scott Garrett to prohibit funds in the bill from being used to enforce the Court&#x27;s decision. The amendment passed, 231–189. The Club for Growth PAC highlighted this vote when it targeted Joe Schwarz, a House Republican who it helped defeat in 2006, claiming he was too liberal.

=== 2006 ===
In the spring of 2006, the Club opposed the 527 Reform Act, which curtailed spending by such political organizations. It led a coalition of center-right groups in sending letters to Congress to support its position. The House passed the 527 Reform Act by a margin of 218–209, but the Senate did not consider the legislation.

The Club for Growth supported various amendments to cut earmarks in the budget, such as &quot;dairy education&quot; and a &quot;wine initiative.&quot; The Club included assessment of sponsorship of the card check bill in its scorecard. If lawmakers co-sponsored the bill, they were docked points in the rating system.

=== 2007 ===
The Club for Growth issued a new scorecard in 2007 that highlighted how House members voted on several amendments that defunded earmarks. Sixteen congressmen scored a perfect 100% on the so-called &quot;RePORK Card&quot;, voting for all 50 anti-pork amendments. They were all Republicans. Conversely, 105 congressmen (81 Democrats and 24 Republicans) scored a 0%, voting against every single amendment. In 2007, the Club also scored against House bills that increased the minimum wage, implemented card check, and sought caps on CEO pay. In the Senate, the Club scored against bills that increased the minimum wage, passage of the farm bill, and the SCHIP healthcare plan.

In 2007, the Club for Growth opposed protectionist policies against China. Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had proposed a bill to apply large tariffs on Chinese imports if that country did not increase the value of its currency. In response, the Club sponsored a petition of 1,028 economists who stated their opposition to protectionist policies against China. The list of economists included Nobel Laureates Finn Kydland, Edward Prescott, Thomas Schelling, and Vernon Smith. The petition played off a similar petition that was also signed by 1,028 economists in 1930 that opposed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.

=== 2008–09 ===
In 2008 and 2009, the Club for Growth opposed the $787 billion stimulus bill, Cash for Clunkers, cap and trade legislation, the Wall Street bailout, the auto bailout, the Affordable Care Act and the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

After Barack Obama was elected president in November 2008, Club President Pat Toomey penned an op-ed that included the results of a poll commissioned by the Club: &quot;A poll commissioned by the Club for Growth in 12 swing congressional districts over the past weekend shows that the voters who made the difference in this election still prefer less government—lower taxes, less spending and less regulation—to Obama&#x27;s economic liberalism. Turns out, Americans didn&#x27;t vote for Dems because they support their redistributionist agenda, but because they are fed up with the GOPers in office. This was a classic &#x27;throw the bums out&#x27; election, rather than an embrace of the policy views of those who will replace them.&quot;

In 2009, the Club produced another &quot;RePORK Card&quot;. This time there were 22 House members with a 100% score: 1 Democrat and 21 Republicans. At the bottom, 211 House members received a 0% score: 202 Democrats and 9 Republicans.

=== 2010 ===
The Club for Growth launched its Repeal It! campaign in 2010 in an attempt to help build public support for undoing the Affordable Care Act. In 2010, more than 400 federal lawmakers and candidates signed the Repeal It! pledge, including more than 40 of the incoming freshman class of congressmen and senators.

The Club for Growth advocated the discharge petition, a proposal that would have forced a House vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act. At the time, Keith Olbermann said: &quot;The petition, which would need 218 signatures to force House Speaker Pelosi to put the repeal bill up for a vote, went largely ignored. As &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; reports, on Monday it had only 30 signatures. That is until the right wing group Club For Growth e-mailed its members, explaining Mr. [Steve] King&#x27;s discharge petition will be considered as a key vote on the club&#x27;s annual Congressional scorecard. That scorecard is considered one of the gold standards of conservative rankings. That and the Spanish Inquisition. So by Tuesday, the petition had 22 more signatures.&quot;

=== 2011–12 ===
The Club was involved in the debate over the debt ceiling that took place in August 2011. The Club endorsed and strongly supported &quot;Cut Cap and Balance&quot; and ran issue ads urging Republicans to &quot;show some spine&quot; on maintaining the debt ceiling.

The Club opposed the re-authorization of the Export-Import Bank. The Club also took a strong position against Republicans voting for tax increases during the debate over the so-called &quot;fiscal cliff&quot;. The Club opposed the &quot;Plan B&quot; tax increase proposed by John Boehner and also opposed the final deal.

=== 2013 ===
In September 2013, Club for Growth made voting on the Continuing Appropriations Resolution a key vote, announcing it track how representatives voted on the bill and make that part of their congressional scorecard. The group urged representatives to vote yes, particularly with defunding ObamaCare in mind.

The Club for Growth opposed the Ryan-Murray Budget deal. It also opposed the 2013 farm bill, which failed for the first time in the bill&#x27;s 40-year history.

=== 2014 ===
The Club&#x27;s PAC spent $3.1 million ($2.4 million on independent expenditures and $700,000 on ads) or nearly half of the $7.8 million which it spent in 2014 on Chris McDaniel&#x27;s effort to defeat Thad Cochran in the United States Senate Republican primary election in Mississippi, 2014.

=== 2015 ===
From April through June 2015, the Club for Growth spent $1 million on television ads in nine congressional districts, urging the members of Congress in those districts to oppose re-authorization of the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank). Additional advertisements were announced in two districts in Utah, but were cancelled when the members declared their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank. In addition, the Club for Growth announced a key vote against re-authorization of the Ex-Im Bank.

The Club for Growth produced a series of policy papers on the positions taken by major Republican presidential candidates on the government&#x27;s role in economic growth. The eleven papers examined the records and remarks of the candidates on issues such as tax reform, government spending, entitlement reform, and free trade. The Club concluded that Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio were the most likely candidates to enact pro-growth policies if elected president.

In October 2015, the Club for Growth announced a key vote against the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, saying that it would include a $1.5 trillion in the debt ceiling and a $112 billion increase in federal spending.

=== Climate change ===
The Club for Growth has opposed government action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In 2009, the Club for Growth pressured Republican politicians not to support a cap-and-trade bill, which the group viewed as being &quot;extremely harmful to the economy.&quot; In 2011, the group issued a white paper criticizing presidential candidate Mitt Romney&#x27;s regulatory record as Massachusetts governor, including his support of global warming policies. In 2017, the group called on President Trump to exit the Paris Agreement.

=== Internal Revenue Service ===
The Club for Growth opposes efforts to fund the Internal Revenue Service. In 2021, the Club for Growth claimed that efforts to fund the IRS were intended to aggressively pursue conservatives and that it was one of the &quot;vicious tactics of the radical socialist left&quot;.

=== Congressional scorecard ===
Since 2005, the Club for Growth has produced an annual congressional scorecard. Each member of Congress receives a score on a scale of 0 to 100. The Club for Growth awards a &quot;Defender of Economic Freedom&quot; award to members of Congress who receive a 90% above on the annual scorecard and have a lifetime score of at least 90%. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Club&#x27;s release of its annual scorecard as &quot;set upon by Republicans like the Oscar nominations list by Hollywood, with everyone dying to know who ranks where, especially in election years&quot;.

The Club&#x27;s 2015 congressional scorecard was based on 29 House votes and 25 Senate votes. Mike Lee was the only U.S. Senator to receive a perfect score. Ben Sasse was ranked second among U.S. Senators, followed by Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. On the U.S. House side, John Ratcliffe, Tim Huelskamp, and Scott DesJarlais received perfect scores.

The Club for Growth Foundation&#x27;s 2017 Congressional Scorecard was released in February 2018. Andy Biggs, a Republican from Arizona, was the only member of the U.S. House to receive a 100% rating. A total of 29 members of the U.S. House received a score of at least 90%. In the U.S. Senate, Jeff Flake, Pat Toomey, and James Lankford scored 100%, while four other senators scored at least 90%.

The Club for Growth&#x27;s 2018 Congressional Scorecard awarded twenty members of the U.S. House and five U.S. Senators scores of at least 90%. Four U.S. Senators (Jeff Flake, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Pat Toomey) and three U.S. Representatives (Justin Amash, Andy Biggs, and Paul Gosar) received perfect scores. Susan Collins received the lowest score among Republican senators while Brian Fitzpatrick and Christopher Smith were the lowest scoring Republican members of the U.S. House.

== Club for Growth PAC ==

=== 2004 ===
In 2004, the Club for Growth&#x27;s PAC endorsed and supported U.S. Representative Pat Toomey, who challenged incumbent Senator Arlen Specter in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania. The PAC was reported to have collected contributions totaling over for Toomey. It also spent $1 million on its own independent television advertising campaign on Toomey&#x27;s behalf. Specter, who had the support of President Bush, the RNC, and Sen. Rick Santorum, defeated Toomey by a narrow margin of 51–49%. Afterward Toomey accepted the position as President of the Club for Growth, where he served until April 2009.

=== 2006 ===
The original Club&#x27;s PAC supported the electoral bids of freshmen U.S. Congressman Adrian Smith (R-NE), Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Bill Sali (R-ID), and Tim Walberg (R-MI), who all were elected. &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; wrote that Smith&#x27;s views did not differ greatly from those of his primary election rivals, but the endorsement of the Club for Growth&#x27;s PAC &quot;gave him the imprimatur of the most fiscally conservative candidate, and it helped boost him to the top of the campaign fundraising competition.&quot;

In the 2006 primaries, the Club&#x27;s PAC recommended to its donors that they support incumbent Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-TX), the first time the Club&#x27;s PAC recommended support for a Democrat. Cuellar won the primary race against former Congressman Ciro Rodriguez. The Club&#x27;s PAC endorsed four candidates for U.S. Senate, including Mike Bouchard in Michigan, Mike McGavick in Washington, Michael Steele in Maryland, and Stephen Laffey in Rhode Island, who did not win.

Support by the Club&#x27;s PAC was not a guarantee of success: its candidate Sharron Angle was defeated in the Republican primary in Nevada&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, although it spent more than $1 million on her campaign. The Club&#x27;s PAC also supported primary campaigns of Phil Krinkie in Minnesota and Kevin Calvey in Oklahoma, who lost, as did incumbent congressman Chris Chocola in Indiana, John Gard in Wisconsin, and Rick O&#x27;Donnell in Colorado.

The Club&#x27;s PAC supported the reelection of Steve Chabot in Ohio.

=== 2007 ===
The Club&#x27;s PAC endorsed state senator Steve Buehrer in the special election for Ohio&#x27;s 5th congressional district to replace the deceased Rep. Paul Gillmor. Buehrer however was defeated by Bob Latta, the son of former Rep. Del Latta, in the Republican primary in November 2007 by a 44% to 40% margin.

The Club&#x27;s PAC endorsed Paul Jost, the chairman of the Virginia chapter of the Club for Growth, in the contest to replace deceased Rep. Jo Ann Davis in Virginia&#x27;s 1st congressional district. In the nominating convention, Jost was defeated by state delegate Rob Wittman.

=== 2008 ===
In Maryland&#x27;s 1st congressional district, the Club&#x27;s PAC endorsed state senator Andrew P. Harris against nine term incumbent Wayne Gilchrest. In the February 12 primary, Harris surged to a strong 44% to 32% victory. Gilchrest became the second incumbent Republican to be defeated by a candidate supported by the Club. The first was Rep. Joe Schwarz in Michigan in 2006. Harris was, however, unable to win the general election.

In Georgia&#x27;s 10th congressional district, the Club&#x27;s PAC endorsed incumbent Paul Broun who defeated state representative Barry Fleming 71% to 29% in the July 15, 2008, primary election. Broun&#x27;s victory surprised many political observers.

In Arizona&#x27;s 5th congressional district, the Club&#x27;s PAC endorsed former Maricopa County Treasurer David Schweikert, who narrowly defeated former candidate Susan Bitter-Smith by a margin of 30% to 28%; there were three other candidates. He did not win the general election.

During the 2008 Republican presidential primaries, the Club&#x27;s PAC was critical of Mike Huckabee, attacking him as the &quot;tax-increasing liberal governor of Arkansas&quot;. Huckabee, in turn, referred to the Club for Growth as the &quot;Club for Greed&quot;.

=== 2009 ===
The Club&#x27;s PAC endorsed in the special election in New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district the Conservative Party of New York candidate, Doug Hoffman instead of Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava. With the Club pouring money into Hoffman&#x27;s campaign, Scozzafava realized that she could not win and withdrew from the race the Sunday before the November 3 special election, endorsing the Democratic candidate Bill Owens. Owens won the election in a district where portions had not had a Democratic congressman since the 19th century.

=== 2010 ===
Of the 26 general election candidates endorsed by Club for Growth in 2010, 20 won election. The following chart lists candidates endorsed by the Club:
=== 2012 ===
In 2012, the Club for Growth PAC endorsed eighteen congressional candidates, nine of whom won their elections:
=== 2014 ===
=== 2016 ===
==== U.S. presidential election ====
With regard to the 2016 Republican presidential primary candidates, the Club for Growth was critical of Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Donald Trump. In August 2015, Club for Growth President David McIntosh said that Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz are &quot;the real deal candidates, the gold standard of the race,&quot; and that while questions remained, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker showed some pro-growth stances.

In August 2015, the Club for Growth PAC announced it would formally support presidential candidates for the first time, saying the group would bundle donations for Cruz, Rubio, Walker, Bush, and Paul. Club for Growth President David McIntosh said &quot;Five candidates are at the forefront of the Republican presidential field on issues of economic freedom, and the Club for Growth PAC is standing with them to help them stand out from the rest.&quot; In October 2015, McIntosh said Cruz and Rubio were &quot;the gold standard&quot; of Republican presidential candidates.

The Club for Growth&#x27;s Super PAC, Club for Growth Action, was particularly critical of Trump&#x27;s candidacy, announcing a $1 million Iowa advertising buy against his campaign in September 2015. The Club for Growth Action was the first third-party group to spend significant sums against Donald Trump. The Club for Growth announced a $1.5 million advertising buy in Florida in March 2016. The group&#x27;s advertisements highlighted Trump&#x27;s support for liberal policies, such as a single-payer health insurance system and tax increases.

In March 2016, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that the Club for Growth PAC planned to deny congressional endorsements to any candidates who endorsed Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential bid before the nomination was actually clinched. The Club&#x27;s PAC noted that the warning did not apply to those who endorsed Trump after the May 3, 2016, Indiana primary. Also in March 2016, the Club for Growth PAC endorsed Ted Cruz for president. The Club for Growth PAC had never previously endorsed in a presidential race. According to Club for Growth head David McIntosh, &quot;This year is different because there is a vast gulf between the two leading Republican candidates on matters of economic liberty. Their records make clear that Ted Cruz is a consistent conservative who will fight to shrink the federal footprint, while Donald Trump would seek to remake government in his desired image.&quot;

==== U.S. congressional elections ====
In North Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, Club for Growth Action opposed incumbent Renee Ellmers without endorsing a specific candidate. She was defeated in the primary.
=== 2017 ===
The Club for Growth endorsed Bob Gray to represent Tom Price&#x27;s district after he left to lead the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The group reportedly also bought $250,000 of airtime on Atlanta cable against early Republican front-runner Karen Handel. The special election took place on April 18, 2017, with Republican Karen Handel defeating Gray and winning a runoff election on June 20, 2017, against Democrat Jon Ossoff.

The organization endorsed Ralph Norman in the Republican primary to replace Mick Mulvaney in South Carolina&#x27;s 5th congressional district. Norman won the primary and went on to defeat Archie Parnell in the general election. The organization also endorsed Christopher Herrod&#x27;s candidacy in the special election to replace Jason Chaffetz.

=== 2018 ===
The Club for Growth PAC endorsed Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel in his bid to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown in the 2018 United States Senate election in Ohio. Mandel dropped out of the race in January 2018.

===2019===
In the 2019 special election in North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district, the Club for Growth endorsed state senator Dan Bishop in the 10-candidate Republican primary field. Bishop advanced from the primary and defeated Democrat Dan McCready in the general special election on September 10, 2019.

In the 2019 special election in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 12th congressional district, the Club for Growth endorsed Fred Keller, who advanced to the general election. Keller won the general special election held on May 21, 2019.

In the 2019 special election in North Carolina&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, the Club for Growth endorsed Celeste Cairns in the 17-person Republican primary field. Cairns did not advance to the runoff primary.

=== 2020 ===
Club for Growth supported the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump, who lost to Joe Biden.
=== 2022 ===
On April 9, Donald Trump welcomed David McIntosh onstage during a rally in North Carolina. Trump praised McIntosh, stating, &quot;He’s a winner. He’s a fighter. We are undefeated when we work together.&quot; McIntosh responded, &quot;You are a great man. … I am so proud to partner with you.&quot;

On April 15, Donald Trump officially endorsed JD Vance for the 2022 United States Senate election in Ohio. After this endorsement, Club for Growth continued their negative ad campaign against Vance, and doubled down on April 27 with an ad attacking Vance for negative statements he made about Trump in 2016. According to The New York Times&#x27; Maggie Haberman, Trump reacted to this advertisement by having an assistant send a three word message to McIntosh, &quot;Go f*** yourself.&quot;
=== 2024 ===
David McIntosh, the organization&#x27;s president, has endorsed Trump for president. The organization has favorably commented about Trump&#x27;s campaign. Note that not all these races were in swing seats, meaning those in safe seats were highly likely to have won after winning the nomination.

<text>David Hykes (born March 2, 1953) is an American composer, singer, musician, author, and meditation teacher. He was one of the earliest modern western pioneers of overtone singing, and since 1975 has developed a comprehensive approach to contemplative music which he calls Harmonic Chant (harmonic singing). After early research and trips studying Mongolian, Tibetan, and Middle Eastern singing forms, Hykes began a long series of collaborations with traditions and teachers of wisdom and sacred art, including the Dalai Lama and the Gyuto and Gyume monks.

Hykes founded the Harmonic Choir in 1975, and has performed and taught Harmonic Chant and the related Harmonic Presence work in America, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, Australia and many other countries. Of overtone singing and his own study of the form, music theorist Charles Madden writes, &quot;David Hykes has done everything I had hoped to do, and more.&quot; His choir incorporates both basic overtone singing as well as additional advanced forms.

His work is organised within The Harmonic Presence Foundation.

His song, &quot;Rainbow Voice&quot;, has been featured in the films &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Blade&quot; (1998), &quot;Baraka&quot; (1992), and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989).

==Education==
Hykes was educated at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio where he studied with avant-garde experimental filmmakers Tony Conrad and Paul Sharits, free jazz with the Cecil Taylor Unit, and contemporary, classical and medieval music with John Ronsheim and David Stock. He received an M.F.A. from Columbia University in New York in 1993. For many years he studied North Indian raga singing and the history of Indian music with Sheila Dhar.

David Hykes is a Dharma student of Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche, who gave him the name Shenpen Yeshe, &quot;the Primordial Wisdom that brings happiness to beings,&quot; and Tsoknyi Rinpoche. He completed twenty years of spiritual studies in the Gurdjieff Foundations in New York, San Francisco, and Paris, as a student of Gurdjieff&#x27;s successors Lord John Pentland and Dr. Michel de Salzmann. Over the years he has received teachings from Tibetan Buddhist masters including Dhuksey Rinpoché and the Dalai Lama, as well as the Gyuto and Gyume Monks, whom he helped bring to the United States for the first time in 1985–86.

<doc id="216409" wikidata="Q465060" url="?curid=216409" title="Devika Rani">
<text>Devika Rani Chaudhuri (30 March 1908 – 9 March 1994), usually known as Devika Rani, was an Indian actress who worked in Hindi films. She was the first recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and was awarded the Padma Shri. Widely acknowledged as the First Lady of Indian cinema, Devika Rani is regarded as one of the greatest actresses. One of the highest-paid actress of the 1930s early 1940s, she appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actresses&quot; list in 1940 and 1941.

Born into a wealthy, anglicized Indian family, Devika Rani was sent to boarding school in England at age nine and grew up in that country. In 1928, she met Himanshu Rai, an Indian film-producer, and married him the following year. She assisted in costume design and art direction for Rai&#x27;s experimental silent film &quot;A Throw of Dice&quot; (1929). Both of them then went to Germany and received training in film-making at UFA Studios in Berlin. Rai then cast himself as hero and her as heroine in his next production, the bilingual film &quot;Karma&quot;, made simultaneously in English and Hindi. The film premiered in England in 1933, elicited interest there for a prolonged kissing scene featuring the real-life couple, and flopped badly in India. The couple returned to Bombay, India in 1934, where Himanshu Rai established a production studio, Bombay Talkies, in partnership with certain other people. They changed their studio name. The studio produced several successful films over the next 5–6 years in that time of period, and Devika Rani played the lead role in many of them. Her on-screen pairing with Ashok Kumar became popular in India.

Following Rai&#x27;s death in 1940, Devika Rani took control of the studio and produced some more films in partnership with her late husband&#x27;s associates, namely Sashadhar Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar. As she was to recollect in her old age, the films which she supervised tended to flop Or average hit, while the films supervised by the partners tended to be hits. In 1945, she retired from films, married the Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich and moved to his estate on the outskirts of Bangalore, thereafter leading a very reclusive life for the next five decades. Her persona, no less than her film roles, were considered socially unconventional. Her awards include the Padma Shri (1958), Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1969) and the Soviet Land Nehru Award (1990).
==Background and education==
Devika Rani was born as Devika Rani Choudhury on 30 March 1908 in Waltair near Visakhapatnam in present-day Andhra Pradesh, into an extremely affluent and educated Bengali family, the daughter of Col. Dr. Manmathnath Choudhury by his wife Leela Devi Choudhury.

Devika&#x27;s father, Colonel Manmatha Nath Chaudhuri, scion of a large landowning &quot;zamindari&quot; family, was the first Indian Surgeon-General of Madras Presidency. Devika&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Durgadas Choudhury, was the &quot;Zamindar&quot; (landlord) of Chatmohar Upazila of Pabna district of present-day Bangladesh. Her paternal grandmother, Sukumari Devi (wife of Durgadas), was a sister of the nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Devika&#x27;s father had five brothers, all of them distinguished in their own fields, mainly law, medicine and literature. They were Sir Ashutosh Chaudhuri, Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court during the British Raj; Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri and Kumudnath Chaudhuri, both prominent Kolkata-based barristers; Pramathanath Choudhary, the famous Bengali writer, and Dr. Suhridnath Chaudhuri, a noted medical practitioner. The future Chief of Army Staff, Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri, was Devika&#x27;s first cousin: their fathers were brothers to each other.

Devika&#x27;s mother, Leela Devi Choudhury, also came from an equally educated family and was a niece of Rabindranath Tagore. Thus, Devika Rani was related through both her parents to the poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Her father, Manmathnath Choudhury, was the son of Sukumari Devi Choudhury, sister of Rabindranath Tagore. Devika&#x27;s mother, Leela Devi Chaudhuri, was the daughter of Indumati Devi Chattopadhyay, whose mother Saudamini Devi Gangopadhyay was another sister of the Nobel laureate. Thus, Devika&#x27;s father and maternal grandmother were first cousins to each other, being the children of two sisters of Rabindranath Tagore. Nor was this all: Two of Devika&#x27;s uncles (Chief Justice Sir Ashutosh and Pramathanath) were married to their first cousins (mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughters), the nieces of Rabindranath Tagore: Prativa Devi Choudhury, wife of Sir Ashutosh Choudhury, was the daughter of Hemendranath Tagore, and Indira Devi Choudhury, wife of Pramathanath Choudhury, was the daughter of Satyendranath Tagore. Devika thus had extremely strong family ties to Jarasanko, seat of the Tagore family in Kolkata and a major crucible of the Bengali Renaissance.

Devika Rani was sent to boarding school in England at the age of nine, and grew up there. After completing her schooling in the mid-1920s, she enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and the Royal Academy of Music in London to study acting and music. She also enrolled for courses in architecture, textile and decor design, and even apprenticed under Elizabeth Arden. All of these courses, each of them a few months long, were completed by 1927, and Devika Rani then took up a job in textile design.

==Career==
In 1928, Devika Rani first met her future husband, Himanshu Rai, an Indian barrister-turned-film maker, who was in London preparing to shoot his forthcoming film &quot;A Throw of Dice&quot;. Rai was impressed with Devika&#x27;s &quot;exceptional skills&quot; and invited her to join the production team of the film, although not as an actress. She readily agreed, assisting him in areas such as costume designing and art direction. The two also traveled to Germany for the post-production work, where she had occasion to observe the film-making techniques of the German film industry, specifically of G. W. Pabst and Fritz Lang. Inspired by their methods of film-making, she enrolled for a short film-making course at Universum Film AG studio in Berlin. Devika Rani learnt various aspects of film-making and also took a special course in film acting. Around this time, they both acted in a play together, for which they received many accolades in Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries. During this time she was also trained in the production unit of Max Reinhardt, an Austrian theatre director.

In 1929, shortly after the release of &quot;A Throw of Dice&quot;, Devika Rani and Himanshu Rai were married.

===Acting debut===
Devika and Himanshu Rai returned to India, where Himanshu produced a film titled &quot;Karma&quot; (1933). The film was his first talkie, and like his previous films, it was a joint production between people from India, Germany and the United Kingdom. Rai, who played the lead role, decided to cast Devika Rani as the female lead, and this marked her acting debut. &quot;Karma&quot; is credited as having been the first English language talkie made by an Indian. It was one of the earliest Indian films to feature a kissing scene. The kissing scene, involving Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, lasted for about four minutes, and eighty years later, this stands as the record for duration of a kissing scene in Indian cinema as of 2014. Devika Rani also sang a song in the film, a bi-lingual song in English and Hindi. This song is said to be Bollywood&#x27;s first English song.

Made simultaneously in both English and Hindi, &quot;Karma&quot; premiered in London in May 1933. Alongside a special screening for the Royal family at Windsor, the film was well received throughout Europe. Devika Rani&#x27;s performance was internationally acclaimed as she won &quot;rave reviews&quot; in the London media. A critic from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; noted Devika Rani for her &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;charm&quot; while also crediting her to be a &quot;potential star of the first magnitude&quot;. Following the release of the film, she was invited by the BBC to enact a role in their first ever television broadcast in Britain in 1933. She also inaugurated the company&#x27;s first short wave radio transmission to India. In spite of its success in England, &quot;Karma&quot; did not interest Indian audiences and turned out be a failure in India when it was released in Hindi as &quot;Nagin Ki Ragini&quot; in early 1934. However, the film received good critical response and helped Devika Rani establish herself as a leading actress in Indian cinema. Indian independence activist and poet Sarojini Naidu called her a &quot;lovely and gifted little lady&quot;.

===Bombay Talkies===
After the critical success of &quot;Karma&quot;, the couple returned to India in 1934. Although the Hindi version of the film, released in India in 1934, flopped without a trace, Himanshu Rai had established the required networks in Europe, and was able to start a film studio named Bombay Talkies, partnering with Niranjan Pal, a Bengali playwright and screenwriter who he had met previously in London and Franz Osten, who directed several of Rai&#x27;s films.

Upon inception, Bombay Talkies was one of the &quot;best-equipped&quot; film studios in the country. The studio would serve as a launch pad for future actors including Dilip Kumar, Leela Chitnis, Madhubala, Raj Kapoor, Ashok Kumar and Mumtaz. The studio&#x27;s first film &quot;Jawani Ki Hawa&quot; (1935), a crime thriller, starring Devika Rani and Najm-ul-Hassan, was shot fully on a train.

===Elopement===
Najm-ul-Hassan was also Devika&#x27;s co-star in the studio&#x27;s next venture, &quot;Jeevan Naiya.&quot; The two co-stars developed a romantic relationship, and during the shooting schedule of &quot;Jeevan Naiya,&quot; Devika eloped with Hassan. Himanshu was both enraged and distraught. Since the leading pair were absent, production was stalled. A significant portion of the movie had been shot and a large sum of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent. The studio therefore suffered severe financial losses and a loss of credit among bankers in the city while the runaway couple made merry.

Sashadhar Mukherjee, an assistant sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because both of them were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other. He established contact with the runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani to return to her husband. In the India of that era, divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than prostitutes and were shunned by their own families. In her heart of hearts, Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances. She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee, seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband as a condition for her return. Henceforth, she would be paid separately for working in his films, but he would be required to single-handedly pay the household expenses for the home in which both of them would live. Himanshu agreed to this, in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt. Devika Rani returned to her marital home. However, things would never be the same between husband and wife again, and it is said that thenceforth, their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode.

Despite the additional expense involved in re-shooting many portions of the film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee&#x27;s wife, as the hero of &quot;Jeevan Naiya.&quot; This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar&#x27;s six-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was the period in which actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.

===Golden era of Bombay Talkies===

&quot;Achhut Kannya&quot; (1936), the studio&#x27;s next production was a tragedy drama that had Devika Rani and Ashok Kumar portraying the roles of an untouchable girl and a Brahmin boy who fall in love. The film is considered a &quot;landmark&quot; in Indian cinema as it challenged the caste system in the country. The casting of Devika Rani was considered a mismatch as her looks did not match the role of a poor untouchable girl by virtue of her &quot;upper-class upbringing&quot;. However, her pairing with Ashok Kumar became popular and they went on to star in as many as ten films together with most of them being Bombay Talkies productions.

In the 1930s, Bombay Talkies produced several women-centric films with Devika Rani playing the lead role in all of them. In majority of the films produced by the studio, she was paired opposite Ashok Kumar, who was &quot;overshadowed&quot; by her. &quot;Jeevan Prabhat&quot;, released in 1937, saw a role-reversal between Devika Rani and Ashok Kumar—she played a higher-caste Brahmin woman who is mistaken by society of having an extra-marital affair with an untouchable man. Her next release &quot;Izzat&quot; (1937), based on &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, was set in the medieval period and depicted two lovers belonging to enemy clans of a Maratha empire. &quot;Nirmala&quot;, released in the following year, dealt with the plight of a child-less woman who is told by an astrologer to abandon her husband to ensure successful pregnancy. In &quot;Vachan&quot;, her second release of the year, she played a Rajput princess. &quot;Durga&quot;, her only release in 1939, was a romantic drama that told the story of an orphaned girl and a village doctor, played by Ashok Kumar.

===Widowhood and studio decline===
Following the death of Rai in 1940, there was a rift between two parties of the Bombay Talkies led by Mukherjee and Amiya Chakravarty. Devika Rani assumed principal responsibility and took over the studio along with Mukherjee. In 1941, she produced and acted in &quot;Anjaan&quot; co-starring Ashok Kumar. In the subsequent years, she produced two successful films under the studio—&quot;Basant&quot; and &quot;Kismet. Basant Kismet&quot; (1943) contained anti-British messages (India was under British rule at that time) and turned out to be a &quot;record-breaking&quot; film. Devika Rani made her last film appearance in &quot;Hamari Baat&quot; (1943), which had Raj Kapoor playing a small role.

She handpicked newcomer Dilip Kumar for a role in &quot;Jwar Bhata&quot; (1944), produced by her on behalf of the studio. An internal politics that arose in the studio led prominent personalities including Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar to part ways with her and set up a new studio called Filmistan. Due to lack of support and interest, she decided to quit the film industry. In an interview to journalist Raju Bharatan, she mentioned that her idea of not willing to compromise on &quot;artistic values&quot; of film-making as one of the major reasons for her quitting the industry.

== Personal life ==
Following her retirement from films, Devika Rani married Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich, son of Russian artist Nicholas Roerich, in 1945. After marriage, the couple moved to Manali, Himachal Pradesh where they got acquainted with the Nehru family. During her stay in Manali, Devika Rani made a few documentaries on wildlife. After staying in Manali for some years, they moved to Bangalore, Karnataka, and settled there managing an export company. The couple bought a estate on the outskirts of the city and led a solitary life for the remainder of their lives.

== Death ==
She died of bronchitis on 9 March 1994—a year after Roerich died—in Bangalore. At her funeral, Devika Rani was given full state honors. Following her death, the estate was on litigation for many years as the couple had no legal claimants; Devika Rani remained childless throughout her life. In August 2011, the Government of Karnataka acquired the estate after the Supreme Court of India passed the verdict in favour of them.

==Legacy==

Devika Rani was called the first lady of Indian cinema. She is credited for being one of the earliest personalities who took the position of Indian cinema to global standards. Her films were mostly tragic romantic dramas that contained social themes. The roles played by her in films of Bombay Talkies usually involved in romantic relationship with men who were unusual for the social norms prevailing in the society at that time, mainly for their caste background or community identity. Rani was highly influenced by the German cinema by virtue of her training at the UFA Studios; Although she was influenced by German actress Marlene Dietrich, her acting style was compared to Greta Garbo, thus leading to Devika Rani being named the &quot;Indian Garbo&quot;.

Rani&#x27;s attire, both in films and sometimes in real life, were considered &quot;risque&quot; at that time. In his book &quot;Bless You Bollywood!: A tribute to Hindi Cinema on completing 100 years&quot;, Tilak Rishi mentions that Devika Rani was known as the &quot;Dragon Lady&quot; for her &quot;smoking, drinking, cursing and hot temper&quot;. In 1958, the Government of India honoured Devika Rani with a Padma Shri, the country&#x27;s fourth highest civilian honour. She became the first ever recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the country&#x27;s highest award for films, when it was instituted in 1969. In 1990, Soviet Russia honoured her with the &quot;Soviet Land Nehru Award&quot;. A postage stamp commemorating her life was released by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in February 2011. In 2020, Kishwar Desai published a book titled &quot;The Longest Kiss: The Life and Times of Devika Rani&quot;, which sheds light on Devika Rani&#x27;s professional accomplishments and her personal misfortunes.

<doc id="216410" wikidata="Q1157707" url="?curid=216410" title="Daisyworld">
<text>Daisyworld is the name of a model developed by Andrew Watson and James Lovelock (published in 1983) to demonstrate how organisms could inadvertently regulate their environment. The model simulates a fictional planet (called Daisyworld) which is experiencing slow global warming due to the brightening of the Sun. The planet is populated by two species of daisies: black daisies and white daisies. The white daisies have a high albedo (reflectivity), and therefore have a cooling effect on the planet. The black daisies, on the other hand, have a low albedo (and thus absorb more solar radiation) and so have a warming effect on the planet. The daisies&#x27; growth rates depend on the temperature, and each daisy also affects its own microclimate in the same way as it affects the global climate. As a result, the populations of the two daisy species self-organize such that the planet remains near the optimal temperature of both daisy species (i.e. with more black daisies when the Sun is dimmer and more white daisies when the Sun is brighter). This model is called a parable because it was meant to illustrate how biotic processes could not only affect the environment (in this case the climate), but also stabilize the environment, without any planning or awareness on the part of the species involved.

Daisyworld (also sometimes referred to as &quot;Daisy World&quot;), has become a term of reference in evolutionary and population ecology. It derives from research on aspects of &quot;coupling&quot; between an ecosphere&#x27;s biota and its planetary environment, in particular via mathematical modeling and computer simulation, research dating to a series of 1982-1983 symposia presentations and primary research reports by James E. Lovelock and colleagues aimed to address the plausibility of the Gaia hypothesis. Also later referred to as a modeling of geosphere–biosphere interactions, Lovelock&#x27;s 1983 reports focused on a hypothetical planet with biota (in the original work, daisies) whose growth fluctuates as the planet&#x27;s exposure to its sun&#x27;s rays fluctuate, i.e., a pair of daisy varieties, whose differing colours drive a difference in interaction with their environment (in particular, the sun). Reference to Daisyworld types of experiments have come to more broadly refer to extensions of that early work, and to further hypothetical systems involving similar and unrelated species.

More specifically, given the impossibility of mathematically modeling the interactions of the full array of the biota of Earth with the full array of their environmental inputs, Lovelock introduced the idea of (and mathematical models and simulations approach to) a far simpler ecosystem—a planet at the lowest limit of its biota orbiting a star whose radiant energy was slowly changing—as a means to mimic a fundamental element of the interaction of all of the Earth&#x27;s biota with the Sun. In the original 1983 works, Daisyworld made a wide variety of simplifying assumptions, and had white and black daisies as its only organisms, which were presented for their abilities to reflect or absorb light, respectively. The original simulation modeled the two daisy populations—which combined to determine the planet&#x27;s overall reflective power (fraction of incident radiation reflected by its surface)—and Daisyworld&#x27;s surface temperature, as a function of changes in the hypothetical star&#x27;s luminosity; in doing so Lovelock demonstrated that the surface temperature of the simple Daisyworld system remained nearly constant over a broad range of solar fluctuations, a result of shifts in the populations of the two plant varieties.

== Synopsis, 1983 simulation ==
Wood and colleagues, in a 2008 review citing the two 1983 Lovelock primary research papers on Daisyworld (still Daisy World or the same in lower case, at that point), describe it as being formulated in response to early criticism of Lovelock&#x27;s Gaia hypothesis, specifically, being a model &quot;invented to demonstrate that planetary self-regulation can emerge automatically from physically realistic feedback between life and its environment, without any need for foresight or planning on the part of the organisms&quot;,

Given the impossibility of fully representing the &quot;coupling&quot; of the whole of the Earth&#x27;s biota and its environment, the hypothetical modelis an imaginary grey world orbiting, at a similar distance to the Earth, a star like our Sun that gets brighter with time. The environment... is reduced to one variable, temperature, and the biota consist of two types of life, black and white daisies, which share the same optimum temperature for growth and limits to growth. The soil of Daisyworld is sufficiently well watered and laden with nutrients for temperature alone to determine the growth rate of the daisies. The planet has a negligible atmospheric greenhouse, so its surface temperature is simply determined by... [the hypothetical star&#x27;s] luminosity and its [the planet&#x27;s] overall albedo [reflective power, the fraction of incident radiation reflected by the surface], which is, in turn, influenced by the coverage of the two daisy types. This hypothetical construction produces, in its mathematical modeling, a nonlinear system &quot;with interesting self-regulating properties&quot;.
== Purpose and impact==
The purpose of the model is to demonstrate that feedback mechanisms can evolve from the actions or activities of self-interested organisms, rather than through classic group selection mechanisms. Daisyworld examines the energy budget of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the albedo of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. Competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a balance of populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

Lovelock sought to demonstrate the stability of Daisyworld by making its sun evolve along the main sequence, taking it from low to high solar constant. This perturbation of Daisyworld&#x27;s receipt of solar radiation caused the balance of daisies to gradually shift from black to white but the planetary temperature was always regulated back to this optimum (except at the extreme ends of solar evolution). This situation is very different from the corresponding abiotic world, where temperature is unregulated and rises linearly with solar output.

== Criticism ==
Daisyworld was designed to refute the idea that there was something inherently mystical about the Gaia hypothesis that Earth&#x27;s surface displays homeostatic and homeorhetic properties similar to those of a living organism; specifically, thermoregulation was addressed.

Wood and colleagues noted in 2008 that a key element in the hypothetical construct of Daisyworld was that the species of focus,&quot;the daisies alter the same environmental variable (temperature) in the same direction at the local level and the global level. Hence what is selected for at the individual level is directly linked to its global effects. This makes the original model a special case (and it is one that is not particularly prevalent in the real world). Evolutionary biologists often criticize the original model for this reason.&quot;

The Gaia hypothesis has otherwise attracted a substantial amount of criticism from scientists, e.g., Richard Dawkins, who argued that planet-level thermoregulation was impossible without planetary natural selection, which might involve evidence of dead planets that did not thermoregulate. W. Ford Doolittle rejected the notion of planetary regulation because it seemed to require a &quot;secret consensus&quot; among organisms, thus some sort of inexplicable purpose on a planetary scale. Others countered the criticism that some &quot;secret consensus&quot; would be required for planetary regulation, suggesting that thermoregulation of a planet beneficial to the two species arises naturally.

Later criticism of Daisyworld centers on the fact that although it is often used as an analogy for Earth, the original simulation leaves out many important details of the true Earth system. For example, the hypothetical system requires an ad-hoc death rate (γ) to sustain homeostasis, and does not take into account the difference between species-level phenomena and individual level phenomena. Detractors of the simulation believed inclusion of these details would cause the system to become unstable, making it a false analogy. These criticisms were countered by Timothy Lenton and James Lovelock in 2001, who argued that including further factors can improve climate regulation on later versons of Daisyworld.

==Subsequent research==

Later versions of Daisyworld, identifying the research area as &quot;tutorial modelling of geosphere–biosphere interactions&quot;, introduced a range of grey daisies, as well as populations of grazers and predators, and found that these further increased the stability of the homeostasis.

More recently, other research, modeling real biochemical cycles of Earth, and using various types of organisms (e.g. photosynthesisers, decomposers, herbivores and primary and secondary carnivores) also argues to have produced Daisyworld-like regulation and stability, in support of ideas related to planetary biological diversity. This enables nutrient recycling within a regulatory framework derived by natural selection amongst species, where one being&#x27;s harmful waste becomes low energy food for members of another guild. For instance, research on the Redfield ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus suggests that local biotic processes might regulate global systems.

Later extension of the Daisyworld simulations which included rabbits, foxes and other species, led to the proposal that the larger the number of species, the greater thermoregulartory improvement for the entire planet, results suggesting that such a hypothetical system was robust and stable even when perturbed. Daisyworld simulations where environments were stable gradually became less diverse over time; in contrast gentle perturbations led to bursts of species richness, lending support to the idea that biodiversity is valuable.

This finding was supported by a 1994 primary research report on species composition, dynamics, and diversity in successional and native grasslands in Minnesota by David Tilman and John A. Downing, which concluded that &quot;primary productivity in more diverse plant communities is more resistant to, and recovers more fully from, a major drought&quot;. They go on to add that their &quot;results support the diversity stability hypothesis but not the alternative hypothesis that most species are functionally redundant&quot;.

== Relevance to Earth ==

Because Daisyworld is so simplistic, having for example, no atmosphere, no animals, only one species of plant life, and only the most basic population growth and death models, it should not be directly compared to Earth. This was stated very clearly by the original authors. Even so, it provided a number of useful predictions of how Earth&#x27;s biosphere may respond to, for example, human interference. Later adaptations of Daisyworld (discussed below), which added many layers of complexity, still showed the same basic trends of the original model.

One prediction of the simulation is that the biosphere works to regulate the climate, making it habitable over a wide range of solar luminosity. Many examples of these regulatory systems have been found on Earth.

<text>A land ethic is a philosophy or theoretical framework about how, ethically, humans should regard the land. The term was coined by Aldo Leopold (1887–1948) in his &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; (1949), a classic text of the environmental movement. There he argues that there is a critical need for a &quot;new ethic&quot;, an &quot;ethic dealing with human&#x27;s relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it&quot;.

Leopold offers an ecologically based land ethic that rejects strictly human-centered views of the environment and focuses on the preservation of healthy, self-renewing ecosystems. &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; was the first systematic presentation of a holistic or ecocentric approach to the environment. Although Leopold is credited with coining the term &quot;land ethic&quot;, there are many philosophical theories that speak to how humans should treat the land. Some of the most prominent land ethics include those rooted in economics, utilitarianism, libertarianism, egalitarianism, and ecology.

==Economics-based land ethic==

This is a land ethic based wholly upon economic self-interest. Leopold sees two flaws in this type of ethic. First, he argues that most members of an ecosystem have no economic worth. For this reason, such an ethic can ignore or even eliminate these members when they are actually necessary for the health of the biotic community of the land. And second, it tends to relegate conservation necessary for healthy ecosystems to the government and these tasks are too large and dispersed to be adequately addressed by such an institution. This ties directly into the context within which Leopold wrote &quot;A Sand County Almanac.&quot;

For example, when the US Forest Service was founded by Gifford Pinchot, the prevailing ethos was economic and utilitarian. Leopold argued for an ecological approach, becoming one of the first to popularize this term coined by Henry Chandler Cowles of the University of Chicago during his early 1900s research at the Indiana Dunes. Conservation became the preferred term for the more anthropocentric model of resource management, while the writing of Leopold and his inspiration, John Muir, led to the development of environmentalism.

==Utilitarian-based land ethic==

Utilitarianism was most prominently defended by British philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Though there are many varieties of utilitarianism, generally it is the view that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people. Utilitarianism has often been used when deciding how to use land and it is closely connected with an economic-based ethic. For example, it forms the foundation for industrial farming; an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. In fact, a common argument in favor of industrial agriculture is that it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices. However, a utilitarian-based land ethic is different from a purely economic one as it could be used to justify the limiting of a person&#x27;s rights to make a profit. For example, in the case of the farmer planting crops on a slope, if the runoff of soil into the community creek led to the damage of several neighbor&#x27;s properties, then the good of the individual farmer would be overridden by the damage caused to his neighbors. Thus, while a utilitarian-based land ethic can be used to support economic activity, it can also be used to challenge this activity.

==Libertarian-based land ethic==

Another philosophical approach often used to guide actions when making (or not making) changes to the land is libertarianism. Roughly, libertarianism is the ethical view that agents own themselves and have particular moral rights, including the right to acquire the property. In a looser sense, libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each individual person has a right to a maximum amount of freedom or liberty when this freedom does not interfere with other people&#x27;s freedom. A well-known libertarian theorist is John Hospers. For right-libertarians, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for the above farmer to plant on a slope as long as this action does not limit the freedom of his or her neighbors.

This view is closely connected to utilitarianism. Libertarians often use utilitarian arguments to support their own arguments. For example, in 1968, Garrett Hardin applied this philosophy to land issues when he argued that the only solution to the &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens. Hardin supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument. However, it can be argued that this leaves libertarian-based land ethics open to the above critique lodged against economic-based approaches. Even excepting this, the libertarian view has been challenged by the critique that numerous people making self-interested decisions often cause large ecological disasters, such as the Dust Bowl disaster. Even so, libertarianism is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, held by U.S. ranchers and farmers.

==Egalitarian-based land ethic==

Egalitarian-based land ethics are often developed as a response to libertarianism. This is because, while libertarianism ensures the maximum amount of human liberty, it does not require that people help others. It also leads to the uneven distribution of wealth. A well-known egalitarian philosopher is John Rawls. When focusing on land use, egalitarianism evaluates its uneven distribution and the uneven distribution of the fruits of that land. While both a utilitarian- and libertarian-based land ethic could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an egalitarian approach typically favors equality, whether that be an equal entitlement to land or access to food. However, there is also the question of negative rights when holding to an egalitarian-based ethic. In other words, if it is recognized that a person has a right to something, then someone has the responsibility to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, an egalitarian-based land ethic could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water because it links land and water with the right to food, the growth of human populations, and the decline of soil and water resources.

==Ecologically based land ethic==

Land ethics may also be based upon the principle that the land (and the organisms that live off the land) has intrinsic value. These ethics are, roughly, based on an ecological or systems view. This position was first put forth by Ayers Brinser in &quot;Our Use of the Land&quot;, published in 1939. Brinser argued that white settlers brought with them &quot;the seeds of a civilization which has grown by consuming the land, that is, a civilization which has used up the land in much the same way that a furnace burns coal.” Later, Aldo Leopold&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; (1949) popularized this idea.

Another example is the deep ecology view, which argues that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities and that all life is of inherent worth. Similar to egalitarian-based land ethics, the above land ethics were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian-based approaches. Leopold&#x27;s ethic is one of the most popular ecological approaches in the early 21st century. Other writers and theorists who hold this view include Wendell Berry (b. 1934), N. Scott Momaday, J. Baird Callicott, Paul B. Thompson, and Barbara Kingsolver.

==Aldo Leopold&#x27;s land ethic==
In his classic essay, &quot;The Land Ethic,&quot; published posthumously in &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; (1949), Leopold proposes that the next step in the evolution of ethics is the expansion of ethics to include nonhuman members of the biotic community, collectively referred to as &quot;the land.&quot; Leopold states the basic principle of his land ethic as: &quot;A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.&quot;

He also describes it in this way: &quot;The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land . . . [A] land ethic changes the role of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; from conqueror of the land community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.&quot;
Leopold was a naturalist, not a philosopher. There is much scholarly debate about what exactly Leopold&#x27;s land ethic asserts and how he argues for it. At its core, the land ethics claims (1) that humans should view themselves as plain members and citizens of biotic communities, not as &quot;conquerors&quot; of the land; (2) that we should extend ethical consideration to ecological wholes (&quot;soils, waters, plants, and animals&quot;), (3) that our primary ethical concern should not be with individual plants or animals, but with the healthy functioning of whole biotic communities, and (4) that the &quot;summary moral maxim&quot; of ecological ethics is that we should seek to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. Beyond this, scholars disagree about the extent to which Leopold rejected traditional human-centered approaches to the environment and how literally he intended his basic moral maxim to be applied. They also debate whether Leopold based his land ethic primarily on human-centered interests, as many passages in &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; suggest, or whether he placed significant weight on the intrinsic value of nature. One prominent student of Leopold, J. Baird Callicott, has suggested that Leopold grounded his land ethics on various scientific claims, including a Darwinian view of ethics as rooted in special affections for kith and kin, a Copernican view of humans as plain members of nature and the cosmos, and the finding of modern ecology that ecosystems are complex, interrelated wholes. However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by Roberta Millstein, who has offered evidence that Darwin&#x27;s influence on Leopold was not related to Darwin&#x27;s views about moral sentiments, but rather to Darwin&#x27;s views about interdependence in the struggle for existence.

===Attractions of Leopold&#x27;s land ethic===

Leopold&#x27;s ecocentric land ethic is popular today with mainstream environmentalists for a number of reasons. Unlike more radical environmental approaches, such as deep ecology or biocentrism, it does not require huge sacrifices of human interests. Leopold does not, for example, believe that humans should stop eating or hunting, or experimenting on animals. Nor does he call for a massive reduction in the human population, or for permitting humans to interfere with nature only to satisfy vital human needs (regardless of economic or other human costs). As an environmental ethic, Leopold&#x27;s land ethic is a comparatively moderate view that seeks to strike a balance between human interests and a healthy and biotically diverse natural environment. Many of the things mainstream environmentalists favor—preference for native plants and animals over invasive species, hunting or selective culling to control overpopulated species that are damaging to the environment, and a focus on preserving healthy, self-regenerating natural ecosystems both for human benefit and for their own intrinsic value—jibe with Leopold&#x27;s ecocentric land ethic.

A related understanding has been framed as global land as a commons. In this view biodiversity and terrestrial carbon storage - an element of climate change mitigation - are global public goods. Hence, land should be governed on a global scale as a commons, requiring increased international cooperation on nature preservation.

===Criticism===

Some critics fault Leopold for lack of clarity in spelling out exactly what the land ethic is and its specific implications for how humans should think about the environment. It is clear that Leopold did not intend his basic normative principle (&quot;A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community&quot;) to be regarded as an ethical absolute. Thus construed, it would prohibit clearing land to build homes, schools, or farms, and generally require a &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to nature that Leopold plainly did not favor. Presumably, therefore, his maxim should be seen as a general guideline for valuing natural ecosystems and striving to achieve what he terms a sustainable state of &quot;harmony between men and land.&quot; But this is vague and, according to some critics, not terribly helpful.

A second common criticism of Leopold is that he fails to state clearly why we should adopt the land ethic. He often cites examples of environmental damage (e.g., soil erosion, pollution, and deforestation) that result from traditional human-centered, &quot;conqueror&quot; attitudes towards nature. But it is unclear why such examples support the land ethic specifically, as opposed to biocentrism or some other nature-friendly environmental ethic. Leopold also frequently appeals to modern ecology, evolutionary theory, and other scientific discoveries to support his land ethic. Some critics have suggested that such appeals may involve an illicit move from facts to values. At a minimum, such critics claim, more should be said about the normative basis of Leopold&#x27;s land ethic.

Other critics object to Leopold&#x27;s ecological holism. According to animal rights advocate, Tom Regan, Leopold&#x27;s land ethic condones sacrificing the good of individual animals to the good of the whole, and is thus a form of &quot;environmental fascism.&quot; According to these critics, we rightly reject such holistic approaches in human affairs. Why, they ask, should we adopt them in our treatment of non-human animals?

Finally, some critics have questioned whether Leopold&#x27;s land ethic might require unacceptable interferences with nature in order to protect current, but transient, ecological balances. If the fundamental environmental imperative is to &quot;preserve&quot; the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems, wouldn&#x27;t this require frequent and costly human interventions to prevent naturally occurring changes to natural environments? In nature, the &quot;stability and integrity&quot; of ecosystems are disrupted or destroyed all the time by drought, fire, storms, pests, newly invasive predators, etc. Must humans act to prevent such ecological changes, and if so, at what cost? Why should we place such high value on current ecological balances? Why think it is our role to be nature&#x27;s steward or policeman? According to these critics, Leopold&#x27;s stress on preserving existing ecological balances is overly human-centered and fails to treat nature with the respect it deserves.

<text>The Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or Roerich Pact is an inter-American treaty. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the defense of cultural objects is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military purposes, and the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity.

== Nicholas Roerich ==

Russian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich (1874–1947) initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of &quot;Peace of Civilizations&quot;. Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich&#x27;s most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of American states in the Oval Office of the White House (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.

Nicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in St. Petersburg. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son&#x27;s inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to Paris to take lessons from Fernand Cormon, the well known tutor of Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married Helena Shaposhnikova, who later developed the Agni Yoga philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian Tsar Nicolas II himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by Maurice Maeterlinck and Igor Stravinsky, premiered in St. Petersburg.

In 1917, Roerich went to live near a lake in Finland, to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the October Revolution and Finnish Civil War, the family travelled across several Scandinavian countries to Great Britain and eventually left for North America in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: &quot;Cor Ardens&quot; (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) and &quot;The Master Institute of United Arts&quot; (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).

In 1923, the Roerich Museum was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in Manhattan, at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In 1929, Roerich&#x27;s work towards the pact was recognised through a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.

After leaving America, the Roerichs settled at Naggar in the Kullu Valley from which their estate looked towards the Himalayas. Here they established the Urusvati Institute which remains in Naggar with an exhibition about the pact. Nicholas Roerich died on 13 December 1947.

== Origins ==
An idea about the protection of cultural monuments was formulated for the first time by Nicholas Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at Saint-Petersburg province, Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.

In 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir, Suzdal, Yuriev-Polsky, Smolensk, Vilnius, Izborsk and Pskov. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, Nicholas Roerich has visited Uglich, Kalyazin, Kashin and Tver. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.

Summarizing these trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article &quot;Along the old times&quot; (1903): &quot;Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it&quot;.

In 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor&#x27;s Russian Archeological Society about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.

During the Russo-Japanese war (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments. In the course of several years after his travel in 1903–1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article &quot;Silent Pogroms&quot; (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl: &quot;Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation ...&quot;.

In 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the Imperial Russian Army, as well as the governments of the United States and France with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster &quot;Enemy of Mankind&quot; denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture &quot;Glow&quot; expressing a protest against World War I.

In 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor Nicholas II and Great Prince Nicholas Nikolayevich containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.

In 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with G. G. Shklyaver (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of international law and political sciences at the University of Paris prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the Banner of Peace. It consists of a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.

== Draft and ratification ==
In 1929, Roerich, again in collaboration with Professor Shklyaver, prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the Red Cross for medical neutrality.

In 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich&#x27;s appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at League of Nations and also by the Committee of the Pan-American Union. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.

In the aftermath of World War II, the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth UNESCO General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.

Ideas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the international law, especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.

== Banner of Peace ==


&quot;Pax Cultura&quot; (&quot;Cultural Peace&quot; or &quot;Peace through Culture&quot;) is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935, the Roerich Pact was signed by the United States and Latin American nations, agreeing that &quot;historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions&quot; should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the &quot;Banner of Peace&quot;, bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.

According to the Roerich Museum, &quot;The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today.&quot;

The Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the Hague Convention of 1954. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.

== World League of Culture and World Day of Culture ==
In the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.

Characterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut Alexei Leonov wrote:

If we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. ...

Developing the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician D. S. Likhachev. He said:

 ... I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. ...

At the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.

In his article &quot;Pain of the Planet&quot; (1933) N. Roerich wrote: &quot;The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people&#x27;s good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity&quot;.

The cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich&#x27;s thought about the implementation of World Day of Culture. N. Roerich wrote:
&quot;... We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures ...&quot;
