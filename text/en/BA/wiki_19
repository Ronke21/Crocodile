<text>Joseph Leo Baxendale (27 October 1930 – 23 April 2017) was an English cartoonist and publisher. Baxendale wrote and drew several titles. Among his best-known creations are the &quot;Beano&quot; strips &quot;Little Plum&quot;, &quot;Minnie the Minx&quot;, &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot;, and &quot;The Three Bears&quot;.

==Career==
Baxendale was born in Whittle-le-Woods, Lancashire, and was educated at Preston Catholic College. After serving in the RAF, he took his first job as an artist for the local &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&quot; drawing adverts and cartoons.

=== DC Thomson ===
In 1952, he began freelance work for the children&#x27;s comic publishers DC Thomson, creating several highly popular new strips for &quot;The Beano&quot; including &quot;Little Plum&quot;, &quot;Minnie the Minx&quot; (started in 1953, taken over by Jim Petrie in 1961), &quot;The Three Bears&quot;, and &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; (initially called &quot;When the Bell Rings&quot;). Baxendale also co-operated on the launch of DC Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Beezer&quot; comic in 1956. To facilitate his work for DC Thomson, Baxendale relocated to the publisher&#x27;s location city of Dundee, Scotland. Baxendale&#x27;s time with D.C. Thomson came to an abrupt end in 1962 when, overburdened with work, he in his own words &quot;just blew up like an old boiler&quot; and left.

=== Odhams ===
In 1964, Baxendale began work for Odhams Press to set up and design a new children&#x27;s comic, &quot;Wham!&quot; and, two years later, its sister comic &quot;Smash!&quot; In its early issues, &quot;Wham!&quot; presented both clear imitations of &quot;Beano&quot; strips, such as a clone of his &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; in the shape of &quot;The Tiddlers&quot;, and new original strips such as &quot;Eagle-Eye, Junior Spy&quot; and &quot;Georgie&#x27;s Germs&quot;, in which he attempted to break the mould of older strips by the use of bizarre humour, outrageous puns, and surreal plots. (Baxendale earned £8,000 in his first year at Odhams — equivalent to £165,000 in 2020.)

&quot;Eagle-Eye, Junior Spy&quot;, birthed two spinoff strips in &quot;Smash!&quot; in 1966. The first one, &quot;The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.&quot;, was also a spoof of the popular TV series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;. (Baxendale drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some early covers of &quot;Smash!&quot;; after which Mike Lacey took over.) &quot;Grimly Feendish&quot;, starred &quot;Eagle-Eye&quot;&#x27;s most popular character, along with various travelling accomplices (including bats, spiders, octopuses and other creatures of darkness and slime) who assisted Feendish in his schemes of world domination.

Another strip Baxendale created for &quot;Smash!&quot; — &quot;The Swots and the Blots&quot; — was about two rival gangs (the Swots and the Blots) vying to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with &quot;Teach&quot; caught in the crossfire. The strip&#x27;s origins lay in Baxendale&#x27;s classroom-based strip &quot;The Tiddlers&quot;, which had then been running for two years in &quot;Wham!&quot; (and which continued in &quot;Pow!&quot; when it and &quot;Wham&quot; merged in 1968, where it was combined with Ron Spencer&#x27;s &quot;The Dolls of St. Dominics&quot; to become &quot;The Tiddlers and The Dolls&quot;). In fact, &quot;The Swots and the Blots&quot; was a direct continuation of &quot; The Tiddlers&quot;, with only a change of title. The characters (i.e. &quot;Teach&quot; and the Blots), school buildings, and situations were all largely as they had been in &quot;The Tiddlers&quot;. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally. Although &quot;The Swots and the Blots&quot; was created by Baxendale, the first couple of years of the strip were drawn by Mike Lacey. (As had happened with some of Baxendale&#x27;s work for &quot;Wham!&quot;, artists such as Lacey were commissioned from time to time to &quot;ghost&quot; Baxendale&#x27;s style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on &quot;Smash!&quot;, but in practice, he signed very few them, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.)

&quot;The Swots and the Blots&quot; always had wit and a sense of style, but it reached a new standard of excellence when Baxendale began drawing it for the new-look &quot;Smash!&quot; from March 1969. (In Baxendale&#x27;s hands, it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot;, in &quot;The Beano&quot;.) The strip became a standard-bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in &quot;Smash!&quot; and continuing in its successor, &quot;Valiant and Smash&quot;, with some fill-ins by Les Barton), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier &quot;The Beano&quot; work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.

The title logo of Baxendale&#x27;s &quot;Bad Penny&quot; strip featured a portrait of Penny and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character&#x27;s name originated). Penny had some similarities with Baxendale&#x27;s earlier Minnie the Minx character in &quot;The Beano&quot;. When Baxendale had been drawing &quot;Minnie the Minx&quot;, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on &quot;Bad Penny&quot; his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character&#x27;s own personality traits. When the strip was eventually dropped in &quot;Smash!&quot;, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, making occasional appearances in &quot;The Swots and the Blots&quot; as a new member of the Blots.

=== Fleetway ===
Around 1968, Baxendale left Odhams for another, better-paying IPC subsidiary — Fleetway Publications. Despite the transfer, Baxendale still needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing that he was now working for both companies. It must be remembered that Odhams was in rivalry with Fleetway — despite the fact that both publishers were parts of the same Mirror Group. As Baxendale said, &quot;Alf Wallace once made a cry aside to me to illustrate the hostility between Fleetway and Odhams: &#x27;If I were to go across to the Fleetway canteen to have lunch, they would soon order me out&#x27;.&quot;

Accordingly, Baxendale still contributed strips to Odhams&#x27; &quot;Smash!&quot;, but did so without signing his work. For instance, for strips like &quot;Bad Penny&quot; and &quot;Grimly Feendish&quot;, Baxendale pencilled the drawings, and Mike Brown, an animator by trade, inked them in. In this way, they together turned out large numbers of the strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown&#x27;s name — a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working &quot;undercover&quot;:
One of the strips Baxendale produced for Fleetway was &quot;Big Chief Pow Wow&quot; for &quot;Buster&quot; — the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists). For Fleetway, he also created &quot;Clever Dick&quot; and &quot;Sweeny Toddler&quot;.

=== Move to adult comics ===
Baxendale left the world of mainstream British children&#x27;s comics in 1975, creating the more adult-orientated &quot;Willy the Kid&quot; series, published by Duckworths. In the 1980s he fought a seven-year legal battle with DC Thomson for the rights to his &quot;Beano&quot; creations, which was eventually settled out of court. His earnings from that settlement allowed Baxendale to found the publishing house Reaper Books in the late 1980s. In the same year, he brought out &quot;THRRP!&quot;, an adult comic book.

For a year before he fully retired from cartooning to concentrate on publishing in 1992, Baxendale drew &quot;I Love You Baby Basil!&quot; for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the mid-1960s, Baxendale published a weekly anti-war newsletter &quot;the Strategic Commentary&quot;. Though it had some paying subscribers, including fellow Vietnam War opponent Noam Chomsky, Baxendale made a considerable loss from sending hundreds of free weekly copies to Labour Party MPs.

Leo Baxendale and his wife Peggy had five children, including Martin Baxendale, who also became a cartoonist and worked on some of his father&#x27;s strips.

==Death==
Leo Baxendale died of cancer on 23 April 2017 at the age of 86. Andy Fanton, who at the time of Baxendale&#x27;s death was the &quot;Beano&quot;&#x27;s writer for several Baxendale-created strips, lauded his predecessor as &quot;the godfather of so much of what we do&quot;.

== Awards ==
Baxendale was the second person inducted into the British Comic Awards Hall of Fame, in 2013. He was described as having created &quot;a lifetime of original, anarchic, hilarious and revolutionary comics&quot; and having had an &quot;incalculable&quot; influence on children and comic artists, while his work was lauded for being &quot;an integral and inseparable part of the history of British children&#x27;s comics.&quot; The BBC said that he was &quot;regarded by aficionados as one of Britain&#x27;s greatest and most influential cartoonists&quot; and quoted the British cartoonist Lew Stringer as saying that Baxendale was &quot;quite simply the most influential artist in UK humour comics&quot;.

==Notable creations==

Over the course his career, Baxendale worked for a number of different publishers, writing and drawing many different strips in several different comics. The following lists some of Baxendale&#x27;s most well-known creations. As well as creating new strips, Baxendale also worked on pre-existing properties, such as &quot;Lord Snooty&quot; in &quot;Beano&quot;, issues 691–718.

<text>John Moultrie (1799–1874) was an English clergyman, known as a poet and hymn-writer.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Great Portland Street, London, on 31 December 1799, at the house of his maternal grandmother, Mrs Fendall; he was the eldest son of George Moultrie, rector of Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, by his wife Harriet (died 1867). His father was the son of John Moultrie of South Carolina.

After preliminary education at Ramsbury, Wiltshire, Moultrie was sent to Eton College in 1811. John Keate, whom he annoyed by a visit to Thomas Gray&#x27;s monument at Stoke Poges, was then headmaster. Among his friends were William Sidney Walker, Lord Morpeth, Richard Okes, John Louis Petit, Henry Nelson Coleridge and Edward Coleridge, and Winthrop Mackworth Praed. He composed with great facility in Latin, but was indifferent to school studies, distinguishing himself as a cricketer, actor, and wit.

In October 1819 Moultrie entered, as a commoner, Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became intimate with Thomas Babington Macaulay, Charles Austin, and others of their set. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge: he is recorded in one match in 1820, totalling 6 runs with a highest score of 6 not out and taking 1 wicket. Proceeding his M.A. in 1822, he spent time at the Middle Temple, but after acting for some time as a tutor to the three sons of Lord Craven, he gave up the law and decided to take holy orders; he had an offer of the living of Rugby, Warwickshire, by Lord Craven in 1825. In 1825 he was also ordained, and on 28 July that year he married Harriet Margaret Fergusson, sister of James Fergusson.

== Career ==
He had the parsonage at Rugby rebuilt, and went to reside there in 1828. Moultrie arrived in the parish almost simultaneously with Thomas Arnold&#x27;s acceptance of the headmastership of Rugby School. Writing to Derwent Coleridge, Moultrie&#x27;s close friend Bonamy Price described the reciprocal influence of these two men.

At school he wrote for the &quot;College Magazine&quot;, edited the subsequent &quot;Horæ Otiosæ&quot;, and after leaving Eton contributed verses to the &quot;Etonian&quot; during 1820–1. His treatment of the subject of Lady Godiva was praised by William Gifford and William Wordsworth. Both in the &quot;Etonian&quot; and in Charles Knight&#x27;s &quot;Quarterly Magazine&quot; his verses appeared under the pseudonym &#x27;Gerard Montgomery.&#x27;

In 1837 Moultrie issued a collection of his poems, which were favourably reviewed both in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; and the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; In 1843 he published &#x27;The Dream of Life; Lays of the English Church and other Poems.&#x27; It is an autobiographical meditation in verse, which contains comments on contemporaries, including Thomas Babington Macaulay, Henry Nelson Coleridge, Charles Austin, Chauncey Hare Townshend, and Charles Taylor. In 1850 appeared &#x27;The Black Fence, a Lay of Modern Rome,&#x27; an anti-papal work, and &#x27;St. Mary, the Virgin and Wife,&#x27; both of which had several editions. In 1852 he edited the &quot;Poetical Remains&quot; of William Sidney Walker.

In 1854, his last volume of verse appeared, &#x27;Altars, Hearths, and Graves.&#x27; Among its contents is the &#x27;Three Minstrels,&#x27; giving an account of Moultrie&#x27;s meetings, on different occasions, with Wordsworth, Coleridge and Tennyson. In his later work Moultrie became the writer of much blank verse of a conscientious and explanatory type. He also wrote a number of hymns, on special subjects. Most of them are in Benjamin Hall Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Hymnologia Christiana&quot;, 1863.

A complete edition of his poems was published in two volumes in 1876, with a memoir, by Derwent Coleridge.

==Personal life==
He died on 26 December 1874 in Rugby, Warwickshire of smallpox, which he had caught from a parishioner whom he was visiting. He was buried in the parish church, to which an aisle was added in his memory. His gravestone says &quot;The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep&quot;. Moultrie Road in central Rugby is named after him.

His wife Harriet died in 1864, leaving three sons and four daughters. Of them, Gerard Moultrie and Mary Moultrie were also hymn-writers.

He was the great-uncle of Henry Stephens Salt, a vegetarian socialist and animal rights advocate.

<doc id="214716" wikidata="Q766306" url="?curid=214716" title="Red-billed blue magpie">
<text>The red-billed blue magpie (Urocissa erythroryncha) is a species of bird (magpie) in the crow family, Corvidae. It is about the same size as the Eurasian magpie, but has a much longer tail, one of the longest of any corvid. It is long and weighs .

==Taxonomy==
The red-billed blue magpie was described by French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name, but in 1783, Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Corvus erythrorynchus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The specimen described by Buffon had come from China, but the type location was restricted to Canton by Hugh Birckhead in 1937. The red-billed blue magpie is now one of five species placed in the genus &quot;Urocissa&quot; that was introduced by German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek &quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;kissa&quot; meaning &quot;magpie&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;erythroryncha&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;eruthros&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot; and &quot;rhunkhos&quot; meaning &quot;bill&quot;.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;U. e. occipitalis&quot; (Blyth, 1846) – northwest India to east Nepal
* &quot;U. e. magnirostris&quot; (Blyth, 1846) – northeast India to south Indochina
* &quot;U. e. alticola&quot; Birckhead, 1938 – north Myanmar and south-central China
* &quot;U. e. brevivexilla&quot; R. Swinhoe, 1874 – northeast China
* &quot;U. e. erythroryncha&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – central, east, and southeast China, north Indochina

==Description==
The head, neck, and breast are black with a bluish spotting on the crown. The shoulders and rump are a duller violet-blue, and the underparts are a greyish cream. The long tail is a brighter violet-blue (as are the wing primaries) with a broad, white tip. The bill is a bright orange-red, as are the legs and feet and a ring around each eye. This red can vary across its range to almost yellow in some birds.


===Habits and habitat===
The red-billed blue magpie occurs in a broad swath from the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, and further eastwards. It ranges from the western Himalayas eastwards into Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and through central and eastern China to southwest Manchuria, in evergreen forest and scrub in predominantly hilly or mountainous country. It has adapted to urban habitat, and can be seen in large cities in China such as Beijing and Hong Kong. They nest in trees and large shrubs in a relatively shallow nest. Usually, three to five eggs are laid.
Food is sought both in trees and on the ground. It takes the usual wide range of food, such as invertebrates, other small animals, and fruit and some seeds. It robs nests of eggs and also chicks. Vocal mimicry is very apparent in this species, and its calls are very varied, but the most usual are a grating rattle and a high-pitched whistle somewhat like a flute.

<text>24 Themis is one of the largest asteroids in the asteroid belt. It is also the largest member of the Themistian family. It was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on 5 April 1853. It is named after Themis, the personification of natural law and divine order in Greek mythology.

Not to be confused with 269 Justitia, named for Justitia, Themis&#x27; Roman name.

== Discovery and observations ==
24 Themis was discovered on 5 April 1853 by Annibale de Gasparis of Naples, though it was given its name by fellow Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi. The asteroid was named after Themis, the Greek goddess of law. Gravitational perturbations in the orbit of Themis were used to calculate the mass of Jupiter as early as 1875.

On 24 December 1975, 24 Themis had a close encounter with 2296 Kugultinov with a minimum distance of . By analyzing the perturbation of Kugultinov&#x27;s orbit due to the gravitational pull of Themis, the mass of Themis was determined to be approximately solar masses ( Earth masses).

== Orbit and rotation ==
Themis is in an elliptical orbit around the Sun with an eccentricity of 0.1306 and an inclination of 0.76°. It has an orbital period of 5.54 years. The distance between Themis and the Sun ranges from 2.71 AU at perihelion and 3.55 AU at aphelion, with a mean distance of 3.1302 AU. Themis is part of the Themis family of asteroids, which is located in the outer part of the main belt. The family consists of a core of large objects surrounded by a cloud of smaller objects; 24 Themis is a member of the core.

== Surface materials ==
===Ice===
On 7 October 2009, the presence of water ice was confirmed on the surface of this asteroid using NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility. The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice. As this ice layer is sublimated, it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface.

Scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to Earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the Moon. The presence of ice on 24 Themis supports this theory. Because of its proximity to the sun (~3.2 AU), the widespread ice on the surface of 24 Themis is somewhat unexpected. The surface ice may be replenished by a sub-surface reservoir of water or impact gardening—a lunar phenomenon in which the moon overturns surface material at a rate of 1  m/ Gyr.

An alternative mechanism to explain the presence of water ice on 24 Themis is similar to the hypothesized formation of water on the surface of the Moon by solar wind. Trace amounts of water would be continuously produced by high-energy solar protons impinging oxide minerals present at the surface of the asteroid. The hydroxyl surface groups (S–OH) formed by the collision of protons () with oxygen atoms present at oxide surface (S=O) can further be converted in water molecules () adsorbed onto the oxide minerals surface. The chemical rearrangement supposed at the oxide surface could be schematically written as follows:

:2 S-OH → S=O + S + 
or, 
:2 S-OH → S–O–S + 

where S represents the oxide surface.

===Organics===
Organic compounds were also detected on the surface of Themis in the form of tholins, high-molecular weight organics found in the outer solar system, distinguished by a brown or reddish color in optical spectra. Compounds found in the spectra of Themis include ice tholin (the residual of an irradiated mixture of water ice and ethane), asphaltite, carbonaceous meteorite material, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

<doc id="214718" wikidata="Q795552" url="?curid=214718" title="Common green magpie">
<text>The common green magpie (Cissa chinensis) is a member of the crow family, roughly about the size of the Eurasian jay or slightly smaller. In the wild specimens are usually a bright and lush green in colour (often fades to turquoise in captivity or with poor diet as the pigment is carotenoid based), slightly lighter on the underside and has a thick black stripe from the bill (through the eyes) to the nape. Compared to the other members of its genus, the white-tipped tail is quite long. This all contrasts vividly with the red fleshy eye rims, bill and legs. The wings are reddish maroon.

It is found from the lower Himalayas in north eastern India in a broad south easterly band down into central Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra and northwestern Borneo in evergreen forest (including bamboo forest), clearings and scrub.

This bird seeks food both on the ground and in the canopy of the trees, and takes a very high percentage of animal prey from countless invertebrates, small reptiles, mammals and young birds and eggs. It will also take flesh from a recently killed carcass.
They will usually feed the newborns first.

The nest is built in trees, large shrubs and often in tangles of various climbing vines. There are usually 4–6 eggs laid.

The voice is quite varied but often a harsh &quot;peep-peep&quot;. It also frequently whistles and chatters.

==Taxonomy==

The common green magpie was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Coracias chinensis&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. Buffon believed that his specimen had come from China but the species only occurs in the extreme south of the country. The type locality was redesignated in 1952 by the German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann as Mergui, Tanintharyi Region, Myanmar.
The common green magpie is now one of four species that are placed in the genus &quot;Cissa&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826 with the common green magpie as the type species. The generic name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;kissa&quot; meaning a &quot;jay&quot; or &quot;magpie&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;chinensis&quot; was chosen by Boddaert in the mistaken belief that the specimen illustrated by Martinet had come from China.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot; C. c. chinensis&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – Himalayas to south China, north Indochina, Thailand and Myanmar
* &quot; C. c. klossi&quot; Delacour &amp; Jabouille, 1924 – central Indochina
* &quot; C. c. margaritae&quot; Robinson &amp; Kloss, 1919 – Lang Bian Mountains (south Vietnam)
* &quot; C. c. robinsoni&quot; Ogilvie-Grant, 1906 – Malay Peninsula
* &quot; C. c. minor&quot; Cabanis, 1850 – Sumatra and Borneo

<doc id="214719" wikidata="Q523106" url="?curid=214719" title="Katrina Leung">
<text>Katrina Leung (; born 1954) is a former high value Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant and Ministry of State Security (MSS) agent who, on April 9, 2003, was indicted by the United States Department of Justice for &quot;Unauthorized copying of national defense information with intent to injure or benefit a foreign nation&quot;. Her case was later dismissed on January 6, 2005, because of prosecutorial misconduct, but an appeal by the U.S. Attorney resulted in a plea bargain of guilty to lesser charges on December 16, 2005. She was alleged by the United States government to have contaminated twenty years of intelligence relating to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, as well as critically compromising the FBI&#x27;s Chinese counterintelligence program. She was known by a variety of aliases, including Chan Man Ying, Chen Wen Ying, Luo Zhongshan, and Parlor Maid.

== Early life ==
Leung immigrated to the United States in 1970 using a fake Republic of China passport stating that she was born on May 1, 1954, in Guangzhou. Leung enrolled at Washington Irving High School in New York City, New York, and graduated in June 1972. She became a permanent resident alien on August 7, 1972.

== Education ==
Leung attended and earned an undergraduate degree from Cornell University in 1976. She then went on to earn a Master of Business Administration from the University of Chicago. It was somewhere during this time as a student that Leung was contacted by the FBI for information on some of her acquaintances.

She was appointed by philanthropist Caroline Leonetti Ahmanson as President of the Los Angeles-Guangzhou Sister City Committee and raised funds for the Republican Party.

==Involvement with the FBI==
In 1980, Leung moved to Los Angeles and occupied an apartment building which contained numerous tenants that were subjects of other FBI investigations. She developed a close relationship with a pro-PRC activist who was under FBI investigation for illegally transferring technology from the U.S. to the PRC. Leung became the general manager of an import-export company which in late 1980 had become the subject of an FBI investigation dealing with the illegal transfer of technology from the U.S. to the PRC. On February 10, 1981, the FBI launched an investigation into Leung, believing that she was engaging in clandestine intelligence-gathering on behalf of the PRC. Leung eventually left her job at the import-export company, closing the FBI investigation on her. The PRC activist was arrested in China, closing that investigation as well.

In 1982, FBI Special Agent James J. Smith re-opened the FBI investigation into Leung hoping that she could provide him with additional information on the PRC activist as well as other miscellaneous information. Smith was so impressed with the information Leung provided that he converted her into an FBI asset codename &quot;Parlor Maid&quot; in December of the same year.

=== Career as a double agent ===

On March 16, 1984, Leung became a U.S. citizen with the help of Smith. The FBI had developed a plan for her to be recruited by the Chinese Ministry of State Security as an asset working as a double agent for the United States. In June 1984, Leung was recruited by the MSS believing that she was a low-level source of information at the FBI&#x27;s Los Angeles office. Leung began receiving money from the FBI to pay for her expenses (the majority going towards flights to and from China). She passed two polygraph examinations: one in September 1984 and one in June 1986.

Between 1985 and 1990, Leung&#x27;s profile within the West Coast Chinese community and the FBI had risen significantly. Her connections within the community became so extensive that she entertained Chinese diplomatic officials and organized high-profile banquets for visiting PRC officials from the mainland. During this time, she met and charmed President of China Yang Shangkun who eventually became her patron. As a sign of her growing influence in the PRC, she advised the Chinese government in 1998 on a new location for their Los Angeles consulate.

Up to this point, Leung&#x27;s reports were well received by the Central Intelligence Agency, and much of her reporting during this time had also been verified by a Chinese defector. A sign of her growing influence within the FBI could be seen when she was sent to China shortly after the Tiananmen Square Massacre to report on the country&#x27;s political climate during a time when the country&#x27;s information flow had virtually ceased.

In June 1990, the FBI learned that Leung had revealed to MSS officials the existence and location of a classified operation as well as classified details of the FBI&#x27;s counterintelligence program. The FBI headquarters chief questioned Leung&#x27;s handler Smith, who denied the allegations and successfully convinced his superior that she would never do such a thing without his authorization. Smith privately confronted Leung on May 31, 1991, about the unauthorized disclosure of information. In response, she told him that her Chinese handler &quot;Mao&quot; had discovered her double-agent identity and had coerced her into giving additional information.

In April 1991, the FBI obtained an audio recording of a conversation between a woman identifying herself as &quot;Luo&quot; and a known PRC intelligence official identifying himself as &quot;Mao&quot;. Special Agent William Cleveland, Jr. was brought in to listen to the tape and immediately recognized the woman&#x27;s voice as Leung&#x27;s. Leung had, among other things, detailed without authorization the itinerary of a recent trip that Cleveland had taken with the State Department to the PRC. Cleveland immediately notified Smith of the breach and in May of the same year, the two traveled to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. for a high-level meeting concerning herself. In addition to the analyst’s recommendations, Smith defended the suspicious activities of Leung and managed to convince his superiors that terminating her as an asset was not the best course of action. The FBI accepted his recommendation based on his extensive experience handling Leung, as well as his experience in the FBI and the analyst&#x27;s recommendation. Federal prosecutors alleged Leung engaged in a 20-year extra-marital affair with Smith. The MSS handler was &quot;Mao Guohua&quot; who is alleged to be the MSS&#x27;s leading U.S. expert.

=== Investigation ===

==== December 12, 2001 ====

The FBI obtained a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to surveil Leung as part of an investigation into her activities. They conducted a limited consensual search of Leung&#x27;s residence and found an FBI telephone directory, a telephone list relating to an FBI investigation codename &quot;Royal Tourist&quot;, a secret FBI memo concerning Chinese fugitives, and an FBI legal directory.

==== November 11, 2002 ====

The FBI conducted a covert search into Leung&#x27;s luggage at Los Angeles International Airport before and after a trip she had taken to the PRC. Six photographs of FBI agents, two of whom were on active duty, were missing from her baggage upon her arrival back into the U.S.

==== December 20, 2002 ====

The FBI learned that Leung had surreptitiously copied a top-secret document that her handler Smith had checked out overnight from the FBI and transmitted the information to her MSS handler.

=== Arrest ===

Leung and Smith were arrested by the Department of Justice on the morning of April 9, 2003 at her residence in San Marino, California, and charged with &quot;Unauthorized Copying of National Defense Information with Intent to Injure or Benefit a Foreign Nation in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 793(b)&quot;. Smith allegedly had an affair with Leung for 20 years, and allegedly brought classified materials to their trysts. Smith admitted to having a sexual relationship with Leung. Smith and Leung pleaded not guilty. 

She was not charged with either treason or espionage presumably because her prosecutors did not feel they had adequate evidence to guarantee a conviction that historically had been notoriously difficult to secure. She was denied bail because she was deemed a flight risk. Leung spent three months in jail and 18 months in house arrest.

== 2004 plea agreement ==
Smith pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely concealing his alleged affair with Katrina Leung, from the FBI. He was sentenced to three months&#x27; home confinement for lying to the FBI about his affair. He also was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. The plea allowed Smith to avoid prison time. Prosecutors also agreed to drop three other charges, including two counts of gross negligence in his handling of national security documents.

=== Case dismissed ===

On January 6, 2005, U.S. District Judge Florence Marie Cooper dismissed Leung&#x27;s case on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. Judge Cooper found that Leung&#x27;s constitutional right to a witness necessary to her defense had been violated in the language of retired Special Agent Smith&#x27;s plea agreement, specifically that he &quot;could not share further information relating to the case with Leung or her counsel&quot;.

=== Appeal and subsequent plea agreement ===

The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and entered plea negotiations with Leung concerning illegal tax returns that had been revealed as a result of this case. On December 16, 2005, Leung pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI and one count of filing a false federal tax return. Leung was sentenced to the terms of her plea agreement, which stated that she must cooperate in full debriefings, three years probation, 100 hours of community service, and a US$10,000 fine.

<text>Paul Moyer Limbert (May 27, 1897 – December 24, 1998) was a clergyman, educator and Secretary General of the World Alliance of YMCAs.

Born in Pennsylvania, Limbert earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Franklin and Marshall College in 1918 and divinity degree at the Lancaster Theological Seminary in 1922. An educator of the first order, Limbert lectured and taught at many American universities, eventually becoming president of Springfield College. He served there from 1946 to 1952.

Limbert was then selected to serve the highest post in all of the YMCA movement. In 1952, he was named Secretary General of the World Alliance of YMCAs in Geneva, Switzerland. During his tenure, the YMCA celebrated its centennial in 1955, and Limbert visited many YMCAs in over 60 nations, including Britain, France, and in Africa.

After his term ended, Limbert traveled, lectured and wrote articles dealing with YMCA history. In 1985, at age 88, he was named as the first inductee into the YMCA Hall of Fame. Limbert was also named as the association&#x27;s most notable living leader, a &quot;position&quot; he held until his death at the age of 101 in 1998.</text><links>

<doc id="214721" wikidata="Q1271226" url="?curid=214721" title="Robert Hallam">
<text>Robert Hallam ( Alum or Halam; died 4 September 1417) was an English churchman, Bishop of Salisbury and English representative at the Council of Constance. He was Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1403 to 1405.

Hallam was originally from Cheshire in northern England&gt; and was educated at Oxford University. As Chancellor he, the Proctors, and all others in the University were pardoned by King Henry IV. On leaving the chancellorship, he was nominated in May 1406 by Pope Innocent VII as Archbishop of York, but the appointment was vetoed by King Henry IV in the same year. However, in 1407 he was consecrated by Pope Gregory XII at Siena as Bishop of Salisbury. As bishop, Hallam supported various churches and shrines in his diocese with grants of episcopal indulgences.

At the Council of Pisa in 1409, Hallam was one of the English representatives. On 6 June 1411, Antipope John XXIII (Baldassare Cardinal Cossa) purported to make Hallam a pseudocardinal, but this title was not recognised.

At the Council of Constance, in November 1414, Hallam was the chief English envoy. There he took a prominent position, as an advocate of Church reform and of the superiority of the council to the pope. He played a leading part in the discussions leading to the deposition of Antipope John XXIII on 29 May 1415, but was less concerned with the trials of Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, through whose influence the council had been assembled, was absent during the whole of 1416 on a diplomatic mission in France and England; but when he returned to Constance in January 1417, as the open ally of the English king, Hallam as Henry V&#x27;s trusted representative obtained increased importance, and contrived to emphasise English prestige by delivering the address of welcome to Sigismund. Afterwards, under Henry&#x27;s direction, he supported the emperor in trying to secure a reform of the Church, before the council proceeded to the election of a new pope. This matter was still undecided when Hallam died suddenly on 4 September 1417. His executors were Masters Richard Hallum, John Fyton, John Hikke, with William Clynt, Thomas Hallum, Thomas Faukys, clerk, &amp; Humfrey Rodeley

After Hallam&#x27;s death the cardinals were able to secure the immediate election of a new pope, Martin V, who was elected on 11 November: it has been said that the abandonment of the reformers by the English was due entirely to Hallam&#x27;s death; but it is more likely that Henry V, foreseeing the possible need for a change of front, had given Hallam discretionary powers which the bishop&#x27;s successors used. Hallam himself had the confidence of Sigismund and was generally respected for his straightforward independence. He was buried in Constance Cathedral, where his tomb near the high altar is marked by a brass of English workmanship.

<doc id="214722" wikidata="Q2362238" url="?curid=214722" title="Mandell Creighton">
<text>Mandell Creighton (; 5 July 1843 – 14 January 1901) was a British historian, Anglican priest and bishop. The son of a successful carpenter in north-west England, Creighton studied at the University of Oxford, focusing his scholarship on the Renaissance Papacy, and then became a don in 1866. He was appointed the first occupant of the Dixie Chair of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge in 1884. The following year, he also was engaged as the founding editor of the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;, the first English-language academic journal in its field. In these posts, he helped to establish history as an independent academic discipline in England.

In addition to his work as a historian, Creighton had a career in the clergy of the Church of England from the mid-1870s until his death. He served as a parish priest in Embleton, Northumberland, and later, successively, as a canon residentiary of Worcester Cathedral (1885), Bishop of Peterborough (1891) and Bishop of London (1897). His moderation and practicality drew praise from Queen Victoria and won notice from politicians. In later years, he was appointed to various positions of trust, including the Privy Council, and it was widely thought that he would have become Archbishop of Canterbury had his death, at the age of 57, not supervened.

As a historian, Creighton&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; was &quot;A History of the Papacy during the Period of the Reformation&quot;, published in five volumes between 1882 and 1894. His historical work received mixed reviews. He was praised for scrupulous even-handedness, but criticised for not taking a stand against historical excesses. He was firm in asserting that public figures should be judged for their public acts, not private ones. He believed that the Church of England was uniquely shaped by its particular English circumstances, and he saw it as the soul of the nation.

Creighton was married to the author and future women&#x27;s suffrage activist Louise Creighton, and the couple had seven children. 
==Early childhood, 1843–1857==
Mandell Creighton was born on 5 July 1843 in the border country city of Carlisle, Cumberland (now in Cumbria); he was the eldest child of Sarah ( Mandell) and Robert Creighton. His mother was a daughter of Thomas Mandell, a yeoman farmer from Bolton, Cumberland. His father, a carpenter, built a successful cabinet-making business in Carlisle. Mandell&#x27;s younger siblings were James (born 1844), Mary (born and died in 1845) and Mary Ellen (known as Polly, born 1849). In 1850, when Mandell was seven Sarah Creighton died unexpectedly. Robert, who never remarried and seldom spoke of his wife again, raised the children with help from his unmarried sister, who came to live with the family; Creighton recalled her as a kind mother-substitute to the children.

A self-made man, Robert Creighton continually expounded the virtues of hard work. Mandell&#x27;s younger brother James joined his father&#x27;s business, was twice elected mayor of Carlisle, and later become a director of the North British Railway. Polly recalled her childhood as &quot;horridly unhappy&quot;. Her formal schooling was limited, but she devoted her adult life to promoting the education of children, and in 1927 became the first woman granted the freedom of the city of Carlisle. The family living quarters, above the shop, were spacious but spartan, with little decoration and few books. Robert was short-tempered and family life could be fraught. There was a strong sense of duty in the household but affection was rarely expressed openly. 

Creighton&#x27;s education began in a nearby dame school. In 1852 he moved to the Carlisle Cathedral School. Under the influence of an inspirational headmaster, the Rev William Bell, he began to read voraciously and excel academically. In November 1857 he took the King&#x27;s Scholarship examination for admission to Durham School located 70 miles (112 km) away. As his Carlisle teachers had not prepared him for translation of Latin verse, he left a portion of the exam unanswered and felt sure he had failed. The examiners assessed his overall performance as good and decided to accept him, offering him a scholarship. In February 1858 the 15-year-old Creighton left Carlisle to become a boarder at Durham.

==Durham School, 1858–1862==

Durham School required its students to attend services in Durham Cathedral on Sundays and holy days. The medieval cathedral&#x27;s high-church ceremony made a lasting impression on Creighton. It became a focus of his religious life and would later influence his choice of career. Durham&#x27;s headmaster, Henry Holden, a classical scholar and an educational reformer, was soon taking an interest in the new student. With Holden&#x27;s encouragement, Creighton began to win prizes in classical subjects, and also English and French. Other pupils came seeking his help in translating passages from their classical studies; they gave him the nickname &quot;Homer&quot; on account of his quickness at construing. During his last year at Durham, he was promoted to head boy of the school, a position that appealed to his strong wish to inspire people, especially younger boys. Although he aimed to do so by setting an example with his own morality, corporal punishment was then the norm in schools, and he did not hesitate to use it. In a solemn letter written to his successor as head boy he wrote of the punishment for drunkenness, beastliness, bullying and stealing: &quot;I strongly recommend giving a fellow a thrashing ... and remember, never thrash a fellow a &quot;little&quot;, always &quot;hard&quot;&quot;.

Creighton was severely short-sighted; he also had double vision, which forced him to read with one eye closed, until a London oculist prescribed glasses to correct the fault. As his poor sight inhibited his participation in sports he took with enthusiasm to walking. His tours of the countryside, often undertaken with companions, could cover more than twenty miles (32 km) a day and last several days. Walking gave him many opportunities to exercise his curiosity about the local botany and architecture. The habit was to remain with him for the rest of his life. 

In the spring of 1862 Creighton applied unsuccessfully for a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. He applied next to Merton College, Oxford, for a classical postmastership. The application was successful and Creighton arrived in Oxford in October 1862. He continued to take a keen interest in Durham School, and once walked there from Oxford to hear speeches at a school function.

==Oxford undergraduate, 1862–1866==
Creighton&#x27;s annual postmastership grant of was enough to cover his tuition at Merton, but little more. For his other expenses he had to apply to his father, who treated him quite generously. Creighton lived economically in college attic rooms for most of his time at Merton. In his last year he moved out of college to share rooms in the High with George Saintsbury, the future author and critic of English and French literature, and wine connoisseur, with whom he developed a shared liking for absinthe.

Merton was a small college, which Creighton later described as &quot;a very cosmopolitan place, made up of all sorts of men, with all sorts of tastes. There were rich men, poor men, reading men, idle men, all meeting on terms of mutual respect and with perfect frankness&quot;. Merton was much favoured by undergraduates from public school backgrounds who had more inclination to sports than to serious study. Creighton was not one such, and his poor eyesight prevented him from playing cricket and football, but he was able to join the college rowing team. Walking continued to be his principal physical recreation. He recalled, &quot;I used to take a train and go somewhere, and walk through the villages, see the churches, study the architecture, and speculate on the conditions of life which must have been the outcome of these surroundings&quot;.

Creighton read voraciously and widely. Among his Merton friends he was dubbed &quot;The Professor&quot;, or &quot;P&quot;. The writers and poets of whose works he became fond included Carlyle, Browning, Tennyson and Swinburne. He was becoming politically aware, embracing a moderate liberalism. He joined the Oxford Union, and although he seldom spoke in debates there he was elected Union president in 1867. He especially honed his skills in informal conversations, conducted anywhere and everywhere, about topics great and small, rising above what Gladstone later dubbed &quot;Oxford&#x27;s agony&quot;—the habit of overestimating the importance of Oxford&#x27;s everyday disputes.

In his second year, Creighton and three other students became inseparable, both during academic terms and vacations, forming a group called &quot;The Quadrilateral&quot;. The group friendship was intense, like many such in that time. Although Creighton had a large circle of male friends, he did not form any close friendships with women during this time. In his final term, he wrote to a friend, &quot;ladies in general are very unsatisfactory mental food: they seem to have no particular thoughts or ideas&quot;. About Creighton&#x27;s religious practice during this time, the historian James Kirby notes that he &quot;attended daily communion, observed fasts, and took an interest in liturgy, becoming, as his biographer—his wife Louise—later said, &#x27;a decided High Churchman&#x27;&quot;.

Academically, Creighton&#x27;s goal was an honours degree in &quot;literae humaniores&quot;, the study of Greek and Roman classical literature, philosophy, and ancient history. In the final examinations, in the spring of his fourth year, he received first-class honours. He was drawn from classical to medieval history by a lecture by W. W. Shirley, the Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History; the works of William Morris, John Ruskin, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti further enhanced this interest. Unlike historians of a generation earlier, such as William Stubbs and E. A. Freeman, students could now gain a supplementary degree in law and history. After six months&#x27; study Creighton took the examinations in that school in Autumn 1866. He had not allowed himself enough time to read all the relevant literature and achieved only a second class degree. His first in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; took precedence and the classics professor Benjamin Jowett suggested that Creighton apply for a teaching fellowship at Balliol. In the event he did not need to: his own college, Merton, elected him as a probationary fellow in December 1866.

==Teaching and marriage, 1867–1874==

At Merton, Creighton became a tutor in Modern History, which Kirby describes as &quot;a relatively new subject which few were then prepared to teach&quot;. During the second half of the 19th century, many academic reforms were instituted at Oxford, beginning with the Oxford University Act 1854. By the 1860s the reforms had trickled down the colleges. Among the changes were the new responsibilities given to college tutors, whose teaching duties had previously consisted entirely of giving personalised instruction in their rooms to undergraduates. They were now tasked with the preparation of students for the university&#x27;s examinations, previously the responsibility of university-wide instructors such as professors. As the tutors were chosen from distinguished recent graduates, the new instructional staff were more youthful than the old. 

At this time there was discontent among the Merton students at what was seen as a lack of leadership in the teaching faculty. Many fellows, both resident and non-resident, had become distant presences. Creighton was popular with undergraduates and was looked upon as someone who would exercise the necessary leadership. According to his biographer James Covert he did so by appealing both to the students&#x27; reasoning and to their good sense, and by simultaneously immersing himself among them. He was given more responsibilities, which brought promotions and salary increases. After four years of teaching, his salary had more than doubled. With the college&#x27;s approval he joined forces with another Merton tutor, William Esson, to open collegiate lectures to students of other colleges. Soon, the Association of Tutors was born, as well as an Oxford-wide series of lectures that any student could attend. The lectures were to influence his choice of future research. He wrote later:
Religious beliefs were also undergoing an upheaval. Many Victorian intellectuals, who had been raised in Christian households, had, in adult life, begun to experience religious doubt and were moving in a secular direction. Creighton, in contrast, was gradually consolidating his religious beliefs. Although his high-church views had moderated, he was to remain devoted to the doctrines of the real presence and apostolic succession throughout his life, although he had little sympathy for ritualism. He never had any crisis of confidence. He had no interest in the new natural sciences and was not moved to read Darwin, regarding his writings as too speculative. Creighton&#x27;s friend Henry Scott Holland wrote of him, &quot;At the close of the sixties it seemed to us at Oxford almost incredible that a young don of any intellectual reputation for modernity should be on the Christian side&quot;. After some speculation by friends about whether Creighton would commit to taking holy orders, he did so, being ordained deacon by John Mackarness, the Bishop of Oxford in 1870. He preached his first sermon in April 1871.

Creighton spent many vacations in Europe. He fell in love with Italy, its scenery, its culture, and its people. This led to a fascination with Renaissance Italy, which became his scholarly interest. He was an admirer of Walter Pater and the aesthetic movement. His rooms in Oxford were decorated with William Morris wallpaper and blue and white pottery. The furnishings brought admiration from friends and requests to view them from acquaintances. Creighton was now leading a life that was far removed from that of his frugal student days. According to Kirby: 
===Marriage===

After his return from a holiday in mainland Europe in early 1871 Creighton attended a lecture by the art critic John Ruskin at the Sheldonian Theatre. After the lecture, he noticed a friend, the future author Humphry Ward, talking to an unfamiliar young woman who was wearing a yellow scarf. Yellow was Creighton&#x27;s favourite colour; the scarf aroused his interest enough for him to ask Ward about the woman, whose name was Louise von Glehn. She was the youngest daughter of a London merchant, Robert von Glehn, a naturalised British citizen who was originally from Reval in the Russian Governorate of Estonia. Soon Ward was inviting Creighton and von Glehn to a Valentine&#x27;s Day lunch hosted in his rooms in Brasenose College. In a few weeks von Glehn found herself won over by Creighton&#x27;s charm, and before she left Oxford at the end of the month, the two were unofficially engaged. Their further courtship involved visiting the National Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum, and examining the early Italian engravings in the print room of the British Museum. Creighton undertook to teach his fiancée Italian; she helped him improve his German. They had agreed to be married the following winter, but as Christmas approached, it was still not certain whether Merton would waive its requirement of celibacy for its teaching fellows. On Christmas Eve the college passed a special statute enabling four fellows, including Creighton, to hold office after marrying. Von Glehn and Creighton were married on 8 January 1872 in her home town of Sydenham, Kent. They spent a week honeymooning in Paris before returning to Oxford for Creighton&#x27;s new teaching term.

Like many Victorian scholars, Creighton assumed that his wife would be an accessory in his academic pursuits and that he would be the senior partner in their intellectual relationship. During their courtship, he had written to her: 
In the summer of 1873 the couple took their first trip together to Italy. It was during this trip that Creighton made firm his intention to study the Renaissance popes for his life&#x27;s research. During these years there were additions to the family: a daughter was born to the couple in the autumn of 1872, and another in the summer of 1874. With a growing family and a clear research plan, Creighton began to doubt the long-term viability of his Merton tutorial fellowship. He wanted to give more time to writing history than his college duties allowed. He was ordained priest in 1873, and the following year an opportunity arose of a rural living in a remote parish in coastal Northumberland to which Merton held the right of appointment. Creighton later said:
Although varying advice was offered by Louise, by Creighton&#x27;s married colleagues, by his unmarried colleagues, and even by his students, his mind was made up. When, in late 1874, the college formally offered him the position of vicar of the parish of Embleton, Creighton accepted and the family moved there in December.

==Vicar of Embleton, 1875–1884==

The village of Embleton lies close to the North Sea in Northumberland approximately midway between Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne. The vicarage—then owned by Merton College and consisting of a fortified pele tower built in the 14th century along with adjoining later additions—was a large establishment with many rooms for Creighton&#x27;s growing family, their guests, and servants. The parish consisted of a handful of villages and approximately 1700 inhabitants, among whom were farmers, whinstone quarrymen, herring and haddock fishermen, women workers in fish curing yards, and railwaymen. 

Although the Creightons missed Oxford society and its stimulations they gradually adapted to their new surroundings. With the help of a curate paid from his own funds, Creighton established a routine that enabled him to both carry out pastoral duty and write history. Each weekday morning, he spent four hours reading in the vicarage library. In the afternoons, Mandell, and whenever possible, Louise, visited the homes of their parishioners, listening to them, giving advice, offering prayers, conducting services for the housebound, and, on occasion, handing out home-made medical remedies. They found their parishioners to be reserved, proud, and independent, but could not help seeing them as lacking in morals. 

Although Creighton was not a teetotaller—he made a clear distinction between the suppression of drunkenness and the suppression of drink—he founded a local chapter of the Church of England Temperance Society, thereby displeasing some locals. Louise organised meetings of the Mothers&#x27; Union as well as The Girls&#x27; Friendly Society, which aimed to empower girls, encouraging them, for example, to stay in school until the age of fourteen.

Creighton&#x27;s own family was growing: four more children were born during the Embleton years, and all were home schooled, mostly by Louise. Creighton, who took great interest in the parish schools, served as examiner for other schools in the region, and began to formulate some ideas on the education of children. He was elected to local government bodies such as the Board of Guardians, which administered the poor laws in the region, and to the local sanitary authority. In 1879 he accepted his first administrative position in the Church of England: he was appointed rural dean of the Alnwick area of the diocese, responsible—in addition to his parochial duties at Embleton—for supervising the clergy in neighbouring parishes. Later, he was appointed examining chaplain for the Bishop of Newcastle, Ernest Roland Wilberforce, and tasked with assessing candidates for holy orders.

Between the two of them, the Creightons wrote fifteen books during their ten years in Embleton. They both wrote history books for young people, Louise wrote an unsuccessful novel, and Mandell wrote the first two volumes of his magnum opus, &quot;The History of the Papacy in the Period of Reformation&quot;. The &quot;Papacy&quot; volumes, published in 1882, cover the period leading up the Reformation, and end twenty years before the birth of Luther. They were well received and were commended for their even-handed approach. The historian Lord Acton, who reviewed them in &quot;The Academy&quot; and who was aware that they were written over a few years in a northern vicarage far from the centres of scholarship, wrote:

Creighton also wrote dozens of book reviews and scholarly articles. Among them were his first forays into the role of the Church of England in the life of the nation. Throughout the 19th century, the Church had suffered erosion of membership. In the mid-century, many scholars such as the educator Thomas Arnold had asserted the identity of the Church and the nation; as the century entered its last two decades, Creighton was among a small minority continuing to do the same.

In 1884 Creighton was invited to apply for the newly created professorship of ecclesiastical history, the Dixie chair, at the University of Cambridge and a concurrent fellowship at Emmanuel College. His application was successful, and on 9 November 1884 Creighton preached his last sermon at Embleton church. Later, he said, &quot;At Embleton I spent ten years, and I have no hesitation in saying that they were the ten happiest years of my life. There I got to know people, and to know English people: two things ... which one does not learn at a University&quot;. Louise Creighton recalled that his parishioners found it difficult to express their feelings openly; she recorded one woman as saying, &quot;Well, if you ain&#x27;t done no good, you&#x27;ve done no harm&quot;, which coming from a Northumbrian he took as high praise. After his death he was commemorated in Embleton by the building of the Creighton Memorial Hall. Built with the financial support of Sir Edward Grey and others, it was declared open by Louise Creighton in October 1903.

==Cambridge professor, 1884–1891==

The Creightons arrived in Cambridge in late November 1884 and were deluged with invitations to social engagements. Interaction with academic society after ten years led to new friendships, especially for Louise. One such new acquaintance, Beatrice Webb, who became Louise&#x27;s firm lifelong friend, wrote of her, &quot;She has, I think, a warmer heart and a larger mind than her husband&#x27;s&quot;. Creighton had already corresponded with Acton and now met him in person, as he did other Cambridge notables, such as Robertson Smith, the Hebrew and Arabic scholar, and Alfred Marshall, the economist.
From his arrival in Cambridge, colleagues turned to Creighton for his advice. He contributed to changes in the historical tripos,contributing from his arrival to changes in the historical tripos and its examination, providing candidates with more choice and more open-ended questions. Crowder writes, &quot;As a historian he was concerned with what the past had to tell about the character of the actors and their times rather than with the accumulation of information&quot;.

Creighton lectured twice a week at the university, preparing extensively, but lecturing without notes. He also preached in the Emmanuel College chapel. A colleague said of his preaching style, &quot;He did not care for eloquence, indeed he despised it; what he aimed at was instruction, and for this he always looked more to principles than facts&quot;. He lectured more informally to undergraduates at Emmanuel College once a week. He supported Cambridge&#x27;s two new women&#x27;s colleges, Girton (founded 1869) Newnham (1871), and taught informal weekly classes at Newnham. Two students from those classes, Mary Bateson and Alice Gardner, later became professional historians; both were mentored by Creighton.

Creighton was given to undertaking any work he was asked to do. In 1885 he accepted two appointments that added substantially to his workload. A long-planned journal of history, &quot;The English Historical Review&quot; was launched with Creighton as its editor, and he became a residentiary canon of Worcester Cathedral. Crowder writes that Creighton had no illusions about the work editing the journal would entail: &quot;he accepted out of duty, before any editorial policy had been framed, quite apart from his goal of promoting interest in the discipline and improving research&quot;.

The canonry at Worcester required the holder to be in residence there for a total of three months every year. Creighton fitted this into his academic schedule: he and his household lived in the cathedral close there during university vacations. During the weeks of his residence he preached in the cathedral every Sunday evening to large congregations. He contributed to the cathedral&#x27;s intellectual and liturgical life, giving lectures and bringing visiting scholars to lecture to the clergy of the diocese.

Creighton&#x27;s experiences at Worcester led him to consider how a relationship of competition between a cathedral and the parish churches of the diocese could be turned into one of cooperation, a subject on which he would write scholarly articles. He did not overlook the grim side of city life. He joined the Worcester Diocesan Penitentiary Association and was moved by the plight of prison inmates. In a sermon at the Sanitary Congress of Worcester in 1889 he spoke about the effect of harsh physical life on the moral life:
Emmanuel College was the alma mater of the Rev John Harvard, after whom Harvard College in the United States is named. That college marked its 250th anniversary in November 1886 and Creighton, accompanied by Louise, attended the celebrations, representing Emmanuel. During the extended visit, they met prominent American men of letters, including the historian of the American West, Francis Parkman; the future supreme court justice, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.; and the poet and critic James Russell Lowell. Creighton received an honorary Harvard doctorate.

In February 1887 volumes III and IV of Creighton&#x27;s &quot;History of the Papacy&quot; were published by Longmans. These volumes narrowed the focus to specific popes, chiefly, Sixtus IV, Alexander VI and Julius II, and covered a period of a little over half a century, bringing the narrative to 1518 and the start of the Reformation. In his approach of maintaining historiographical balance and considering individuals as products of their historical eras, Creighton did not single out anyone for special condemnation, even the Borgia pope, Alexander VI, whose &quot;exceptional infamy&quot;, Creighton felt, was &quot;largely due to the fact that he did not add hypocrisy to his other vices&quot;.

Creighton invited Acton to review the two volumes for the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;. Acton had by this time developed what the historian J. P. Kenyon has called &quot;his hatred of the papacy, [which], inflamed by his historical studies, knew no bounds&quot;. Acton&#x27;s review was largely hostile, implying that Creighton&#x27;s methods were not those of a &quot;scrupulous and self-respecting writer&quot;, and commenting adversely about &quot;the economy of evidence, and the severity with which the raw material is repressed&quot;. In the following weeks there were contentious exchanges between the two men, polarising eventually into their two views of history, Acton&#x27;s normative approach versus Creighton&#x27;s more relativist one. Acton&#x27;s strictures led Creighton to reconsider his own position and become slightly more judgmental. In an 1895 paper he would write that the papacy, &quot;which had been established for the promotion of morality&quot; had in fact &quot;provided the means for the utmost immorality&quot;.

==Bishop of Peterborough, 1891–1896==
In December 1890 Creighton received a letter from Lord Salisbury, the Prime Minister, asking whether he would be willing to exchange the canonry of Worcester for the canonry of Windsor, which had become vacant. After some hesitation, Creighton accepted, but before he could take up the new appointment it was forestalled by another letter from Salisbury, in February. This offered appointment as Bishop of Peterborough, an office that had become available upon the translation of its incumbent William Connor Magee to York. Creighton was chosen partly because his love for ritual had created an impression among others that he had a high-church outlook. The Peterborough diocese had many high churchmen, and it was felt that Creighton would be a good fit. In fact, Creighton was quite broad church in terms of doctrine and belief (as opposed to his taste for vestments and high-church trappings); his moderate views would later make him popular with Queen Victoria.

In Creighton&#x27;s mind, the Peterborough appointment, which he felt duty-bound to accept, meant the effective end of his academic life. The Creightons, particularly Louise, were evidently depressed at the prospect of leaving Cambridge. In a letter to an old college friend, Creighton wrote, &quot;No man could have less desire than I for the office of bishop. Nothing save the cowardliness of shirking from responsibility and the dread of selfishness led me to submit&quot;.

A few weeks before Creighton&#x27;s consecration as bishop at Westminster Abbey in late April 1891, he fell ill with muscular rheumatism. Soon after his enthronement at Peterborough Cathedral in mid-May 1891 he was taken ill again, this time with influenza. Each time, the recovery was prolonged. The Peterborough diocese, then comprising 676 parishes and including Leicester and Northampton, offered a vast ecclesiastical challenge. Creighton met it in the manner he had employed in Embleton: he proceeded to visit every corner. Travelling by train to distant parishes, staying overnight with the parish priests, and conducting services in their churches, Creighton spent very little time at home with his family during the first year. His immersion among the clergy, treatment of them as equals, and dispatch in attending to their concerns, gradually increased his popularity. The experience also helped him to work out his doctrinal stance. Although he was personally liberal, he came firmly to believe that to be English was to be Anglican, and to regard dissenters as having lost their way and Roman Catholics as disloyal.

Creighton also became determined to better understand the working classes of his diocese. The Leicester boot-and-shoe-trade strike of 1895, which began in March as a lock-out of 120,000 workers by employers, gave him just such an opportunity. Creighton wrote an open letter to his clergy, impressed them with the gravity of the situation, and urged them to work impartially to facilitate communication between the opposing sides. According to Covert, &quot;Creighton&#x27;s tactic was to serve as conduit for all bargaining parties, sharing information and feelings derived from his local clergy, who, being on the spot, possessed insights and sympathies that needed to be known and expressed&quot;. By late April, a compromise was reached for which Creighton reaped much praise as well as a growing reputation as a peacemaker.

A year earlier, in 1894, the fifth and last volume of Creighton&#x27;s &quot;History of Papacy in the Period of Reformation&quot; was published by Longman. The book was subtitled &quot;The German Revolt, 1517–1527&quot; and covered the history up to the Sack of Rome in 1527. Creighton had found little time to devote to its writing, and critics generally expressed disappointment in the outcome. Although he had originally planned to continue the history up to the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563, Creighton did not now feel up to the task. As the volumes did not cover the period claimed in their title, the publisher, in 1897, brought out a second edition titled, &quot;A History of the Papacy from the Great Schism to the Sack of Rome, 1378–1527&quot; reflecting the reduced scope. Creighton, nonetheless, remained a popular lecturer. During his Peterborough years, he gave many lectures, most published later in book form, their titles reflecting his diverse intellectual interests. Among his addresses were the Hulsean Lectures at Cambridge in the winter of 1893–94 on &quot;Persecution and Tolerance&quot;, the 1895 Rede Lecture at Cambridge on &quot;The Early Renaissance in England&quot;, the 1896 Romanes Lecture at Oxford on &quot;The English National Character&quot;, and his 1896 address at Westminster Abbey on &quot;Saint Edward the Confessor&quot;.

In June 1896 Creighton represented the Church of England at the coronation of Czar Nicholas II in Moscow, deputising for the Archbishop of Canterbury, Edward White Benson, who was ill, as was Randall Davidson, the Bishop of Winchester, who as Prelate of the Order of the Garter would have been the official stand-in. A lover of pageantry, Creighton wore a bishop&#x27;s cope and mitre of white and gold, rather than the plainer episcopal attire more familiar in England at the time. On his return he wrote a twenty-page account of the coronation for the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, which gained the attention of Queen Victoria, who sent Creighton a letter requesting several copies for the royal family.

==Bishop of London, 1897–1901==
===Appointment===
In October 1896 Archbishop Benson died. Three possible successors were considered: Frederick Temple (Bishop of London), Davidson and Creighton. Queen Victoria wanted Davidson to be offered the archbishopric; the Archbishop of York (William Maclagan) and the Prince of Wales favoured Creighton, but the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, with whom the decision effectively rested, preferred to move Temple to Canterbury and replace him in London with Creighton. &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Considerable doubt has been felt as to the fitness of the appointment to the Archbishopric of Canterbury of a man as advanced in life as Dr Temple&quot;, but expressed great confidence in Creighton. He was not then, any more than he had ever been, eager for ecclesiastical advancement, which he felt had been thrust upon him and disrupted his academic career. Nonetheless he considered it his duty to undertake what was asked of him, though hoping for a return to scholarly endeavours at the end.

Creighton was enthroned as Bishop of London on 30 January 1897. At first his subordinate clergy were unsure about him. According to one commentator:

The same (anonymous) commentator said that Creighton&#x27;s liking for vestments should not lead people to suppose he was sympathetic to ritualism or would tolerate any practices not authorised by the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

===Educational reform===
One of Creighton&#x27;s first efforts after becoming Bishop of London was to support the passage of the Voluntary School Bill of 1897. Almost thirty years earlier, the Elementary Education Act 1870 had established non-denominational elementary schools, also called board schools, which were funded by local taxes. Religious schools, also called &quot;voluntary schools&quot; had not received this support. The bill asked for extension of taxpayer support to the voluntary schools. In March 1897 Creighton addressed the House of Lords in support of the bill, which was eventually passed by both Houses of Parliament. Creighton felt strongly that all religious instruction should be denominational. In a letter to the London district school boards, he wrote, &quot;We only ask that the wishes of the parents be consulted about [religious] education of their children, and that every child in England should receive instruction in the religious beliefs of the denomination to which his parents belong&quot;.

===High-v-low church controversies===
By 1898 Creighton was increasingly occupied with a debate over ritual practice in the Diocese of London, and, more generally, in the Church of England. On his arrival in London, he had discovered that low-church clergy in his diocese were taking exception to the ritual practices of some high churchmen, practices thought by some to show Roman Catholic influence. The controversy had begun in the wake of the Oxford Movement of the 1830s and later, which had created an Anglo-Catholic revival within the Church. An evangelical agitator, John Kensit, had protested that Creighton himself had on occasion worn a cope and mitre. Kensit called for Creighton to take a firmer public stance against high-church rituals, such as the use of candles and incense. Although Creighton seemed to subscribe to a broad branch theory—that the real Catholic Church was a collection of national churches which included the Church of England, the Church of Rome and the Eastern Orthodox Church—he was firm about asserting Anglican doctrine—that liturgical practice, beyond that involving what he termed &quot;permissible liberty&quot;, must conform to that in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. In a circular letter to his clergy, he wrote:
This was not enough to satisfy Kensit and his more vocal evangelical supporters, who threatened to create public disruption. Eventually the archbishops of Canterbury and York held a hearing in Lambeth Palace, and in August 1899 ruled against the use of candles and incense, a seeming victory for the low-church forces. The wider doctrinal conflict, though, was to continue beyond both the Victorian and Edwardian eras.

===Workload, final days and death===
Throughout this time, Creighton conducted the endless business that came with his large diocese. In one year, he was recorded to have given 294 formal sermons and addresses. He made trips to Windsor Castle and Sandringham to conduct services for Queen Victoria. In 1897 he organised a special service of thanksgiving outside St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in commemoration of her Diamond Jubilee. His prominent office, moreover, brought other responsibilities. He was appointed to the Privy Council; he became a trustee of the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and many other organisations, and succeeded Frederic Leighton as president of the committee commissioning the Survey of London which documented the capital&#x27;s principal buildings and public art.

Creighton&#x27;s health became a cause for concern to his family and friends. Starting in 1898, he had begun to experience bouts of stomach pain. By 1899 these had increased in severity, and by the summer of 1900 his doctors were suspecting a stomach tumour. He was operated on twice in December of that year, but the surgeries were unsuccessful. In early January he experienced two severe stomach haemorrhages and his condition rapidly declined. He died on 14 January 1901, aged 57.

On 17 January 1901, after a funeral in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral attended by archbishops, bishops and other clergy, politicians, academics, representatives of other churches and faiths, and numerous members of the general public, Archbishop Temple presided over the interment of Creighton&#x27;s body in the crypt. It was the first time that a Bishop of London had been buried in Wren&#x27;s St Paul&#x27;s, which replaced Old St Paul&#x27;s after the Great Fire of London in 1666.

==Character and personal life==
The philosopher Edward Caird, a fellow at Merton during Creighton&#x27;s student days there, said of him, &quot;Creighton possesses common sense in a degree which amounts to genius&quot;. Later, at Cambridge, some colleagues were perplexed by his personality. When teaching or transacting academic business, he displayed a shrewd, canny intelligence. But at social gatherings, much to the delight of the students present, he was continually outrageous and flippant. His relationship with Louise is not easily characterised. In the months after the Peterborough appointment, husband and wife would frequently quarrel, sometimes bitterly, as a niece would later recall. But the couple could also be surprisingly demonstrative for their times: during this same period, a nephew caught sight of Louise and her husband locked in passionate embrace. The Creightons had seven children, and he could be stern with them, on one occasion tying a daughter to a table leg as a punishment. Yet he could also romp around the house with them, engage in horseplay, and make up nonsensical stories—all of which, many years later, they would consider highlights of their childhood. 

Throughout his life, Creighton went on long walks (his &quot;rambles&quot;, as he liked to call them). When the children grew older, the family&#x27;s outdoor pastime of choice became hockey. Many clergy visiting him at his London residence, Fulham Palace, found themselves unable to refuse Creighton&#x27;s enthusiastic invitations to join in. 

Although sparing with alcohol, Creighton was a lifelong chain smoker. An interviewer recalled seeing him rolling and smoking &quot;cigarettes innumerable&quot;. When the author Samuel Butler received an invitation to visit the Creightons in Peterborough in 1894, he was dubious about accepting until his secretary noticed in the letter a flake of tobacco inadvertently left by Creighton.

Creighton loved pageantry, creating speculation that he had high-church views. However, when a high-church priest protested that incense was needed for curing souls, Creighton responded, &quot;And you think that souls like herring cannot be cured without smoke?&quot; His moderate views—equally opposed to radical evangelicals and conservative Anglo-Catholics—endeared him to Queen Victoria. His work ethic, on the other hand, was far from moderate. He seldom refused offers of additional responsibility, confessing more than once to both an abiding fatalism about being saddled with more responsibility and guilt about shirking it. His old friend Scott Holland, by then a canon of St Paul&#x27;s, welcoming Creighton to the diocese of London in 1897, remarked, &quot;I hope you will use up everybody except yourself. We want our Bishop to have his head above water—not to be loaded down by the tremendous grind&quot;.

==Legacy and reputation==
Obituaries in contemporary newspapers and scholarly journals hailed Creighton as one of England&#x27;s great historians and a prelate of remarkable integrity. The &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; remarked, &quot;It is certainly rare to find so much intellectual force and so high a standard of conduct combined in one man&quot;.

===Historian===
Today, Creighton is better known as a historian than as a cleric. His work is seen as part of his own era in British historiography. Many of the milestones of Creighton&#x27;s academic life, such as founding of the &quot;English Historical Review&quot; in 1885, with himself as the first editor, are those of the era as well. According to the historian Philippa Levine:

Creighton is considered to be one of the first British historians with a distinctly European outlook. Of his magnum opus, &quot;History of the Papacy in the Period of the Reformation&quot;, R. J. W. Evans writes, &quot;[It] constitutes one of the first great attempts to introduce the British to explicitly and history&quot;. 

Creighton and his peers left a heterogeneous legacy. On the one hand, Creighton was a painstakingly balanced scholar; even his critic Lord Acton described Creighton&#x27;s strength as &quot;sovereign impartiality&quot;. Creighton saw himself as someone interested in actions, in contrast to Acton, whom he considered to be interested in ideas. Although Creighton did not personally consider the popes to be guiltless (for example, amidst writing the third papacy volume, he wrote, in a letter to a friend, that working on the Borgias was like &quot;spending one&#x27;s day in a low police court&quot;) Creighton was emphatic that public men be judged for their public and not private actions. In a lecture on &quot;Historical Ethics&quot; he gave in the wake of his dispute with Acton, he said, &quot;I like to stand upon clear grounds which can be proved and estimated. I do not like to wrap myself in the garb of outraged dignity because men in the past did things contrary to the principles which I think soundest in the present&quot;.

On the other hand, Creighton&#x27;s historical outlook, as well as that of his historian peers, bore the cultural and social stamp of their position. According to the historians Robert Harrison, Aled Jones and Peter Lambert, &quot;Their emphasis on the Englishness of Britain&#x27;s key institutions, for instance, effectively excluded non-English ethnic groups from the &#x27;chief part&#x27;, as Creighton had put it, of history&#x27;s subject&quot;.

In the words of the historian John Wolffe:
===Churchman===
The emphasis on concreteness and reality would remain a feature of Creighton&#x27;s episcopates. He saw the Church of England not as an abstract entity existing independently in space and time, but as rooted in England, its people, and their history. In the words of the historian Keith Robbins, &quot;It was an unashamed acknowledgment on his part that the form, structure, ethos and doctrine of that church had been fashioned in the circumstances of English history&quot;. Similarly, Creighton saw the living church as an embodiment of the contemporary yearnings of the English people. He wrote, &quot;The people need not agree about details, but the general trend of the Church must be regulated by their wishes. The Church cannot go too far from the main ideas of the people&quot;. Consequently Creighton could imbue the church with Victorian self-assessments and aspirations: &quot;The function of the Church of England was to be a church of free men. The Church of Rome was the church of decadent peoples: it lives only in the past, and has no future ... The Church of England has before it the conquest of the world&quot;. 

As a corollary of this outlook, Creighton was explicitly against the separation of church and state. In his way of thinking, church and state were two aspects of the nation as seen from two vantage points. Any attempt at legislating a separation would, in addition, have caused social disruptions in late-Victorian Britain: many higher clergy had ties of education and friendship with prominent public men.

In Wolffe&#x27;s summary: 
===Honours and memorials===
During his lifetime Creighton received honorary doctorates from these universities: Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, and Glasgow, and Trinity College, Dublin. A few years after his death, the Creighton lecture was established at King&#x27;s College, London. The lecture series celebrated its centenary in 2007.

Creighton was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1897. He was a corresponding member of the Massachusetts Historical Society and of the American Society of Church History, and a fellow of the .

In 1907 Louise Creighton raised funds to found Bishop Creighton House, serving the area around Fulham and Hammersmith, tackling problems caused by social isolation and disadvantage.

There is a memorial to Creighton in Peterborough Cathedral just north of the sanctuary in the form of a substantial mosaic depicting his effigy, details of his life and the mottos &quot;I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ&quot; and &quot;He tried to write true history&quot;. The memorial to Creighton in St Paul&#x27;s bears the same two inscriptions.

<text>Urocissa is a genus of birds in the Corvidae, a family that contains the crows, jays, and magpies.

The genus was established by German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850. The type species was subsequently designated as the red-billed blue magpie (&quot;Urocissa erythroryncha&quot;). The name &quot;Urocissa&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;kissa&quot; meaning &quot;magpie&quot; .
==Species==
The genus contains five species:

<text>In mathematics, the -th harmonic number is the sum of the reciprocals of the first natural numbers:
formula_1

Starting from , the sequence of harmonic numbers begins:
formula_2

Harmonic numbers are related to the harmonic mean in that the -th harmonic number is also times the reciprocal of the harmonic mean of the first positive integers.

Harmonic numbers have been studied since antiquity and are important in various branches of number theory. They are sometimes loosely termed harmonic series, are closely related to the Riemann zeta function, and appear in the expressions of various special functions.

The harmonic numbers roughly approximate the natural logarithm function and thus the associated harmonic series grows without limit, albeit slowly. In 1737, Leonhard Euler used the divergence of the harmonic series to provide a new proof of the infinity of prime numbers. His work was extended into the complex plane by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, leading directly to the celebrated Riemann hypothesis about the distribution of prime numbers.

When the value of a large quantity of items has a Zipf&#x27;s law distribution, the total value of the most-valuable items is proportional to the -th harmonic number. This leads to a variety of surprising conclusions regarding the long tail and the theory of network value.

The Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem implies that, except for the case , the harmonic numbers are never integers.

==Identities involving harmonic numbers==
By definition, the harmonic numbers satisfy the recurrence relation
formula_3

The harmonic numbers are connected to the Stirling numbers of the first kind by the relation
formula_4

The harmonic numbers satisfy the series identities
formula_5
and
formula_6
These two results are closely analogous to the corresponding integral results
formula_7
and
formula_8

===Identities involving ===

There are several infinite summations involving harmonic numbers and powers of :
formula_9

==Calculation==
An integral representation given by Euler is
formula_10

The equality above is straightforward by the simple algebraic identity
formula_11

Using the substitution , another expression for is
formula_12
The th harmonic number is about as large as the natural logarithm of . The reason is that the sum is approximated by the integral
formula_13
whose value is .

The values of the sequence decrease monotonically towards the limit
formula_14
where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The corresponding asymptotic expansion is
formula_15
where are the Bernoulli numbers.

==Generating functions==
A generating function for the harmonic numbers is
formula_16
where ln(&quot;z&quot;) is the natural logarithm. An exponential generating function is
formula_17
where Ein(&quot;z&quot;) is the entire exponential integral. The exponential integral may also be expressed as
formula_18
where Γ(0, &quot;z&quot;) is the incomplete gamma function.

== Arithmetic properties ==
The harmonic numbers have several interesting arithmetic properties. It is well-known that formula_19 is an integer if and only if formula_20, a result often attributed to Taeisinger. Indeed, using 2-adic valuation, it is not difficult to prove that for formula_21 the numerator of formula_19 is an odd number while the denominator of formula_19 is an even number. More precisely,
formula_24
with some odd integers formula_25 and formula_26.

As a consequence of Wolstenholme&#x27;s theorem, for any prime number formula_27 the numerator of formula_28 is divisible by formula_29. Furthermore, Eisenstein proved that for all odd prime number formula_30 it holds
formula_31
where formula_32 is a Fermat quotient, with the consequence that formula_30 divides the numerator of formula_34 if and only if formula_30 is a Wieferich prime.

In 1991, Eswarathasan and Levine defined formula_36 as the set of all positive integers formula_37 such that the numerator of formula_38 is divisible by a prime number formula_39 They proved that
formula_40
for all prime numbers formula_41 and they defined &quot;harmonic primes&quot; to be the primes formula_30 such that formula_36 has exactly 3 elements.

Eswarathasan and Levine also conjectured that formula_36 is a finite set for all primes formula_45 and that there are infinitely many harmonic primes. Boyd verified that formula_36 is finite for all prime numbers up to formula_47 except 83, 127, and 397; and he gave a heuristic suggesting that the density of the harmonic primes in the set of all primes should be formula_48. Sanna showed that formula_36 has zero asymptotic density, while Bing-Ling Wu and Yong-Gao Chen proved that the number of elements of formula_36 not exceeding formula_51 is at most formula_52, for all formula_53.

==Applications==
The harmonic numbers appear in several calculation formulas, such as the digamma function
formula_54
This relation is also frequently used to define the extension of the harmonic numbers to non-integer &quot;n&quot;. The harmonic numbers are also frequently used to define using the limit introduced earlier:
formula_55
although
formula_56
converges more quickly.

In 2002, Jeffrey Lagarias proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that
formula_57
is true for every integer with strict inequality if ; here denotes the sum of the divisors of .

The eigenvalues of the nonlocal problem on formula_58
formula_59
are given by formula_60, where by convention formula_61, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are given by the Legendre polynomials formula_62.

==Generalizations==

===Generalized harmonic numbers===
The &quot;n&quot;th generalized harmonic number of order &quot;m&quot; is given by
formula_63

(In some sources, this may also be denoted by formula_64 or formula_65)

The special case &quot;m&quot; = 0 gives formula_66 The special case &quot;m&quot; = 1 reduces to the usual harmonic number:
formula_67

The limit of formula_68 as is finite if , with the generalized harmonic number bounded by and converging to the Riemann zeta function
formula_69

The smallest natural number &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;kn&quot; does not divide the denominator of generalized harmonic number &quot;H&quot;(&quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) nor the denominator of alternating generalized harmonic number &quot;H′&quot;(&quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is, for &quot;n&quot;=1, 2, ... :
:77, 20, 94556602, 42, 444, 20, 104, 42, 76, 20, 77, 110, 3504, 20, 903, 42, 1107, 20, 104, 42, 77, 20, 2948, 110, 136, 20, 76, 42, 903, 20, 77, 42, 268, 20, 7004, 110, 1752, 20, 19203, 42, 77, 20, 104, 42, 76, 20, 370, 110, 1107, 20, ... 

The related sum formula_70 occurs in the study of Bernoulli numbers; the harmonic numbers also appear in the study of Stirling numbers.

Some integrals of generalized harmonic numbers are
formula_71
and
formula_72 where &quot;A&quot; is Apéry&#x27;s constant &quot;ζ&quot;(3),
and
formula_73

Every generalized harmonic number of order &quot;m&quot; can be written as a function of harmonic numbers of order formula_74 using
formula_75   for example: formula_76

A generating function for the generalized harmonic numbers is
formula_77
where formula_78 is the polylogarithm, and . The generating function given above for is a special case of this formula.

A fractional argument for generalized harmonic numbers can be introduced as follows:

For every formula_79 integer, and formula_80 integer or not, we have from polygamma functions:
formula_81
where formula_82 is the Riemann zeta function. The relevant recurrence relation is
formula_83
Some special values areformula_84where &quot;G&quot; is Catalan&#x27;s constant. In the special case that formula_85, we get
formula_86
where formula_87 is the Hurwitz zeta function. This relationship is used to calculate harmonic numbers numerically.

===Multiplication formulas===
The multiplication theorem applies to harmonic numbers. Using polygamma functions, we obtain
formula_88
or, more generally,
formula_89

For generalized harmonic numbers, we have
formula_90
where formula_91 is the Riemann zeta function.

===Hyperharmonic numbers===

The next generalization was discussed by J. H. Conway and R. K. Guy in their 1995 book &quot;The Book of Numbers&quot;. Let
formula_92
Then the nth hyperharmonic number of order &quot;r&quot; (&quot;r&gt;0&quot;) is defined recursively as
formula_93
In particular, formula_94 is the ordinary harmonic number formula_38.

=== Roman Harmonic numbers ===
The Roman Harmonic numbers, named after Steven Roman, were introduced by Daniel Loeb and Gian-Carlo Rota in the context of a generalization of umbral calculus with logarithms. There are many possible definitions, but one of them, for formula_96, isformula_97andformula_98Of course,formula_99

If formula_100, they satisfyformula_101Closed form formulas areformula_102where formula_103 is Stirling numbers of the first kind generalized to negative first argument, andformula_104which was found by Donald Knuth.

In fact, these numbers were defined in a more general manner using Roman numbers and Roman factorials, that include negative values for formula_37. This generalization was useful in their study to define Harmonic logarithms.

==Harmonic numbers for real and complex values==

The formulae given above,
formula_106
are an integral and a series representation for a function that interpolates the harmonic numbers and, via analytic continuation, extends the definition to the complex plane other than the negative integers &quot;x&quot;. The interpolating function is in fact closely related to the digamma function
formula_107
where is the digamma function, and is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The integration process may be repeated to obtain
formula_108

The Taylor series for the harmonic numbers is
formula_109
which comes from the Taylor series for the digamma function (formula_110 is the Riemann zeta function).

=== Alternative, asymptotic formulation ===
There is an asymptotic formulation that gives the same result as the analytic continuation of the integral just described. When seeking to approximate  for a complex number , it is effective to first compute  for some large integer . Use that as an approximation for the value of . Then use the recursion relation backwards  times, to unwind it to an approximation for . Furthermore, this approximation is exact in the limit as  goes to infinity.

Specifically, for a fixed integer , it is the case that
formula_111

If  is not an integer then it is not possible to say whether this equation is true because we have not yet (in this section) defined harmonic numbers for non-integers. However, we do get a unique extension of the harmonic numbers to the non-integers by insisting that this equation continue to hold when the arbitrary integer  is replaced by an arbitrary complex number ,

formula_112
Swapping the order of the two sides of this equation and then subtracting them from  gives
formula_113

This infinite series converges for all complex numbers  except the negative integers, which fail because trying to use the recursion relation backwards through the value  involves a division by zero. By this construction, the function that defines the harmonic number for complex values is the unique function that simultaneously satisfies (1) , (2) for all complex numbers  except the non-positive integers, and (3) for all complex values .

This last formula can be used to show that
formula_114
where  is the Euler–Mascheroni constant or, more generally, for every  we have:
formula_115

===Special values for fractional arguments===
There are the following special analytic values for fractional arguments between 0 and 1, given by the integral
formula_116

More values may be generated from the recurrence relation
formula_117
or from the reflection relation
formula_118

For example:
formula_119

Which are computed via Gauss&#x27;s digamma theorem, which essentially states that for positive integers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; with &quot;p&quot; &lt; &quot;q&quot;
formula_120

===Relation to the Riemann zeta function===
Some derivatives of fractional harmonic numbers are given by
formula_121

And using Maclaurin series, we have for &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1 that
formula_122

For fractional arguments between 0 and 1 and for &quot;a&quot; &gt; 1,
formula_123

<text>Henry Hallam (9 July 1777 – 21 January 1859) was an English historian. Educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, he practised as a barrister on the Oxford circuit for some years before turning to history. His major works were &quot;View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages&quot; (1818), &quot;The Constitutional History of England&quot; (1827), and &quot;Introduction to the Literature of Europe, in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries&quot; (1837). Although he took no part in politics himself, he was well acquainted with the band of authors and politicians who led the Whig party. In an 1828 review of &quot;Constitutional History&quot;, Robert Southey claimed that the work was biased in favour of the Whigs.

Hallam was a fellow of the Royal Society, and a trustee of the British Museum. In 1830 he received the gold medal for history founded by George IV.

==Life==
The only son of Rev John Hallam, canon of Windsor and dean of Bristol, Henry Hallam was born on 9 July 1777 and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1799. Called to the Bar, he practised for some years on the Oxford circuit; but his tastes were literary, and when, on his father&#x27;s death in 1812, he inherited a small estate in Lincolnshire, he gave himself up to study. He had become connected with the brilliant band of authors and politicians who led the Whig party, a connection to which he owed his appointment to the well-paid and easy post of commissioner of stamps; but took no part in politics himself. He was, however, an active supporter of many popular movements—particularly of that which ended in the abolition of the slave trade; and he was attached to the political principles of the Whigs.

Hallam&#x27;s earliest literary work was undertaken in connection with the Whig periodical, the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, where his review of Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Dryden&quot; attracted attention. His first major work, &quot;View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages&quot; (two volumes), was published in 1818, and was followed nine years later by &quot;The Constitutional History of England&quot; (1827, two volumes). &quot;Introduction to the Literature of Europe, in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries&quot; (four volumes) appeared in 1837. A volume of supplemental notes to his &quot;Middle Ages&quot; was published in 1843, and in 1852 &quot;Literary Essays and Characters: Selected from &quot;An Introduction to the Literature of Europe&quot;&quot; was published. These works represent nearly all of Hallam&#x27;s career.

Hallam was a fellow of the Royal Society, and a trustee of the British Museum. In 1830 he received the gold medal for history founded by George IV.

==Historical works==
Hallam described his work &quot;Middle Ages&quot; as a series of historical dissertations for the period from the 5th to the 15th century. The work consists of nine long chapters: the histories of France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and of the Greek and Saracenic empires, fill five chapters. Others deal with major institutional features of medieval society: the feudal system, the ecclesiastical system, and the political system of England. The last chapter sketches society, commerce, manners, and literature in the Middle Ages.

The &quot;Constitutional History of England&quot; (1827) took up the subject at the point at which it had been dropped in &quot;Middle Ages&quot;, namely the accession of Henry VII, and carried it down to the accession of George III. Hallam stopped here because he was unwilling to touch on issues of contemporary politics which seemed to him to run back through the whole period of the reign of George III, but this did not prevent him from being accused of bias. The &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; for 1828 contains a hostile article on the &quot;Constitutional History&quot;, written by Robert Southey, full of reproach: the work, he said, is the &quot;production of a decided partisan&quot;. It was his distant treatment of Charles I, Thomas Cranmer and William Laud that provoked the indignation of Southey.

Hallam, like Thomas Babington Macaulay, ultimately referred political questions to the standard of Whig constitutionalism. But he was conscientious with his materials, and it was this which made the &quot;Constitutional History&quot; one of the standard textbooks of English politics.

==Literary history works==
The 4-volume &quot;Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries&quot; (1837–1839) continues a topic broached in the &quot;View of the Middle Ages&quot;. In the first chapter Hallam sketches the state of literature in Europe down to the end of the 14th century: the extinction of ancient learning which followed the fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity; the preservation of the Latin language in the services of the church; and the revival of letters after the 7th century. For the first century and a half of his period he is mainly occupied with a review of classical learning, taking short decennial periods and noticing works which they produced. For the period 1520–1550 there are separate chapters on ancient literature, theology, science, speculative philosophy and jurisprudence, the literature of taste and other miscellaneous literature; and the subdivisions of subjects is carried further in later periods. Thus poetry, the drama and polite literature form the subjects of separate chapters. An author may be mentioned in many chapters: William Shakespeare, Hugo Grotius, Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes appear in half a dozen different places.

The plan excluded biographical history. It is an account of the books which would make a complete library of the period, arranged according to date of publication and subject.

==Death and memorials==
Hallam died in London on 21 January 1859, aged 81. He has a memorial in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, and there is a blue plaque at 67 Wimpole Street in London installed by the London County Council commemorating the fact that he once lived there.

==Family==
In 1807 Hallam married Julia Maria Elton (daughter of Sir Charles Elton). She died in 1847.

Hallam lost his children, one after another. His eldest son, the poet Arthur Henry Hallam—the &quot;A.H.H.&quot; of Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;—died in 1833 at the age of 22. In 1834 Hallam edited and published &quot;Remains, in Verse and Prose, of Arthur Henry Hallam&quot;. In 1850 his second son, Henry Fitzmaurice Hallam, also died.

<doc id="214731" wikidata="Q31780" url="?curid=214731" title="Sheol">
<text>Sheol ( ; &quot;Šəʾōl&quot;, Tiberian: &quot;Šŏʾōl&quot;) in the Hebrew Bible is the underworld place of stillness and darkness which lies after death. 

Within the Hebrew Bible, there are few—often brief and nondescript—mentions of Sheol, seemingly describing it as a place where both the righteous and the unrighteous dead go, regardless of their moral choices in life. The implications of Sheol within the texts are therefore somewhat unclear; it may be interpreted as either a generic metaphor describing &quot;the grave&quot; into which all humans invariably descend, or an actual state of afterlife within Israelite thought. Though such practices are forbidden, the inhabitants of Sheol can, under some circumstances, be summoned by the living, as when the Witch of Endor calls up the spirit of Samuel for King Saul.

While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the Second Temple period (roughly 500 BCE – 70 CE), a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment meant for the wicked dead alone. When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into Greek in ancient Alexandria (around 200 BCE), the word &quot;Hades&quot; (i.e., the Greek underworld) was substituted for Sheol owing to its similarities to the Underworld of Greek mythology. The gloss of Sheol as &quot;Hades&quot; is reflected in the New Testament, wherein Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the evil it represents.

==Hebrew Bible==
&quot;Sheol&quot; is mentioned 66 times throughout the Hebrew Bible. The first mentions of Sheol within the text associate it with the state of death and a sense of eternal finality. Jacob avows that he will &quot;go down to Sheol,&quot; still mourning the apparent death of his son Joseph. Later in the book of Genesis, the same formula is repeated when describing the sorrow that would befall Jacob should another of his sons, Benjamin, not return to him with his remaining brothers.

Sheol makes its next appearance during the episode of Korah in the book of Numbers. After Korah attempts to rouse the Israelites to rebel against Moses, Moses vows that Yahweh will prove his legitimacy by splitting open the earth to hurl Korah and his conspirators into Sheol. Sure enough, as he finishes his speech, Yahweh splits the earth open, causing Korah, his family, and all of his possessions to, as the text describes it, &quot;enter Sheol alive.&quot; In the book of Deuteronomy, Moses sings that the anger of Yahweh is a flame which burns in the &quot;depths&quot; of Sheol, consuming the entire earth from the bottom up.

Subsequent mentions of Sheol in the Tanakh depict it as a representation of death, suggesting that entry into Sheol is an unavoidable consequence of dying. 1 Samuel describes Yahweh as the one who brings souls down to Sheol, and 2 Samuel further cements Sheol as humanity&#x27;s ultimate postmortem destination. 1 Kings uses &quot;going down to Sheol&quot; as a metaphor for death, describing those who go down to it both &quot;in peace&quot; and &quot;in blood&quot;. 

The prophet Isaiah expounds on Sheol to great lengths during some of his sermons, personifying it as possessing an ever-increasing hunger for living people, with a great propensity for the souls of sinners, and where pleas to Yahweh cannot escape. Ezekiel, during his prophecy of Egypt&#x27;s downfall, describes Egypt metaphorically descending into Sheol as a dead person would, where all the spirits of the dead, as well as other fallen empires, such as Assyria, jeer and mock its fall from might.

The remaining mentions of Sheol lie in the poetic literature of the Hebrew Bible. Job mentions Sheol in several of his laments, calling it his &quot;home&quot; as he lies in anguish, and yearning for death to take him there to put an end to his suffering. Sheol is also mentioned in several Psalms—again, as the grave of humanity.

Other biblical names for Sheol were ( &#x27;ruin&#x27;), found in Psalm 88:11, Job 28:22 and Proverbs 15:11 and ( &#x27;corruption&#x27;), found in Isaiah 38:17 and Ezekiel 28:8.

==Interpretation==

Even within the realm of Jewish thought, the understanding of Sheol was often inconsistent. This would later manifest, in part, with the Sadducee–Pharisee ideological rift which, among other things, disagreed on whether relevancy should lie more prominently in the world of living or in the realm of an afterlife. The lack of a clear belief structure surrounding Sheol lends the idea to a number of interpretations: namely, one which imagines Sheol as a concrete state of afterlife, or one which envisions Sheol as a metaphor for death as a whole. To the latter&#x27;s end, certain editions of the Bible translate the term &quot;Sheol&quot; as generic terms such as &quot;grave&quot; or &quot;pit&quot; (KJV, NIV, etc.), while others (NAB, NASB, etc.) preserve it as a proper noun. Distinguishing Sheol between a realm and a metaphor is the crux of several unanswered questions surrounding its nature.

Perhaps owing to the evolution of its interpretation, certain elements of Sheol as described in the Hebrew Bible appear contradictory. Those in Sheol remember nothing, not even Yahweh, yet elsewhere its inhabitants possess an otherwise impossible perception of earthly events, even those which occur after their demise. Pleas to Yahweh cannot escape Sheol, and yet, Yahweh remains its unequivocal master. Those who descend into Sheol cannot escape it, yet Yahweh raises souls from it. Furthermore, despite the evidently abstract nature of Sheol, there is some physicality to it: it was clearly understood to be subterranean, which is further supported by its association with the term &quot;bōr&quot; (, &quot;pit&quot;), found in Isaiah 14:15, 24:22, and Ezekiel 26:20. It is a &quot;land&quot; (&quot;eretz&quot;), contains &quot;gates&quot;, is apparently compartmentalized, and there are numerous mentions of its &quot;deepest depths&quot; and &quot;farthest corners&quot;. The idea that both the righteous and unrighteous eventually descend to Sheol appears to be an unspoken assumption in the Hebrew Bible - thus Jacob and David have no reservation in acknowledging their eventual residency, even as the later prophets spoke of Sheol lying in wait for the wicked. 

The origins of the concept of Sheol are debated. The general characteristics of an afterlife such as Sheol were not unique to the ancient Israelites; the Babylonians had a similar underworld called Aralu, and the Greeks had one known as Hades. As such, it is assumed that the early Israelites apparently believed that the graves of family, or tribe, all united into one, collectively unified &quot;grave&quot;, and that this is what the Biblical Hebrew term Sheol refers to: the common grave of humans. Therefore, the family tomb is the central concept in understanding biblical views of the afterlife. It is &quot;not mere sentimental respect for the physical remains that is...the motivation for the practice, but rather an assumed connection between proper sepulture and the condition of happiness of the deceased in the afterlife&quot;.

Wojciech Kosior has argued that &quot;Sheol&quot; in the Hebrew Bible refers to an underworld deity. Some additional support for this hypothesis comes from the ancient Near Eastern literary materials. It has been proposed that Sheol is the Hebrew derivative of Shuwala (Akkadian: 𒋗𒉿𒆷 &quot;šu-wa-la&quot;), an underworld goddess of Hurrian origin, attested in Hattusa in Anatolia, Emar and Ugarit in Syria, and Ur in Mesopotamia, often alongside other underworld deities such as Allani or Ugur. According to Assyriologist Lluis Feliu, a connection between Sheol and Shuwala is &quot;possible, but not certain&quot;. Edward Lipiński regards this connection as proven. Some scholars argue that Sheol understood anthropomorphically fits the semantic complex of the other ancient Near Eastern death deities such as Nergal, Ereshkigal or Mot.

The Second Temple Period wrought several radical theological changes within the Israelite population, and marked the transition from Israelite religion to modern Judaism. The idea of Sheol underwent extensive modification and became widely diversified, with a newfound plethora of interpretations. With the codification of Rabbinical Judaism and the Talmud, Jewish theology concerning the afterlife had largely abandoned the concept of a single destination for all mankind after death and adopted the more recognizable model which espoused a place of reward for the righteous, and a place of punishment for the wicked called &quot;Gehinnom&quot;. Subsequently, &quot;Sheol&quot;, and the related terms &quot;Abaddon&quot;, &quot;Bor&quot;, &quot;Shakhat&quot;, etc., were reduced to synonyms for this realm of punishment.

==Mandaeism==
In Mandaeism, the World of Darkness (i.e., the underworld) is sometimes referred to as Sheol () in the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; and other Mandaean scriptures.

<doc id="214734" wikidata="Q1797029" url="?curid=214734" title="Brother Jonathan">
<text>Brother Jonathan is the personification of New England. He was also used as an emblem of the United States in general, and can be an allegory of capitalism. His too-short pants, too-tight waistcoat and old-fashioned style reflect his taste for inexpensive, second-hand products and efficient use of means.

Brother Jonathan soon became a stock fictional character, developed as a good-natured parody of all New England during the early American Republic. He was widely popularized by the weekly newspaper &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; and the humor magazine &quot;Yankee Notions&quot;.

Brother Jonathan was usually depicted in editorial cartoons and patriotic posters outside New England as a long-winded New Englander who dressed in striped trousers, somber black coat and stove-pipe hat. Inside New England, &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; was depicted as an enterprising and active businessman who blithely boasted of Yankee conquests for the Universal Yankee Nation.

After 1865, the garb of Brother Jonathan was emulated by Uncle Sam, a common personification of the continental government of the United States.

==History==
The term dates at least to the 17th century, when it was applied to Puritan roundheads during the English Civil War. It came to include residents of colonial New England, who were mostly Puritans in support of the Parliamentarians during the war. It probably is derived from the Biblical words spoken by David after the death of his friend Jonathan, &quot;I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan&quot; (2 Samuel 1:26). As Kenneth Hopper and William Hopper put it, &quot;Used as a term of abuse for their ... Puritan opponents by Royalists during the English Civil War, it was applied by British officers to the rebellious colonists during the American Revolution&quot;.

A popular folk tale about the origin of the term holds that the character is derived from Jonathan Trumbull (1710–1785), Governor of the State of Connecticut, which was the main source of supplies for the Northern and Middle Departments during the American Revolutionary War. It is said that George Washington uttered the words, &quot;We must consult Brother Jonathan,&quot; when asked how he could win the war. That origin is doubtful, however, as neither man made reference to the story during his lifetime and the first appearance of the story has been traced to the mid-19th century, long after their deaths.

The character was adopted by citizens of New England from 1783 to 1815, when Brother Jonathan became a nickname for any Yankee sailor, similar to the way that G.I. is used to describe members of the U.S. Army.

The term &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; is thought to date approximately to the War of 1812. &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; appeared in newspapers from 1813 to 1815, and in 1816 he appeared in a book.

In 1825 John Neal wrote the novel &quot;Brother Jonathan: or, the New Englanders&quot; and had it published in Edinburgh to expose British readers to US customs and language. The emblem had been developing for decades as a minor self-referential device in American literature, but saw full development in this novel into the personification of American national character. The weekly newspaper &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; was first published in 1842, issued out of New York. As editor in 1843, Neal used it to argue for Brother Jonathan to be the national emblem of the US. &quot;Yankee Notions, or Whittlings of Jonathan&#x27;s Jack-Knife&quot; was a high-quality humor magazine, first published in 1852, that used the stock character to lampoon Yankee acquisitiveness and other peculiarities. It, too, was issued out of New York, which was a rival with neighboring New England before the Civil War. It was a popular periodical with a large circulation, and people both inside and outside New England enjoyed it as good-natured entertainment. Such jokes were often copied in newspapers as far away as California, where natives encountered Yankee ships and peddlers, inspiring Yankee impersonations in comedy burlesques.

Jules Verne included in his 1864 novel &quot;The Adventures of Captain Hatteras&quot; () a chapter entitled &quot;John Bull and Jonathan&quot;, in which British and American members of a polar expedition confront each other, each seeking to claim the newly-discovered island of New America. The land is named by Captain Altamont, an American explorer, who is first to set foot on it. A deleted chapter, &quot;John Bull and Jonathan&quot;, had Hatteras and Altamont dueling for the privilege of claiming the land for their respective countries.

Around the same time, the New England–based Know Nothing Party, which &quot;Yankee Notions&quot; also lampooned, was divided into two camps—the moderate Jonathans and the radical Sams. Eventually, Uncle Sam came to replace Brother Jonathan, and the victors applied &quot;Yankee&quot; to all of the country by the end of the century, after the &quot;Yankee&quot; section had won the American Civil War. Likewise, &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; was applied to the Federal government. Uncle Sam came to represent the United States as a whole over the course of the late 19th century, supplanting Brother Jonathan.

According to an article in the 1893 &quot;The Lutheran Witness&quot;, Brother Jonathan and Uncle Sam were different names for the same person:

&quot;When we meet him in politics we call him Uncle Sam; when we meet him in society we call him Brother Jonathan. Here of late Uncle Sam &quot;alias&quot; Brother Jonathan has been doing a powerful lot of complaining, hardly doing anything else.&quot;

==Legacy==
The phrase &quot;We must consult Brother Jonathan&quot; appears on the graduation certificates of Yale University&#x27;s Trumbull College, also named for Trumbull.

Some members of the Jonathan Club, a private social club headquartered in downtown Los Angeles, believe their club was named after Jonathan Trumbull or &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;. However, the club was formed in 1895, and the true inspiration for its name is lost to history.

Between 1891 and 1901, US socialist Daniel De Leon wrote more than 300 editorials as dialogues between &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; (a class-conscious worker who espoused the doctrines of the SLP) and &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; (a worker lacking in class-consciousness).

<text>Adult education, distinct from child education, is a practice in which adults engage in systematic and sustained educating activities in order to gain new knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values. It can mean any form of learning adults engage in beyond traditional schooling, encompassing basic literacy to personal fulfillment as a lifelong learner, and to ensure the fulfillment of an individual.

In particular, adult education reflects a specific philosophy about learning and teaching based on the assumption that adults can and want to learn, that they are able and willing to take responsibility for the learning, and that the learning itself should respond to their needs.

Driven by what one needs or wants to learn, the available opportunities, and the manner in which one learns, adult learning is affected by demographics, globalization and technology.

The learning happens in many ways and in many contexts just as all adults&#x27; lives differ.
Adult learning can be in any of the three contexts:

* Formal – Structured learning that typically takes place in an education or training institution, usually with a set curriculum and carries credentials;
* Non-formal – Learning that is organized by educational institutions but non credential. Non-formal learning opportunities may be provided in the workplace and through the activities of civil society organizations and groups;
* Informal education – Learning that goes on all the time, resulting from daily life activities related to work, family, community or leisure (e.g. community baking class).

The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on &quot;The Changing Nature of Work&quot; argues that adult learning is an important channel to help readjust workers&#x27; skills to fit in the future of work and suggests ways to improve its effectiveness.

==Characteristics==
In a study, Greenberg compared the orthographic and phonological skills of functionally illiterate adults and children. The study found that although functionally illiterate adults performed similarly in reading tasks, children were more successful in vocabulary and spelling tests. This means that functional illiterate adults are at a similar level of education as children, yet they differ in strengths of different skills.

The difficulty in many countries is that education systems cater to children, the problem with this being that the adult brain works and learns in a very different manner to a child&#x27;s developing brain. Teaching a 6-year-old how to write is a very different process to teaching a 30-year-old with similar writing skills. Several things must be taken into consideration when teaching adults as opposed to children. Although functionally illiterate adults have similar literacy functionality to developing children, they differ greatly in how they retain information. Adult learners have much more independence in performing tasks, a longer attention span, and more discipline. Adult learners are also educating themselves out of choice, as opposed to children who are forced to attend school. Finally, adults are likely to have increased anxiety in a classroom, because with ageing they &quot;are more likely to experience this fear of failure, which can heighten [their] anxiety, especially if [their] experience of education in the past was not always positive.&quot; These all contribute to a difference in the way adults need to be taught.

There are ways that adults are able to gain confidence in a classroom. Taming anxiety in a classroom comes down to two things: comfort and support. Comfort can be found by fulfilling Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs highlights the importance of getting enough rest, eating healthy, and having a stable life. These criteria are the same for children, yet finding stability for adults can be more difficult. In many cases, adult learners have a job or have to support themselves, which adds increased pressure in addition to education. Support is also necessary in the success of adult learning. This means having a work or classroom environment that makes one feel comfortable. Feeling comfortable means feeling as though one has emotional support in the classroom, and having a space where asking for guidance is encouraged rather than shamed.

Educating adults differs from educating children in several ways given that adults have accumulated knowledge and work experience which can add to the learning experience. Most adult education is voluntary, therefore, the participants are generally self-motivated, unless required to participate by an employer. The practice of adult education is referred to as andragogy to distinguish it from the traditional school-based education for children – pedagogy. Unlike children, adults are seen as more self-directed rather than relying on others for help.

Adults are mature and therefore have knowledge and have gained life experiences which provide them a foundation of learning. An adult&#x27;s readiness to learn is linked to their need to have the information. Their orientation to learn is problem-centered rather than subject-centered. Their motivation to learn is internal.

Adults frequently apply their knowledge in a practical fashion to learn effectively. They must have a reasonable expectation that the knowledge they gain will help them further their goals. For example, during the 1990s, many adults, including mostly office workers, enrolled in computer training courses. These courses would teach basic use of the operating system or specific application software. Because the abstractions governing the user&#x27;s interactions with a PC were so new, many people who had been working white-collar jobs for ten years or more eventually took such training courses, either at their own whim (to gain computer skills and thus earn higher pay) or at the behest of their managers.

The purpose of adult education in the form of college or university is distinct. In these institutions, the aim is typically related to personal growth and development as well as occupation and career preparedness. Adult education that focuses specifically on the workplace is often referred to as human resource development. Another goal might be to not only sustain the democratic society, but to even challenge and improve its social structure.

A common problem in adult education in the US is the lack of professional development opportunities for adult educators. Most adult educators come from other professions and are not well trained to deal with adult learning issues. Most of the positions available in this field are only part-time without any benefits or stability since they are usually funded by government grants that might last for only a couple of years.

However, in some countries, which contain the advanced systems of adult education, professional development is available through post-secondary institutions and provide professional development through their ministry of education or school boards and through nongovernmental organizations. In addition, there are programs about adult education for existing and aspiring practitioners offered, at various academic levels, by universities, colleges, and professional organizations.

Adult educators have long maintained commitments to racial justice and other forms of social justice struggle. which included extensive work at Freedom Schools during the Civil Rights Movement. Contemporary commitments to racial justice in adult education include initiatives in the workplace. and beyond

==Objectives==
The primary purpose of adult education is to provide a second chance for those who are poor in society or who have lost access to education for other reasons in order to achieve social justice and equal access to education. Therefore, adult education is often a social policy of the government. Continuing education can help adults maintain certifications, fulfill job requirements and stay up to date on new developments in their field. Also, the purpose of adult education can be vocational, social, recreational or for self-development. One of its goals may be to help adult learners satisfy their personal needs and achieve their professional goals. With the development of economy and the progress of society, the requirement of human quality has been raised. In the 1960s, the proposition of &quot;lifelong education&quot; was put forward, which led to the change of contemporary educational concepts. Therefore, its ultimate goal might be to achieve human fulfillment. The goal might also be to achieve an institution&#x27;s needs. For example, this might include improving its operational effectiveness and productivity. A larger scale goal of adult education may be the growth of society by enabling its citizens to keep up with societal change and maintain good social order.

One fast-growing sector of adult education is English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), also referred to as English as a second language (ESL) or English language learners (ELL). These courses are key in assisting immigrants with not only the acquisition of the English language, but the acclimation process to the culture of the United States as well as other English speaking countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

==Theories==
===Eduard C. Lindeman&#x27;s theories===
Eduard C. Lindeman was the first expert who gave a systematic account of adult education. In his theory of education, education is regarded as a lifelong process. He pointed out that due to the constant development and change of social life and the surrounding environment, knowledge, and information are in a cycle of constant transmission, supplement and update, which requires people to keep learning to adapt to the changes in the outside world. At the same time, he believes that adult learners should not only learn for the needs of work and survival, but also have the opportunity to enrich themselves. He insists that adult education is an inspiring life-changing tool. Adult education should not only help people improve their skills and abilities in work, but also guide people to find happiness outside work.

Otherwise, Lindeman also proposed that the most valuable resource for adult learners is the learner&#x27;s experience. He believes that the purpose of adult education is to give meaning to all kinds of experience. Experience can enhance learners&#x27; autonomous learning and cognitive ability.

In addition, Lindeman believes that adult education is an important means of improving society. The basic function of adult education is to promote the physical and mental development of adult learners. He argues that adult education is a powerful tool for social activists. Through adult education, the personal code of conduct and cultural knowledge of adult learners should be improved to gradually improve the social atmosphere and order.

=== Andragogy ===
The principles of andragogy flow directly from an understanding of the characteristics of adults as learners and can be recognized when we understand the characteristics of adults, and see the way those characteristics influence how adults learn best. Teachers who follow the principles of andragogy when choosing materials for training and when designing program delivery, find that their learners progress more quickly, and are more successful in reaching their goals.

Malcolm Knowles introduced andragogy as the central theory of adult learning in the 1970s, defining andragogy as “the art and science of helping adults learn. Knowles&#x27;s andragogy theory helps adults use their experiences to create new learning from previous understandings. Knowles believes that preparation for learning is related to the relevance of learning to adult life, and that they bring an ever-expanding experience that can serve as a learning resource.

Andragogy proposes the following six main assumptions about adults learners:

# As people mature, their self-concept moves from dependence toward self-direction;
# Adults have accumulated rich experiences through family responsibilities, work-related activities, and prior education;
# Adults&#x27; readiness to learn is closely connected to the developmental tasks of his or her social role;
# Adult learners prefer immediate application of knowledge;
# Adults&#x27; motivation to learn derive from internal drives rather than external ones;
# Adults need to know why they need to learn something.

Knowles suggests these characteristics should be taken into consideration when designing programs for adults and facilitating adult learning processes. He also proposed a model of self-directed learning. In Knowles&#x27;s view, self-directed learning is a process in which individuals actively diagnose their learning needs, propose learning goals, select and implement appropriate learning strategies, and evaluate learning results. This learning model centers learners as taking an active role in their learning.

==Challenges and motivating factors==
Functional illiteracy is the inability to use reading, writing, and calculation abilities to contribute to the development of one&#x27;s own personal growth and societal growth. This has become more and more common in adults, and although functional illiterates can still contribute to society, it limits their social and economic status. In contrast to being illiterate, where a person is unable to read and write, functional illiteracy is when a person who has these skills is unable to use them in everyday life. For example, a functional illiterate person may be able to read and write a basic sentence, but tasks such as filling out a job application, reading a doctor prescription or filling out basic everyday calculations becomes difficult. Studies have shown that these limitations affect language and cognitive skills.

Adults have many responsibilities that they must balance against the demands of learning. Because of these responsibilities, adults have barriers and challenges against participating in learning and continuing their education. The barriers can be classified into three groups including institutional, situational, and dispositional.

Some situational barriers include the lack of time balancing career and family demands, the higher cost of education, and transportation. Dispositional barriers include lack of confidence, embarrassment, and a fear of failure. Institutional barriers include challenges that the college provides in relation to admission, admission requirements, and financial aid requirements from the education facility. Other institutional barriers include the lack of evening and weekend hours from administrative offices such as financial aid, bursar, or academic advising. The lack of evening and weekend hours impedes these students from receiving the necessary information for their retention and academic success. Distance and/or online learning can also address some problems with adult education that cause these barriers.

Meanwhile, research illustrates that understanding the motivations and barriers of adult learners can increase their enrollment and retention. Additional research shows that adult learners are more motivated in the classroom when they can clearly identify the application of their education to their professional or personal experiences. When instructors recognize their students&#x27; characteristics, they can develop lessons that address both the strengths and the needs of each student. Adults that are motivated, have confidence, and positive self-esteem are more likely to develop into lifelong learners.

In fast-developing countries, the qualifications of adults fall far behind those of young people, and may no longer match the requirements of a developed economy. This implies strong potential demand for the education and training of adults. This demand needs to be met through flexible modes of study which are suitable for adults, avenues of access that recognize informal prior learning, and the supports necessary for adults with limited formal education to succeed in further study.

=== Characteristics of non-participating adults in education ===
Previous research findings suggest that as adults get older, they are less likely to participate in AE (adult education). The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), nationally representative samples of adults aged 16–65 in 23 OECD countries, has found that older age groups had lower participation rates than younger age groups. Particularly, adults aged 16 to 25 were on average about three times more likely to participate than older adults aged 56 to 65.

Eurobarometer survey, national representative samples of adult aged 15 to 65 of European Union countries, also revealed that adults in the three youngest age groups examined (ages 15–24, ages 25–39, and ages 40–54) were more likely to participate in AE than age group of 55+. Moreover, the Eurobarometer survey shows that participation rate declined from younger to older adults. Participation rate of European countries was 59% for adults aged 15–24. The rate began to decline 38% for adults aged 25–39 and it also fell down to 31% for adults aged 40–54. Participation rate was 17% for adults above 55. Reason of why older adults&#x27; participation declined relates mainly to lack of promotion and support. When people get old, their chances to take promotion for any AE programs are reduced.

In many OECD and European countries, employers often support their workers to attend in AE programs since they consider that workers with higher-educated and skilled are crucial indicators of development for companies. Therefore, older adults cannot get promotions from their employers because of the gradual loss of seniority, learning ability and performance. Since older adults are rarely offered a promotion from their employers, and the cost would be an obstacle for participation, they are unable to take the courses even if they wanted to take part in programmes. Moreover, lack of motivation and unavailability of learning opportunities could be additional reasons of older adults&#x27; low-participation).

Findings of previous research are quite mixed when participation in AE comes to gender. According to the IALS, there is no a statistically significant difference between men and women in AE. However, the average participation rate of men was a bit higher than women. It was 38.7% for men and 37.9% for women. The Eurobarometer survey shows a similar result to the IALS data. Specifically the average participation of males was 35%; while, it was 30% for females. Women&#x27;s low participation is mainly resulted from family burdens and lack of financial support. However, an opposite tendency can be observed in the US. A study based on National Household Education Survey [NCES] in 2001 revealed that although gender difference did not exist much, females were more likely to participate in AE than males in the US. The participation rate was 49% for women and 43% for men.

Educational attainment is determined as the most important factor in predicting participation in AE. It is known that those with higher levels of educational attainment participate more in AE programs.

The IALS showed that there was a clear relationship between previous educational attainment and participation in AE. The data found those with low educational background were less likely to participate in OECD countries. Specifically, the participation rate was 57.6% for adults who completed college or university education; while, it was 15.5% for adults who did not complete high school.

The Eurobarometer survey also showed that 87% of low-educated people belonged to the non-participant group. Reason of low or non-participation of the less-educated can be explained from perspectives of individual and employers. Individual point illustrated that low self-confidence regarding the learning, which mainly derived from previous bad educational experiences, could be a major obstacle for the less-educated. Apart from low self-confidence, those less-educated might not perceive their need of participation or might actually not have a need to participate. Yet, employers&#x27; view was apparent that they tended to support high-educated because they were more trainable than the low-educated. Therefore, the participation of the less-educated was low since they could not get promotions from their employers.

Finally, adults who come from a better socio-economic background tend to participate more in AE programs. The OECD data showed that higher the parent&#x27; educational level could produce the higher participation rate. 
Summarizing above findings, people, those are young and men, with high levels of education, high-status of jobs are more likely to take part in any form of education and training. On the contrary, typical non-participants tend to be women, older, less educated, and coming from poor socio-economic backgrounds. In addition, less-skilled, unemployed, immigrants, language minorities, and rural residents are less likely to participate in AE programmes.

=== Deterring factors for participation in education ===
Deterrents are characteristics that explain why adults respond in negative manners to participate in education and learning. 
Deterrents faced by adults are multifaceted, including both external and internal factors. However, cost and time have been remained as the most frequently reported deterrents. Large sampled (nationwide and international) surveys on barriers to participation such as a study of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the US, IALS and Eurobarometer indicated that time and cost were the main deterrents for adults. Moreover, some empirical studies discovered time and cost as the most cited deterrents through studying various groups of adults. Cost includes tuition fee of a programme as well as extra expenditures for learning such as clothes, food, transportation and other school necessities (textbooks and stationaries). It is well known that adults less educated, low-skilled and unemployed are less likely to participate in education/learning. For the unemployed, it is obvious that cost can hinder their participation in education. And those lacking education and skills must be paid low salaries. In this way, cost could be the most influential deterrent. Even employed adults seem not wanting to invest money for a course, but they could attend if their employers supported them financially. For the time barrier, most adults involved in the above-mentioned studies reported that they could not participate in educational activities due to lack of time. Adults tended to say that they were busy with their daily routines. Apart from cost and time deterrents, family and job commitments are other most commonly cited deterrents. The large sampled surveys and empirical studies as mentioned earlier revealed that adults tended to report family and job responsibilities as deterrents and rated right after the cost and time deterrents. However, Milana suggested that busy workload and family responsibilities can be associated with the time barrier, otherwise time barrier itself is a vague concept. Adults feel they do not have time to learn because they are busy at work and home. Thus, the time barrier should be considered in line with family and job commitments. 
After above-mentioned deterrents, another mostly reported deterrent is irrelevant and inadequate supplies of trainings/activities. In other words, AE programs and courses do not always suit the needs of adult learners. It, therefore, is also important for educational planners to recognize that AE opportunities available may not always suit the learner&#x27;s need.

Deterrents related to an individual&#x27;s internal issues tend to be reported in lowest rate. For example, the IALS showed that the least deterrent was lack of self-confidence. Also, the Eurobarometer survey indicated that adults’ perception of being too old to learn was the least significant deterrent.

Moreover, perceived deterrents are differentiated into social groups. Johnstone and Rivera found that older adults faced more dispositional barriers such as low self-confidence and too late for being learners. Also, younger adults and women were more experienced with situational barriers such as cost and child care arrangements. Among the less educated, one&#x27;s low-confidence regarding the learning ability could be the main deterrent.

==Benefits==
Adult education can have many benefits ranging from better health and personal well-being to greater social inclusion. It can also support the function of democratic systems and provide greater opportunities for finding new or better employment. Adult education has been shown to have a positive impact on the economy.

Adult education provides opportunities for personal growth, goal fulfillment &amp; socialization. Chris McAllister&#x27;s research of semi-structured interviews with older adult learners shows a motivation to communicate with people and to get out of the house to keep mentally active. Researchers have documented the social aspects of older adult education.

Friendship was described as an important aspect of adult learning. The classroom is seen as a part of their social network. In recent studies, the friendships that are made between adults seem to have an increasing effect on their social structure as a whole.

The development of social networks and support was found to be a key motivation of adult learners. As editor of a book entitled Adult Education and Health, Leona English claims that including health education as part of adult education makes for a healthier community.

When surveying adult education programs in Japan, Nojima found that classes focusing on hobbies and very specific recreational activities were by far the most popular. The author noted that more time, money and resources needed to be in place so participants would be able to take advantage of these types of activities. Withnall explored the influences on later life learning in various parts in the U.K. Results were similar in that later in life education afforded these older adults opportunities to socialize.
Some experts claim that adult education has a long-term impact on the economy and that there is a correlation between innovation and learning at the workplace.

Recently, adult education has gained recognition and importance in broader educational policies which emphasise inclusive and equitable education for all. However, there has been a shift towards a narrow focus on vocational skills, undermining the transformative potential of adult education. Looking to the future, adult learning needs to extend beyond labor market needs, connecting career change and reskilling to broader educational reforms. Lifelong learning should be reconceptualized as transformative and responsive to societal changes. It is crucial to address the participation and inclusion of vulnerable groups, appreciate informal learning, embrace digital means of participation, and promote scientific literacy while combating misinformation. Adult education plays a vital role in enhancing competencies, fostering responsibility, understanding changing paradigms, and shaping a just and sustainable world, emphasizing intergenerational solidarity.

== Monitoring ==
=== Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) ===
Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education (GRALE) are a series of reports that monitor progress on Adult Learning and Education (ALE), promote action, identify trends in the field of ALE, and explore solutions to challenges. GRALE play a key role in meeting UNESCO&#x27;s commitment to monitor and report on countries&#x27; implementation of the Belém Framework for Action. This Framework was adopted by 144 UNESCO Member States at the Sixth International Conference on Adult Learning and Education (CONFINTEA VI), which was held in Belém, Brazil, in 2009. In the Belém Framework for Action, countries agreed to improve ALE across five areas of action: policy; governance; financing; participation, inclusion and equity; and quality.

=== Adult and youth literacy rate ===
According to the most recent estimates, the global youth literacy rate is 91%, meaning 102 million youth lack basic literacy skills. In low-income countries, one in three young people still cannot read.

The adult literacy rate is 86%, which means 750 million adults lack basic literacy skills. There are 92 literate women for every 100 literate men globally, and in low-income countries, as few as 77 literate women for every 100 literate men. The literacy rate is expected to continue to grow steadily in countries in all income groups.

At the global level, the youth literacy rate is expected to reach 94% by 2030 and the adult literacy rate 90%. In low-income countries, less than 70% of adults and slightly more than 80% of youth aged 15 to 24 years are projected to have basic literacy skills by 2030.

<text>Cissa is a genus of relatively short-tailed magpies, sometimes known as hunting cissas, that reside in the forests of tropical and subtropical southeast Asia and adjacent regions. The four species are quite similar with bright red bills, primarily green plumage, black mask, and rufous wings. 

Due to a low-carotenoid diet they often appear blue or turquoise in captivity; the structural color of their feathers.

They are carnivorous, and mainly feed on arthropods and small vertebrates.

The genus was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826 with the common green magpie (&quot;Cissa chinensis&quot;) as the type species. The name &quot;Cissa&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;kissa&quot; meaning a &quot;jay&quot; or &quot;magpie&quot;.
==Species==
The genus &quot; Cissa&quot; contains four species:

<doc id="214745" wikidata="Q2170848" url="?curid=214745" title="Roy Henderson (baritone)">
<text>Roy Galbraith Henderson CBE (4 July 1899 – 16 March 2000) was a British baritone singer, conductor and teacher.

Born in Edinburgh and raised in Nottingham, Henderson began singing in public during the First World War, entertaining his army colleagues. After the war he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London, where he won numerous prizes. Professionally he came to public notice in 1925 deputising at short notice in the difficult and important baritone part in Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; at a London concert. He maintained a successful concert career for the next 27 years, taking part in the premieres of many works by British composers. 

Henderson appeared in opera in two seasons at Covent Garden in 1928 and 1929, and was a founding member of the company of the Glyndebourne Festival, singing there in every season from 1935 to 1939. He was also well known as a recitalist, performing classic and new songs. He made many recordings, mainly for the Decca company, although he is particularly remembered for HMV&#x27;s recordings from Glyndebourne and a 1938 Columbia recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; in which Henderson and fifteen other leading British singers took part. In addition to singing he was a conductor, mostly of choral music, and made some recordings in that capacity.

From the start of his career Henderson aimed to be a teacher of singing. He took pupils from the late 1920s onwards, and was a professor at the RAM from 1940. In 1953 he retired from public performance and devoted himself to full-time teaching. Among his many pupils the best-known was Kathleen Ferrier, and others included Jennifer Vyvyan (soprano), Constance Shacklock (mezzo-soprano), Norma Procter (contralto), Thomas Round (tenor) and John Shirley-Quirk and Derek Hammond-Stroud (baritones).

==Early years==
Henderson was born in Edinburgh, the third child and elder son of the Rev Alexander Roy Henderson and his wife, Jean Boyd, &quot;née&quot; Galbraith. Alexander Henderson was minister of the Augustine Congregational Church between 1895 and 1902, when he moved to England to take charge of Castle Gate Congregational Church, Nottingham. Henderson attended Nottingham High School, where he received a classical education and became captain of the cricket team. 

During the First World War Henderson served in the Artists Rifles, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire regiment. In his hut were two well-known baritones, Percy Heming and Charles Mott, the latter being particularly helpful to him. Henderson joined an army concert party entertaining the troops, and he began learning the knack of what he called &quot;putting it over&quot; to an audience. According to his colleague Keith Falkner, it was then that Henderson learned to sing in public, &quot;practising what was to become a flexible and immaculate voice during late-night sentry duty&quot;. Before he returned to civilian life he auditioned for a well-known bass-baritone, Robert Radford, who recommended a career as a singer: &quot;He told me the raw material was there, and the rest depended on myself&quot;.
After the war Henderson gained a government grant of £150 a year to study at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). There he won thirteen awards, including the Betjemann gold medal for singing, the Worshipful Company of Musicians&#x27; medal, and the medal for the most distinguished student of the year. In addition, he led the RAM&#x27;s cricket team against the Royal College of Music, captained by Falkner, who later described his opposite number as &quot;a passionate sportsman, playing cricket (a crafty spin-bowler) and football (a tenacious goalkeeper)&quot;. While still a student Henderson made his first broadcast in August 1922, for the Marconi Company, shortly before the establishment of the BBC. 

Senior students could be appointed sub-professors − assistants to faculty members − and while serving in that capacity Henderson decided in 1923 that when he reached the age of fifty he would retire from singing and devote himself to teaching. Before the end of the 1920s he was giving private lessons in &quot;voice production and the interpretation of song&quot; alongside his singing career. 

On 27 March 1926 Henderson married Bertha Collin Smyth (1901–1985), a fellow student from the RAM. They had a son and two daughters.

==Singing career==

===Concerts===
In April 1925 Henderson came to public notice by stepping in at short notice to sing the baritone part in Delius&#x27;s &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society when the intended soloist, Percy Heming, withdrew. A London newspaper reported the next day:

Singing from memory was Henderson&#x27;s lifelong preference. He found it inhibiting to have to look at a score while singing. After his 1925 success in &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; he sang in all further British performances of the work − thirteen in all − between then and 1946. Six were conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, whom Henderson admired, although finding himself instinctively more in rapport with Sir Hamilton Harty: &quot;I felt with Harty that there was a sort of joint effort − whatever I did he responded to, and whatever he did I responded to&quot;. After a performance of the &quot;Mass of Life&quot; with Harty in 1932 Delius wrote to Henderson saying that it had been the best performance he had heard. The composer sent him a signed photograph inscribed &quot;To the unequalled interpreter of Zarathustra&quot;. He asked for Henderson as soloist in his &quot;Sea Drift&quot;, and in 1933 Henderson sang in the premiere of Delius&#x27;s &quot;Idyll&quot; at a promenade concert under Sir Henry Wood. With Beecham, Henderson performed Delius&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Sunset&quot; and &quot;An Arabesque&quot; at the 1934 Leeds Festival.

Other works by British composers in which Henderson was soloist at the first performance include Bliss&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for Orchestra and Voice&quot;, under Malcolm Sargent (1929), Dyson&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Pilgrims&quot; under the composer (1931), Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Five Tudor Portraits&quot; (1935) and &quot;Dona nobis pacem&quot; (1936), both conducted by the composer, and E. J. Moeran&#x27;s &quot;Nocturne&quot; (1935). He was one of the sixteen soloists chosen for the &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; (1938), which Vaughan Williams composed as a tribute to Wood for the latter&#x27;s golden jubilee as a conductor. The composer wrote the music with each soloist&#x27;s voice in mind, and like the other singers, Henderson is commemorated in the published score which prints each soloist&#x27;s initials alongside his or her lines, in Henderson&#x27;s case &quot;Nor is not mov&#x27;d with concord of sweet sounds&quot;.

Henderson&#x27;s concert repertory was wide and varied. He was closely associated with the choral works of Elgar, and sang under the composer&#x27;s baton in &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; in 1933. Henderson was greatly admired in Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Apostles&quot;, In &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Alan Blyth quotes a review from &quot;The Times&quot;:
 &quot;The Times&quot; called Henderson&#x27;s performance of Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; &quot;unforgettable in its dramatic eloquence&quot; and praised the nobility of his Jesus in Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;.

===Opera===
Henderson&#x27;s professional operatic career began in 1928. He had played Ford in &quot;Falstaff&quot; in RAM student productions at the Scala Theatre in 1925 and 1926, receiving strong praise, and he made a well-received record for Vocalion of a scene from the opera, singing the parts of both Ford and Falstaff. His professional debut in opera was in the 1928 international season at Covent Garden. He sang Donner in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and Kothner in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. In the following Covent Garden season he appeared again in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and sang the Herald in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, conducted respectively by Bruno Walter and Robert Heger. Also in 1929, conducted by John Barbirolli, he played Ford in &quot;Falstaff&quot; for the British National Opera Company, opposite his RAM Falstaff, Arthur Fear.
After 1929 Henderson made no further appearances at Covent Garden. In 1931 he was the baritone soloist in a concert performance of Manuel de Falla&#x27;s opera &quot;Master Peter&#x27;s Puppet Show&quot;, conducted by the composer. He became closely associated with the Glyndebourne Festival. In 1934 he sang Count Almaviva in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; on the opening night of the festival&#x27;s inaugural season and at twelve further performances in 1934 and 1935. Thereafter he appeared at Glyndebourne every year until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. His other roles there were Papageno in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (16 performances, 1936−1937), Guglielmo in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (19 performances, 1936−1939) and Masetto in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (36 performances, 1936−1939). Of these, his favourite roles were Papageno and Guglielmo: &quot;not the Count which I didn&#x27;t enjoy particularly. It&#x27;s an angry, jealous part and I&#x27;m much more inclined to comedy&quot;. The conductor was Fritz Busch, who was, along with Harty, the conductor Henderson most liked working with. In 1940 the Glyndebourne company went on tour with a production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; in which Henderson played Peachum and was scheduled to take over from Michael Redgrave as Macheath, but the fall of France and evacuation from Dunkirk forced the cancellation of the tour.

===Song recitals===
Throughout his singing career Henderson gave song recitals. While still a student he sang in his home town, Nottingham, as early as 1920 (in &quot;a variety of songs more or less modern&quot;). The accompanist Gerald Moore wrote that Henderson&#x27;s &quot;quiet unobtrusive manner concealed a probing mind and an imagination that made every song he sang vital&quot;:
Moore added, &quot;Our enjoyable work together apart, I know of no colleague with a livelier humour and keener sense of fun&quot;. The music critic Alan Blyth wrote of Henderson, &quot;Though his voice was not intrinsically very beautiful, he used it with intelligence and charm&quot;.

==Conductor and teacher==

Alongside his career as a singer Henderson developed what &quot;The Times&quot; described as &quot;a sideline as a talented and highly respected choral conductor&quot; He was conductor of the Huddersfield Glee and Madrigal Society from 1932 to 1939, and trained the Nottingham Harmonic Society, which during the inter-war years was a particularly well known choir. In 1936 he founded the Nottingham Oriana Choir and directed it until 1952. From 1942 to 1953 he conducted the Bournemouth Municipal Choir.

Henderson retired from public performance in March 1952 to concentrate on teaching, as he had long planned. By then he had been a professor at the RAM for twelve years and continued in that capacity until 1974. After retiring from the academy he continued to teach privately for many years. His pupils at the RAM and elsewhere included the sopranos Jennifer Vyvyan, Rae Woodland, Pauline Tinsley and Marie Hayward, the mezzo-sopranos Constance Shacklock and Gillian Knight, the contraltos Kathleen Ferrier and Norma Procter, the tenor Thomas Round, the baritones John Shirley-Quirk and Derek Hammond-Stroud, and the bass Hervey Alan. After Ferrier&#x27;s early death, Henderson contributed a chapter on being her teacher and friend in a memorial volume edited by Neville Cardus in 1954.

==Recordings==
Henderson began making records in the days of acoustic recording, and in his old age it pleased him to be, as he put it, &quot;one of the last people alive to have sung into a horn&quot;. Some of his early recordings were included in a 1999 CD set released to mark his centenary.

===Decca===
Henderson had a long association with the Decca record company from its early days in 1929. As a singer he made these Decca recordings:

As a conductor Henderson made three sets for Decca:

===Other recordings===
Henderson made studio recordings for EMI and other labels; these and recordings of him singing in live concerts and broadcasts have been issued, including:

==Last years==
Until his final years Henderson continued to teach, at his house in Belsize Park, London. He contributed reminiscences and comment to many BBC radio programmes in his retirement, including one in 1989 in which he and the two other surviving soloists discussed the origins and premiere of the &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; half a century earlier, and another in 1991 in which he and Falkner were in conversation with Richard Baker about their long careers. To celebrate his hundredth birthday a compilation of his recordings was issued on compact disc, the earliest of them dating back to 1925.

Henderson died at the Musicians&#x27; Benevolent Fund nursing home, Ivor Newton House, Bromley, south-east London, on 16 March 2000, aged 100. He was survived by his son and one daughter; his wife and a daughter predeceased him.

<doc id="214753" wikidata="Q216477" url="?curid=214753" title="Chief Seattle">
<text>Seattle ( – June 7, 1866; , ; usually styled as Chief Seattle) was a leader of the Duwamish and Suquamish peoples. A leading figure among his people, he pursued a path of accommodation to white settlers, forming a personal relationship with Doc Maynard. The city of Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington, was named after him. A widely publicized speech arguing in favor of ecological responsibility and respect for Native Americans&#x27; land rights had been attributed to him.

== Name ==
The name Seattle is an anglicization of his name in his native Lushootseed language, . According to Upper Skagit elder Vi Hilbert, his name was traditionally pronounced . After his baptism in 1852, he gained the baptismal name of Noah Seattle.

In English, his name is often also spelled Si&#x27;ahl, Sealth, Seathl or See-ahth as an attempt to be more accurate to the Lushootseed pronunciation. There is no &quot;th&quot; sound in the Lushootseed language.

==Life==

=== Youth ===
Seattle was born between 1780 and 1786 to Schweabe, a Suquamish leader from , the main Suquamish village on Agate Pass, and Sholeetsa, a Duwamish woman. By some accounts, his mother was born into slavery, while in others, she was a high-born noblewoman. His exact birthplace is also disputed. According to some historians, as well as the tradition of the Suquamish Tribe, Seattle was born on Blake Island (), and his mother was from the village of on the White River. Seattle himself said he was born on Blake Island. According to the Duwamish Tribe, Seattle was born at his mother&#x27;s village on the Black River, near what is now the city of Kent, Washington. According to one of his contemporaries, an American settler named Emily Inez Denny, he was born at the Old Man House at . 

Seattle grew up speaking both the Duwamish and Suquamish dialects of Southern Lushootseed. Seattle&#x27;s Suquamish family was a powerful one, and they dominated parts of Kitsap Peninsula, Vashon Island, Bainbridge Island, and Blake Island. Because power and authority in Coast Salish culture are traditionally not guaranteed through descent, Seattle had to prove his worth to his Coast Salishan society. 

In 1792, when Seattle was around six years old, he met &quot;HMS Discovery&quot; and &quot;HMS Chatham&quot; under the command of George Vancouver, who had anchored off Restoration Point on Bainbridge Island. Seattle and his family, who were occupying nearby Blake Island gathering food, were visited by a party from the Vancouver expedition. Seattle&#x27;s father, Schweabe, and uncle, Kitsap, may have been the two &quot;chiefs&quot; that Vancouver invited onto his ship. Over several days, Vancouver and the Suquamish (who were soon joined by their Duwamish neighbors) interacted extensively, trading goods and observing each other. Seattle often talked about this experience later in his life. Seattle would also later visit Fort Nisqually to trade with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. It is likely that these events taking place in his formative years encouraged his fascination with Europeans and their culture.

At some time during his youth, Seattle participated in a traditional coming-of-age ceremony called a vision quest (). His nobility was affirmed by the reception of a powerful spirit power, the thunderbird. In the traditional religion of the peoples of southern Puget Sound, having a strong spirit power is a symbol of strength, purity, and prestige. 

Seattle married into Duwamish families from , a significant village at the mouth of the Duwamish River, where he took several wives, as expected from a man of his status. He would go on to have several children, the most famous being Kikisoblu, his first child, born to his first wife, Ladalia. She died after the birth of her daughter, but Seattle had three sons and four more daughters through his second wife, Olahl.

=== A feared Suquamish warrior ===
As Seattle aged, he earned a reputation as a leader and a strong warrior. In his early 20s, Seattle participated in a coalition war against the Cowichan peoples of Vancouver Island led by his uncle Kitsap. Around 1810, Seattle led an ambush against a group of raiders in five canoes coming down the Green River. Seattle&#x27;s raiding party killed or enslaved the occupants of three canoes and sent the remaining two canoes back as a warning. Seattle also led a raid against the S&#x27;Klallam people on the Olympic Peninsula and may have also led further raids against the Snoqualmie people as well. Coast Salish peoples historically practiced slavery, and, like many of his contemporaries, Seattle enslaved people whom he had captured during his raids, further increasing his prestige.

By 1833, he had become known to the staff of Fort Nisqually as . He was seen as an intelligent and formidable leader, owing to his strong voice and towering physique, standing nearly tall. Francis Herron, the Chief Trader at the fort, considered him important and dangerous and requested him to sign a treaty forswearing murder. In 1837, however, Seattle murdered a Skykomish shaman. The new Chief Trader, William Kittson, hoped that the Suquamish would kill him; however, they continued to value him as a leader. 

In 1841, Seattle led a raid on the village of , located near modern-day Auburn at the former confluence of the Green and White rivers. The raid was in retaliation for a murder committed by someone from the village, and it crippled the village. Later, in 1847, he was part of the leadership of the Suquamish war against the Chemakum, who were decimated and effectively wiped out following the war. However, one of his sons was killed in battle with the Chemakum, leading Seattle to seek baptism into the Catholic Church around 1848. Seattle was probably baptized by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Olympia, where he chose the baptismal name of Noah after the prophet of the same name.

=== Friendship with American settlers ===
After the death of his son and his conversion to Christianity, Seattle began to seek cooperation with American settlers, retiring from fighting. He welcomed pioneers, inviting them to settle and trade with his people. Seattle began seeking contacts with businessmen and community leaders and gained a reputation as a &quot;friend of the whites&quot; among settlers. Seattle and the Duwamish helped many early American settlers, guiding them along the Duwamish River and its tributaries, providing them with safe transportation, and helped clear forests for the cultivation of crops, and provided labor in early sawmills and farms.

Seattle was eventually contacted by Isaac Stevens, the first Territorial Governor of Washington Territory, who recognized Seattle&#x27;s prominence among his people. Seattle would go on to be the first signature on the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliot for the Suquamish, and all the peoples of the Duwamish River&#x27;s watershed, including the Duwamish, Sammamish, Stkamish, Smulkamish, and Skopamish peoples, authorizing the cession of roughly 2.5 million acres of land to the United States. It has been argued that Seattle had no authority to sign the treaties for the peoples of the upriver Duwamish River according to traditional governance, and that he and others did not realize governor Stevens&#x27; desire to alter the indigenous political systems and control the native population.

The unpopular treaties caused many Duwamish to renounce Seattle&#x27;s leadership. Alongside many other tribes, the Duwamish participated in the Puget Sound War, a part of the broader Yakima Indian War. Despite this, Seattle supported the Americans in the conflict, providing them with valuable military intelligence. Seattle warned the American settlers of the impending attack and brought as many people as he could away from the fighting to the Port Madison reservation. After the war&#x27;s conclusion with the defeat of Native forces, Seattle tried to help his people regain their footing and sought clemency for the Native leaders in the war, such as Leschi. One reason for the war was the unratified treaty and illegal enforcement, so Seattle continuously advocated for the final ratification of the treaties. He also tried to stop slave murder and curtail the influence of alcohol on the Port Madison Reservation; he continued to try to resolve disputes elsewhere.

Seattle continued to seek relationships with American settlers, eventually gaining relationships with Doc Maynard, William De Shaw, and George Meigs, who all helped Seattle further his goals in helping the local Native and Settler populations. Despite his friendships with the Americans, the town forced Seattle to leave the city that bore his name in 1865 after the Town of Seattle Ordinance No. 5 banned all Native Americans from the town unless housed and employed by a white settler. Seattle then moved to the Suquamish Reservation, but continued to visit the city often both to visit his American friends and gather with other Native Americans in temporary waterfront campsites.

The Suquamish people, with whom Seattle eventually settled, continued to take care of Seattle and recognized him as their leader until his death, bringing him food and water to his house. Seattle died June 7, 1866, on the Port Madison Reservation after suffering from a brief yet severe fever. His funeral was conducted with both Catholic and Suquamish traditions, and he was buried on the Port Madison Reservation. Although he was mourned locally on the reservation and by his friend and sawmill owner George Meigs, no other pioneers of the city of Seattle attended his funeral, and no newspaper covered the event. However, years after his death, in 1890, some early Seattle historians and pioneers visited his gravesite, adding a stone marker to the grave.

==Chief Seattle&#x27;s speech==

In 1854, Seattle gave a speech, delivered in his native language of Lushootseed, to Isaac Stevens, during a visit to the city of Seattle. A pioneer, Henry A. Smith, had attended the meeting and taken notes of the speech. Thirty-three years later, in 1887, a text was reconstructed from Smith&#x27;s notes and published in the &quot;Seattle Sunday Star.&quot; Smith&#x27;s version of the speech was &quot;necessarily filtered&quot;, &quot;embellished&quot;, and created from Smith&#x27;s &quot;incomplete&quot; notes, according to historian Walt Crowley. There is no corroboration for the exact words of the speech, but Smith&#x27;s reconstruction is plausible, albeit embellished. Smith&#x27;s speech reconstruction has been lauded as &quot;a powerful, bittersweet plea for respect of Native American rights and environmental values.&quot;

In 1929, Clarence C. Bagley printed a version of the speech in his &quot;History of King County&quot;, adding &quot;Dead -- I say? There is no death. Only a change of worlds&quot; to the end of the speech. Bagley&#x27;s version became popular, circulating in environmentalist pamphlets and other works. The work was further modified by William Arrowsmith and Ted Perry, who added their own text additions. These versions influenced environmentalists and Native American rights activists in the 1960s.

==Legacy==

As Seattle was highly famous to both early pioneers and modern residents, as well as a constant figure in the mythos of Seattle&#x27;s founding, Chief Seattle&#x27;s legacy has been preserved in many ways. Seattle&#x27;s grave site, at the Suquamish Tribal Cemetery, has been turned into a monument to him and his life. In 1890, a group of Seattle pioneers led by Arthur Denny set up the monument over his grave, with the inscription &quot;SEATTLE Chief of the Suqampsh and Allied Tribes, Died June 7, 1866. The Firm Friend of the Whites, and for Him the City of Seattle was Named by Its Founders.&quot; On the reverse is the inscription &quot;Baptismal name, Noah Sealth, Age probably 80 years.&quot; The site was restored, and a native sculpture was added in 1976 and again in 2011.

Several of Seattle&#x27;s descendants also gained fame in their own right. Kikisoblu, also known as Angeline, was his most famous child and well-known to the residents of early Seattle, where she lived until her death in 1896. His son Jim became the leader of the Suquamish for a time, but was unpopular and was replaced in favor of a prominent leader of the Catholic Suquamish community, Jacob Wahalchu. A Duwamish grandniece of his, Rebecca Lena Graham, is also notable for her successful inheritance claim following the Graham v. Matthias, 63 F. 523 (1894) case.

Two statues of Seattle were created in his honor by James A. Wehn. A bronze bust, located in Pioneer Square, was made in 1909, and a full statue, located in the Denny Triangle, was made in 1912.

The city of Seattle and numerous other institutions relating to the city are named after him. Other things are named after Seattle as well, including:

* Chief Sealth Trail in southern Seattle
* A B-17E Flying Fortress, SN# 41-2656 named &quot;Chief Seattle&quot;, a so-called &quot;presentation aircraft&quot;, was funded by bonds purchased by the citizens of Seattle. Flying with the 435th Bombardment Squadron out of Port Moresby, it was lost with its 10-man crew on August 14, 1942.
* MV &quot;Chief Seattle&quot;, one of the four fireboats operated by the Seattle Fire Department
* MV Sealth, an Issaquah-class ferryboat operated by Washington State Ferries.
* Camp Sealth, a non-profit summer camp operated by the American youth organization Camp Fire

Several festivals and holidays are celebrated in his honor. The Suquamish Tribe hosts a festival in the third year of August called &quot;Chief Seattle Days.&quot; The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates the life of Seattle on June 7 in its Calendar of Saints. The liturgical color for the day is white.

Soundgarden, a Seattle rock band, covered the Black Sabbath song, &quot;Into the Void&quot; replacing the lyrics with the words from what was alleged to be Chief Seattle&#x27;s speech.

<doc id="214755" wikidata="Q1414135" url="?curid=214755" title="Rolling stock">
<text>The term rolling stock in the rail transport industry refers to railway vehicles, including both powered and unpowered vehicles: for example, locomotives, freight and passenger cars (or coaches), and non-revenue cars. Passenger vehicles can be un-powered, or self-propelled, single or multiple units.

In North America, Australia and other countries, the term consist ( ) is used to refer to the rolling stock comprising a train, a list containing specific information for each car of a train, or a group of locomotives.

In the United States, the term &quot;rolling stock&quot; has been expanded from the older broadly defined &quot;trains&quot; to include wheeled vehicles used by businesses on roadways.

The word &quot;stock&quot; in the term is used in a sense of inventory. Rolling stock is considered to be a liquid asset, or close to it, since the value of the vehicle can be readily estimated and then shipped to the buyer without much cost or delay. The term contrasts with fixed stock (infrastructure), which is a collective term for the track, signals, stations, other buildings, electric wires, etc., necessary to operate a railway.

<doc id="214761" wikidata="Q12334006" url="?curid=214761" title="Coach (bus)">
<text>A coach (also known as a motorcoach or coach bus) is a type of bus built for longer distance service, in contrast to transit buses that are typically used for shorter journeys within a single metropolitan region. Often used for touring, intercity, and international bus service, coaches are also used for private charter for various purposes.

Deriving the name from horse-drawn carriages and stagecoaches that carried passengers, luggage, and mail, modern motor coaches are almost always high-floor buses, with separate luggage hold mounted below the passenger compartment. In contrast to transit buses, motor coaches typically feature forward-facing seating, with no provision for standing. Other accommodations may include onboard restrooms, televisions, and overhead luggage space.

The name used for this type of bus varies between countries. In United States they are officially designated as motorcoach &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; as well as being referred to as coach bus. In United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and many other countries they are called coach. In Japan they are called Highway Bus, while those operating airport services are called Airport Limousine or Limousine Bus.

==History==

=== Background ===

Horse-drawn chariots and carriages (&quot;coaches&quot;) were used by the wealthy and powerful where the roads were of a high enough standard from possibly 3000 BC. In Hungary, during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus in the 15th century, the wheelwrights of Kocs began to build a horse-drawn vehicle with steel-spring suspension. This &quot;cart of Kocs&quot; as the Hungarians called it () soon became popular all over Europe. The imperial post service employed the first horse-drawn mail coaches in Europe since Roman times in 1650, and as they started in the town of Kocs, the use of these mail coaches gave rise to the term &quot;coach&quot;. Stagecoaches (drawn by horses) were used for transport between cities from about 1500 in Great Britain until displaced by the arrival of the railways.

One of the earliest motorized vehicles was the charabanc, which was used for short journeys and excursions until the early years of the 20th century. The first &quot;motor coaches&quot; were purchased by operators of those horse-drawn vehicles in the early 20th century by operators such as Royal Blue Coach Services, who purchased their first charabanc in 1913 and were running 72 coaches by 1926.

==Features==

Coaches are designed for comfort, as passengers are onboard for significant periods of time on long journeys, or the hirer desires a high standard of comfort on shorter trips.

They can vary considerably in quality: some higher-specification coaches feature luxury seats and refreshments, while others may only have the bare essentials such as non-reclining highback seats and an underfloor baggage compartment. Coaches typically have only a single, narrow door, but some may have two doors - it can be a tradeoff between faster passenger boarding/alighting times and having 2-4 extra seats.

Seats are normally in a configuration of 2 seats either side of a central aisle - or in premium coaches there can be 2 seats on one side of the aisle and 1 seat on the other side , or even 1 seat either side of the aisle in luxury coaches. Other seating layouts can be found on coaches built for a specific purpose (e.g. some overnight buses in Japan have 3 single seats with 2 narrow aisles).

Some characteristics include:
* Air conditioning is installed on virtually every modern coach.
* Comfortable highback seats - covered in cloth/fabric or leatherette (or even leather in some luxury coaches) - that recline and can include a fold-out tray table and/or beverage holder, and armrests.
* Luggage racks above the seats for storing carry-on bags.
* Luggage compartment, accessed from outside the vehicle, under the main floor (or sometimes at the rear)
* Personal reading light and adjustable air conditioning outlet above the seat
* On-board restrooms fitted with chemical toilets, hand basins and soap or hand sanitizer
* On some coaches, on-board entertainment including movies may be shown to passengers
* On-board refreshment service provided by an attendant or a vending machine
* Wheelchair accessible. This is generally provided using a wheelchair lift, although some coaches are in a partial (or full) double-deck layout able to accommodate wheelchair(s) and optionally a small number of regular seats on the lower level, with access by a portable or foldout ramp, with the remainder of the lower level normally used for luggage storage and a toilet.
* Curtains or blinds, useful on overnight services or to block harsh sunlight
* Onboard AC power, USB charging ports and Wi-Fi access
* Seat belt for safety

==Manufacture==
Coaches, like buses, may be fully built by integrated manufacturers, or a separate chassis consisting of only an engine, wheels and basic frame may be delivered to a coachwork factory for a body to be added. A few coaches are built with monocoque bodies without a chassis frame. Integrated manufacturers (most of whom also supply chassis) include Autosan, Scania, Fuso, and Alexander Dennis. Major coachwork providers (some of whom can build their own chassis) include Van Hool, Neoplan, Marcopolo, Irizar, MCI, Prevost, Volvo, Denning Manufacturing in Australia and Designline in New Zealand.

==Regulations==

In some European countries following the 1958 type certification treaty, coach (that is vehicle of type M2 or M3) type certification is regulated by regulation number 107 from the UNECE. In the U.S., commercial drivers of motorcoaches are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).

Drivers of buses &amp; coaches require a Commercial driver&#x27;s license (a higher class of license than is required to drive a car). Many states/countries also require bus/coach drivers to obtain an additional certification to carry paying passengers - for example United Kingdom &amp; European Union require a Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (Driver CPC)

Seat belts for drivers and all passengers are now legally required in many countries - for example United Kingdom. Refer to: Overview of Seat Belt Legislation by Country.

<text>Heȟáka Sápa commonly known as Black Elk (baptized Nicholas; December 1, 1863 – August 19, 1950), was a &quot;wičháša wakȟáŋ&quot; (&quot;medicine man, holy man&quot;) and &quot;heyoka&quot; of the Oglala Lakota people. He was a second cousin of the war leader Crazy Horse and fought with him in the Battle of Little Bighorn. He survived the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. He toured and performed in Europe as part of &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot;.

Black Elk is best known for his interviews with poet John Neihardt, where he discussed his religious views, visions, and events from his life. Neihardt published these in his book &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; in 1932. This book has since been published in numerous editions, most recently in 2008. Near the end of his life, he also spoke to American ethnologist Joseph Epes Brown for his 1947 book &quot;The Sacred Pipe&quot;. There has been great interest in these works among diverse people interested in Native American religions, notably those in the pan-Indian movement.

Black Elk converted to Catholicism, becoming a catechist, but he also continued to practice Lakota ceremonies. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rapid City opened an official cause for his beatification within the Roman Catholic Church in 2016. His grandson, George Looks Twice said, &quot;He was comfortable praying with this pipe and his rosary, and participated in Mass and Lakota ceremonies on a regular basis&quot;.

==Early years==
===Childhood===
Black Elk came from a long lineage of medicine men and healers. His father was a medicine man, as were his paternal uncles. Black Elk was born into an Oglala Lakota family in December 1863 along the Little Powder River (at a site thought to be in the present-day state of Wyoming). According to the Lakota way of measuring time (referred to as Winter counts), Black Elk was born in &quot;the Winter When the Four Crows Were Killed on Tongue River.&quot;

===Vision===
When Black Elk was nine years old, he was suddenly taken ill; he reported lying prone and unresponsive for several days. During this time he said he had a great vision in which he was visited by the Thunder Beings (&quot;Wakinyan&quot;) &quot;...spirits were represented as kind and loving, full of years and wisdom, like revered human grandfathers.&quot; When he was 17, Black Elk told a medicine man, Black Road, about the vision in detail. Black Road and the other medicine men of the village were &quot;astonished by the greatness of the vision.&quot;

Late in his life, Black Elk told Neihardt about his vision. He also envisioned a great tree that symbolized the life of the Earth and all people. Neihardt later wrote about this in &quot;Black Elk Speaks.&quot;

In one of his visions, Black Elk describes being taken to the center of the Earth, and to the central mountain of the world. Mythologist Joseph Campbell notes that an &quot;&quot;axis mundi,&quot; the central point, the pole around which all revolves ... the point where stillness and movement are together...&quot; is a theme in several other religions, as well. Campbell viewed Black Elk&#x27;s statement as one key to understanding worldwide religious myth and symbols in general.

From DeMallie&#x27;s book:

=== The Battle of the Little Bighorn ===
Black Elk was present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and described his experience to John Neihardt:

==Later Years: International touring and Ghost Dance movement==
=== &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; ===

In 1887, Black Elk traveled to England with &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot;, an experience he described to Neihardt and which appeared in chapter twenty of &quot;Black Elk Speaks.&quot; On May 11, 1887, the troupe put on a command performance for Queen Victoria, whom they called &quot;Grandmother England.&quot; He was among the crowd at her golden jubilee.

In the spring of 1888, &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; set sail for the United States. Black Elk became separated from the group, and the ship left without him, stranding him with three other Lakota. They subsequently joined another wild west show and he spent the next year touring in Germany, France, and Italy. When Buffalo Bill arrived in Paris in May 1889, Black Elk obtained a ticket to return home to Pine Ridge, arriving in the autumn of 1889. During his sojourn in Europe, Black Elk was given an &quot;abundant opportunity to study the white man&#x27;s way of life,&quot; and he learned to speak rudimentary English.

===The Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee Massacre===
Black Elk returned to the Pine Ridge Reservation after touring with the Wild West shows. He became involved with the Ghost Dance movement, bringing to the followers of the movement a special Ghost Dance shirt, after seeing his ancestors in vision who instructed him, &quot;We will give you something that you shall carry back to your people, and with it they shall come to see their loved ones&quot;. The Ghost Dance brought hope: The white man would soon disappear; the buffalo herds would return; people would be reunited with loved ones who had since passed away; the old way of living before the white man would return. This was not just a religious movement but a response to the gradual cultural destruction.

Black Elk was present at the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890, which occurred due to fear by US settlers of the large interest in the Ghost Dance by Plains tribes. While on horseback, he said he charged soldiers and helped to rescue some of the wounded, arriving after many of Spotted Elk&#x27;s (Big Foot&#x27;s) band of people had been shot. He was grazed by a bullet to his hip. Lakota leader Red Cloud convinced him to stop fighting after being wounded, and he remained on the Pine Ridge Reservation, where he could convert to Catholicism.

==Final years: Conversion to Catholicism==
For at least a decade, beginning in 1934, Black Elk returned to work related to his performances earlier in life with Buffalo Bill. He organized an Indian show to be held at the Sitting Bull Crystal Cavern Dance Pavilion in the sacred Black Hills. Neihardt writes that, unlike the Wild West shows, used to glorify Native American warfare, Black Elk created a show to teach tourists about Lakota culture and traditional sacred rituals, including the Sun Dance.

Black Elk&#x27;s first wife Katie converted to Roman Catholicism, and they had their three children baptized as Catholics. After Katie&#x27;s death, in 1904 Black Elk, then in his 40s, converted to Catholicism. He also became a catechist, teaching others about Christianity. He married again and had more children with his second wife; they were also baptized and reared as Catholic. He said his children &quot;had to live in this world.&quot; His first wife Katie died in 1903. Black Elk became a Catholic in 1904, when he was in his 40s. He was christened with the name of Nicholas and later served as a catechist in the church. After this, other medicine men, including his nephew Fools Crow, referred to him both as Black Elk and Nicholas Black Elk. The widower Black Elk married again in 1905 to Anna Brings White, a widow with two daughters. Together they had three more children, whom they also had baptized as Catholic. The couple were together until her death in 1941. His son, Benjamin Black Elk (1899–1973), became known as the &quot;Fifth Face of Mount Rushmore&quot;, posing in the 1950s and 1960s for tourists at the memorial.

===1930s: Meeting with Neihardt and Brown===
In the early 1930s, Black Elk spoke with John Neihardt and Joseph Epes Brown, which led to the publication of Neihardt&#x27;s books. His son Ben translated Black Elk&#x27;s stories into English as he spoke. Neihardt&#x27;s daughter Enid recorded these accounts. She later arranged them in chronological order for Neihardt&#x27;s use. Thus the process had many steps and involved more people than Black Elk and Neihardt in the recounting and recording.

After Black Elk spoke with Neihardt over the course of several days, Neihardt asked why Black Elk had &quot;put aside&quot; his old religion and baptized his children. According to [Neihardt&#x27;s daughter] Hilda, Black Elk replied, &quot;My children had to live in this world.&quot; &quot;To live&quot; according to Black Elk, is one of the central prayers of Lakota spirituality. (Black Elk mentions this prayer for life nineteen times in &quot;The Sacred Pipe&quot;.) In her 1995 memoir, Hilda Neihardt wrote that just before his death, Black Elk took his pipe and told his daughter Lucy Looks Twice, &quot;The only thing I really believe is the pipe religion.&quot;

==Legacy==
Since the 1970s, the book &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; has become popular with those interested in Native Americans in the United States. With the rise of Native American activism, there was increasing interest among many in Native American religions. Within the American Indian Movement, especially among non-Natives and urban descendants who had not been raised in a traditional culture, &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; was a popular book among those newly seeking religious and spiritual inspiration. However, critics have stated that John Neihardt, as the author and editor, may have exaggerated, altered, or invented some of the content either to make it more marketable to the intended white audience of the 1930s, or because he did not fully understand the Lakota culture.

On August 11, 2016, the US Board on Geographic Names officially renamed Harney Peak, the highest point in South Dakota, Black Elk Peak in honor of Nicholas Black Elk and in recognition of the significance of the mountain to Native Americans.

In August 2016, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rapid City opened an official cause for his beatification within the Roman Catholic Church. On October 21, 2017, the cause for canonization for Nicholas Black Elk was formally opened by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rapid City, South Dakota, paving the way for the possibility of him eventually being recognized as a saint. Black Elk&#x27;s conversion to Roman Catholicism has confused many, both Indigenous and Catholic. Biographer Jon M. Sweeney addressed this duality in 2020, explaining, &quot;Nick didn&#x27;t see reason to disconnect from his vision life after converting to Catholicism... Was Black Elk a true Lakota in the second half of his life? Yes... Was he also a real Christian? Yes.&quot; He is now designated by Catholics as a &quot;Servant of God&quot;, a title indicating that his life and works are being investigated by the Pope and the Catholic Church for possible canonization. His work to share the Gospel with Native and non-Native people and harmonize the faith with Lakota culture were noted at the Mass where this was announced.

Damian Costello writes that Black Elk&#x27;s Lakota Catholic faith was uniquely anti-colonial, stemming from his Ghost Dance vision. In this he says it was broadly analogous to anti-colonial movements from across the globe drawn from the Biblical narrative, such as the Rastafari in Jamaica.

<text>A stagecoach (also: stage coach, stage, road coach, ) is a four-wheeled public transport coach used to carry paying passengers and light packages on journeys long enough to need a change of horses. It is strongly sprung and generally drawn by four horses although some versions are drawn by six horses.

Commonly used before steam-powered rail transport was available, a stagecoach made long scheduled trips using stage stations or posts where the stagecoach&#x27;s horses would be replaced by fresh horses. The business of running stagecoaches or the act of journeying in them was known as staging.

Some familiar images of the stagecoach are that of a Royal Mail coach passing through a turnpike gate, a Dickensian passenger coach covered in snow pulling up at a coaching inn, a highwayman demanding a coach to &quot;stand and deliver&quot; and a Wells Fargo stagecoach arriving at or leaving an American frontier town. The yard of ale drinking glass is associated by legend with stagecoach drivers, though it was mainly used for drinking feats and special toasts.

==Description==
The stagecoach was a closed four-wheeled vehicle drawn by horses or hard-going mules. It was regularly used as a public conveyance on an established route usually to a regular schedule. Spent horses were replaced with fresh horses at stage stations, posts, or relays. In addition to the stage driver or coachman who guided the vehicle, a shotgun messenger armed with a coach gun might travel as a guard beside him. Thus, the origin of the phrase &quot;riding shotgun&quot;.


The American &quot;mud wagon&quot; was an earlier, smaller, and cruder vehicle, being mostly open-sided with minimal protection from weather, causing passengers to risk being mud-splashed. A canvas-topped stage wagon was used for freight and passengers, and it had a lower center of gravity, making it harder to overturn.

==Speed==
Until the late 18th century, stagecoaches traveled at an average speed of about , with the average daily mileage traversed approximately . With road improvements and the development of steel springs, speeds increased. By 1836 the scheduled coach left London at 19:30, travelled through the night (without lights) and arrived in Liverpool at 16:50 the next day, a distance of about , doubling the overall average speed to about , including stops to change horses.

==History==

===Origins===
The first crude depiction of a coach was in an English manuscript from the 13th century. The first recorded stagecoach route in Britain started in 1610 and ran from Edinburgh to Leith. This was followed by a steady proliferation of other routes around the island. By the mid 17th century, a basic stagecoach infrastructure had been put in place. A string of coaching inns operated as stopping points for travellers on the route between London and Liverpool. The stagecoach would depart every Monday and Thursday and took roughly ten days to make the journey during the summer months. Stagecoaches also became widely adopted for travel in and around London by mid-century and generally travelled at a few miles per hour. Shakespeare&#x27;s first plays were performed at coaching inns such as The George Inn, Southwark.

By the end of the 17th century stagecoach routes ran up and down the three main roads in England. The London-York route was advertised in 1698:
The novelty of this method of transport excited much controversy at the time. One pamphleteer denounced the stagecoach as a &quot;great evil [...] mischievous to trade and destructive to the public health&quot;. Another writer, however, argued that:

The speed of travel remained constant until the mid-18th century. Reforms of the turnpike trusts, new methods of road building and the improved construction of coaches led to a sustained rise in the comfort and speed of the average journey - from an average journey length of 2 days for the Cambridge-London route in 1750 to a length of under 7 hours in 1820.

Robert Hooke helped in the construction of some of the first spring-suspended coaches in the 1660s and spoked wheels with iron rim brakes were introduced, improving the characteristics of the coach.

In 1754, a Manchester-based company began a new service called the &quot;Flying Coach&quot;. It was advertised with the following announcement - &quot;However incredible it may appear, this coach will actually (barring accidents) arrive in London in four days and a half after leaving Manchester.&quot; A similar service was begun from Liverpool three years later, using coaches with steel spring suspension. This coach took an unprecedented three days to reach London with an average speed of 

===Royal Mail stagecoaches===
Even more dramatic improvements were made by John Palmer at the British Post Office. The postal delivery service in Britain had existed in the same form for about 150 years—from its introduction in 1635, mounted carriers had ridden between &quot;posts&quot; where the postmaster would remove the letters for the local area before handing the remaining letters and any additions to the next rider. The riders were frequent targets for robbers, and the system was inefficient.

Palmer made much use of the &quot;flying&quot; stagecoach services between cities in the course of his business, and noted that it seemed far more efficient than the system of mail delivery then in operation. His travel from Bath to London took a single day to the mail&#x27;s three days. It occurred to him that this stagecoach service could be developed into a national mail delivery service, so in 1782 he suggested to the Post Office in London that they take up the idea. He met resistance from officials who believed that the existing system could not be improved, but eventually the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Pitt, allowed him to carry out an experimental run between Bristol and London. Under the old system the journey had taken up to 38 hours. The stagecoach, funded by Palmer, left Bristol at 4 pm on 2 August 1784 and arrived in London just 16 hours later.

Impressed by the trial run, Pitt authorised the creation of new routes. Within the month the service had been extended from London to Norwich, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester, and by the end of 1785 services to the following major towns and cities of England and Wales had also been linked: Leeds, Dover, Portsmouth, Poole, Exeter, Gloucester, Worcester, Holyhead and Carlisle. A service to Edinburgh was added the next year, and Palmer was rewarded by being made Surveyor and Comptroller General of the Post Office. By 1797 there were forty-two routes.

===Improved coach design===
The period from 1800 to 1830 saw great improvements in the design of coaches, most notably by John Besant in 1792 and 1795. His coach had a greatly improved turning capacity and braking system, and a novel feature that prevented the wheels from falling off while the coach was in motion. Besant, with his partner John Vidler, enjoyed a monopoly on the supply of stagecoaches to the Royal Mail and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing for the following few decades.

Steel springs had been used in suspensions for vehicles since 1695. Coachbuilder Obadiah Elliott obtained a patent covering the use of elliptic springs - which were not his invention. His patent lasted 14 years delaying development because Elliott allowed no others to license and use his patent. Elliott mounted each wheel with two durable elliptic steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs attached to the axles. After the expiry of his patent most British horse carriages were equipped with elliptic springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid taxation, and steel springs in larger vehicles.

===Improved roads===

 in road construction were also made at this time, most importantly the widespread implementation of Macadam roads up and down the country. The speed of coaches in this period rose from around (including stops for provisioning) to and greatly increased the level of mobility in the country, both for people and for mail. Each route had an average of four coaches operating on it at one time - two for both directions and a further two spares in case of a breakdown en route. Joseph Ballard described the stagecoach service between Manchester and Liverpool in 1815 as having price competition between coaches, with timely service and clean accommodations at inns.

===Taxation and regulation===

Stagecoaches in Victorian Britain were heavily taxed on the number of passenger seats. If more passengers were carried than the licence allowed there were penalties to pay. The lawyer Stanley Harris (1816–1897) writes in his books &quot;Old Coaching Days and The Coaching Age&quot; that he knew of informers ready to report any breach of regulations to the authorities. This could be overloading of passengers in excess of the licence or minor matters such as luggage too high on the roof. They did this in return for a portion of any fines imposed, sometimes as much as half. The tax paid on passenger seats was a major expense for coach operators. Harris gives an example of the tax payable on the London to Newcastle coach route (278 miles). Annual tax amounted to £2,529 for 15 passengers per coach (4 inside and 11 outside). Annual tolls were £2,537. The hire of the four coach vehicles needed was £1,274. The 250 horses needed for this service also needed to be paid for. Operators could reduce their tax burden by one seventh by operating a six-day-a-week service instead of a seven-day service.

===Decline and evolution===
The development of railways in the 1830s spelled the end for stagecoaches and mail coaches. The first rail delivery between Liverpool and Manchester took place on 11 November 1830. By the early 1840s most London-based coaches had been withdrawn from service.

Some stagecoaches remained in use for commercial or recreational purposes. They came to be known as road coaches and were used by their enterprising (or nostalgic) owners to provide scheduled passenger services where rail had not yet reached and also on certain routes at certain times of the year for the pleasure of an (often amateur) coachman and his daring passengers.

====Competitive display and sport====
 vanished as rail penetrated the countryside the 1860s did see the start of a coaching revival spurred on by the popularity of Four-in-hand driving as a sporting pursuit (the Four-In-Hand Driving Club was founded in 1856 and the Coaching Club in 1871).

New stagecoaches often known as Park Drags began to be built to order. Some owners would parade their vehicles and magnificently dressed passengers in fashionable locations. Other owners would take more enthusiastic suitably-dressed passengers and indulge in competitive driving. Very similar in design to stagecoaches their vehicles were lighter and sportier.

These owners were (often very expert) amateur gentlemen-coachmen, occasionally gentlewomen. A professional coachman might accompany them to avert disaster. Professionals called these vehicles &#x27;butterflies&#x27;. They only appeared in summer.
===Spread elsewhere===

====Australia====
Cobb &amp; Co was established in Melbourne in 1853 and grew to service Australia&#x27;s mainland eastern states and South Australia.

====Continental Europe====

The , a solidly built stagecoach with four or more horses, was the French vehicle for public conveyance with minor varieties in Germany such as the &quot;Stellwagen&quot; and &quot;Eilwagen&quot;.

The &quot;diligence&quot; from Le Havre to Paris was described by a fastidious English visitor of 1803 with a thoroughness that distinguished it from its English contemporary, the &quot;stage coach&quot;.
A more uncouth clumsy machine can scarcely be imagined. In the front is a cabriolet fixed to the body of the coach, for the accommodation of three passengers, who are protected from the rain above, by the projecting roof of the coach, and in front by two heavy curtains of leather, well oiled, and smelling somewhat offensively, fastened to the roof. The inside, which is capacious, and lofty, and will hold six people in great comfort is lined with leather padded, and surrounded with little pockets, in which travellers deposit their bread, snuff, night caps, and pocket handkerchiefs, which generally enjoy each others company, in the same delicate depository. From the roof depends a large net work which is generally crouded with hats, swords, and band boxes, the whole is convenient, and when all parties are seated and arranged, the accommodations are by no means unpleasant.
Upon the roof, on the outside, is the imperial, which is generally filled with six or seven persons more, and a heap of luggage, which latter also occupies the basket, and generally presents a pile, half as high again as the coach, which is secured by ropes and chains, tightened by a large iron windlass, which also constitutes another appendage of this moving mass. The body of the carriage rests upon large thongs of leather, fastened to heavy blocks of wood, instead of springs, and the whole is drawn by seven horses. 

The English visitor noted the small, sturdy Norman horses &quot;running away with our cumbrous machine, at the rate of six or seven miles an hour&quot;. At this speed stagecoaches could compete with canal boats, but they were rendered obsolete in Europe wherever the rail network expanded in the 19th century. Where the rail network did not reach, the &quot;diligence&quot; was not fully superseded until the arrival of the autobus.

In France, between 1765 and 1780, the &quot;turgotines&quot;, big mail coaches named for their originator, Louis XVI&#x27;s economist minister Turgot, and improved roads, where a coach could travel at full gallop across levels, combined with more staging posts at shorter intervals, cut the time required to travel across the country sometimes by half.

====New Zealand====
A Cobb &amp; Co (Australia) proprietor arrived in New Zealand on 4 October 1861, thus beginning Cobb &amp; Co (New Zealand) stagecoach operation.

====United States====

Beginning in the 18th century, crude wagons began to be used to carry passengers between cities and towns, first within New England by 1744, then between New York and Philadelphia by 1756. Travel time was reduced on this later run from three days to two in 1766 with an improved coach called the &quot;Flying Machine&quot;. The first mail coaches appeared in the later 18th century carrying passengers and the mails, replacing the earlier post riders on the main roads. Coachmen carried letters, packages, and money, often transacting business or delivering messages for their customers. By 1829 Boston was the hub of 77 stagecoach lines; by 1832 there were 106. Coaches with iron or steel springs were uncomfortable and had short useful lives. Two men in Concord, New Hampshire, developed what became a popular solution. They built their first Concord stagecoach in 1827 employing long leather straps under their stagecoaches which gave a swinging motion.


Describing a journey he took in 1861, in his 1872 book, &quot;Roughing It&quot;, Mark Twain wrote that the Concord stage was like &quot;an imposing cradle on wheels&quot;. Around twenty years later, in 1880, John Plesent Gray recorded after travelling from Tucson to Tombstone on J.D. Kinnear&#x27;s mail and express line: The horses were changed three times on the trip, normally completed in 17 hours.

The stagecoach lines in the U.S. were operated by private companies. Their most profitable contracts were with U.S. Mail and were hotly contested. Pony Express, which began operations in 1860, is often called first fast mail service from the Missouri River to the Pacific Coast, but the Overland Mail Company began a twice-weekly mail service from Missouri to San Francisco in September 1858. Transcontinental stage-coaching ended with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869.

====Southern Africa====
The railway network in South Africa was extended from Mafeking through Bechuanaland and reached Bulawayo in 1897. Prior to its arrival, a network of stagecoach routes existed.

====Ottoman Palestine====

Stagecoaches, often known by the French name &quot;Diligence&quot; - a smaller model with room for six passengers and a bigger one for ten, drawn by two horses (in the city, on the plain or on a good road) or three (on intercity and elevated roads) - were the main means of public transportation in Ottoman Palestine between the middle of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.

The first stagecoaches were brought to Palestine by the German religious group known as the &quot;Templers&quot; who operated a public transportation service between their colonies in the country as early as 1867. Stagecoach development in Palestine was greatly facilitated by the 1869 visit of Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I. For this distinguished guest, the road between Jaffa and Jerusalem was greatly improved, making possible the passage of carriages. Stagecoaches were a great improvement over the earlier means of transport used in the country, such as riding horses, donkeys or camels, or light carts drawn by donkeys.

When the stagecoach ran into a difficult ascent or mud, the passengers were required to get off and help push the carriage. The trip between Jaffa and Jerusalem by stagecoach lasted about 14 hours spread over a day and a half, including a night stop at Bab al-Wad (Shaar HaGai), the trip in the opposite, downhill direction took 12 hours.

The stagecoaches belonged to private owners, and the wagoners were mostly hired, although sometimes the wagoner was also the owner of the wagon. The license to operate the stagecoaches was granted by the government to private individuals in the cities and to the colony committees in the early Zionist colonies. The license holders paid a special tax for this right and could employ subcontractors and hired wagons.

The stagecoaches linked Jerusalem with Jaffa, Hebron and Nablus, the Zionist colonies with Jaffa, Haifa with Acre and Nazareth. They were also used for urban and suburban transportation in the Haifa region.

The colony of Rehovot is known to have promulgated detailed regulations for stagecoach operation, soon after its foundation in 1890, which were greatly extended in 1911. Fares were fixed, ranging between 1.10 Grush for traveling to the nearby village of Wadi Hanin and 5.00 Grush for traveling from Rehovot to Jaffa. The stagecoach was required to work six times a week (except for the Shabbat) and to carry free of charge the mails and medicines of the Rehovot pharmacy.

While railways started being constructed in Palestine in the last years of the 19th century, stagecoaches were still a major means of public transport until the outbreak of the First World War, and in peripheral areas were still used in the early years of British Mandatory rule.

<text>The New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides) is a medium-sized member of the family Corvidae, native to New Caledonia. The bird is often referred to as the &#x27;qua-qua&#x27; due to its distinctive call. It eats a wide range of food, including many types of invertebrates, eggs, nestlings, small mammals, snails, nuts and seeds. The New Caledonian crow sometimes captures grubs in nooks or crevices by poking a twig at the grub to agitate it into biting the twig, which the crow then withdraws with the grub still attached. This method of feeding indicates the New Caledonian crow is capable of tool use. They are also able to make hooks. This species is also capable of solving a number of sophisticated cognitive tests which suggest that it is particularly intelligent. As a result of these findings, the New Caledonian crow has become a model species for scientists trying to understand the impact of tool use and manufacture on the evolution of intelligence.

==Description==
The New Caledonian crow is a moderate-sized crow ( in length), similar in size to the house crow, but less slender-looking. The bird has an all-black appearance with a rich gloss to its feathers of purple, dark blue and some green in good light. The beak, feet and legs are all black. The beak is moderate in size but is unusual in that the tip of the lower mandible is angled upwards, making it somewhat chisel-like in profile. It has been suggested that this beak morphology evolved due to the selective pressure of needing to hold a tool straight.

The vocalization is described as a soft &quot;waa-waa&quot; or &quot;wak-wak&quot;, and sometimes as a hoarse &quot;qua-qua&quot; or &quot;waaaark&quot;. Across New Caledonia, the bird is often referred to as a &#x27;qua-qua&#x27; due to its distinctive call.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bird is endemic to the islands of New Caledonia in the Pacific, living in primary forest. It inhabits only the main island, Grande Terre, and one of the Loyalty Islands, Maré Island.

== Ecology and behavior ==
The New Caledonian crow eats a wide range of food, including many types of insects and other invertebrates (some caught in flight with great agility, including night-flying insects which it catches at dusk), eggs and nestlings, small mammals, snails (which it drops from a height onto hard stones), and various nuts and seeds.

This species is known for using plant material to create stick and leaf tools to capture prey hiding in cracks and crevices. These tools can have naturally occurring , or are sometimes fashioned into hooks by the birds. The tool is inserted into the crack or crevice in the log or branch, and the prey is agitated into biting the tool. The crow then withdraws the tool with prey still attached, and devours the prey. Grubs caught in this way have been shown to be an integral part of the crows&#x27; diet. The New Caledonian crow appears to fill the ecological niche of the woodpeckers and the woodpecker finch of the Galapagos, since the latter and New Caledonia lack woodpeckers. The feeding method of the woodpecker finch differs in that it stabs at grubs and levers them slowly out of the log using a small twig.

The nest of the New Caledonian crow is built high in a tree with usually 2–3 eggs laid from September to November.

=== Tool use and manufacture ===
This species uses stick tools in the wild by finding small twigs and probing them into holes in logs to extract insects and larvae. New Caledonian crows are also able to manufacture tools by breaking twigs off bushes and trimming them to produce functional stick tools. Tool manufacture is rare in comparison to simple tool use and indicates a higher level of cognitive function. The crows can also make leaf tools by tearing rectangular strips off the edges of &quot;Pandanus&quot; spp. leaves. The creation of such leaf tools allows these crows to exploit naturally occurring hooks – the barbs running along the edges of these leaves can be used as hooks if the tool is held such that the barbs point towards the crows’ head. Other naturally occurring hooks are also incorporated within tools, such as the thorns that grow on vine species in New Caledonia. These crows create hooks by crafting both wood and ferns into hooks. This is done by trimming the junctions between two branches or fern stolons into a tick shape (i.e. one junction has a long piece of wood/stolon attached, one junction has a small piece of wood /stolon attached) and then removing material from this junction to create a functioning hook. This imposition of three-dimensional form onto a natural material resembles carving.
This species has a particular method for crafting tools:

The New Caledonian crow is the only non-primate species for which there is evidence of cumulative cultural evolution in tool manufacture. That is, this species appear to have invented new tools by modifying existing ones, then passing these innovations to other individuals in the cultural group. Gavin R. Hunt and colleagues at the University of Auckland studied tools the crows make out of &quot;pandanus&quot; (or screw pine) leaves. Observations of the distribution of 5,500 leaf counterparts or stencils left behind by the cutting process suggest that the narrow and the stepped tools are more advanced versions of the wide tool type. &quot;The geographical distribution of each tool type on the island suggests a unique origin, rather than multiple independent inventions&quot;. This implies that the inventions, which involve a delicate change in the manufacturing process, were being passed from one individual to another.

The New Caledonian crow also spontaneously makes tools from materials it does not encounter in the wild. In 2002, researcher Alex Kacelnik and colleagues at the University of Oxford observed of a couple of New Caledonian crows called Betty and Abel:

This observation was further investigated in a series of studies. Out of ten successful retrievals, Betty bent the wire into a hook nine times. Abel retrieved the food once, without bending the wire. The process would usually start with Betty trying to get the food bucket with the straight wire, but then she would make a hook from it bending it in different ways, usually by snagging one end of the wire under something, and then using the bent hook to pick up the tray.

Clearly, Betty&#x27;s creation of hooks cannot be attributed to the shaping or reinforcement of trial-and-error behavior. In 2004, Hunt observed the crows in the wild also making hooks, but the adaptation to the new material of the wire was clearly novel and appeared purposeful. Intentional tool manufacture, even if it is generalizing a prior experience to a novel context, is rare in the animal world.

These crows also use tools to investigate potentially dangerous objects, such as a rubber snake or a flashing LED bike light.

=== Meta- and compound tools ===

Meta-tool use is using one tool on another tool to achieve the objective of the task. It is generally considered to be a behaviour requiring more complex cognitive ability than the use of just a single tool. Studies show that New Caledonian crows are capable of meta-tool use, at a level rivalling the best performances seen in primates.

One such study involved putting food in a box out of the crows&#x27; reach. The crows were given a stick that was too short to reach the food. However, this short stick could be used to retrieve a longer stick from another box, which could then be used to retrieve the food. This complex behaviour involved the crow realising that a tool could be used on non-food objects, and suppressing the urge to go directly for the food. It was solved by six of seven birds on the first attempt. This behaviour had previously only been observed in primates.

In a study conducted at the Max Planck Society crows have been shown to create compound tools from 2–4 short branches that could be slotted together.

===Mirror use===
New Caledonian crows have shown they are able to process information from mirrors, a cognitive ability possessed by only a small number of species. By using a mirror, wild-caught New Caledonian crows are able to find objects they cannot see with a direct line of sight. However, the crows were unable to recognise themselves in the mirror – other corvids have tested positive for this capability.

<text>The Red Violin () is a 1998 drama film directed by François Girard and starring Samuel L. Jackson, Carlo Cecchi and Sylvia Chang. It spans four centuries and five countries telling the story of a mysterious red-coloured violin and its many owners. The instrument, made in Cremona in 1681 with a future forecast by tarot cards, makes its way to Montreal in 1997, where an appraiser identifies it and it goes to auction. The film was an international co-production among companies in Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

The screenplay, inspired by a historic 1720 Stradivarius violin nicknamed the &quot;Red Mendelssohn&quot;, was written by Don McKellar and Girard. The film was shot in Austria, Canada, China, England and Italy. It features a soundtrack by John Corigliano, with solos performed by violinist Joshua Bell.

After premiering at the Venice Film Festival, it received some positive reviews from critics and grossed $10 million at the U.S. box office. It received numerous honours, including the Academy Award for Best Original Score and eight Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture. The film was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to &quot;All About My Mother&quot;.

==Plot==
 Cremona, 1681 &quot;()&quot;

Nicolò Bussotti is a violin-maker whose wife, Anna Rudolfi, is pregnant. Anna asks her servant Cesca to foretell her unborn child&#x27;s future. Cesca cannot determine the future of someone who was not born, but she does offer to read Anna&#x27;s future using tarot cards. The first, The Moon, signifies that Anna will live a long life.

In the meantime, Nicolò has fashioned a new violin. He is about to varnish it when he finds that both she and the child have died. Distraught, Nicolò returns to his shop and varnishes the violin with a red color. The violin, the last one that Nicolò ever made, then makes its way to an orphanage in Austria.

 Vienna, 1793 &quot;()&quot;

Cesca turns over the second card, The Hanged Man, which means disease and suffering for those around Anna.

At the orphanage, the violin comes into the possession of Kaspar Weiss, a young but brilliant violin prodigy. The monks at the orphanage ask a violin instructor, Poussin, to adopt the boy to further his development. Poussin brings Weiss and the violin to Vienna. They learn that Prince Mannsfeld is visiting Vienna and is looking for a prodigy to accompany him back to Prussia, promising a generous reward. Poussin puts Weiss through a strict practice regimen. However, the regimen and the &quot;Poussin Meter&quot; (a primitive metronome) take a toll on Weiss&#x27; heart defect. On the day of the recital, just before starting to play, Weiss&#x27;s heart gives out from the stress, and he collapses, dead.

Weiss is buried at the orphanage where he grew up. When Poussin inquires about the violin, the monks explain that they buried it with Weiss. The violin is later stolen by grave robbers travelling in a Romani procession, who take it to England.

Oxford, the late 1890s &quot;()&quot;
Cesca&#x27;s third card is The Devil, and she explains that Anna will meet a handsome and intelligent man who will seduce her.

Lord Frederick Pope comes across the Romani procession setting up camp on his estate, as a Romani woman plays the violin. He offers his hospitality in exchange for the violin. Frederick finds great praise in his public concerts with the violin and his compositions, with his lover Victoria Byrd serving as his carnal muse. Victoria, a writer, announces to Frederick that she needs to travel to Russia to research a novel she is working on.

While Victoria is absent, Frederick loses his inspiration to compose and degenerates. When Victoria does not receive his letters for a full week, she resolves to return immediately. But when she arrives, she finds him in the arms of a new muse, the Romani violinist woman. In a moment of rage, Victoria shoots the violin, grazing its neck and detaching its strings and tailpiece, before storming out.

Frederick&#x27;s final letter to Victoria states that he will be dying by suicide and that he is leaving his entire estate to her. The violin ends up in the hands of Frederick&#x27;s Chinese servant, who returns to Shanghai and sells it to an antiques dealer, who repairs the damage. The instrument was sold to a young woman and her daughter during the 1930s.
Shanghai, late 1960s &quot;()&quot;

Cesca predicts the fourth card, Justice, means tough times ahead, featuring a trial and persecution, where Anna shall be guilty.

In the chaos of China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, any ideas or items deemed &quot;bourgeois&quot; are denounced and should be destroyed. One target for public denunciation and self-criticism is a music teacher named Zhou Yuan, who is berated for his fondness for Western classical music. A political officer, Xiang Pei, successfully defends Zhou. Xiang then returns to her residence and retrieves the Red Violin, given as a gift from her mother. Several Red Guards raid Xiang&#x27;s apartment after learning of its existence, finding nothing.

Xiang arrives at Zhou&#x27;s house and pleads with him to take the violin to keep it safe. He relents and vows to keep it hidden, while Xiang leaves to face possible prosecution from Communist Party officials. Years later, Chinese police enter Zhou&#x27;s home to find his dead body amid a &quot;sanctuary&quot; of dozens of musical instruments. Upon this discovery, the present-day Chinese government ships these items to Montreal for appraisal and sale at auction.
Montréal, 1997 &quot;()&quot;

The final card, Death, Cesca sees not as predicting death, but, due to its upside-down positioning, as rebirth.

Charles Morritz arrives in Montreal as an appraiser for the violins sent by the Chinese government. Almost immediately, he notices the Red Violin and believes it may be the legendary last violin of Nicolò Bussotti. He has restorer Evan Williams perform some work on it, while sending samples of the varnish to a lab at the University of Montreal. At the same time, he purchases a copy of the Red Violin from a private collection in London, the closest copy to the original available.

When the results of the varnish tests arrive, Morritz is shocked to learn that the violin&#x27;s varnish contains human blood. Nicolò had carried his wife&#x27;s body to his shop after her death and slit her wrist to collect blood for making the red varnish. He admits to the auction manager, Leroux, that it is the Red Violin.

As he prepares to fly home, Morritz stops by the auction house &quot;Duval&#x27;s&quot;, with the London copy in hand. As the auction for the previous lot ends, Morritz switches the Red Violin for the London copy, which is sold for $2.4 million. Morritz calls his wife at home in New York City and asks to speak to his daughter, telling her he has a special present for her upon his return.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was inspired by one of the violins of Antonio Stradivari, the 1721 Red Mendelssohn, which features a unique red stripe on its top right side. By the time the film was made, the Red Mendelssohn was owned by Elizabeth Pitcairn, heiress to the PPG fortune, whose grandfather purchased it for her 16th birthday for $1.7 million at auction at Christie&#x27;s London. Despite rumours and the film, the Red Mendelssohn is varnished with burgundy rather than blood. Stradivarius used red varnish on numerous other violins from 1704 to 1720, the so-called &quot;golden period&quot;, and other red-coloured violins besides the Red Mendelssohn survive.

Director François Girard opted to make a film about a violin due to his belief that &quot;Making film is making music&quot;. The concept of a history of a violin was the starting point, with Girard not initially realizing the project would call for five languages or an unusually large budget. His screenplay, written with Don McKellar, sees the eponymous instrument travel over greater distances, while the years separating each segment become shorter. This suggests a musical structure, though Girard said this was not planned and only developed as he and McKellar continued to write.

Girard and McKellar proposed their story and project to various Hollywood companies, but were unwilling to give up creative control, or to limit the number of languages spoken in the film, as U.S. companies requested. As a result, they produced the film with Rhombus Media.

===Filming===
The film is an international co-production, allowing for a larger budget to be accumulated from various sources, making &quot;The Red Violin&quot; one of the most costly Canadian films produced to date. Its final budget was $15 million. Girard and McKellar employed a few crew members from their previous film, &quot;Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould&quot; (1993), including cinematographer Alain Dostie, editor Gaétan Huot and actor Colm Feore.

The co-production also allowed for shooting in Canada, China, and around Europe, including Montreal, Shanghai and Vienna. Girard, McKellar and producer Niv Fichman went location scouting at the beginning of production, visiting Prague and Hong Kong and meeting writers who helped correct foreign-language dialogue. Ultimately, they decided they needed to film in Vienna and Shanghai to depict those cities properly. Lord Frederick Pope&#x27;s estate was Chicheley Hall while his concerts were filmed at the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford University. In Cremona, Italy, Girard visited violin-making schools and met some people who made the instruments, recruiting some as extras.

The most challenging part was securing permission from the government of China to simulate the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, with Fichman travelling to China seven times before the government allowed shooting, which took place only five days later. Shooting in Shanghai took place on Hong Zhen Old Street in the Hongkou District. Hundreds of Chinese police, with guns, closed the streets where shooting took place, due to the 450 extras loudly calling for revolution. Fichman claimed &quot;there was the possibility that we were going to cause a riot&quot;. The action in the Montreal segments was the most complex, which Girard said put the greatest strain on himself and the cast. Filming completed after six months, with shooting on 60 of those days.

===Music===
Girard had no formal musical background; his main experience working with music was as a film director. The film score was written by composer John Corigliano, with every violin solo in the film performed by violinist Joshua Bell. The conductor was Esa-Pekka Salonen. The score is mainly of the Chaconne genre, while the ostensibly Romani music was also actually written by Corigliano. Bell said he was eager to join the film crew, citing his enthusiasm for Corigliano&#x27;s work and his use of form. Corigliano, looking for a romantic musical performance, also referred to Bell as the ideal choice for a musician, calling him &quot;an aristocrat as a violinist&quot;. Girard stated Bell and Corigliano were involved from the outset, and reviewed every version of the screenplay as it was in development.

Much of the score had to be written before principal photography, which is rare in film. Since the violin movements seen in the film had to match Corigliano&#x27;s music, real-life child prodigy Christoph Koncz was cast. However, Girard tied up two musicians to actor Jason Flemyng to help him give his performance as a violinist, the &quot;Octopus&quot; method. After shooting completed, Corigliano finished &quot;Anna&#x27;s theme&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Red Violin&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 2, 1998, where it received standing applause. It opened in the Toronto International Film Festival in September 1998. It was also screened in international film festivals in London and Tokyo.

Odeon Films gave &quot;The Red Violin&quot; a wider release in Canada on 13 November 1998. A limited release followed in the United Kingdom on 9 April 1999. and the film opened in the United States on 11 June 1999, distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment.

==Reception==
===Box office===
By February 1999, &quot;The Red Violin&quot; had grossed $2 million in Canada, surpassing the previous year&#x27;s winner of the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture, &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;. By August 1999, the film grossed $6 million in the United States, which Lions Gate Entertainment declared &quot;a huge success for a specialty film&quot;. It was the distributor&#x27;s most successful Canadian film of the year.

The film finished its run having made US$10 million in the United States. In Canada, it finished with a gross of $3,378,800, making it one of the most seen English Canadian films in national box-office history. It was not a major hit overseas.

===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 41 reviews, and an average rating of 7.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A symphony of storytelling whose lulls lead to satisfying crescendos, &quot;The Red Violin&quot; weaves a centuries-long saga with the journey of a single instrument.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Canadian &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; critic Brian D. Johnson, referencing &quot;Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould&quot;, wrote &quot;&quot;The Red Violin&quot; amounts to more than &quot;Five Short Films About a Fiddle&quot;&quot;, crediting Corigliano&#x27;s music for supplying intensity and the story for making the eponymous violin into its own interesting character. Roger Ebert called the film &quot;heedlessly ambitious&quot;, possessing &quot;the kind of sweep and vision that we identify with elegant features from decades ago&quot;. For &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jonathan Romney wrote that &quot;as flawed movies go, it&#x27;s elegant, entertaining and quite breathtakingly ambitious&quot;. Stephen Holden wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the film did not live up to its score. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B, with Lisa Schwarzbaum writing the fictional violin surpassed all real fiddles in colourful pedigree, and finding the storytelling interesting.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Stephen Hunter assessed the score to be the strongest element of the film, and the story to be intriguing and occasionally &quot;macabre&quot;. Xan Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Independent&quot; review compared the production design unfavourably to a BBC work for students. Laura Kelly of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; called the film &quot;praise-worthy&quot;. In &quot;The San Francisco Gate&quot;, Bob Graham accepted the film&#x27;s ambition and judged Samuel L. Jackson to be cool in the role, in a very different way than in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994). In &quot;National Review&quot;, Jay Nordlinger praised Corigliano&#x27;s soundtrack but criticized Girard&#x27;s direction and film.

In &quot;Queen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;, Maurice Yacowar analyzed the film as presenting the characters of Kaspar, Xian, Peng and Morritz as manifestations of different aspects of Bussotti&#x27;s passions, while the characters of Poussin and bidder Ruselsky wanted to use the instrument to further their own interests. Yacowar concluded the film &quot;explores passions directed outwards&quot;. In the &quot;Canadian Journal of Film Studies&quot;, Brenda Longfellow criticized the film for materialism and depicting &quot;the sacrifice of a woman on the altar of art&quot;. In 2002, readers of &quot;Playback&quot; voted &quot;The Red Violin&quot; the third best Canadian film ever.

In 2001, an industry poll conducted by &quot;Playback&quot; named it the fourth best Canadian film of the preceding 15 years.

===Accolades===
Composer John Corigliano was previously nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for the 1980 film &quot;Altered States&quot; before winning for &quot;The Red Violin&quot;. He won over &quot;American Beauty&quot;, which he had considered the front-runner before the ceremony.

At the Genie Awards, Don McKellar was effectively competing against himself as a screenwriter of both &quot;Last Night&quot; and &quot;The Red Violin&quot;. &quot;The Red Violin&quot; dominated the awards, with eight wins. The film also competed in the 1st Jutra Awards, launched to honour the Cinema of Quebec. Due to the international production and amount of English, numerous English Canadians accepted awards.

&quot;The Red Violin&quot; was also nominated for Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Original Score, but lost to &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;.

==Legacy==
Corigliano adapted his score into a Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (&quot;The Red Violin&quot;), performed in Baltimore, Dallas and Atlanta from 2003 to 2004. In 2005, it was performed at the San Francisco Ballet. He later wrote another adaptation, &quot;The Red Violin: Chaconne for Violin and Orchestra&quot;.

After the film&#x27;s release, the Red Mendelssohn owner Elizabeth Pitcairn also learned its Chaconne, which she called &quot;spooky&quot;, adding &quot;that&#x27;s when the violin can tell its own story; that&#x27;s when it can actually speak&quot;. Pitcairn brought the &quot;Red Violin&quot; to the Prince George Symphony Orchestra in 2012.

<doc id="214793" wikidata="Q5275920" url="?curid=214793" title="Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act">
<text>The Digital Media Consumers&#x27; Rights Act (DMCRA) was a proposed law in the United States that directly challenges portions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and would intensify Federal Trade Commission efforts to mandate proper labeling for copy-protected CDs to ensure consumer protection from deceptive labeling practices. It would also allow manufacturers to innovate in hardware designs and allow consumers to treat CDs as they have historically been able to treat them.

The DMCRA bill was introduced to the United States House of Representatives on January 7, 2003 as by Rick Boucher. The bill was co-sponsored by John Doolittle, Spencer Bachus and Patrick J. Kennedy.

The bill was reintroduced into Congress once again on March 9, 2005 as , the &#x27;Digital Media Consumers Rights Act of 2005&#x27;. The 2005 bill&#x27;s original co-sponsors were John Doolittle, and Joe Barton.

## Some provisions of the bill were incorporated into the FAIR USE Act of 2007.

== Official summary of the bill ==
The authors of the bill have summarized it as follows:

&quot;The Digital Media Consumers’ Rights Act (DMCRA) restores the historical balance in copyright law and ensures the proper labeling of &quot;copy-protected compact discs&quot;.&quot;

&quot;1) Restores the Historic Balance in U.S. Copyright Law&quot;

&quot;Reaffirms Fair Use. The DMCRA provides that it is not a violation of Section 1201 of Title 17 (the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA) to circumvent a technological measure in connection with gaining access to or using a work if the circumvention does not result in an infringement of the copyright in the work. For example, under the bill a user may circumvent an access control on an electronic book he purchased for the purpose of reading it on a different electronic reader. However, if he were to upload the book onto the Internet for distribution to others, he would be liable for both a Section 1201 circumvention violation and for copyright infringement.&quot;

&quot;Reestablishes Betamax Standard. The DMCRA also would specify that it is not a violation of Section 1201 of the DMCA to manufacture, distribute, or make non-infringing use of a hardware or software product capable of enabling significant non-infringing use of a copyrighted work. By re-establishing the principle set forth in Sony v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984), this provision is intended to ensure that consumers will have access to hardware and software products by which to engage in the activities authorized by the legislation. For example, a blind person could develop a means to listen in audio form to an electronic book which had been purchased in text form.&quot;

&quot;Restores Valid Scientific Research. The bill amends the DMCA to permit researchers to produce the software tools necessary to carry out &quot;scientific research into technological protection measures.&quot; Current law allows circumvention for encryption research under specified circumstances. The bill will enable circumvention for research on technological measures other than encryption. The bill also permits a researcher to develop the tools necessary for such circumvention.&quot;

&quot;2) Ensures Proper Labeling of &quot;Copy-Protected Compact Discs&quot;&quot;

&quot;Major record companies have begun adding technology to CDs that would block people from making copies. In many cases the technology has also prevented playback on computers, DVD players, or even some standard CD players. It has become apparent that even the limited introduction of these discs into the United States market has caused consumer and increased burdens on retailers and manufacturers. Consumers are accustomed to the functionality of industry standard Compact Discs and should be aware of any reduced playability or recording functionality of non-standard &quot;copy-protected compact discs&quot; before they make the decision to purchase such items. For that reason, the bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that adequate labeling occurs for the benefit of consumers.&quot;

<doc id="214794" wikidata="Q835753" url="?curid=214794" title="Show No Mercy">
<text>Show No Mercy is the debut studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records. Brian Slagel signed the band to the label after watching them perform an Iron Maiden cover. The band self-financed their full-length debut, combining the savings of vocalist Tom Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from guitarist Kerry King&#x27;s father. Touring extensively promoting the album, the band brought close friends and family members along the trip, who helped backstage with lighting and sound.

Although the album was criticized for its poor production quality, it became Metal Blade&#x27;s highest-selling release, producing the songs &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, &quot;Die by the Sword&quot; and &quot;Black Magic&quot;, which were played at Slayer&#x27;s live shows regularly.

==Recording==

Slayer was the opening act for Bitch at the Woodstock Club in Los Angeles, performing eight songs—six being covers. While performing an Iron Maiden cover, the band was spotted by Brian Slagel, a former music journalist who had recently founded Metal Blade Records. Slagel met with the band backstage and asked if they would like to be featured on the label&#x27;s upcoming &quot;Metal Massacre III&quot; compilation; the band agreed. The band&#x27;s appearance on the compilation created underground buzz, which led to Slagel signing the band with Metal Blade Records. Recorded in Los Angeles, &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; was financed by vocalist Tom Araya, who used his earnings as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from guitarist Kerry King&#x27;s father. King says the album is &quot;fuckin&#x27; Iron Maiden here and there&quot;. Vocalist Araya asserts Venom, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Mercyful Fate were big influences on the record, as guitarist King was into the Satanic image.

Lombardo said in 2015 that he was not pleased with how the drums were recorded. The engineer at the time had difficulties getting the right mix between the toms and the cymbals because they were too loud. The solution was to dampen the cymbals with towels and record the toms and cymbals separately. As such, Lombardo called &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; his least favorite Slayer album, although he emphasized that the songs were great, just not his performance.

Gene Hoglan, later known as the drummer for bands like Dark Angel and Death, provided backing vocals on the song &quot;Evil Has No Boundaries&quot;. &quot;Back at the time it was Jeff Hanneman] and Kerry doing the &#x27;Evil!&#x27; You know, it didn&#x27;t sound too heavy and I mentioned to like Tom or Jeff or somebody like, &#x27;You know you guys should consider...maybe consider doing like big gang vocals on that, make it sound evil like demons and stuff,&#x27; and they were like &#x27;Good idea.&#x27; But how about now, we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and now everybody jumped up and yelled &#x27;EVIL!!!&#x27; So I was like &#x27;Cool&#x27; because I&#x27;m like, &#x27;I wanna sing on this record somehow, that&#x27;s how I can do it,&#x27; totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, &#x27;Fuck we have the time, let&#x27;s do it.&#x27; So I was like &#x27;Yeah, I got to sing on it!&#x27;&quot; On recording the drums, Slagel wanted drummer Dave Lombardo to play without using cymbals due to the amount of noise they made, as he was unsure if he could siphon the noise out, which he eventually did.

The band used Satanic themes in both lyrics and live performances to gain notice among the metal community and &quot;to fuck with people&quot;. The back cover featured &#x27;side 666&#x27; and inverted crosses, with Hanneman playing his guitar. Due to the imagery and lyrical content, Slayer received mail from the Parents Music Resource Center telling the band to stop releasing records. Araya comments, &quot;Back then you had that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart. When in actuality you&#x27;re trying to create an image. You&#x27;re trying to scare people on purpose.&quot; The album produced the songs &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, &quot;Die by the Sword&quot;, and &quot;Black Magic&quot;, which were played at Slayer&#x27;s live shows regularly.

==Touring==
The band went on their first tour of the United States after the album&#x27;s release—Slagel gave the band a list of addresses and contact numbers of the venues. Araya was still working at the hospital, and called the members saying, &quot;Today&#x27;s the day. Are we gonna do this?&quot; The band knew if they did not tour now, they never would. So they set out taking Araya&#x27;s Camaro and U-Haul. During the first leg of the tour, Slayer had no manager; Doug Goodman, who had met the band when he was first in line for their first show in Northern California (opening for Lȧȧz Rockit) took a vacation from his job at a grocery store to help out on the tour, eventually becoming the band&#x27;s &quot;tour guide&quot;. Goodman now tour manages acts such as Green Day and Beck.

Kevin Reed, a friend of the band, set up the drums and lighting when touring with the band. Reed&#x27;s father, Lawrence R. Reed, drew the album cover, which depicts Baphomet with a sword on the album&#x27;s cover. Araya&#x27;s younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the &quot;essentials&quot; such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, &quot;We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, &#x27;So, where&#x27;s the money?&#x27; And we were like, &#x27;What money?&#x27; At that time, we didn&#x27;t realize that you had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest.&quot;

The band performed in a hotel in Winnipeg, where the basement was the club. Araya comments, &quot;We stayed there for like four or five days, I think. We saw Verbal Abuse play there. Then we played a place in Boston called the Lizard Lounge. In fact, a car had run into the front of the building, and it was all boarded up, but we still played there.&quot; When one of the guitarists broke a string Araya would hand them the bass, Hanneman stating, &quot;We&#x27;d argue about it, too—like, &#x27;I wanna play bass for a while!&#x27;&quot;

==Reception==
Although the band did not have enough time to sell any records while touring, the album became Metal Blade Records&#x27; highest selling release. Five thousand copies was the label&#x27;s average. &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; went on to sell between 15,500 and 20,000 copies in the United States; it also went on to sell more than 15,000 overseas, as Metal Blade had worldwide rights. The success of the album led to Slagel wanting the band to release a new record and an extended play.

&quot;Show No Mercy&quot; was met with polarized opinions and reviews mostly leaning on the negative side when it was issued, but in some recent reviews it came to be considered a classic album. In 1984, Dave Dickson of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; crushed the album defining it &quot;pure, unadulterated junk&quot;, while Bernard Doe of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; called the record &quot;one of the heaviest, fastest, most awesome albums of all time!&quot; The German magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; gave &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; a positive review, which remarked how Slayer were &quot;actually the hardest and fastest&quot; in comparison with their contemporaries Metallica and Exciter, and defined their music as &quot;heavy metal punk.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Jeremy Ulrey had mixed feelings towards the album, saying that even though the musicianship and production were &quot;amateurish&quot; compared to Slayer&#x27;s later releases, the album remains a &quot;solid, if inessential, part of the Slayer legacy&quot;. Users voted 4/5 at AllMusic. Sputnikmusic staff member Hernan M. Campbell described the album as &quot;fast, heavy, and mean, inducing an inescapable atmosphere of utter atrocity.&quot; He noted that the &quot;lo-fi&quot; production quality gives the album a &quot;classic&quot; feeling.

Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; for being as &quot;seminal&quot; as Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; &quot;in defining state-of-the-art speed metal&quot; and for inspiring new bands to &quot;expand the limits of metal.&quot; However, he &quot;found the record stiff and one dimensional&quot;, with &quot;its style laid down in stifling arrangements.&quot; Fenriz, drummer for Darkthrone, cited &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; as the inspiration for the band&#x27;s &quot;current style of fusing NWOBHM with black metal&quot;. Terry Butler of Obituary and former member of Death defined the album as &quot;the blueprint for the beginning of death metal&quot; and said: &quot;When I heard &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; I wanted to play that way...It was a whole new level of mayhem. I wanted to play that way&quot;.

System of a Down&#x27;s Daron Malakian has praised &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; as an influential album that helped shape him as a person and artist. He claimed he introduced heavy metal to the people of Iraq with this album when he lived there at age 14.

&quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included the album cover on their list of &quot;50 most hilariously ugly rock and metal album covers ever&quot;.

<doc id="214795" wikidata="Q841066" url="?curid=214795" title="Hell Awaits">
<text>Hell Awaits is the second studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released on April 8, 1985, by Metal Blade Records. The band&#x27;s 1983 debut &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; became Metal Blade Records&#x27; highest-selling release, and as a result, producer Brian Slagel desired to release a second Slayer album. To that end, Slagel financed a recording budget (&quot;Show No Mercy&quot; was paid for by band members) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio.

The lyrical themes on &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; include hell and Satan, as with their debut; the intro of the title track played backwards reveals the repeated phrase &quot;join us&quot;. Musically, the album features the band&#x27;s most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous releases, and according to Kerry King, he and Jeff Hanneman were very into Mercyful Fate at the time, which then led to the longer and more progressive songs. Defined as &quot;influential to future extreme metal acts&quot;, the most popular songs from &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; were re-recorded by various underground metal bands and have appeared on several tribute albums.

==Recording==
Slayer&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;, became Metal Blade Records&#x27; highest selling release, selling 40,000 copies worldwide; the success led producer Brian Slagel to want to record another album with them. Slagel hired producer Ron Fair, who worked for Chrysalis Records, and had seen the band perform live and enjoyed their performance. On seeing Slayer in the studio, Fair stated, &quot;Wow, these guys are really angry,&quot; as he was inexperienced working with heavy metal musicians. Slagel financed the album, in stark contrast to &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;, which was financed by singer Tom Araya, who used his earnings as a respiratory therapist, and a loan from guitarist Kerry King&#x27;s father.
The budget organized by Slagel allowed for professional assistance. Bernie Grundman provided audio mastering, Eddy Schreyer worked on remastering, and Bill Metoyer, who worked on the band&#x27;s earlier release &quot;Haunting the Chapel&quot;, acted as sound engineer. The recording featured audio effects such as the intro to &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;, a reversed recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating &quot;Join us&quot;, ending with &quot;Welcome back&quot;. Still, Araya later stated the album had poor production quality: &quot;Nowadays, production-wise, it&#x27;s so under par. But for what it was at the time, those are amazing records to me. I guess we could go in and redo it. But why ruin it?&quot;

Drummer Dave Lombardo, on the other hand, asserts the album was professionally done compared to &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have to overdub the cymbals, and we had a really good engineer.&quot; Lombardo&#x27;s favorite song is &quot;At Dawn They Sleep&quot;, &quot;because it was kind of slow and grungy, but then it had that double-bass part at the end.&quot; While recording the track, neither guitarists King, nor Jeff Hanneman who wrote the lyrics, were in the studio—only Araya and Slagel. On reading the lyrics, which featured a misspelled word, Araya sang it as it was spelled, although it&#x27;s not a real word. The song &quot;Hardening of the Arteries&quot; on the album ends with a very similar section that makes up the beginning of the song &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; and is also one of the only Slayer songs to fade out on a continuous riff.

The album&#x27;s cover art was done by Albert Cuellar. Araya told The Quietus that the art was put together &quot;overnight&quot;, with the scene of &quot;skeletal demon beasts&quot; fighting in hell directly resembling a scene of a 1977 issue of the comic &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. It went unnoticed until 2011 when a blog post uploaded PDFs of the story &quot;Approaching Centauri&quot; drawn by Jean Giraud.

==Touring==
To promote &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;, Slayer embarked on the Combat Tour with Venom and Exodus. Exodus guitarist Gary Holt commented, &quot;We immediately bonded with the Slayer guys. It was two bands of friends playing with one band of heroes, you know? We were just star-struck.&quot;

Inside Venom&#x27;s tour bus (the first time Slayer had been in one) the band members got drunk with Venom, while listening to &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;. Araya entered the bus &quot;hammered out of his mind&quot;, according to Lombardo, saying &quot;I gotta take a piss! Where&#x27;s the bathroom in this thing?&quot; Venom singer Conrad &quot;Cronos&quot; Lant responded, saying &quot;Right here—right here in my mouth!&quot; Araya took it almost literally and urinated on his hair. Cronos got up and punched him in the face, the two blamed each other all night, and Araya continued the tour with a black eye. Araya will not discuss the incident other than saying that he was drunk and it was a very disrespectful thing to do.

==Reception==

Although it did not enter any charts, &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; was hailed upon its release as Slayer&#x27;s most progressive recording, featuring a much darker thrash-oriented style, with unusual arrangements such as varying tempos, and dissonant nuances that &quot;paved the way to a wholly distinctive sound all their own&quot;, according to AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia. Rivadavia awarded the album four out of five stars, saying that it was &quot;incredibly ahead of its time&quot; and referred to it as &quot;a mandatory item in the band&#x27;s remarkable discography&quot;. It has sold over 1,000,000 records worldwide according to Brian Slagel.

In the book &quot;Legends of Rock Guitar&quot;, &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; was defined as &quot;a psychotic exploration into the depths of Satanism and physical torture&quot;. The book, a chronology of the great guitarists of rock which includes both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, observed the band&#x27;s evolution in comparison with their previous album, &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;, saying, &quot;The musicianship is improved, as is lead singer Tom Araya&#x27;s voice, making the band sound less like hacks and more like metal fiends. The sludgy riffs, which were pure [Black] Sabbath, are offset by some of King&#x27;s and Hanneman&#x27;s faster solos, giving Slayer entrée into the speed metal realm.&quot;

==Influence==
Musicians such as singer Phil Anselmo and drummer Gene Hoglan cite &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; as an influence. Anselmo—known for his work with Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual—explained in an interview with D. X. Ferris, author of the book about the album &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, that &quot;&quot;Hell Awaits&quot; just holds the entire thing. Every bit of everything to do with heavy music. [Slayer] are gods, the best band from California, for sure.&quot; Norwegian musician Frode Sivertsen (also known as &quot;E. N. Death&quot;), former member of the black metal band Gehenna, says the song &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; and Slayer&#x27;s music in general has influenced him as a musician, ranking the album in his top five. Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Damageplan picked &quot;At Dawn They Sleep&quot; among his 12 Favorite Tunes in the March 1993 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, stating that Slayer taught him &quot;how to play with guts and aggression&quot;.

Defined as &quot;influential to future extreme metal acts&quot;, the most popular songs from &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; were re-recorded by various underground metal bands, and have appeared in several tribute albums, such as &quot;Slatanic Slaughter II&quot; and &quot;Gateway to Hell 1 &amp; 2&quot;. The song &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; has been covered by Cradle of Filth, Incantation, Earth Crisis, and Mr Bungle, &quot;Kill Again&quot; by Angelcorpse, &quot;Praise of Death&quot; by Sinister, &quot;At Dawn They Sleep&quot; by Six Feet Under, and &quot;Necrophiliac&quot; by Sadistic Intent, Sinister, Benediction and Fleshcrawl.

<text>Lizzie Andrew Borden (July 19, 1860 – June 1, 1927) was an American woman who was tried and acquitted of the August 4, 1892, axe murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River, Massachusetts. No one else was charged in the murders, and, despite ostracism from other residents, Borden spent the remainder of her life in Fall River. She died of pneumonia at the age of 66, just days before the death of her older sister, Emma.

The Borden murders and trial received widespread publicity in the United States, and have remained a topic in American popular culture depicted in numerous films, theatrical productions, literary works, and folk rhymes around the Fall River area.

==Early life==

Lizzie Andrew Borden was born on July 19, 1860, in Fall River, Massachusetts, to Sarah Anthony Borden (née Morse; 1823–1863) and Andrew Jackson Borden (1822–1892). Her father, who was of English and Welsh descent, grew up in very modest surroundings and struggled financially as a young man, despite being the descendant of wealthy and influential local residents. Andrew eventually prospered in the manufacture and sale of furniture and caskets, then became a successful property developer. He was a director of several textile mills and owned considerable commercial property. He was also president of the Union Savings Bank and a director of the Durfee Safe Deposit and Trust Co. At the time of his murder, his estate was valued at $300,000 ($10,000,000 in 2024).

Despite his wealth, Andrew was known for his frugality. For instance, the Borden residence lacked indoor plumbing even though it was a common feature for the wealthy at that time. The house stood in an affluent area, but the wealthiest residents of Fall River, including Andrew&#x27;s cousins, generally lived in the more fashionable neighborhood, The Hill, which was farther from the industrial areas of the city.

Lizzie and her older sister, Emma Lenora Borden (1851–1927), had a relatively religious upbringing and attended Central Congregational Church. As a young woman, Lizzie was very involved in church activities, including teaching Sunday school to children of recent immigrants to the United States. She was involved in religious organizations, such as the Christian Endeavor Society, for which she served as secretary-treasurer, and contemporary social movements, such as the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. She was also a member of the Ladies&#x27; Fruit and Flower Mission.

Three years after the death of Lizzie&#x27;s mother, Andrew married Abby Durfee Gray (1828–1892). Lizzie later stated that she called her stepmother &quot;Mrs. Borden&quot; and demurred on whether they had a cordial relationship; she believed that Abby had married her father for his wealth. Bridget Sullivan (whom they called Maggie), the Bordens&#x27; 25-year-old live-in maid, who had immigrated to the U.S. from Ireland, testified that Lizzie and Emma rarely ate meals with their parents. In May 1892, Andrew killed multiple pigeons in his barn with a hatchet, believing they were attracting local children to hunt them. Lizzie had recently built a roost for the pigeons, and it has been commonly recounted that she was upset over his killing of them, though the veracity of this has been disputed. A family argument in July 1892 prompted both sisters to take extended vacations in New Bedford. After returning to Fall River, a week before the murders, Lizzie chose to stay in a local rooming house for four days before returning to the Borden residence.

Tension had been growing within the Borden family in the months before the murders, especially over Andrew&#x27;s gifts of real estate to various branches of Abby&#x27;s family. After their stepmother&#x27;s sister received a house, the sisters demanded and received a rental property, the home they had lived in until their mother died, which they purchased from their father for $1. A few weeks before the murders, they sold the property back to their father for $5,000 ($170,993 in 2023). The night before the murders, John Vinnicum Morse, Lizzie and Emma&#x27;s maternal uncle, visited and was invited to stay for a few days to discuss business matters with Andrew, leading to speculation that their conversation, particularly about property transfer, may have aggravated an already tense situation.

For several days before the murders, the entire household had been violently ill. A family friend later speculated that mutton left on the stove to use in meals over several days was the cause. Abby had feared poison, given that Andrew had not been a popular man in Fall River.

==Murders of Andrew and Abby==
===Thursday, August 4, 1892===

Morse arrived in the evening of August 3 and slept in the guest room that night. After breakfast the next morning, at which Andrew, Abby, Morse, and Sullivan were present, Andrew and Morse went to the sitting room, where they chatted for nearly an hour. Morse left around 8:48 am to buy a pair of oxen and visit his niece in Fall River, planning to return to the Borden home for lunch at noon. Andrew left for his morning walk sometime after 9 am.

Although the cleaning of the guest room was one of Lizzie and Emma&#x27;s regular chores, Abby went upstairs sometime between 9:00 am and 10:30 am to make the bed. According to the forensic investigation, Abby was facing her killer at the time of the attack. She was first struck on the side of the head with a hatchet, which cut her just above the ear, causing her to turn and fall face down on the floor, creating contusions on her nose and forehead. Her killer then struck her multiple times, delivering seventeen more direct hits to the back of her head, killing her.

When Andrew returned at around 10:30 am, his key failed to open the door, so he knocked. Sullivan went to unlock the door; finding it jammed, she uttered a curse. She would later testify that she heard Lizzie laughing immediately after this; she did not see Lizzie, but stated that the laughter was coming from the top of the stairs. This was considered significant as Abby was already dead by this time, and her body would have been visible to anyone on the home&#x27;s second floor. Lizzie later denied being upstairs and testified that her father had asked her where Abby was, to which she replied that a messenger had delivered Abby a summons to visit a sick friend.

Sullivan stated that she had then removed Andrew&#x27;s boots and helped him into his slippers before he lay down on the sofa for a nap, a detail contradicted by the crime-scene photos, which show Andrew wearing boots. She testified that she was in her third-floor room, resting from cleaning windows, when just before 11:10 am she heard Lizzie call from downstairs, &quot;Maggie, come quick! Father&#x27;s dead. Somebody came in and killed him.&quot; 

Andrew was slumped on a couch in the downstairs sitting room, struck ten or eleven times with a hatchet-like weapon. One of his eyes had been split cleanly in two, suggesting that he had been asleep when attacked. His still-bleeding wounds suggested a very recent attack. Dr. Bowen, the family&#x27;s physician, arrived from his home across the street and pronounced both victims dead. Detectives estimated that Andrew&#x27;s death had occurred at approximately 11:00 am.

===Investigation===
Lizzie&#x27;s initial answers to the police officers&#x27; questions were at times strange and contradictory. Initially she reported hearing a groan, or a scraping noise or a distress call, before entering the house. Two hours later she told police she had heard nothing and entered the house not realizing that anything was wrong. When asked where her stepmother was, she recounted Abby receiving a note asking her to visit a sick friend. She also stated that she thought Abby had returned and asked if someone could go upstairs and look for her. Sullivan and a neighbor, Mrs. Churchill, were half-way up the stairs, their eyes level with the floor, when they looked into the guest room and saw Abby lying face down on the floor.

Most of the officers who interviewed Lizzie reported that they disliked her &quot;attitude&quot;; some said she was too calm and poised. Despite her behavior and changing alibis, she was not checked for bloodstains. Police did search her room, but it was a cursory inspection; at the trial they admitted to not doing a proper search because Lizzie was not feeling well. They were subsequently criticized for their lack of diligence.

In the basement, police found two hatchets, two axes, and a hatchet-head with a broken handle. The hatchet-head was suspected of being the murder weapon as the break in the handle appeared fresh and the ash and dust on the head, unlike that on the other bladed tools, appeared to have been deliberately applied to make it look as if it had been in the basement for some time. However, none of these tools were removed from the house. Because of the mysterious illness that had stricken the household before the murders, the family&#x27;s milk and the victims&#x27; stomachs (removed during autopsies performed in the Borden dining room) were tested for poison; none was found. Residents suspected Lizzie of purchasing &quot;hydrocyanic acid in a diluted form&quot; from the local druggist. Her defense was that she inquired about using the acid to clean her furs, despite the local medical examiner&#x27;s testimony that it did not have antiseptic properties.

Lizzie and Emma&#x27;s friend, Alice Russell, decided to stay with the sisters the night following the murders while Morse spent the night in the attic guest room, contrary to later accounts that he slept in the murder-site guest room. Police were stationed around the house on the night of August 4, during which an officer said he had seen Lizzie enter the cellar with Russell, carrying a kerosene lamp and a slop pail. He stated he saw both women exit the cellar, after which Lizzie returned alone; though he was unable to see what she was doing, he stated it appeared she was bent over the sink.

On August 5, Morse left the Borden residence and was mobbed by hundreds of people; police had to escort him back to the house. The following day, police conducted a more thorough search of the house, inspecting the sisters&#x27; clothing and confiscating the broken-handled hatchet head. That evening a police officer and the mayor visited the house, and Lizzie was informed that she was a suspect in the murders. The next morning, Russell entered the kitchen to find Borden tearing up a dress. She explained that she was planning to put it on the fire because it was covered in paint. It was never determined whether it was the dress she had been wearing on the day of the murders.

===Inquest===
Lizzie appeared at the inquest hearing on August 8. Her request to have her family attorney present was refused under a state statute providing that an inquest must be held in private. She had been prescribed regular doses of morphine to calm her nerves, and it is possible that her testimony was affected by this. Her behavior was erratic, and she often refused to answer a question even if the answer would be beneficial to her. She often contradicted herself and provided alternating accounts of the morning in question, such as saying she was in the kitchen reading a magazine when her father arrived home, then saying she was in the dining room doing some ironing, and then saying she was coming down the stairs.

The district attorney was very aggressive and confrontational. On August 11, Lizzie was served with a warrant of arrest and jailed. The inquest testimony, the basis for the modern debate regarding Lizzie&#x27;s guilt or innocence, was later ruled inadmissible at her trial in June 1893. Contemporaneous newspaper articles noted that Lizzie possessed a &quot;stolid demeanor&quot; and &quot;bit her lips, flushed, and bent toward attorney Adams;&quot; it was also reported that the testimony provided in the inquest had &quot;caused a change of opinion among her friends who have heretofore strongly maintained her innocence.&quot; The inquest received significant press attention nationwide, including an extensive three-page write-up in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. A grand jury began hearing evidence on November 7, and Borden was indicted on December 2.

===Trial and acquittal===

Lizzie&#x27;s trial took place in New Bedford starting on June 5, 1893. Prosecuting attorneys were Hosea M. Knowlton and future United States Supreme Court Justice William H. Moody; defending were Andrew V. Jennings, Melvin O. Adams, and former Massachusetts governor George D. Robinson. 

Five days before the trial&#x27;s commencement, on June 1, another axe-murder occurred in Fall River. This time the victim was Bertha Manchester, who was found hacked to death in her kitchen. The similarities between the Manchester and Borden murders were striking and noted by jurors. Jose Correa de Mello, a Portuguese immigrant, was later convicted of Manchester&#x27;s murder in 1894, and was determined not to have been in the vicinity of Fall River at the time of the Borden murders.

A prominent point of discussion in the trial, and press coverage of it, was the hatchet-head found in the basement, which was not convincingly demonstrated by the prosecution to be the murder weapon. Prosecutors argued that the killer had removed the handle because it would have been covered in blood. One officer testified that a hatchet handle was found near the hatchet-head, but another officer contradicted this. Though no bloody clothing was found at the scene, Russell testified that on August 8, 1892, she had witnessed Lizzie burn a dress in the kitchen stove, saying it had been ruined when she brushed against wet paint. During the course of the trial, the defense never attempted to challenge this statement.
Lizzie&#x27;s presence at the home was also a point of dispute during the trial; according to testimony, Sullivan entered the second floor at around 10:58 am and left Lizzie and her father downstairs. Lizzie told several people that at this time, she went into the barn and was not in the house for &quot;twenty minutes or possibly a half an hour&quot;. Hyman Lubinsky testified for the defense that he saw Lizzie leaving the barn at 11:03 am and Charles Gardner confirmed the time. At 11:10 am, Lizzie called Sullivan downstairs, told her Andrew had been murdered and ordered her not to enter the room; instead, Lizzie sent her to get a doctor.

Both victims&#x27; heads had been removed during autopsy, and the skulls were admitted as evidence during the trial and presented on June 5, 1893. Upon seeing them in the courtroom, Lizzie fainted. Evidence was excluded that she had sought to purchase prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide), purportedly for cleaning a sealskin cloak, from the local druggist on the day before the murders. The judge ruled that the incident was too remote in time to have any connection.

The presiding Associate Justice, Justin Dewey, who had been appointed by Robinson when he was governor, delivered a lengthy summary that supported the defense as his charge to the jury before it was sent to deliberate on June 20, 1893. After an hour and a half of deliberation, the jury acquitted Lizzie Borden of the murders. Upon exiting the courthouse, she told reporters she was &quot;the happiest woman in the world&quot;.

The trial has been compared to the later trials of Bruno Hauptmann, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and O.J. Simpson, as a landmark in publicity and public interest in the history of American legal proceedings.

===Theories regarding perpetrators===

====Lizzie Borden====
Although acquitted at trial, Lizzie remained the prime suspect in her father&#x27;s and stepmother&#x27;s murders. Writer Victoria Lincoln proposed in 1967 that she might have committed the murders while in a fugue state. Another prominent suggestion was that she was physically and sexually abused by her father, which drove her to kill him. There is little evidence to support this, but incest is not a topic that would have been discussed at the time, and the methods for collecting physical evidence would have been quite different in 1892. This belief was intimated in local papers at the time of the murders, and was revisited by scholar Marcia Carlisle in a 1992 essay.

Mystery author Evan Hunter, better known as Ed McBain, in his 1984 novel &quot;Lizzie&quot;, suggested that Lizzie committed the murders after being caught in a tryst with Sullivan. McBain elaborated on his speculation in a 1999 interview, speculating that Abby had caught the two together and had reacted with horror and disgust, and that Lizzie had killed Abby with a candlestick. She made a confession to Andrew when he returned home but killed him in a rage with a hatchet when he reacted exactly as Abby had. He further speculated that Sullivan disposed of the hatchet somewhere afterwards.

In her later years, Lizzie was rumored to be a lesbian, but there was no such speculation about Sullivan, who later married a man she met while working as a maid in Butte, Montana. Sullivan died in Butte in 1948. Allegedly, she gave a death-bed confession to her sister in which she stated that she had changed her testimony on the stand to protect Lizzie.

====John Morse====
Another significant suspect is John Morse, Lizzie&#x27;s maternal uncle, who rarely met with the family after his sister died but had slept in the house the night before the murders; according to law enforcement, he had provided an &quot;absurdly perfect and over-detailed alibi for the death of Abby Borden&quot;. Morse was considered a suspect by police for a period.

====&quot;William Borden&quot;====
A man named William Borden, suspected to be Andrew&#x27;s illegitimate son, was noted as a possible suspect by author Arnold Brown, who surmised that William had tried and failed to extort money from his alleged father. Author Leonard Rebello, after extensive research on William, proved he was not Andrew&#x27;s son.

====Emma Borden====
Although Emma had an alibi at Fairhaven, about from Fall River, crime writer Frank Spiering proposed in his 1984 book &quot;Lizzie&quot; that she might have secretly visited the residence to kill her parents before returning to Fairhaven in time to receive the telegram informing her of the murders.

==Later life==
After the trial, the Borden sisters moved into a large, modern house in The Hill neighborhood in Fall River. Around this time, Lizzie began using the name Lizbeth A. Borden. At their new house, which Lizbeth dubbed &quot;Maplecroft&quot;, they had a staff that included live-in maids, a housekeeper and a coachman. Because Abby was ruled to have died before Andrew, her estate went first to Andrew and then, at his death, passed to his daughters as part of his estate. A considerable settlement, however, was paid to settle claims by Abby&#x27;s family.

Despite the acquittal, Lizzie was ostracized by Fall River society. Her name was again brought into the public eye when she was accused of shoplifting in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1897. In 1905, shortly after an argument over a party that Lizbeth had given for actress Nance O&#x27;Neil, Emma moved out of the house and never saw her sister again.

==Death==
Lizzie was ill in her last year following the removal of her gallbladder; she died of pneumonia on June 1, 1927, in Fall River at age 66. Funeral details were not published and few attended. Nine days later, Emma died from chronic nephritis in a nursing home in Newmarket, New Hampshire, having moved to this location in 1923 both for health reasons and to avoid renewed attention following the publication of another book about the murders. The Borden sisters, neither of whom had ever married, were buried side by side in the family plot in Oak Grove Cemetery.

At the time of her death, Borden was worth over $250,000 (). She owned a house on the corner of French Street and Belmont Street, several office buildings, shares in several utilities, two cars and a large amount of jewelry. She left $30,000 () to the Fall River Animal Rescue League and $500 ($ in ) in trust for perpetual care of her father&#x27;s grave. Her closest friend and a cousin each received $6,000 ($ today)—substantial sums at the time of the estate&#x27;s distribution in 1927—and numerous friends and family members each received between $1,000 ($ in ) and $5,000 ($ in ).

==In culture==
Scholar Ann Schofield notes that &quot;Borden&#x27;s story has tended to take one or the other of two fictional forms: the tragic romance and the feminist quest ...  As the story of Lizzie Borden has been created and re-created through rhyme and fiction it has taken on the qualities of a popular American myth or legend that effectively links the present to the past.&quot;

The Borden house became a museum, and operates a bed and breakfast with 1890s styling. Pieces of evidence used in the trial, including the hatchet-head, are preserved at the Fall River Historical Society.

===Folk rhyme===
The case was memorialized in a popular skipping-rope rhyme, sung to the tune of the then-popular song &quot;Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay.&quot;

Folklore says that the rhyme was made up by an anonymous writer as a tune to sell newspapers. Others attribute it to the ubiquitous, but anonymous, &quot;Mother Goose&quot;.

In reality, Lizzie&#x27;s stepmother suffered eighteen or 19 blows; her father suffered eleven blows.

The rhyme has a less well-known second verse:

===Depictions===

Lizzie Borden has been depicted in music, radio, film, theater, and television, often in association with the murders of which she was acquitted.

Among the earlier portrayals on stage was John Colton and Carleton Miles&#x27;s 1933 play &quot;Nine Pine Street&quot;, in which Lillian Gish played Effie Holden, a character who is based on Borden. The play was not a success and ran for only twenty-eight performances. In 1947 Lillian de la Torre wrote a one-act play, &quot;Goodbye, Miss Lizzie Borden&quot;.

Other retellings include &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot;, a 1952 Broadway musical with a number titled &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot;, which depicts the crimes, as well as Agnes de Mille&#x27;s ballet &quot;Fall River Legend&quot; (1948) and the Jack Beeson opera &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot; (1965), both works being based on Borden and the murders of her father and stepmother. Other plays based on Borden include &quot;Blood Relations&quot; (1980), a Canadian production written by Sharon Pollock that recounts events leading up to the murders, which was made into a television movie in Calgary. &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot;, another musical adaptation, was also made starring Tony nominee Alison Fraser.

A March 24, 1957, episode of &quot;Omnibus&quot; presented two different adaptations of the Lizzie Borden story: the first a play, &quot;The Trial of Lizzie Borden&quot;, with Katharine Bard as Lizzie; the second a production of the &quot;Fall River Legend&quot; ballet with Nora Kaye as &quot;The Accused&quot;. In 1959, &quot;The Legend of Lizzie&quot; by Reginald Lawrence attracted praise for Anne Meacham in the title role, but still closed after just two performances.

A January 21, 1956, episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, entitled “The Older Sister”, presents a fictionalized account, occurring one year after the murders, where Lizzie and Emma have a conversation revealing who the murderer was. 

The folk singing group The Chad Mitchell Trio recorded a black comedy song, &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot; by Michael Brown, for their live 1961 album &quot;Mighty Day on Campus&quot;. Released as a single, it reached 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1962.

ABC commissioned &quot;The Legend of Lizzie Borden&quot; (1975), a television film starring Elizabeth Montgomery as Lizzie Borden, Katherine Helmond as Emma Borden, and Fionnula Flanagan as Bridget Sullivan; it was later discovered after Montgomery died that she and Borden were in fact sixth cousins once removed, both descending from 17th century Massachusetts resident John Luther. Rhonda McClure, the genealogist who documented the Montgomery-Borden connection, said: &quot;I wonder how Elizabeth would have felt if she knew she was playing her own cousin.&quot;

&quot;Lizzie: The Musical&quot; premiered in 2009, with book by Tim Maner, music by Steven Cheslik-deMeyer and Alan Stevens Hewitt, and lyrics by Cheslik-deMeyer and Maner. The musical had its origins in a 1990 song cycle, and focuses on a secret romance between Borden and her neighbour, Alice, as well as her abuse at home.

Lifetime produced &quot;Lizzie Borden Took an Ax&quot; (2014), a speculative television film with Christina Ricci portraying Borden, which was followed by &quot;The Lizzie Borden Chronicles&quot; (2015)—a limited series and a sequel to the television film, which presents a fictionalized account of Borden&#x27;s life after the trial. A feature film, &quot;Lizzie&quot; (2018), with Chloë Sevigny as Borden and Kristen Stewart as Bridget Sullivan, depicts a lesbian tryst between Borden and Sullivan, which leads to the murders.

The events of the murders and the trial, with actors portraying the people who were involved in them, have been reenacted on a number of documentary programs. In 1936, the radio program &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; broadcast a 15 minute dramatization titled &quot;The Lizzie Borden Case&quot;, which presented a possible scenario in which the murders were committed during a botched robbery attempt by a tramp, who then escaped. Television recreations have included episodes of &quot;Biography&quot;, &quot;Second Verdict&quot;, &quot;History&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Case Reopened&quot; (1999), and &quot;Mysteries Decoded&quot; (2019). The Lizzie Borden case was partly dramatized on an episode of the 2022 BBC Radio podcast series &quot;Lucy Worsley&#x27;s Lady Killers&quot;.

Lizzy Borden, an American heavy metal band, is named after her. The American film director Lizzie Borden also took her name from the historical figure.

===In literature===
*In Agatha Christie&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, the main character Miss Marple says that murder &quot;was not proven in the case of Madeleine Smith and Lizzie was acquittedbut many people believe both of those women were guilty.&quot; Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, &quot;After the Funeral&quot;, and &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot; also reference the case. 
*&quot;The Fall River Axe Murders&quot;, a short story by Angela Carter, was published in her collection &quot;Black Venus&quot; (1985). &quot;Lizzie&#x27;s Tiger&quot;, also by Carter, depicts Borden, imagined as a four-year-old, having an extraordinary encounter at the circus. The story was published posthumously in 1993 in her collection &quot;American Ghosts and Old World Wonders&quot;.
*&quot;Miss Lizzie&quot;, a 1989 novel by Walter Satterthwait, takes place thirty years after the murders and recounts an unlikely friendship between Borden and a child, and the suspicions that arise from a murder.
* &quot;Maplecroft: The Borden Dispatches&quot;, a 2014 novel by Cherie Priest. The first in a series of novels, where Priest adds elements of Lovecraftian horror to the tale of Lizzie Borden. 
*&quot;See What I Have Done&quot;, 2017 novel by Australian writer Sarah Schmidt, tells the story of the murders and their aftermath from the points of view of Lizzie and Emma Borden, Bridget Sullivan, and an imagined stranger. It won the MUD Literary Prize for a debut novel.
*Erika Mailman&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;The Murderer&#x27;s Maid&quot; is told from the points of view of Bridget Sullivan in 1892 and a young woman with a connection to the case in the modern day. It won a gold medal for historical fiction in the Independent Publisher Book Awards.

<text>Decade of Aggression is a double live album by Slayer, released on October 22, 1991, through Def American Records (later renamed to American Recordings) and produced by Rick Rubin. The album was recorded in three separate places on three separate dates. Its working title was &quot;Decade of Decadence&quot; until Mötley Crüe registered the name. Three of the album&#x27;s tracks were included in the box set &quot;Soundtrack to the Apocalypse&quot;. The album&#x27;s reception was generally positive, with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and Robert Christgau both giving the album a positive rating. The album reached number 55 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and also charted on two other charts.

==Conception==
While touring on the Clash of the Titans tour to promote the 1990 studio album &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;, separate sections of the &quot;Decade of Aggression&quot; album were recorded on October 14, 1990, March 8, 1991, and July 13, 1991, however, AllMusic said that Rick Rubin&#x27;s production &quot;seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig.&quot; Although it had a working title of &quot;Decade of Decadence&quot;, it would be released as &quot;Decade of Aggression&quot; after Mötley Crüe copyrighted the name on their 1991 greatest hits album. It was released through Def American Recordings on October 22, 1991.

The release was intended to give them time to decide what their next album&#x27;s style would be. Text in the book &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; said that it was released after the band had gained popularity, saying &quot;Slayer had finally made it into the metal big league and summing up the first blood-soaked chapter of their career, the group duly released the live double set.&quot; It was also released to commemorate their 10th anniversary.

The album does not feature an overdub of guitars. In &quot;The Rough Guide To Rock&quot;, it was said to be &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;put studio favorites through the live shredder in a brutal and definitive manner.&quot; Most of the tracks were a selection from &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, and &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;. The album&#x27;s total duration is one hour, twenty-five minutes, and twenty-eight seconds (85:28). Three of the album&#x27;s tracks were included in the box set &quot;Soundtrack to the Apocalypse&quot;.

The album booklet includes a photo gallery with pictures dating back to 1982. The majority of the photos come from Kevin Estrada, who has said:
==Reception==

Thom Jurek, a staff writer for AllMusic, gave the album a rating of three out of five stars. Jurek gave notice to the album&#x27;s sound quality, telling readers that it does not &quot;capture the sheer overblown intensity of the unit in a concert setting,&quot; but that it comes closer than one may imagine. Jurek also gave note to how Rick Rubin made the two-discs sound like it were recorded at one gig, writing &quot;Producer Rick Rubin stays out of the way; his production seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne said that it was an &quot;accurate aural snapshots of what it&#x27;s like to be part of a crowd craning to see the action on a stage that seems two miles away.&quot; Browne also said that &quot;they&#x27;re perfect examples of the sad current state of the once-proud live rock album.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a star (&quot;Honorable Mention is a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like.&quot;), saying, &quot;praise the Lord—I can hardly understand a word they&#x27;re singing (&quot;Hell Awaits&quot;).&quot; Joel McIver, author of &quot;The Bloody Reign of Slayer&quot; said that it was regarded as one of the best live albums released by a heavy metal band.

The album charted on three different charts. On November 9, 1991, it peaked at number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On January 13, 1992, the album entered the Media Control Charts. It peaked at number 35. It maintained a number on the chart until February 2, 1992, giving it a total of three weeks on the chart.
On December 2, 1991, it entered the UK Album Charts, peaking at number 29. It stayed on the chart for two weeks.

<doc id="214799" wikidata="Q610210" url="?curid=214799" title="God Hates Us All">
<text>God Hates Us All is the ninth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released on September 11, 2001, by American Recordings. It was recorded over three months at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, and includes the Grammy Award-nominated song &quot;Disciple&quot;. Guitarist Kerry King wrote the majority of its lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge, and self-control. Stylistically, the album shows a return to Slayer&#x27;s classic thrash metal sound. It was Slayer&#x27;s last album to feature drummer Paul Bostaph until his return on their 2015 album &quot;Repentless&quot;.

The album&#x27;s release was delayed due to its explicit cover artwork, which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during mixing, and a change of distributor for the band&#x27;s label. Despite this, &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; received positive reviews from critics and peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By 2009, it had sold over 319,000 copies in the United States.

== Recording ==
Slayer began writing lyrics for a new album prior to their appearance at the 1999 Ozzfest. However, every three to four months the band was distracted by commitments to Ozzfest, and worldwide &quot;Tattoo the Earth&quot; tour with Slipknot. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman later admitted &quot;that was the last break. Then we got our shit together.&quot; The band&#x27;s longtime producer, Rick Rubin, was too busy to work with Slayer, and felt &quot;burned out&quot;—unable to create intense music. Araya and King had similar feelings about Rubin, and King remarked he &quot;wanted to work with someone into the heavy-music scene, and Rubin&#x27;s not anymore. I wanted somebody who knows what&#x27;s hot, knows what&#x27;s selling, knows the new techniques, and will keep me on my toes.&quot; Rubin recommended two producers although the first producer was not going to work out personality-wise with Hanneman. The band was pleased with producer candidate Matt Hyde&#x27;s work on &quot;Bloodline&quot; and hired him to produce the entire album.

&quot;God Hates Us All&quot; was to be recorded in a Hollywood studio; however, the band relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia due to the availability of cheaper studio time. Hyde recommended a studio to the band—The Warehouse Studio (owned by Bryan Adams) as he had previously worked there. The studio was altered to make it &quot;feel like home&quot; for Slayer. This consisted of adding incense burners, candles, dimmed lights and pornography on the walls. Two banner flags of two middle fingers were also hung up. Vocalist Tom Araya says: &quot;that was basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That&#x27;s the kind of shit we put up--spooky stuff that makes you feel at home.&quot;

Hyde used the digital audio workstation Pro Tools during the engineering, production, and audio mixing stages of the album. Slayer wanted to keep the use of computer effects to a minimum—only to include a small amount of delay and distortion. As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were recorded first. Drummer Paul Bostaph follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: &quot;The perfect take is the one that felt like it was going to fall apart but never did.&quot; Seven-string guitars were used on the tracks &quot;Scarstruck&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Pain,&quot; the first time Slayer had done so. Guitarist King decided to borrow a seven-string guitar from the B.C. Rich guitar company (manufacturer of his signature model, the KKV.) After writing one song King ordered a seven string with the thought that: &quot;there&#x27;s no point having one tuning for just one song.&quot; So he wrote another, going on to comment: &quot;you don&#x27;t have to be good to make up a seven-string riff.&quot;

The album features two songs on seven string guitars, four songs with guitars tuned to Drop-B and all other songs in C# Standard.

== Lyrical themes ==
&quot;God Hates Us All&quot; explores themes such as religion, murder, revenge, and self-control. King wrote a majority of the lyrics, which he based on &quot;street&quot; subjects which everyone could relate to, rather than &quot;Satan this,&quot; &quot;Satan that,&quot; and &quot;the usual Dungeons &amp; Dragons shit&quot; from the band&#x27;s previous records. King told &quot;Guitar World&quot;:

The song &quot;Threshold&quot; is about reaching one&#x27;s limit with a person in a situation where one is about to break—and are about to blow up as they get &quot;under your skin&quot;, while &quot;Cast Down&quot; features a fallen angel who falls into drugs. &quot;God Send Death&quot; and &quot;Deviance&quot; take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really &quot;pissed him off&quot;, and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted he was trying to get into that person&#x27;s mind; &quot;why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset.&quot;

While other members went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading books about serial killers such Gordon Burn&#x27;s &quot;Happy Like Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West&quot;. Araya was seeking inspiration and aimed at sounding convincing while singing the lyrics and avoiding sounding gimmicky. Araya sang the lyrics more &quot;over-the-top&quot; than done on previous albums, as King&#x27;s writing style is more &quot;aggro.&quot; This resulted in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; reviewer Jason Arnopp describing the album&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;so packed with foul and abusive language that it sounds as if D-12 and the Sopranos family were going head-to-head in a Celebrity Swearathon.&quot;

== Album title and cover art ==
&quot;God Hates Us All&quot; was originally intended to be named &quot;Soundtrack to the Apocalypse&quot;, but Araya suggested that the title would be better used for a box set, which the band later released in 2003. The phrase &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; originates from the song &quot;Disciple&quot;, during which the line is repeated over the chorus. The lyrics are in reference to God&#x27;s allowance of acts such as suicide and terrorism while seemingly doing nothing to prevent them. A member of the heavy metal band Pantera suggested using &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; for a shirt design after King played the song for the band. King agreed although he thought the phrase would have more impact as the album title.

The original album cover depicts a Bible spiked with nails placed in a pentagram star shape covered in blood with the word &quot;Slayer&quot; burnt across it. The liner notes intersperse the lyrics between passages from the biblical Book of Job, partly crossed out with a black marker. The idea was suggested by the band&#x27;s record company, although King wanted more time to develop a better cover. King&#x27;s concept for the cover was to show nails in the shape of a pentagram and have them miss keywords in Bible verses so it appeared as if it had been created by a sociopath. He later complained that the outcome was: &quot;typical of a record company with absolutely no idea what the fuck they were going to do&quot;, and said that the cover &quot;looked like a seventh grader defaced the Bible.&quot; A slip insert was placed in front of the covers in major retail outlets.

== Reception ==
&quot;God Hates Us All&quot; was set for release on July 10. However, concerns regarding audio mixing, the album cover, and the band&#x27;s label (American Recordings) changing distributor, caused the release date to be delayed until September 11, 2001.

With the title and the day it was released (not postponed), the album drew a connection to the September 11 attacks, which was the second time Slayer inadvertently caused controversy towards one of their releases: previously the release of &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;—containing the song &quot;War Ensemble&quot;—had coincided with the Gulf War. In its week of release, &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; debuted at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and sold 51,000 copies. It entered the Canadian Albums Chart at number 9 and debuted at number 18 on the top Internet album chart.

As of November 11, 2009, the album has sold 319,000 copies in the United States.

&quot;God Hates us All&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, the album has a score of 80 out of 100 based on 12 reviews. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Jason Arnopp described the album as: &quot;easily Slayer&#x27;s most convincing collection since &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;,&quot; awarding the album five out of five. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Rob Kemp wrote the record was &quot;Slayer&#x27;s most brutal record since 1986&#x27;s immortal (or undead) &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;,&quot; describing the music as &quot;galloping double bass-drum salvos which switch on a dime to furious double-time pummeling as ominous power chords and jagged shred solos slice and dice with Formula One precision.&quot; Kemp awarded the album three and a half out of five. AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier commented: &quot;nearly 20 years into their evolution, Slayer have abandoned the extravagancies and accessibility of their late-&#x27;80s/early-&#x27;90s work and returned to perfect the raw approach of their early years. A near flawless album,&quot; and that Araya&#x27;s performance possibly makes &quot;the most exhausting Slayer album yet.&quot;

Not all critics were impressed with the album. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin dismissively labeled the album as &quot;another failure on the band&#x27;s part to take the initiative and reinvent themselves.&quot; Krgin described King as &quot;the weaker and less inventive of the two main songwriters&quot; feeling the album &quot;follows a familiar direction that almost always sounds tired and forced.&quot; Krgin also singled out Araya for criticism and called the vocalist: &quot;a hollow shell of his former self, boasting a singing style that is monotonous, devoid of creativity and at times virtually unlistenable.&quot; Krgin awarded the record 6 out of 10, and ended the review by observing that: &quot;Slayer&#x27;s rapidly diminishing record sales is a sign that the band is in dire need of a new lease on life.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave it a mixed review, stating: &quot;Of course, what Slayer says isn&#x27;t supposed to be nearly as important as how it says it. The riffs are all overdriven and suffocating and that&#x27;s a conscious decision. In its simplest form, a song like &quot;Exile&quot; could pass for Motorhead pushed through the blades of a lawn mower but that&#x27;s selling Slayer short. Guitarist Kerry King actively fights the groove that naturally comes from playing heavy rock-and-roll.&quot;

The song &quot;Disciple&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; at the 44th Grammy Awards. This was the band&#x27;s first nomination. Although they did not expect to win they thought it was &quot;cool&quot; to be nominated. The ceremony took place on February 27, 2002, with Tool winning the award for their song &quot;Schism&quot;.

== Bostaph&#x27;s departure ==
Paul Bostaph sustained a chronic elbow injury that hindered his ability to drum and resulted in his decision to leave the band. His third-to-last performance with Slayer was recorded on &quot;War at the Warfield&quot; which Bostaph has not viewed the footage of, likening the experience to: &quot;breaking up with a girlfriend,&quot; and saying he wants to move on with his life. Having no regrets from his time spent with the band Bostaph described the period as a high point in his career. He eventually rejoined Slayer in 2013 once again replacing Dave Lombardo.

Without a drummer and unable to finish their &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; tour Hanneman contacted original drummer Dave Lombardo and asked him if he would be willing to play for the remainder of the tour. Lombardo accepted the offer and played for the remaining 21 shows. However, he did not take on a permanent position with the band.

Following the tour, the band continued their search for a permanent drummer, and sought solicitation via demo tape and snail mail. Interested fans sent video recordings of renditions of the songs &quot;Disciple,&quot; &quot;God Send Death,&quot; &quot;Stain of Mind,&quot; &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, &quot;Postmortem/Raining Blood,&quot; &quot;South of Heaven,&quot; &quot;War Ensemble,&quot; and &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;; complete with résumés. The band listened to hundreds of demo tapes and created a &quot;good pile&quot; and &quot;ungood pile&quot; though the &quot;ungood pile&quot; was much larger. Those whose performances the band were pleased with were offered an audition in Dallas, San Francisco or Peoria, Illinois. Many applicants, however, were unable to attend due to flight costs. The band auditioned roughly two to three drummers a day and their top choice was one of Lombardo&#x27;s recommendations: drummer Kevin Talley.

Slayer ultimately returned to Lombardo after deciding that they could not find a drummer who suited the job. He re-joined Slayer and attended music festivals worldwide to promote &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; and also recorded drums on the 2006 album &quot;Christ Illusion&quot;.

<text>This article lists political parties in Canada.

==Federal parties==

In contrast with the political party systems of many nations, Canadian parties at the federal level are often only loosely connected with parties at the provincial level, despite having similar names. One exception is the New Democratic Party. The NDP is organizationally integrated, with most of its provincial counterparts including a shared membership excluding Quebec.

==Provincial and territorial parties==

===Alberta===
===British Columbia===

Prior to 1903, there was no strong party discipline in the province, and governments rarely lasted more than two years as independent-minded members changed allegiances. MLAs were elected under a myriad of party labels many as Independents, and no one party held strong majorities. The first party government, in 1903, was Conservative. And disciplined party caucuses have been the backbone of BC provincial politics ever since. A list of political parties currently registered with Elections BC can be found at the Elections BC website.

===Manitoba===
===New Brunswick===
===Newfoundland and Labrador===
===Northwest Territories===
From approximately 1897 to 1905, political parties were active; however, legislative government was eliminated when the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created out of the heavily populated area of Northwest Territories (NWT). Elected legislative government was re-established in 1951. Like Nunavut, NWT elects independent candidates and operates by consensus. Some candidates in recent years have asserted that they were running on behalf of a party, but territorial law does not recognize parties.

====Historical parties 1897–1905====
*Northwest Territories Liberal Party
*Northwest Territories Liberal-Conservative Party

===Nova Scotia===
===Nunavut===
The territory, established in 1999, has a legislature that runs on a consensus government model. The members of the unicameral Legislative Assembly of Nunavut are elected individually; there are no parties and the legislature is consensus-based.

===Ontario===
===Prince Edward Island===
===Quebec===
===Saskatchewan===

Saskatchewan elections have historically included candidates running as Independents, sometimes in coalitions or with affiliations to existing parties.

===Yukon===
==Municipal parties==
The majority of municipal politics in Canada are non-partisan, but the municipal governments of Vancouver and Montreal operate on a party system.

=== Burnaby ===
* Burnaby Citizens Association – 4
* Burnaby Green Party – 1
There are four independents. 

===Montreal===

Montreal is one of the rare examples of a city with municipal political parties in Canada (they also exist in Vancouver). Political parties were legalized in Quebec by the PQ government in power in 1978. However, they existed long before official recognition by the provincial government.

=== Surrey ===
* Safe Surrey Coalition – 5
* Surrey First – 4

===Vancouver===

Vancouver is one of two major cities in Canada to have political parties at the municipal level, the other being Montreal. Municipal politics in Vancouver were historically dominated by the centre-right Non-Partisan Association, a &quot;free enterprise coalition&quot; originally established to oppose the influence of the democratic socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. Following the 2008 municipal election, the social democratic Vision Vancouver became the dominant party in city politics for 10 years until its defeat in the 2018 election.

<doc id="214804" wikidata="Q851989" url="?curid=214804" title="Porting">
<text>In software engineering, porting is the process of adapting software for the purpose of achieving some form of execution in a computing environment that is different from the one that a given program (meant for such execution) was originally designed for (e.g., different CPU, operating system, or third party library). The term is also used when software/hardware is changed to make them usable in different environments.

Software is &quot;portable&quot; when the cost of porting it to a new platform is significantly less than the cost of writing it from scratch. The lower the cost of porting software relative to its implementation cost, the more portable it is said to be. This is distinct from cross-platform software, which is designed from the ground up without any single &quot;native&quot; platform.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;port&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to carry&quot;. When code is not compatible with a particular operating system or architecture, the code must be &quot;carried&quot; to the new system.

The term is not generally applied to the process of adapting software to run with less memory on the same CPU and operating system.

Software developers often claim that the software they write is &quot;portable&quot;, meaning that little effort is needed to adapt it to a new environment. The amount of effort actually needed depends on several factors, including the extent to which the original environment (the &quot;source platform&quot;) differs from the new environment (the &quot;target platform&quot;), the experience of the original authors in knowing which programming language constructs and third party library calls are unlikely to be portable, and the amount of effort invested by the original authors in only using portable constructs (platform specific constructs often provide a cheaper solution).

== History ==
The number of significantly different CPUs and operating systems used on the desktop today is much smaller than in the past. The dominance of the x86 architecture means that most desktop software is never ported to a different CPU. In that same market, the choice of operating systems has effectively been reduced to three: Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, in the embedded systems and mobile markets, portability remains a significant issue, with the ARM being a widely used alternative.

International standards, such as those promulgated by the ISO, greatly facilitate porting by specifying details of the computing environment in a way that helps reduce differences between different standards-conforming platforms. Writing software that stays within the bounds specified by these standards represents a practical although nontrivial effort. Porting such a program between two standards-compliant platforms (such as POSIX.1) can be just a matter of loading the source code and recompiling it on the new platform, but practitioners often find that various minor corrections are required, due to subtle platform differences. Most standards suffer from &quot;gray areas&quot; where differences in interpretation of standards lead to small variations from platform to platform.

There also exists an ever-increasing number of tools to facilitate porting, such as the GNU Compiler Collection, which provides consistent programming languages on different platforms, and Autotools, which automates the detection of minor variations in the environment and adapts the software accordingly before compilation.

The compilers for some high-level programming languages (e.g. Eiffel, Esterel) gain portability by outputting source code in another high level intermediate language (such as C) for which compilers for many platforms are generally available.

Two activities related to (but distinct from) porting are emulating and cross-compiling.

==Porting compilers==
Instead of translating directly into machine code, modern compilers translate to a machine independent intermediate code in order to enhance portability of the compiler and minimize design efforts. The intermediate language defines a &quot;virtual machine&quot; that can execute all programs written in the intermediate language (a machine is defined by its language and vice versa). The intermediate code instructions are translated into equivalent machine code sequences by a &quot;code generator&quot; to create executable code. It is also possible to skip the generation of machine code by actually implementing an interpreter or JIT for the virtual machine.

The use of intermediate code enhances portability of the compiler, because only the machine dependent code (the interpreter or the code generator) of the compiler itself needs to be ported to the target machine. The remainder of the compiler can be imported as intermediate code and then further processed by the ported code generator or interpreter, thus producing the compiler software or directly executing the intermediate code on the interpreter. The machine independent part can be developed and tested on another machine (the &quot;host machine&quot;). This greatly reduces design efforts, because the machine independent part needs to be developed only once to create portable intermediate code.

An interpreter is less complex and therefore easier to port than a code generator, because it is not able to do code optimizations due to its limited view of the program code (it only sees one instruction at a time, and users need a sequence to do optimization). Some interpreters are extremely easy to port, because they only make minimal assumptions about the instruction set of the underlying hardware. As a result, the virtual machine is even simpler than the target CPU.

Writing the compiler sources entirely in the programming language the compiler is supposed to translate, makes the following approach, better known as &quot;compiler bootstrapping&quot;, feasible on the target machine: 
# Port the interpreter. This needs to be coded in assembly code, using an already present assembler on the target.
# Adapt the source of the code generator to the new machine.
# Execute the adapted source using the interpreter with the code generator source as input. This will generate the machine code for the code generator.

The difficult part of coding the optimization routines is done using the high-level language instead of the assembly language of the target.

According to the designers of the BCPL language, interpreted code (in the BCPL case) is more compact than machine code, typically by a factor of two to one. Interpreted code however runs about ten times slower than compiled code on the same machine.

The designers of the Java programming language try to take advantage of the compactness of interpreted code, because a Java program may need to be transmitted over the Internet before execution can start on the target&#x27;s Java virtual machine (JVM).

== Porting of video games ==

Porting is also the term used when a video game designed to run on one platform, be it an arcade, video game console, or personal computer, is converted to run on a different platform, perhaps with some minor differences. From the beginning of video games through to the 1990s, &quot;ports&quot;, at the time often known as &quot;conversions&quot;, were often not true ports, but rather reworked versions of the games due to the limitations of different systems. For example, the 1982 game &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a text adventure augmented with graphic images, has significantly different graphic styles across the range of personal computers that its ports were developed for. However, many 21st century video games are developed using software (often in C++) that can output code for one or more consoles as well as for a PC without the need for actual porting (instead relying on the common porting of individual component libraries).

Porting arcade games to home systems with inferior hardware was difficult. The ported version of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; for the Atari 2600 omitted many of the visual features of the original game to compensate for the lack of ROM space and the hardware struggled when multiple ghosts appeared on the screen creating a flickering effect. The poor performance of the Atari 2600 &quot;Pac-Man&quot; is cited by some scholars as a cause of the video game crash of 1983.

Many early ports suffered significant gameplay quality issues because computers greatly differed. Richard Garriott stated in 1984 at Origins Game Fair that Origin Systems developed video games for the Apple II first then ported them to Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit computers, because the latter machines&#x27; sprites and other sophisticated features made porting from them to Apple &quot;far more difficult, perhaps even impossible&quot;. Reviews complained of ports that suffered from &quot;Apple conversionitis&quot;, retaining the Apple&#x27;s &quot;lousy sound and black-white-green-purple graphics&quot;; after Garriott&#x27;s statement, when Dan Bunten asked &quot;Atari and Commodore people in the audience, are you happy with the Apple rewrites?&quot; the audience shouted &quot;No!&quot; Garriott responded, &quot;[otherwise] the Apple version will never get done. From a publisher&#x27;s point of view that&#x27;s not money wise&quot;.

Others worked differently. Ozark Softscape, for example, wrote &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; for the Atari first because it preferred to develop for the most advanced computers, removing or altering features as necessary during porting. Such a policy was not always feasible; Bunten stated that &quot;M.U.L.E. can&#x27;t be done for an Apple&quot;, and that the non-Atari versions of &quot;The Seven Cities of Gold&quot; were inferior. &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; wrote in 1986 that when porting from Atari to Commodore the original was usually superior. The latter&#x27;s games&#x27; quality improved when developers began creating new software for it in late 1983, the magazine stated.

In porting arcade games, the terms &quot;arcade perfect&quot; or &quot;arcade accurate&quot; were often used to describe how closely the gameplay, graphics, and other assets on the ported version matched the arcade version. Many arcade ports in the early 1980s were far from arcade perfect as home consoles and computers lacked the sophisticated hardware in arcade games, but games could still approximate the gameplay. Notably, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; on the Atari VCS became the console&#x27;s killer app despite its differences, while the later &quot;Pac-Man&quot; port was notorious for its deviations from the arcade version. Arcade-accurate games became more prevalent starting in the 1990s as home consoles caught up to the power of arcade systems. Notably, the Neo Geo system from SNK, which was introduced as a multi-game arcade system, would also be offered as a home console with the same specifications. This allowed arcade perfect games to be played at home.

A &quot;console port&quot; is a game that was originally or primarily made for a console before a version is created which can be played on a personal computer. The process of porting games from console to PC is often regarded more cynically than other types of port due to the more powerful hardware some PCs have even at console launch being underutilized, partially due to console hardware being fixed throughout each generation as newer PCs constantly become even more powerful. While broadly similar today, some architectural differences persist, such as the use of unified memory and smaller OSs on consoles. Other objections arise from user interface differences conventional to consoles, such as gamepads, TFUIs accompanied by narrow FoV, fixed checkpoints, online restricted to official servers or P2P, poor or no modding support, as well as the generally greater reliance among console developers on internal hard coding and defaults instead of external APIs and configurability, all of which may require expensive deep reaching redesign to avoid a &quot;lazy&quot; feeling port to PC.

<text>The Old-Time Gospel Hour was a ministry radio and television program broadcast from Thomas Road Baptist Church hosted by minister Jerry Falwell featuring the church&#x27;s Sunday service. Started in 1956 by Jerry Falwell, The Old-Time Gospel Hour gained a national following on radio and television. The series was a major revenue source for Falwell, bringing in more than $90 million during the early 1980s. The show&#x27;s popularity continued through the 1990s, during which time it was still broadcast on hundreds of stations across the country.

The television show ended after Falwell died in 2007. His son, Jonathan Falwell, became the primary minister featured in the Sunday services and eventually folded the show into the church&#x27;s online video library and livestream website called Thomas Road On Demand.

==In popular culture==
Bono of the band U2 mentions &quot;The Old-Time Gospel Hour&quot; in the 1988 live version of the song &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; on the album &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. Toward the end of the song, there is a spoken section where he says &quot;...and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between ABC News, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, and a preacher on the &quot;Old-Time Gospel Hour&quot; stealing money from the sick and the old. Well, the God I believe in isn&#x27;t short of cash, mister.&quot;

Colcord moved west to California in 1856, to Aurora, Nevada, in 1860, and to Virginia City, Nevada, in 1863. He became a successful mining engineer. He also set up a law practice and became one of the top attorneys in the state. He was also involved in the building of bridges and mills. He was selected as a commissioner to represent Nevada at the Paris Expedition in 1889.

Elected as governor in 1890, Colcord strengthened the state&#x27;s economy and also signed the state&#x27;s first admissions day bill. He was the first Nevada governor to support Women&#x27;s Suffrage. During his tenure, a state board of health was established, a mechanical engineering department was initiated in the University of Nevada, and a first state board of equalization was authorized.

After his term as governor, Colcord was named Superintendent of the United States Mint&#x27;s Carson City Mint, a position he held from 1898 to 1911. At that time, the Mint did not produce money, but was a shipping point for bullion.

==Death==
Colcord was in relatively good health at the time of his death on October 30, 1939, at the age of 100 in Carson City, Nevada. He is interred at the Lone Mountain Cemetery in Carson City, Nevada.

<doc id="214811" wikidata="Q1324275" url="?curid=214811" title="Automake">
<text>GNU Automake is a software development tool to automate parts of the compilation process. It eases common compilation problems. For example, it points to needed dependencies.

It automatically generates one or more &quot;Makefile.in&quot; from files called &quot;Makefile.am&quot;. Each &quot;Makefile.am&quot; contains, among other things, useful variable definitions for the compiled software, such as compiler and linker flags, dependencies and their versions, etc. The generated &quot;Makefile.in&quot;s are portable and compliant with the Makefile conventions in the GNU Coding Standards, and may be used by configure scripts to generate a working Makefile.

The Free Software Foundation maintains as one of the GNU programs, and as part of the GNU build system. It is used to build several GNU applications and libraries, such as GTK, as well as non-GNU software such as XCircuit.

== Process ==
Automake aims to allow the programmer to write a makefile in a higher-level language, rather than having to write the whole makefile manually. In simple cases, it suffices to give:
* A line that declares the name of the program to build
* A list of source files
* A list of command-line options to be passed to the compiler (for example, in which directories header files will be found)
* A list of command-line options to be passed to the linker (which libraries the program needs and in what directories they are to be found)

Automake also takes care of automatically generating the dependency information, so that when a source file is modified, the next invocation of the make command will know which source files need to be recompiled. If the compiler allows it, Automake tries to make the dependency system dynamic: whenever a source file is compiled, that file&#x27;s dependencies are updated by asking the compiler to regenerate the file&#x27;s dependency list. In other words, dependency tracking is a side effect of the compilation process.

This attempts to avoid the problem with some static dependency systems, where the dependencies are detected only once when the programmer starts working on the project.

== Design ==
Automake is written in Perl and must be used with GNU Autoconf. Automake contains the following commands:
* &quot;aclocal&quot;
* &quot;automake&quot;

&quot;aclocal&quot;, however, is a general-purpose program that can be useful to autoconf users. The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), for example, uses &quot;aclocal&quot; even though its makefile is hand written.

Like Autoconf, Automake is not entirely backward compatible. For example, a project created with automake 1.13 will not necessarily work with automake 1.14.

<doc id="214812" wikidata="Q5298419" url="?curid=214812" title="Dorothy Frooks">
<text>Dorothy Frooks (February 12, 1896 – April 13, 1997) was an American writer, publisher, military officer, lawyer, and suffragist. She also ran for Congress twice, in 1920 as a member of the Prohibition Party and in 1934 on the Law Preservation ticket for New York&#x27;s At-large congressional district.

She worked as a writer for the &quot;New York Evening World&quot; and published the &quot;Murray Hill News&quot; in 1952. She also wrote &quot;Labor Courts Outlaw Strikes,&quot; a pamphlet calling for the establishment of a labor court.

A lawyer in Peekskill, New York, she wrote numerous fiction and nonfiction books, including &quot;The Olympic Torch&quot;, &quot;The American Heart&quot;, and an autobiography, &quot;Lady Lawyer&quot;.

== Life and law career ==
Dorothy was born on February 12, 1896, on a farm near Saugerties, New York. She was one of ten children of Reginald Frooks, a successful businessman, and Rosita Siberz, an international socialite. She and her siblings were raised on a farm in the Hudson Valley, and spent their winters in the Waldorf Hotel.

She was recruited by her mother&#x27;s London society friends to give street-corner speeches at the age of 11.

Frooks graduated from Hamilton Law School in Chicago and received her master&#x27;s degree from New York University. By the early 1920s she was the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army.

==Military career==
Frooks served as chief yeoman in the United States Navy during World War I and as a judge advocate in the United States Army during World War II.

She served as the National Commander of the Women World War Veterans and worked with the Veterans of World War I and the Retreads, an organization for veterans who served in both world wars.

==&quot;Reds&quot;==
Frooks appeared as one of the &quot;Witnesses&quot; in Warren Beatty&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Reds,&quot; along with fellow centenarian radicals Scott Nearing and George Seldes. Frooks, Nearing and Seldes were all firsthand witnesses of the red-baiting, McCarthyism, and Cold War hysteria of the 1950s.

==Death==
Frooks died in 1997, at the age of 101, and was interred in Calverton National Cemetery.

<doc id="214827" wikidata="Q312393" url="?curid=214827" title="Gentile da Fabriano">
<text>Gentile da Fabriano ( – 1427) was an Italian painter known for his participation in the International Gothic painter style. He worked in various places in central Italy, mostly in Tuscany. 

His best-known works are his &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; from the &quot;Strozzi Altarpiece&quot; (1423), and the &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot;. Following a visit to Florence in 1419, he came in contact with humanism, which influenced his work throughout the rest of his career. He became highly influential on other painters in Florence, especially with his detailed representations inspired by his observations of the natural world.

==Biography==
===Early life in Fabriano (c. 1370-1400)===
Gentile (di Niccolò di Massio) da Fabriano was born around 1370 in or near Fabriano, in the Marche. His family included people active in the civic and religious life of the city. However, much of Gentile&#x27;s early life remains undocumented. His mother died before 1380, and in that year, his father, Niccolò di Giovanni Massi, retired to a monastery where he died in 1385. Little is known of his education: one of his first known works, a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (c. 1395–1400, now in Berlin) shows the influence of paintings made in the northern Italian late-Gothic style. 
Around 1390 he was in Pavia at the court of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, where he left a painting of &quot;Madonna with the Children together with the saints Clara and Francis&quot; (now in the Pavia Civic Museums) and some frescoes depicting ladies in a room of the Visconti Castle.

===Venice (c. 1405–1420)===
About 1405, Gentile da Fabriano was working in Venice. He painted a panel for the church of Santa Sofia, now lost; Jacopo Bellini might have worked in his workshop. Between 1408 and 1409, he painted a fresco (now lost) in the Doge&#x27;s Palace depicting the naval battle between the Venetians and Otto III. In Venice, he met Pisanello and perhaps Michelino da Besozzo. He also produced commissioned works for other cities during this period, such as his &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (c. 1405–1410) for a church in Perugia.
In 1410–1411, Gentile was in Foligno, where he frescoed some of the walls of Palazzo Trinci. Gentile met the painter Michelino da Besozzo in Venice and became inspired by his sophisticated style. Around 1410–1412, he painted what came to be known as one of his first masterworks, the Valle Romita Polyptych (now at the Pinacoteca di Brera). The altarpiece was probably commissioned by Chiavello Chiavelli in 1412. In 1414, he moved to Brescia, at the service of Pandolfo III Malatesta. During the following five years, he painted the Broletto Chapel, a work now mostly lost. While in Brescia in 1418, Gentile painted another panel that was later given as a gift to Pope Martin V, who had passed through the city on his way to Rome.

===Florence (c. 1420–1427)===

On 6 August 1420, Gentile was in Florence, where he painted his famous altarpiece depicting the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; (1423) commissioned by Palla Strozzi. This work, which is now in the Uffizi, is regarded as one of the masterpieces of the International Gothic style and had a lasting influence on Italian Renaissance painting. This work demonstrated his improved naturalistic technique with the use of light to create dimensions and perspective.e. His use of contrasting light brought the figures to life, making them appear more naturally human.. His other works in Florence include the &quot;Intercession Altarpiece&quot; (1420–1423) and the Quaratesi Polyptych (May 1425). In June–August 1425, he was in Siena, where he painted a &quot;Madonna with Child&quot;, now lost, for the Palazzo dei Notai in Piazza del Campo. Between August and October 1425, he was in Orvieto, where he painted a fresco of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; in the Cathedral, where it still remains today. The work has since been restored.

Between 1420 and 1425, Gentile painted another work, an &quot;Annunciation&quot;, in the Vatican Pinacoteca. This painting contains a number of unique features and uses the so-called &quot;ut vitrum&quot; metaphor, that is a special use of light creating glass-like images. Gentile also demonstrates this technique in the predella. The Nativity scene contains three different sources of light (the moon, the angel above and the Christ child) and represents the first realistic depiction of night in Renaissance art.

===Rome (1427)===
In 1427 Gentile arrived in Rome. There, he was commissioned by Pope Martin V to decorate the nave of the Basilica of St. John in Lateran. However, Gentile is known to have died soon thereafter, before 14 October 1427. The nave would later be completed by Pisanello after Gentile&#x27;s death. Gentile was reported buried in the church now called S. Francesca Romana in Florence, but his tomb can no longer be traced there; other sources report that he may be buried in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, in Rome.

==Arabic influence: Mamluk metalwork==

The Mamluk Sultanate is well-known for its production of metalwork objects, most of which include inscriptions in Arabic script. Venice was among the early important centers of trade for Islamic goods in Europe, and in turn, traditional Islamic forms were highly desired by European patrons because of their associations with &quot;exotic&quot; Other of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Halos painted with patterns based on Mamluk metalworks reveal the types of commercial and artistic exchanges that were taking place in other Italian city-states, like Florence. The fact that Florence secured two major seaports, Pisa and Livorno, in 1406 and 1421 respectively, illustrates the increased diplomatic ties between the Florentines and Mamluks.

By the late thirteenth century, artists like Duccio and then later in the early fifteenth century, Gentile da Fabriano, were influenced by these types of Mamluk metalwork pieces and started to incorporate their patterns and motifs into their paintings. In Gentile da Fabriano&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; (1423), pseudo-Kufic inscriptions line the cloaks of several figures. Such inscriptions also appear in the bold, ornamented halo of the Virgin Mary and Joseph, which are divided into four equal parts by rosettes, a design that derives from Mamluk plates. An example of a Mamluk plate of the time is the Mamluk Philae Dish (c. 1345–1360), where four rosettes divide the Arabic script into quadrants.

Halos with pseudo-kufic inscriptions are reflected in several of Gentile da Fabriano&#x27;s paintings that were produced during his time in Florence including the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; from around 1420 and a &quot;Madonna with Child and Angels&quot; that is part of the Quaratesi Polyptych (1425). Moreover, Gentile da Fabriano&#x27;s use of halos with Arabic inscriptions influenced other artists, including painter Masaccio, who began his use of pseudo-kufic halos as early as 1422, and can be seen later in his Pisa Altarpiece from 1426.ref?

<doc id="214829" wikidata="Q867769" url="?curid=214829" title="International Gothic">
<text>International Gothic is a period of Gothic art which began in Burgundy, France, and northern Italy in the late 14th and early 15th century. It then spread very widely across Western Europe, hence the name for the period, which was introduced by the French art historian Louis Courajod at the end of the 19th century.

Artists and portable works, such as illuminated manuscripts, travelled widely around the continent, leading to a common aesthetic among the royalty and higher nobility and considerably reducing the variation in national styles among works produced for the courtly elites. The main influences were northern France, the Duchy of Burgundy, Flanders and Brabant, the Imperial court in Prague, and Italy. Royal marriages such as that between Richard II of England and Anne of Bohemia helped to spread the style.

It was initially a style of courtly sophistication, but somewhat more robust versions spread to art commissioned by the emerging mercantile classes and the smaller nobility. In Northern Europe &quot;Late Gothic&quot; continuations of the style, especially in its decorative elements, could still be found until the early 16th century, as no alternative decorative vocabulary emerged locally to replace it before the Renaissance revival of Classicism. 
Usage of the terms by art historians varies somewhat, with some using the term more restrictively than others. Some art historians feel the term is &quot;in many ways ... not very helpful ... since it tends to skate over both differences and details of transmission.&quot;

==Development==
The important Bohemian version of the style developed in the court of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague, which for a brief period became a leading force in the development of European art. Charles came from the Luxembourg dynasty, was tutored by the future Pope Clement VI, and as a youth spent seven years at the French court, as well as visiting Italy twice. This and family relationships gave him intimate links with the various courts of France, including that of the Avignon Papacy, and from 1363 the separate Valois Duchy of Burgundy under Philip the Bold. The Bohemian style initially lacked the elongated figures of other centres, but had a richness and sweetness in female figures that were very influential. Charles had at least one Italian altarpiece, apparently made in Italy and sent to Prague, near where it remains today in his showpiece Karlštejn Castle. For St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, he first used a French architect, and then the German Peter Parler.
Much of the development of the style occurred in Italy, and it probably spread north of the Alps to influence France partly through the colony of Italian artists attached to the Papal Court at Avignon, and the works displayed from the residence there in the 1330s and 1340s of Simone Martini, a Sienese precursor of the style. Republican Siena had a large influence on the development of the style, but kept to its own dignified Gothic style throughout the period, and afterwards, while the flamboyant Visconti court at Milan, also closely related to the French royal family, was the most important Italian centre of the courtly style. As the style developed in Northern Europe, Italian artists were in turn influenced by it.

The marriage in 1384 between the young King Richard II of England and Charles IV&#x27;s daughter Anne of Bohemia helped to connect Prague and London, and bring the style to England, although Anne died in 1394.

==Royal portraits==
A number of central works of International Gothic work are votive portraits of monarchs with a sacred figure – in some cases being received into Heaven by them, as with a miniature of Jean, Duc de Berry, and some of his relatives, being welcomed by Saint Peter in the . From this period come the earliest surviving panel portraits of monarchs, and royal manuscripts show a greatly increased number of realistic portraits of the monarch who commissioned them.

==Survey==

=== Architecture ===
In architecture, where the style was long-lasting, local varieties of it are often known as Perpendicular architecture in England, and as Sondergotik in Germany and Central Europe, Flamboyant Gothic in France, and later the Manueline in Portugal, and the Isabelline in Spain.

=== Painting and sculpture ===
In painting and sculpture, the style is sometimes known in German as the &quot;Schöne Stil&quot; or &quot;Weicher Stil&quot; (&quot;Beautiful style&quot; or &quot;Soft style&quot;). Stylistic features are a dignified elegance, which replaces monumentality, along with rich decorative colouring, elongated figures and flowing lines. It also makes a more practised use of perspective, modelling, and setting. Figures begin to be given more space in their settings, and interest is taken in realistically depicted plants and animals. In some works, above all the famous calendar scenes of the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the beginnings of real landscape painting are seen. Decoration became increasingly ornate as the style developed in Northern Europe, whereas in Italy the increased sophistication of figure painting was absorbed into Early Renaissance painting.

In sculpture the leading Italian artists remained closer to classicism, and were less affected by the movement; Lorenzo Ghiberti is in many respects close to the style, but already seems infused with Early Renaissance classicism. Claus Sluter was the leading sculptor in Burgundy, and was one artist able to use the style with a strongly monumental effect. Most sculptors are unknown, and the style tended to survive longer in Northern sculpture than painting, as the detailed realism of Early Netherlandish painting was harder to translate into sculpture. Smaller painted wood figures, most often of the Madonna, were significant, and being relatively portable, probably helped to disseminate the style across Europe.
Notable painters included Master Theoderic and the Master of the Třeboň Altarpiece in Bohemia, the Master of the Parement, Jacquemart de Hesdin and the Netherlandish Limbourg brothers in France, and Gentile da Fabriano, Lorenzo Monaco and Pisanello in Italy, the last taking the style into the Early Renaissance. In Burgundy Jean Malouel, Melchior Broederlam and Henri Bellechose were succeeded by Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck who took Early Netherlandish painting in the direction of greater illusionism. Master Bertram and Conrad von Soest were leading regional masters in Germany, working largely for city burghers. Surviving panel paintings of the best quality from before 1390 are very rare except from Italy and the Prague court. Many of these artists moved between countries or regions during their careers, exposing them to the styles of other centres. In particular Broederlam had spent some years in Italy, and it has been speculated that the Master of the Parement was himself Bohemian, as his known French works are very few, and extremely close to Bohemian art.

Illuminated manuscripts remained important vehicles of the style, and in works like the Sherborne Missal were the main English contribution, apart from the stained glass of John Thornton in York Minster and of Thomas Glazier in Oxford and elsewhere. Nottingham alabaster carvings, produced in considerable quantities by workshops to standard patterns, were exported all over Western Europe to value-conscious parish churches. The Hours of Gian Galeazzo Visconti from Milan was a key work, as was the Wenceslas Bible (with the text in German) of Charles IV&#x27;s son. Both, like the Sherborne Missal, are marked by extravagantly decorated borders. John, Duke of Berry, son and brother of French kings, was the most extravagant commissioner of manuscripts, and the main employer of the Limbourg Brothers, the Master of the Brussels Initials and Jacquemart de Hesdin, as well as using many other artists. Other large-scale collectors included Wenceslas, the son of Charles IV, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, son of Henry IV of England and &quot;Regent&quot; of English-occupied France, and the Dukes of Burgundy. In the fifteenth century the cities of Flanders, especially Bruges, came to outstrip Paris as a centre of both manuscript illumination and panel painting.

=== Tapestry ===

A further vehicle of the International Gothic style was provided by the tapestry-weaving centers of Arras, Tournai and Paris, where tapestry production was permanently disordered by the English occupation of 1418–36. Under the consistent patronage of the Dukes of Burgundy, their courtly International Gothic style, elongated figures, rich details of attire, crowded composition, with figures disposed in tiers, owe their inspiration to manuscript illuminators and directly to painters: Baudouin de Bailleul, a painter established at Arras, supplied cartoons for tapestry workshops there and at Tournai, where elements of a local style are hard to distinguish (Weigert, p. 44). The Chatsworth &quot;Hunts&quot; (Victoria and Albert Museum) are inspired by Gaston de Foix&#x27;s book on hunting and the many weavings of Trojan War cycles by contemporary romances.

Tapestry too was an art that was portable. Suites accompanied their seigneurial owners from one unheated and empty château to another. Tapestry weavers themselves could be induced to move workshops, though they remained tied to the accessibility of English wool. Religious and secular subjects vied in this essentially secular art.

A medium of Late Gothic style that is easily overlooked because it has virtually entirely disappeared is that of painted hangings, which served as a less expensive substitute for woven hangings but could be produced, with appropriate themes, on short notice.

==Peak of the movement==
In a period lasting approximately between 1390 and 1420 there was a particularly close correspondence between works produced far apart in Europe. In the north the miniatures of the &quot;Très Riches Heures&quot; Limbourg brothers, in Italy the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; of Lorenzo Monaco, and sculpture and miniatures in many countries show very stylised tall figures, the older men with imposingly long beards and swaying figures. Exotic clothes, based loosely on those of the contemporary Middle East or Byzantine Empire, are worn by figures in biblical scenes; many figures seem to be included just to show off these costumes. The number of figures in many standard religious scenes is greatly increased; the Magi have large retinues, and the Crucifixion often becomes a crowded event. This innovation was to survive the style itself.
==Ending of the International moment==
The unveiling of Gentile da Fabriano&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; (below) in Florence in 1423, &quot;the culminating work of International Gothic painting&quot;, was almost immediately followed by the painting of the Brancacci Chapel by Masolino and Masaccio (1424–26), which was recognised as a breakthrough to a new style. In similar fashion the Limbourg brothers&#x27; masterpiece the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry was followed within a few years by the Turin-Milan Hours, a continuation of a manuscript started decades before by the Parement Master for the Duke of Berry, which despite a Gothic framework pioneered a very different style of painting.

But outside Florence and the leading courts the International Gothic still held sway, gradually developing in directions that once again diverged considerably between Italy and Europe north of the Alps. The arts and architecture transitioned into the Early Renaissance.

<doc id="214830" wikidata="Q5215001" url="?curid=214830" title="DanceSafe">
<text>DanceSafe is a Berkeley, California based nonprofit organization founded in 1998 by then 30 year old Emanuel Sferios. They have 17 local chapters in the US and Canada. DanceSafe volunteers set up tables at music festivals, raves, and other events to distribute non-biased educational literature focused on harm reduction for safe and responsible drug use, including testing kits so that users may obtain more information about the contents of their pills. They also offer on site peer counseling, health and safety tools (Condoms, water, earplugs) and patrols for events that assist in keeping patrons safe.

Sferios has resigned in 2001. Tim Santamour served as Executive Director from 2001 to 2004. Bryan Oley served as Board President and from 2001–2009, Nathan Messer from 2009–2012, Melissa &quot;Missi&quot; Wooldridge from 2012–2016 and is currently headed by Mitchell Gomez. DanceSafe currently has a four-member board of directors who oversee the operations of the organization.

Emanuel Sferios, the founder of DanceSafe, claims that his organization has saved lives by preventing young people from taking the more dangerous adulterated pills and by educating them.

On March 31, 2017, DanceSafe was part of a coalition of drug safety organisations hosting the first-ever International Drug Checking Day to raise awareness of safer drug use. The initiative was aimed at recreational users, with a particular emphasis on the nightlife community, and aims to promote harm reduction—accepting that people will choose to take drugs, and providing them with tools to minimize the risks.

==Laboratory adulterant screening==
Since 1999, DanceSafe has manufactured and sold consumer drug checking kits as part of their harm reduction services for users. DanceSafe also offers on-site pill testing services at harm reduction booths at electronic music events in the United States and Canada. DanceSafe coordinates with event promoters before offering on-site testing services, since some provisions of the so-called Rave Act laws hold organizers and venue owners liable for drug use at their events.

DanceSafe&#x27;s consumer laboratory pill analysis program was taken over by the Erowid Center in 2001, who now offers drug analysis services for pills and other psychoactive substances through DrugsData (formerly EctstasyData). Erowid is an educational non-profit that receives additional support from several organizations, including DanceSafe. Lab fees for testing vary depending on the form of the substance (powder, pharmaceutical tablet, or street table) and include DEA-approved disposal of substances. The project accepts donations to support drug checking and pill-testing. All testing results since the beginning of the program in 1998 are available for review on DrugData.org.

== Harm Reduction ==
In addition to the work at raves and other events, DanceSafe ran an online harm-reduction &#x27;booth&#x27; from 2001–2010. The Booth&#x27;s administrator was Bryan Oley. In 2013, Dancesafe co-hosted the 8th International Club Health conference in San Francisco that included Academic, law enforcement, Harm Reduction and Health agencies from over 17 countries across the world.

<doc id="214836" wikidata="Q5593383" url="?curid=214836" title="Graham cracker">
<text>A graham cracker (pronounced or in America) is a sweet flavored cracker made with graham flour that originated in the United States in the mid-19th century, with commercial development from about 1880. It is eaten as a snack food, usually honey- or cinnamon-flavored, and is used as an ingredient in some foods, e.g., in the graham cracker crust for cheesecakes and pies.

==History==
The graham cracker was inspired by the preaching of Sylvester Graham, who was part of the 19th-century temperance movement. He believed that minimizing pleasure and stimulation of all kinds, including the prevention of masturbation, coupled with a vegetarian diet anchored by bread made from wheat coarsely ground at home, was how God intended people to live, and that following this natural law would keep people healthy. Towards that end, Graham introduced the world&#x27;s first graham wafer product. It was a dull, unsifted flour biscuit baked by Graham himself.

The sugarless wafers were a key component of the eponymous diet. His preaching was taken up widely in the midst of the 1826–1837 cholera pandemic. His followers were called Grahamites and formed one of the first vegetarian movements in America; graham flour, graham crackers, and graham bread were created for them. Graham neither invented nor profited from these products. Herman Melville has an early reference to the crackers in Book XXII, Chapter I, of his 1852 novel &quot;Pierre; or The Ambiguities&quot;:For all the long wards, corridors, and multitudinous chambers of the Apostles&#x27; were scattered with the stems of apples, the stones of prunes, and the shells of peanuts. They went about huskily muttering the Kantian Categories through teeth and lips dry and dusty as any miller&#x27;s, with crumbs of Graham crackers.

==Production==
The main ingredients in its earlier preparations were graham flour, oil, shortening or lard, molasses and salt. Graham crackers have been a mass-produced food product in the United States since 1898, with the National Biscuit Company being the first to mass-produce it at that time. The Loose-Wiles Biscuit Company also began mass-producing the product beginning sometime in the early 1910s. The product continues to be mass-produced in the U.S. today.

In earlier times, mass-produced graham crackers were typically prepared using yeast-leavened dough, which added flavor to the food via the process of fermentation, whereas contemporary mass-production of the product typically omits this process. The dough is sometimes chilled before being rolled out, which prevents blistering and breakage from occurring when the product is baked.

==Uses==
Graham cracker crumbs are used to create graham cracker crusts for fruit pies and moon pies, and as a base, layer or topping for cheesecake. Graham cracker pie crusts are mass-produced in the United States, and consumer versions of the product typically consist of a graham cracker crumb mixture pressed into an aluminum pie pan. The graham cracker is a main ingredient in the preparation of the s&#x27;more. Graham crackers are commonly used in place of &quot;broas&quot; in the traditional Filipino icebox cake mango float.

<text>Luca della Robbia (, , ; 1399/1400–1482) was an Italian Renaissance sculptor from Florence. Della Robbia is noted for his colorful, tin-glazed terracotta statuary, a technique that he invented and passed on to his nephew Andrea della Robbia and great-nephews Giovanni della Robbia and Girolamo della Robbia. Although a leading sculptor in stone, after developing his technique in the early 1440s he worked primarily in terracotta. His large workshop produced both less expensive works cast from molds in multiple versions, and more expensive one-off individually modeled pieces.

The vibrant, polychrome glazes made his creations both more durable and more expressive. His work is noted for its charm rather than the drama of the work of some of his contemporaries. Two of his famous works are &quot;The Nativity&quot; () and &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (). In stone, his most famous work is also his first major commission, the choir gallery, &quot;Cantoria&quot; in the Florence Cathedral (1431–1438). 

Della Robbia was praised by his compatriot Leon Battista Alberti for genius comparable to that of the sculptors Donatello and Lorenzo Ghiberti, the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, and the painter Masaccio. By ranking him with contemporary artists of this stature, Alberti noted the interest and strength of Luca&#x27;s work in marble and bronze, as well as in the terra-cottas always associated with his name.

== Biography ==
Vasari, Gaurico, and several other early writers give contradictory accounts of Luca della Robbia&#x27;s youth, training, and early works. He was born in Florence, the son of a member of the Arte della Lana (wool-workers guild). He may have trained as a goldsmith under Leonardo di Ser Giovanni according to art historian Vasari, before working with Ghiberti on the famous doors of the Florence Baptistry. He was heavily influenced by Donatello, and in the 1420s, was used by the architect Filippo Brunelleschi for sculpture on his buildings. 

His important commission for the &quot;Cantoria&quot; (&quot;Singing Gallery&quot;; 1431–1438) of Florence Cathedral came before he joined the sculptor&#x27;s guild Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e Legname (for workers in stone and wood) in 1432. According to Vasari, the Medici family were responsible for securing the commission for him.

=== Sculpture ===
His first documented commission was the &quot;Cantoria&quot; (&quot;Singing Gallery&quot;; 1431–1438) for the Cathedral of Florence. During the seven years it took della Robbia to carve the reliefs under the supervision of Brunelleschi, his style developed. While the earliest carved panels are fairly symmetric and lack movement, in later panels the movement of the singers becomes much more evident and dynamic. The Singing Gallery shows children singing, dancing, and making music to &quot;praise the Lord&quot; in the words of Psalm 150. Their figures are at once lively, finely observed, and gracefully combined in groups designed to fit the ten panels of the gallery. The advanced nature of the work of the Cantoria has been seen to establish Luca della Robbia&#x27;s skill in stone, as well as to secure his place as a major Florentine artist and student of Renaissance naturalism.

In the next two decades, della Robbia executed commissions like the series of small marble reliefs (1437) for the bell tower of the Cathedral of Florence; and, in collaboration with Michelozzo, the large project of bronze doors for the sacristy of the cathedral. These doors were not finished until 1469; their reliance on a few figures placed in simple, orderly compositions against a flat ground, contrasts sharply with the elaborate pictorial effects of Lorenzo Ghiberti&#x27;s more famous baptistery doors.

Arguably one of the most important existing works in marble by Luca is the tomb of Benozzo Federighi, bishop of Fiesole. Executed in 1454–1456, the tomb originally was placed in the church of San Pancrazio, Florence, but removed to San Francesco di Paola on the Bellosguardo road outside the city in 1783. In 1898, it was again moved to the church of Santa Trinita in Florence. An effigy of the bishop in a restful pose lies on a sarcophagus sculptured with graceful reliefs of angels holding a wreath that contains the inscription. Above are three-quarter length figures of Christ between St. John and the Virgin, of conventional type. The whole is surrounded by a rectangular frame formed of painted tiles. A bunch of flowers and fruit in brilliant realistic colors is painted on each tile with enamel pigments. Although the bunch of flowers on each is painted on one slab, the ground of each tile is formed of separate pieces, likely because the pigment of the ground required a different degree of heat in firing from that needed for the enamel painting of the center.

==== Terracotta ====

Della Robbia&#x27;s earliest surviving freestanding sculpture is the white tin-glazed terracotta &quot;Visitation&quot; in the church of San Giovanni Fuoricivitas of Pistoia, dating to 1445. Although the date of della Robbia&#x27;s first work in colored glazed terra-cotta is not known, his demonstrated control of this medium secured him two major commissions for the duomo of Florence: the large reliefs of the &quot;Resurrection&quot; (also from 1445) and the &quot;Ascension of Christ&quot;(1446). The pliant medium of baked clay covered with a &quot;slip&quot; of vitrified lead and refined minerals permitted a lustrous, polished surface capable of reflecting light and color that was beautifully appropriate for architectural sculpture. Whether animating the vast, somber space of the Cathedral or in the series &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot; gracing the pristine surfaces of the small Pazzi Chapel (1443–1450) in Florence, della Robbia&#x27;s reliefs in this medium achieved a high level of mastery.

Working with assistants, including members of his own family, della Robbia produced a number of decorative reliefs and altarpieces until the end of his life. One of the arguably finest examples is the enameled terra-cotta ceiling (1466) of the Chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal in San Miniato, Florence. Another relief, acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1861, shows his free use of color: an enormous medallion containing the arms of René of Anjou, and other heraldic devices; it is surrounded by an intricately modeled wreath of brilliantly colored fruit and flowers, including apples, lemons, oranges, and fir cones. This medallion was set up on the facade of the Pazzi Palace to commemorate René&#x27;s visit to Florence in 1442.

His works were highly popular in his time and many were sent outside Florence; the larger ones could be disassembled to facilitate transport. In 1446, he bought a large house containing a workshop, which would remain the base of the family workshop until the 1520s.

In 1471, Luca della Robbia was elected president of the Florentine Guild of Sculptors, but he refused on account of his age and infirmity. His election demonstrated, however, the very high esteem in which he was held by his contemporaries. He died in Florence during February 1482, 
taking most of his secrets of tin-based glaze with him.

Edmond Malone exposes them in his &quot;An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments&quot; on 31 March, and the forged &#x27;Shakespearean&#x27; play, &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot;, is able to sustain just a single performance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, on 2 April.

<text>Joseph William Daniels (born August 4, 1970) is an American rock drummer best known as the original drummer for Local H, from 1987 until July 1999.

==Career==
Daniels and his friends Scott Lucas and Matthew &quot;Matt&quot; Garcia started jamming in 1987, while attending high school in Zion, Illinois. They eventually formed Local H in 1990. When Garcia left the band in 1993, he was not replaced, and the band continued as a duo. To complete the band&#x27;s sound, Lucas had a high school friend modify his guitar by adding a bass pickup. In 1999, Daniels decided to depart Local H. His last show with the band was at Chicago&#x27;s The Metro on June 24, 1999.

Daniels then joined the band Stendec in 1999, lasting until they disbanded in 2001. From 2001 to 2004 Daniels was a founding member of The Black Panels. From 2005 to 2007 Daniels worked with the band Bruiser, recording an album with them.

Daniels married in 2006 and had a son the following year. After their son&#x27;s birth, Daniels and his wife opened a boutique in a Chicago suburb and in 2009, started a children&#x27;s T-shirt line.

Beginning in April 2016, Daniels toured with Local H to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album &quot;As Good as Dead&quot;.

==Discography==
*&quot;Ham Fisted&quot; (1995)
*&quot;As Good as Dead&quot; (1996)
*&quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot; (1998)
*&quot;The &#x27;92 Demos&quot; (2000)

<doc id="214848" wikidata="Q2477007" url="?curid=214848" title="Clement Freud">
<text>Sir Clement Raphael Freud (24 April 1924 – 15 April 2009) was a British broadcaster, writer, politician and chef. The son of Ernst L. Freud and grandson of Sigmund Freud, Clement moved to the United Kingdom from Nazi Germany as a child and later worked as a prominent chef and food writer. 

He became known to a wider audience as a television and radio personality. Freud was the longest serving panellist on the BBC Radio 4 panel show &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, appearing in each of the first 143 episodes, and making subsequent regular appearances up until his death in 2009.

Freud was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament in 1973, retaining his seat until 1987, when he received a knighthood. In 2016, seven years after his death, three women made public allegations of child sexual abuse and rape by Freud, which led to police investigations.

== Early life ==
Clement Freud was born Clemens Rafael Freud in Berlin, the son of Jewish parents Ernst L. Freud (an architect) and Lucie Freud (&quot;née&quot; Brasch). He was a grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and the brother of artist Lucian Freud. His family fled to the United Kingdom from Nazi Germany and his forenames were anglicised to Clement Raphael. He spent his later childhood in Hampstead, where he attended the Hall School, a prep school. He was then educated at two independent schools: at Dartington Hall School, where he boarded, and at St Paul&#x27;s School in London. He was naturalised as a British subject on 4 September 1939, one day after the outbreak of the Second World War.

During the war, Freud joined the Royal Ulster Rifles and served in the ranks, acting as an aide to Field Marshal Montgomery. He later worked at the Nuremberg Trials, and in 1947 was commissioned as an officer. Freud married June Flewett (the inspiration for Lucy Pevensie in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s children&#x27;s series &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;) in 1950, and the couple had five children. Flewett had taken the stage name Jill Raymond in 1944, and after her husband&#x27;s knighthood, was known as Lady Freud. Freud became an Anglican at the time of his marriage.

== Early career ==
Freud was one of Britain&#x27;s first celebrity chefs. He worked at the Dorchester Hotel and went on to run his own restaurant in Sloane Square at a relatively young age. Freud appeared in a series of dog food television advertisements (at first Chunky Meat, later Chunky Minced Morsels) in which he co-starred with a bloodhound called Henry (played by a number of dogs) which shared his trademark &quot;hangdog&quot; expression. In 1964 he appeared in &quot;Strictly for the Birds&quot;. In 1968 he wrote the children&#x27;s book &quot;Grimble&quot;, followed by a sequel, &quot;Grimble at Christmas&quot;, six years later. Whilst running a nightclub, Freud met a newspaper editor who gave him a job as a sports journalist. From there he became an award-winning food and drink writer, writing columns for many publications.

== Political career ==
Freud stood in the 1973 Isle of Ely by-election, becoming the Liberal Member of Parliament for that constituency (later North East Cambridgeshire) from 1973 to 1987. In 1983, to support employment in his constituency, he assisted the management buy-out of a concrete pipe manufacturer in March, Cambridgeshire, led by Tom Moore, and became an investor in the resulting March Concrete Ltd. His departure from Parliament was marked by the award of a knighthood.

In his column in the &quot;Racing Post&quot; of 23 August 2006, Freud wrote about his election to Parliament in a by-election: &quot;Politically, I was an anti-Conservative unable to join a Labour party hell-bent on nationalising everything that moved, so when a by-election occurred in East Anglia, where I lived and live, I stood as a Liberal and was fortunate in getting in. Ladbrokes quoted me at 33–1 in this three-horse contest, so Ladbrokes paid for me to have rather more secretarial and research staff than other MPs, which helped to keep me in for five parliaments.&quot;

His autobiography, &quot;Freud Ego&quot;, recalls his election win, and shortly after, when asked by his wife June, &quot;Why aren&#x27;t you looking happier?&quot;, he wrote, &quot;It suddenly occurred to me that after nine years of fame I now had something solid about which to be famous... and cheered up no end.&quot; During his time as a Member of Parliament, he visited China with a delegation of MPs, including Winston Churchill, the grandson of the wartime prime minister. When Churchill was given the best room in the hotel, on account of his lineage, Freud (in a reference to his own famous forebear) declared it was the first time in his life that he had been &quot;out-grandfathered&quot;.

== Callaghan and freedom of information ==
In the last year of James Callaghan&#x27;s government there was a proposal to revive the one-year Lib-Lab pact which had lapsed in July 1978, to include introducing a freedom of information act, long proposed by the Liberals; however, Callaghan himself was opposed to this kind of legislation. Towards the end of the five-year term there was a confidence vote in Callaghan&#x27;s government, and Freud was expected to follow his party and vote with the Opposition. 

Due to by-election defeats Labour&#x27;s Callaghan ran a minority government and sought support of members from opposing parties to support him that day; to that end Freud, in Liverpool at the time, received a phone call from 10 Downing Street at 3pm asking him to miss his train back to London for the 10pm vote, in exchange for a &quot;looser&quot; version of his proposed freedom of information act being enacted. Freud declined the offer and voted as stated by his party, after the lapse of the Lib-Lab pact, for an immediate general election. Otherwise the government could have continued until October 1979.

== Radio, music and academia ==

For many, Freud was best known as a panellist on the long-running Radio 4 show &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. Freud performed a small monologue for the Wings 1973 album &quot;Band on the Run&quot; and appeared on the album&#x27;s cover. He also made the occasional film appearance, with acting roles in movies such as &quot;The Mini-Affair&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Best House in London&quot; (1969). In 1974, he was elected Rector of the University of Dundee and served two three-year terms. A generation later, in 2002, he was elected Rector of the University of St Andrews, beating feminist and academic Germaine Greer and local challenger Barry Joss, holding the position for one term.

== Family and hobbies ==
His son Matthew Freud founded the London public relations firm Freud Communications in 1985. Matthew Freud was formerly married to Caroline Hutton, who was the second wife of Earl Spencer; he then married media magnate Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s daughter Elisabeth.

Clement Freud&#x27;s daughter Emma Freud, a broadcaster, is the partner of Richard Curtis, scriptwriter of &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;. His nieces (by his painter brother Lucian) include poet Annie Freud, fashion designer Bella Freud, and writer Esther Freud. His eldest brother, Stephen Freud, closely guarded his privacy, with the exception of a 2008 interview he gave to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Stephen died in 2015, at the age of 93. Freud died without resolving a feud with his brother Lucian, thought to have dated back 70 years, over which of them was the rightful winner of a boyhood race. There have been claims that Freud fathered a child in the mid-1950s with the family&#x27;s 17-year-old nanny.

Freud was a columnist for the &quot;Racing Post&quot; newspaper. Freud&#x27;s enthusiasm for horse racing went as far as challenging Sir Hugh Fraser, then chairman of Harrods, to a horse race at Haydock in 1972. Freud trained for three months and lost some five stone for the event. Although Fraser, a country gentleman, was seen as a much better prospect, the two made a bet for £1,000-a-side. Freud used the long odds to his advantage, however, and shrewdly placed a large side bet on himself. Freud won the race and made a great deal of money. His horse, Winter Fair, went on to win the Waterloo Hurdle at Aintree that year.

Freud wrote articles reviewing facilities for spectators at racecourses in Britain, especially catering. This led him to receive the nickname &quot;Sir Clement Food&quot;.

== Death and funeral ==
Freud died at his home on 15 April 2009, nine days before his 85th birthday. His funeral service was held at St Bride&#x27;s Church in Fleet Street and was attended by a host of personalities from the media and entertainment industry including Bono, Richard Curtis, Stephen Fry, Paul Merton, Debbie McGee and Nicholas Parsons, as well as several representatives from Westminster, such as then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, then-Shadow Chancellor George Osborne and former Liberal party leader Lord Steel. He was survived by his wife of 59 years, Jill Freud, his five children, his 17 grandchildren and his two elder brothers, Stephen and Lucian.

==Child sexual abuse allegations==
On 15 June 2016, allegations were made in an ITV documentary, &quot;Exposure: Abused and Betrayed – A Life Sentence&quot;, that Freud had engaged in child sexual abuse between the 1940s and the 1970s. Two women, who did not know each other, spoke publicly for the first time to claim Freud had preyed upon them when they were still children and into young adulthood. Sylvia Woosley contacted the ITV News team – the same team that exposed Jimmy Savile – and told them she had been abused for many years by Freud, from the age of 10 in the 1950s to when she left his home aged 19. The second woman, who remained anonymous, said that Freud had groomed her from the age of 11 in 1971, abused her at 14, and violently raped her at 18, by which time Freud had become a Liberal MP. On the day of the documentary broadcast, Freud&#x27;s widow, Jill Freud, issued an apology to both women. She accepted the claims and issued a statement of sympathy for his victims, saying: &quot;I sincerely hope they will now have some peace.&quot;

A third woman, Vicky Hayes, alleged that she was assaulted and raped by Freud when she was aged 17. Hayes said Freud had no right to his reputation as a &quot;pillar of society&quot; and ought to be posthumously stripped of his knighthood. It also emerged that Operation Yewtree had been passed Freud&#x27;s name in 2012 when two alleged victims made accusations to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). 

Allegations were also made of predatory behaviour towards female students during Freud&#x27;s time as Rector of the University of Dundee in the 1970s. Craig Murray, a former British ambassador, who was a student at Dundee University in the late 1970s, described an incident when Freud asked the president of the students&#x27; union to pimp for him and select a woman to entertain him.
