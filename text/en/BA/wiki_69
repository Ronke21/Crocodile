<text>Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester (Henry William Frederick Albert; 31 March 1900 – 10 June 1974) was a member of the British royal family. He was the third son of King George V and Queen Mary, and was a younger brother of kings Edward VIII and George VI. He served as Governor-General of Australia from 1945 to 1947, the only Prince to hold the post.

Henry was the first son of a British monarch to be educated at school, where he excelled at sports, and went on to attend Eton College, after which he was commissioned in the 10th Royal Hussars, a regiment he hoped to command. However, his military career was frequently interrupted by royal duties, and he was nicknamed &quot;the unknown soldier&quot; due to his low profile. While big-game shooting in Kenya, he met the future pilot Beryl Markham, with whom he became romantically involved. The court put pressure on him to end the relationship, but he had to pay regular hush-money to avert a public scandal. In 1935, also under parental pressure, he married Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott, with whom he had two sons, princes William and Richard.

From 1939 to 1940, Henry served in France as a liaison officer to Lord Gort. He performed military and diplomatic duties during the rest of the war, then in 1945 was appointed as Australia&#x27;s governor-general at the request of Prime Minister John Curtin. The post had originally been offered to his younger brother the Duke of Kent, who died in an air crash. Henry attended the coronation of his niece Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and carried out several overseas tours, often accompanied by his wife. From 1965, he became incapacitated by a number of strokes. Upon his death, he was succeeded as the Duke of Gloucester by his only living son, Richard.

Prince Henry was the last surviving son of King George V and Queen Mary. His widow, who died at the age of 102, became the longest-lived-ever member of the British royal family.

==Early life==

Prince Henry was born on 31 March 1900, at York Cottage, on the Sandringham Estate during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. His father was the Duke of York (later King George V), the only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother was the Duchess of York (later Queen Mary), the only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck. At the time of his birth, he was fifth in the line of succession to the throne, behind his grandfather, father and two elder brothers.

He was baptised at the private chapel of Windsor Castle on 17 May 1900, by Randall Thomas Davidson, Bishop of Winchester. He was informally known to his family as &quot;Harry&quot;.

==Childhood and education==

As a young boy, Prince Henry suffered from ill health very much like his older brother Albert. He also had knock knees, and had to wear painful leg splints. He was an extremely nervous child, and was often victim to spontaneous fits of crying or giggling, and also like his brother, Henry had a combination of speech disorders. They both had rhotacism, which prevented them from pronouncing the sound r, but while Albert&#x27;s pronunciation was slightly reminiscent of the &quot;French r&quot;, Henry was completely unable to pronounce it, causing the intended r to sound like [w]. On top of this, Henry also had a nasal lisp and an unusually high-pitched tone, resulting in a very distinctive voice.

By 1909, Henry&#x27;s poor health had become a serious concern for his parents. He was very small for his age and was prone to get very aggressive colds. &quot;You must remember that he is rather fragile and must be treated differently to his two elder brothers who are more robust&quot;, wrote Prince George to Henry&#x27;s tutor, Henry Peter Hansell.

On 6 May 1910, Prince George ascended the throne as George V, and Henry became the third in line to the throne. The King was persuaded by Hansell that it would be good for Henry&#x27;s character to attend school, where he could interact with boys his age. The King, having previously rejected this proposition for his two elder sons, agreed on the basis that it would help him &quot;behave like a boy and not like a little child&quot;.
Prince Henry thus became the first son of a British monarch to attend school. After three days at St Peter&#x27;s Court in Broadstairs as a day boy, Hansell, noticing he liked it, asked the King to send him as a boarder, to which he agreed.

Henry spent three years at St Peter&#x27;s Court. Academically, he was not very bright, although he did show a particular aptitude in mathematics. Henry&#x27;s sole interest became sports, particularly cricket and football. &quot;All you write about is your everlasting football of which I am heartily sick&quot;, wrote his mother, answering a fully detailed letter from Henry about a match.

In September 1913, Henry started at Eton College. During the First World War, Crown Prince Leopold of Belgium, later Leopold III, was a member of his house (Mr Lubbock&#x27;s). His studies did not improve, but his nerves and disposition did. He made friends through his enthusiasm for sports, and his masters were very pleased with him, noting in his report that he was &quot;thoroughly willing, cheerful, modest &amp; obedient&quot;. To his father, these values were the most important, having no time or interest in what he called &quot;intellectuals&quot;.

By the time he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1919 with his brother Albert, Henry had outgrown all his brothers, both in height and size, and enjoyed very good health. Their stay at Cambridge lasted just one year and was very uneventful for both of them, as they were not allowed to live in college with the other undergraduates, due to their father&#x27;s fear of their mixing with undesirable company.

==Military career==

Unlike his brothers, Prince Henry joined the Army rather than the Royal Navy. He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1919, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps on 16 July 1919. On 16 July 1921 he was promoted to lieutenant in the 10th Royal Hussars, with whom he continued to serve. Though he desired to serve in more active roles as a soldier, his position as a senior member of the royal family effectively ruled out any such options. He retained an interest in sport and &quot;The Cricketer&quot; reported in August 1921 that the touring Philadelphians had had the honour of being presented to Prince Henry at The Oval.

Prince Henry was promoted to captain on 11 May 1927, and was appointed a personal aide-de-camp to his father on 2 August 1929. On 3 March 1931, he was appointed a staff captain and was seconded for service with the 2nd Cavalry Brigade. He was brevetted to major on 2 August 1934, and upon his father&#x27;s Silver Jubilee the following May, was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the Gloucestershire Regiment. On 6 July 1935, he was promoted to the substantive rank of major, his final rank as an actively serving officer. On 23 June 1936, he was appointed a personal aide-de-camp to his eldest brother, Edward VIII.

Following his brother&#x27;s abdication and the accession of his brother the Duke of York as George VI, Prince Henry was effectively retired from active duty, and received a ceremonial promotion to major-general on 1 January 1937, skipping three ranks. He was also granted a Royal Air Force commission as air vice-marshal the same day. He continued to serve as a personal aide-de-camp to the new king, receiving this appointment on 1 February. On 12 March, he received the colonelcy of his former regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars, along with the colonelcies of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Gordon Highlanders. On 28 May, he received an honorary appointment as a captain in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), followed by his appointment on 10 November to the honorary colonelcies of the Ceylon Planters&#x27; Rifle Corps and the Ceylon Light Infantry (now the Sri Lanka Light Infantry).

Following the outbreak of World War II, he joined the British Expeditionary Force, and was appointed as a Chief Liaison Officer on 4 September 1939. In January 1940, he was appointed to the colonelcies of the Ulster Anti-Aircraft Regiments of the Royal Artillery in the Territorial Army. He was slightly wounded in 1940 when his staff car was attacked from the air. In August 1940, he was appointed Chief Liaison Officer, GHQ Home Forces. He also became second-in-command of the 20th Light Armoured Brigade that year, and was promoted to lieutenant-general on 17 September 1941. On 27 October 1944, he was promoted to the rank of full general.

He was appointed a Field Marshal in 1955 and a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in 1958.

==Duke of Gloucester==
On 31 March 1928, his father created him Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden, three titles that linked him with three parts of the United Kingdom, namely England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Prince Henry visited Canada in 1928.

Before his marriage, Prince Henry&#x27;s greatest ambition was to someday command his regiment, the 10th Royal Hussars, or at least spend as much time in the army as possible. Although he was a capable soldier, as the King&#x27;s son he was prevented from joining his regiment abroad, and this meant he was generally seen as an outsider to his fellow officers. To his increasing despair, he had to fulfill the many royal duties his father assigned him.

In September 1928, Henry left England with his brother Edward, Prince of Wales, to shoot big game in Africa. The brothers parted in Nairobi, where Henry was to stay for a while. There, he was entertained by Mansfield Markham and his wife Beryl Markham. Beryl and Henry soon started an affair (though sources differ over when the affair started; many say it was not until her visit to England). In November, the brothers were recalled to England due to their father&#x27;s worsening health, and soon after Beryl returned too. At the Grosvenor Hotel, close to Buckingham Palace, the affair continued with Prince Henry openly hosting parties with her in her suite and drinking too much.

The affair, widely known by the London society, shocked the Queen, to the delight of the Prince of Wales who remarked that &quot;for once, Queen Mary&#x27;s blue-eyed boy was in trouble instead of himself&quot;. The King stepped in, thinking that keeping Henry busy would be the best way to end the affair, as would keeping him from drinking too much, too often. That year, he arranged a series of tours for his son to undertake.

In 1929, he went to Japan to confer the Garter on the Emperor, and a year later he attended the coronation of Haile Selassie of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa. In 1934 George V made him a Knight of St Patrick, Ireland&#x27;s chivalric order. It was the second to last time this order was awarded (the last appointment being the Duke of York, later George VI, in 1936); at the time of his death, the Duke of Gloucester was the only remaining knight. In 1934, he went to Australia and New Zealand where the people received him with overwhelming enthusiasm that one journalist wrote, &quot;(amounted) to something very near adoration&quot;.

==Marriage and family==

When he returned from his trip to Japan in 1929, the affair with Markham ended. Her husband wanted a divorce and threatened to disclose Prince Henry&#x27;s private letters to his wife if he did not &quot;take care of Beryl&quot;. The Duke and Beryl never met again, although she did write to him when he visited Kenya in 1950 with his wife, but he did not write back. Prince Henry&#x27;s solicitors paid out an annuity until her death in 1985.

After his tour of Australia and New Zealand, and pressured by his parents, Prince Henry decided it was time to settle down and proposed to Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott, sister of one of Henry&#x27;s best friends Lord William Montagu Douglas Scott. The proposal, wrote Lady Alice many years later, was not at all romantic as &quot;it was not his way&quot;, instead he just &quot;mumbled it as we were on a walk one day&quot;. They were married on 6 November 1935. The marriage was originally planned to take place at Westminster Abbey, but was moved to the more modest Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace due to the death of Lady Alice&#x27;s father, the Duke of Buccleuch, on 19 October 1935, barely a fortnight before the wedding. After suffering two miscarriages, the Duchess of Gloucester gave birth to two sons:
* Prince William of Gloucester (18 December 1941 – 28 August 1972)
* Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester (born 26 August 1944). He married a Danish commoner, Birgitte van Deurs, on 8 July 1972. The couple later had three children.

The couple lived first at the Royal Pavilion in Aldershot, near the barracks of the Duke&#x27;s regiment. &quot;It was a very simple cabin&quot;, recalled the Duchess of Gloucester, and &quot;the only royal thing about it was my husband&#x27;s presence&quot;. After his father&#x27;s death, the Duke bought Barnwell Manor in 1938. As their London seat, they were given York House in St James&#x27;s Palace.

==Abdication of Edward VIII==
In December 1936, Henry&#x27;s brother Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry divorcée Wallis Simpson. His brother, Prince Albert, ascended the throne as King George VI. Although third in line to the throne, following his two nieces Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, Henry became the first adult in line, meaning he would act as regent if anything were to happen to the King before Princess Elizabeth came of age on 21 April 1944, her 18th birthday. Because of this, Prince Henry could not leave the UK at the same time as the King. Furthermore, he and his younger brother, the Duke of Kent, had to increase their royal engagements considerably to support the new King.

Edward VIII, who became Duke of Windsor after abdicating, recalled that it was Henry who reacted least to the news of his abdication. The brothers had never been close and, apart from horses, they had not much in common. But Edward did admit regretting the implications the abdication would have on &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, a nickname he teasingly used to refer to Henry, owing to his low profile.

The abrupt change in Prince Henry&#x27;s somewhat carefree life up to that point was made clear by the new King on the first evening of his reign. &quot;If you two think that, now that I have taken this new job on, you can go on behaving just as you like, in the same old way, you are very much mistaken! You two have to pull yourselves together&quot;, the King warned his two younger brothers at dinner.

Although the Duke of Gloucester supported his brother, and later his niece, tirelessly and dutifully, he had a fondness for whisky. On one occasion, Queen Mary wrote to the Duchess suggesting that if they were planning to visit, the Duke should bring his own supply of whisky, &quot;as we have not got much left, and it is so expensive&quot;. Even Noble Frankland, who wrote the Duke&#x27;s biography after his death at the request and under the supervision of the Duchess, wrote that: &quot;He did not eschew a glass of whisky ... or the occasional blasphemous oath.&quot;

King George VI had great affection for his younger brother. Circumstances had made them closer following the abdication, and the King trusted Prince Henry with important matters, which he dutifully undertook. Sometimes, though, the organised King found his brother&#x27;s less systematic manner irritating. On one occasion after a day of shooting at Balmoral Castle, the King found a mistake on his shot-game record, where there seemed to be a pair of grouse missing. A member of staff suggested that the King call and ask the Duke of Gloucester, who was staying at Birkhall. When the Duke confirmed he had taken the birds, the King&#x27;s gruff warning to his brother that he should never again take birds without telling him surprised the member of staff.

==Second World War==
After the outbreak of World War II, the Duke of Gloucester, as Chief Liaison Officer to Lord Gort, spent almost the entire first year of the war in France. Besides boosting the troops&#x27; morale, he was useful as a first-hand witness of the situation; he reported to government officials and to the King, to whom he continually wrote detailed and objective accounts of what was happening. Always eager to get involved, the Duke often found himself in dangerous situations, but did not seem overly worried. &quot;Motoring about is not nice as many villages are being bombed&quot;, he wrote to his wife in his usual straightforward and dismissive manner. The Duke&#x27;s two narrowest escapes both came in May 1940.

Having known King Leopold III of Belgium from school days, the Duke wanted to meet him personally to offer support after rumours began circulating that Belgium would surrender to Germany. On 14 May, he and his brother-in-law, Lord William Scott, drove from Hotel Univers in Arras into Belgium to see the King of the Belgians at a secret location. That night, Hotel Univers was bombed, resulting in several deaths, including those staying in the rooms next to the Duke&#x27;s. The Duke wrote to his brother that King Leopold was &quot;very depressed&quot;. As the Duke and Lord William Scott drove back, they were caught up in heavy enemy bombing in Tournai, where their car caught fire. They managed to get out and dive into an alleyway, although not unscathed as the Duke needed medical attention for a profusely bleeding wound.

Although generally optimistic, Prince Henry did sometimes suffer from bouts of depression during his service in 1940, especially at the end of his occasional leaves. &quot;My beloved Alice, I did hate leaving you yesterday so very much that I could hardly keep a straight face&quot;, he wrote to his wife after reporting back. The strains of living at the French front also diminished his resolve at times: &quot;I think I hate this country and war more than ever... it is such an awful waste of everything&quot;, he told the Duchess.

In June, after the fall of Dunkirk, the Duke was ordered back to England by an embarrassed General Headquarters, which had not been able to assure the King&#x27;s brother&#x27;s safety. &quot;Wherever I went or had been, I was bombed&quot;, the Duke explained to his mother, amused.

In early 1942 the King arranged a four-month-long military and diplomatic mission for the Duke to the Middle East, India and East Africa. The mission came just after Prince Henry had become a father for the first time, and it was considered a dangerous trip, as the Germans were rapidly advancing toward some of the territories the Duke would visit. The King even wrote to his sister-in-law that he would act as guardian of the newly born Prince William if anything should happen to his brother.

After Prince Henry&#x27;s younger brother, the Duke of Kent, died in a plane crash in Scotland in August 1942, it was decided that the Duke of Gloucester would not be sent on any further missions that could prove dangerous.

==Governor-General of Australia==

In late 1944 the Duke was unexpectedly appointed Governor-General of Australia after the death in 1942 of his younger brother, the Duke of Kent, who had previously been offered the position.

The Duke had made a successful visit to Australia in 1934. Because the Duke was shy, he sometimes appeared stiff and formal, but he and the Duchess travelled widely in Australia using his own plane during their time in office. When Prime Minister Curtin died in 1945, the Duke appointed Frank Forde as prime minister.

Gloucester left Australia in March 1947, after two years in the post. He was recalled to the UK to act, on behalf of the King, as Counsellor of State during a visit by George VI and Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret to South Africa. As a parting gift, he left his own plane for use by the government and people of Australia.

==Later life==

In May 1949, May 1961, May 1962 and May 1963, the Duke served in the office of Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which temporarily afforded him precedence in Scotland immediately below the King and Queen.

The Duke attended the coronation of his niece Elizabeth II in 1953. Both the Duke and Duchess carried out royal engagements, including several overseas tours. In 1954 the Duke served as the Treasurer of the Honourable Society of Gray&#x27;s Inn. He represented Queen Elizabeth II during the Malayan Declaration of Independence on 31 August 1957. He suffered a series of strokes in later years; his first was in 1965 while he and his wife, Alice, were returning from Sir Winston Churchill&#x27;s funeral ceremony in their vehicle, which resulted in a car crash. This, together with later strokes, left him dependent on a wheelchair, and he was unable to speak in his last remaining years. His last public appearance was at the unveiling of Queen Mary&#x27;s plaque at Marlborough House in 1967, where he appeared weak and considerably older than the Duke of Windsor. In 1972, he was too ill to attend the funeral of the Duke of Windsor in May, or the wedding of his younger son, Prince Richard, in July. In August, the Duke&#x27;s elder son, Prince William, died in a plane crash; by that point, he was in such poor health that his wife hesitated about whether to tell him. She later wrote in her memoirs that she did not, but that he may have learnt of their son&#x27;s death from television coverage.

==Death==
The Duke died on 10 June 1974 at the age of 74. He was the last surviving son of King George V and Queen Mary, and the last living knight of the Order of St Patrick. His body was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore.

His will was sealed in London after his death in 1981. His estate was valued at £734,262 (or £5.6 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

His second, and only living, son, Prince Richard, inherited the title of Duke of Gloucester. The Duke&#x27;s widow, Alice, received permission from Queen Elizabeth II to be styled &quot;Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester&quot;, to distinguish herself from Prince Richard&#x27;s wife. She outlived her husband by 30 years until her death on 29 October 2004, becoming, at age 102, the longest-lived member of the British royal family in history.

<text>Philip J. Carroll, Jr. (1937–2014) was an American businessman who was active in a variety of corporate and government roles. 
Carroll earned a Bachelor of Science in physics from Loyola University New Orleans in 1958 and a M.S. in physics from Tulane University in 1961, after which he joined the Shell Oil company as an engineer. He died in Houston, Texas, on October 6, 2014.

Carroll became the CEO of Shell Oil in 1993 and served in that position until July 1998, when he became the chairman and CEO of Fluor Corporation, an engineering and construction services firm. He retired from Fluor in February 2002.

He was a non-executive director of the British defense company BAE Systems. 
Carroll was a member of the board of directors of other companies, including Boise Cascade, Vulcan Materials, American Express, Scottish Power, and Texas Medical Center.

Carroll was an honorary life member of the board of the American Petroleum Institute, a member of the Tulane University advisory board, and the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and the University of Houston.

In the 1970s he briefly served as the director of the U.S. Department of Commerce&#x27;s Energy Conservation Division and the Director of the National Industrial Energy Conservation Council. In 2003 he was appointed by the Bush administration to head the policy planning advisory board of the Iraqi Oil Ministry.
He opposed the neo conservative-backed plan to privatize Iraqi oil. He told Newsnight: &quot;Many Neo-Conservatives are people who have certain ideological beliefs about markets, about democracy, about this, that and the other. International oil companies, without exception, are very pragmatic commercial organizations. They don&#x27;t have a theology.&quot;

<doc id="222106" wikidata="Q593573" url="?curid=222106" title="To Be and to Have">
<text>To Be and To Have (; also the UK title) is a 2002 French documentary film directed by Nicolas Philibert about a small rural school. It was screened as an &quot;Out of Competition&quot; film at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and achieved commercial success. The film became the subject of an unsuccessful legal action by the school&#x27;s teacher, who said that he and the children&#x27;s parents had been misled about the film&#x27;s intended audience, and that he and the children had been exploited.

The documentary&#x27;s title translates as &quot;to be and to have&quot;, the two auxiliary verbs in the French language. It is about a primary school in the commune of Saint-Étienne-sur-Usson, Puy-de-Dôme, France, the population of which is just over 200. The school has one small class of mixed ages (from four to twelve years), with a dedicated teacher, Mr Lopez, who shows patience and respect for the children as we follow their story through a single school year.

The film won several awards, including the 2003 Sacramento French Film Festival Audience Prize.

==Critical response==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A small, sensitive, and moving portrait of a teacher and his students.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 87 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

==Lawsuit==
Following the film&#x27;s popularity in cinemas, Lopez, the principal personality in the documentary, made an unsuccessful attempt to sue the documentary&#x27;s makers for a share of the €2 million profit. One of his main claims was that the film-makers had exploited his image without authorisation. French film unions warned that if Lopez had been successful it would have spelt &quot;the death of the documentary, undermining the crucial principle that subjects should not be paid to participate&quot;.

Speaking after the court case, Lopez said that he, the children and their families had been misled by the film&#x27;s production company about the purpose and intended audience of the film:

&quot;We were misled. The production company told me and the children&#x27;s families that they were making a small documentary about the phenomenon of the one-teacher village school and that the film would be used primarily for educational purposes. They said it would have a restricted screening, and never discussed marketing the film to make it such a commercial venture...We had no idea that it would be in cinemas all over the country, released on DVD or distributed abroad.
The court ruled that Lopez&#x27;s attendance at the Cannes film festival, which he attended with some of the students, and his repeated public expressions of satisfaction at its success, constituted his tacit acceptance of the use of his image.

The French media had been critical of Lopez, with one newspaper carrying the headline: &quot;To be and to have: the teacher would rather have.&quot; However Lopez said money was never his motivation: &quot;I&#x27;m simply trying to make the film company recognise my rights.&quot; Lopez was supported in his action by the families of most of his former pupils, some of whom stated that they themselves would also sue the film company.

Lopez said the unexpected attention the film had brought the young students had traumatised some of them:
&quot;One child, who had been very stable and happy until the film&#x27;s release, was so distressed by his unexpected fame, that he started wetting the bed, and became afraid of the dark...Other children have been teased at their new secondary schools because of their involvement. All have been subjected to a great deal of stress as a direct consequence of the film.&quot;

<doc id="222118" wikidata="Q2353777" url="?curid=222118" title="German submarine U-429">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-429&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; originally built for the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; during World War II. Her keel was laid down on 14 September 1942 by Danziger Werft of Danzig. She was then commissioned as &quot;S-4&quot; on 14 July 1943 under the command of &quot;Tenente di vascello&quot; Angelo Amendolia.

Following the Italian armistice on 8 September 1943, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; took possession of the &quot;U-429&quot;, which was still in German waters, along with the and . These boats were not deemed advanced or useful enough for full war service, and on 27 October 1943 they were turned over to training flotillas for service in the Baltic Sea, training up submarine crews for dispatch to operating boats, mainly based in France. After a very uneventful service life, the &quot;U-429&quot; was caught in an open dock during a U.S. Eighth Air Force raid on the city of Wilhelmshaven on 30 March 1945, and destroyed by bombing, although her crew were not on board at the time of the attack.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-429&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert GU 343/38–8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-429&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Modern dramatization==
The 2003 film &quot;In Enemy Hands&quot; features a fictional &quot;U-429&quot;, which captures the crew of a fictional version of .

<text>USS &quot;Swordfish&quot; (SS-193), a &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine, was the first submarine of the United States Navy named for the swordfish, a large fish with a long, swordlike beak and a high dorsal fin. She was the first American submarine to sink a Japanese ship during World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Swordfish&quot;′s keel was laid down on 27 October 1937 by the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California. She was launched on 3 April 1939 sponsored by Miss Louise Shaw Hepburn, and commissioned on 22 July 1939 with Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) Chester C. Smith in command.

==Operational history==
=== 1937–1941 ===

Following shakedown and post-shakedown repairs at Mare Island, &quot;Swordfish&quot; operated out of San Diego, California, until early 1941, when she set sail for Pearl Harbor. On 3 November &quot;Swordfish&quot;, in company with three other U.S. submarines, departed Pearl, and on 22 November arrived at Manila, Philippine Islands. The submarine remained at Manila until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. The following day, she set sail on her first war patrol, conducted off the coast of Hainan, China. After damaging several enemy vessels on the 9th, 11th, and 14th (&quot;Kashii Maru&quot;), &quot;Swordfish&quot; sank her initial victim of the war on 16 December. Hit amidships by one of three torpedoes, the cargo ship &quot;Atsutasan Maru&quot; erupted in a cloud of smoke and flames and disappeared beneath the waves. On 27 December &quot;Swordfish&quot; embarked the organizational staff of the Submarine Asiatic Command Staff at Manila and headed for Soerabaja, Java, arriving on 7 January 1942.

=== 1942 ===
&quot;Swordfish&quot; departed Soerabaja on 16 January for her second war patrol, conducted in the Celebes Sea and in the Philippines. On 24 January, she torpedoed and sank the cargo ship &quot;Myoken Maru&quot; (4,124 tons) off Kema, Celebes Islands. On 20 February, she submerged in the entrance of Mariveles, Luzon, only to surface after dark to take on board the President of the Philippines Manuel L. Quezon, his family, Vice President of the Philippines Sergio Osmeña, Chief Justice of the Philippines José Abad Santos, and three Philippine Army officers. She departed on the surface about 11:30pm and sailed through a minefield. She submerged during the day of 21 February, between 06:20 and 18:20 which caused it to be quite warm, 94F and 92% humidity. She arrived off the coast of San Jose, Panay, Philippine Islands on 22 February at 10pm and they stopped at 2:30am on 23 February about a mile off the coast of San Jose de Buenavista, Antique. Fifteen minutes later they were advised that their launch was approaching. The passengers debarked the sub around 3am on 23 February. The President and his party were transferred to a motor tender. &quot;Swordfish&quot; then returned to Manila Bay and embarked the High Commissioner of the Philippines, arriving Fremantle, Western Australia, on 9 March.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; got underway from Fremantle on 1 April for her third war patrol, with her primary mission being to deliver 40 tons of provisions to the besieged island of Corregidor. The island fell to the Japanese before the mission could be carried out and the submarine was ordered to patrol in the vicinity of Ambon Island. The only ships sighted were beyond effective range, and the submarine returned to Fremantle on 1 May.

Departing Fremantle for her fourth war patrol on 15 May, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was in the Makassar Strait on 23 May when she damaged the &quot;Asakaze Maru&quot;; in the South China Sea on 29 May where she sank a 1900-ton transport ship &quot;Tatsufuku Maru&quot; and was in the Gulf of Siam on 12 June, where she torpedoed and sank a 4585-ton cargo ship &quot;Burma Maru&quot;. The submarine returned to Fremantle on 4 July.

Her fifth war patrol, conducted in the Sulu Sea, and her sixth war patrol, conducted in the Solomon Islands, were unproductive. During her sixth patrol, she possibly was involved in an accidental &quot;friendly fire&quot; attack in Misima Island harbor on , which was damaged on 12 November 1942. She was involved in another friendly fire incident at 02:30 on 26 November 1942, when a United States Army Air Forces North American B-25 Mitchell bomber mistook &quot;Swordfish&quot; for a Japanese submarine and attacked her while she was on the surface off Cape Ward Hunt, New Guinea. She crash-dived, and had reached a depth of when four bombs detonated across her stern, inflicting no damage or casualties.

=== 1943 ===
On her seventh war patrol, &quot;Swordfish&quot; sank the 4,122-ton cargo ship &quot;Myoho Maru&quot; on 19 January 1943. She again was the target of a friendly fire incident when at 09:25 on 7 February 1943 what her crew identified as a U.S. Army Air Forces B-17 Flying Fortress bomber mistakenly attacked her while she was on the surface north-northeast of Kavieng, New Ireland, at . Her crew heard machine-gun bullets striking her conning tower as she crash-dived, followed by an explosion, and she descended to a depth of before her crew regained control of her and stabilized her at a depth of . Her damage was significant enough to force her to terminate her patrol early and head to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 23 February 1943, she underwent overhaul.

On 29 July 1943, &quot;Swordfish&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor for her eighth war patrol. On 22 August 1943, she sighted her first target of the patrol, and quickly sent the 3,016-ton cargo ship &quot;Nishiyama Maru&quot; to the bottom, the victim of two torpedo hits. She intercepted a Japanese convoy on 5 September 1943 and damaged a large tanker before sinking a 3,203-ton transport ship &quot;Tenkai Maru&quot;. She concluded the patrol at Brisbane, Australia, on 20 September.

&quot;Swordfish&quot;″s ninth war patrol lasted only three weeks. Shortly after reaching her assigned patrol area, her crew discovered material defects, and she had to return to port.

=== 1944 ===

On the day after Christmas 1943, &quot;Swordfish&quot; departed for her tenth war patrol, in the hands of one of the Submarine Force&#x27;s oldest commanders, 42-year-old Karl G. Hensel (Class of 1923), formerly commanding Submarine Division 101. The patrol was conducted in Tokyo Bay. It was plagued with equipment casualties in old &quot;Swordfish&quot;, including radar trouble and electrical fires. On 13 January 1944, she sank 6921-ton freighter &quot;Yamakuni Maru&quot;, while surviving &quot;heavy—and close—depth charges&quot;. The depth charging caused her to lose power in her electrical systems, and when she dived at dawn the next day, she suffered two separate fires and nearly went right to the bottom; her captain managed to bring her back up, where she wallowed on the surface, only to have a Japanese patrol boat close on her. She regained power in the nick of time and dived. At around 2200 on 14 January, &quot;Swordfish&quot; detected another ship, and made radar contact at on the Japanese navy&#x27;s first genuine Q-ship, the 2182-ton merchantman &quot;Delhi Maru&quot;, on her maiden voyage. She had been outfitted with sonar (which &quot;Swordfish&quot; had heard pinging), new watertight bulkheads, depth charge throwers, and concealed guns, specially to destroy submarines. At midnight, &quot;Swordfish&quot; fired three bow torpedo tubes, scoring three hits with the recently corrected Mark XIV torpedo. &quot;Delhi Maru&quot; blew up, and the two patrol boats of her escort kept &quot;Swordfish&quot; down with depth charges for three hours before she evaded.

17 January, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was detailed to intercept and her escort. In the dark, it was impossible to see the carrier, but radar made contact on the force at (), making . To avoid being detected, &quot;Swordfish&quot; dived, only to end up in front of one of &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s escorting destroyers, which practically ran right over her. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; came on so fast, &quot;Swordfish&quot; could barely get off a shot from her four stern tubes, with the carrier going away; all missed. On 27 January, &quot;Swordfish&quot; fired two torpedoes at a 3140-ton auxiliary gunboat &quot;Kasagi Maru&quot; which broke in half and sank. She completed her tenth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 7 February. Her total score was claimed to be two ships for 15,200 tons; the tonnage was reduced by JANAC to 12,543 tons postwar, but the number of ships was raised to three.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; put to sea on 13 March for her eleventh war patrol, conducted in the Mariana Islands. Although several enemy ships were damaged during this patrol, no sinkings could be confirmed; and the submarine returned to Majuro on 29 April.

&quot;Swordfish&quot;″s twelfth war patrol was conducted in the area of the Bonin Islands. On 9 June, the submarine found Japanese destroyer clearly illuminated against the horizon and sank the enemy ship with two torpedoes from her bow tubes. On 15 June, she torpedoed and sank a 4804-ton transport ship &quot;Kanseishi Maru&quot;. The remainder of the patrol was unproductive; on 27 June the &quot;Swordfish&quot; heavily damaged two enemy trawlers near Chici Jima and on 30 June sank or heavily damaged a Japanese picket boat in the Northern Pacific, and the submarine terminated her twelfth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 30 June.

On 22 December, &quot;Swordfish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor to conduct her thirteenth war patrol, in the vicinity of Nansei Shoto. She topped off with fuel at Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 26 December and left that day for her area. In addition to her regular patrol, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was to conduct photographic reconnaissance of Okinawa, for preparation for the upcoming Okinawa campaign.

=== 1945 ===
On 2 January, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was ordered to delay carrying out her assigned tasks in order to keep her clear of the Nansei Shoto area until completion of carrier-based air strikes which were scheduled. She was directed to patrol the general vicinity of until further orders were received. Her acknowledgement of those orders on 3 January was the last communication received from &quot;Swordfish&quot;.

On 9 January 1945, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was directed to proceed to the vicinity of Okinawa to carry out her special mission. It was estimated that the task would not take more than seven days after arrival on station, which she should have reached on 11 January. Upon completion of her mission, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was to proceed to Saipan, or to Midway if she was unable to transmit by radio. Since neither place had seen her by 15 February, and repeated attempts to raise her by radio had failed, she was reported as presumed lost on that date.

In the report of her loss, mention was made that , which at the time was patrolling the vicinity of Okinawa, reported that on the morning of 12 January she contacted a submarine by radar. It was believed that contact was with &quot;Swordfish&quot;. Four hours later &quot;Kete&quot; heard heavy depth charging from this area, and it was believed that this attack might have been the cause of &quot;Swordfish&quot;″s loss.

Japanese information on antisubmarine attacks does not mention the attack heard by &quot;Kete&quot; on 12 January, and records no attacks in which &quot;Swordfish&quot; is likely to have been the victim. However, it is now known that there were many mines planted around Okinawa, since the Japanese were expecting an Allied invasion of that island. The majority of the mines were planted close in. It is considered about equally likely that &quot;Swordfish&quot; was sunk by depth charge attack before she reached Okinawa for her special mission or that she was lost to a mine at that place. Japanese sources sometimes credit her with sinking &quot;Shoto Maru&quot; on 4 January and being sunk in return by her escort, Kaibokan CD-4, since no claims for &quot;Shoto Maru&quot; match her sinking time.

Admiral William S. Pye&#x27;s son, Lieutenant Commander John Briscoe Pye, was among those lost with &quot;Swordfish&quot; on her 13th and final war patrol.

==Honors and awards==
* Navy Unit Commendation for the period of her first, second, and fourth war patrols
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with eight battle stars for World War II service

==Commemoration==
A memorial to &quot;Swordfish&quot; exists in St. Paul, Minnesota, near the Como Park Zoo and Conservatory, just off Churchill Street on a rise a short walk south of Hamm Falls. It consists of a torpedo on a stand. On one side of the base is a plaque listing the names of her crew and giving a brief history of the vessel. On the other is a roll of U.S. submarines lost in World War II.

<text>USS &quot;Swordfish&quot; (SSN-579), a nuclear-powered submarine, was the second submarine of the United States Navy named for the swordfish, a large fish with a long, swordlike beak and a high dorsal fin.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Swordfish&quot; was awarded to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine, on 18 July 1955, and her keel was laid down on 25 January 1956. She was launched on 27 August 1957 sponsored by Mrs. Eugene C. Riders, and commissioned on 15 September 1958 with Commander Shannon D. Cramer, Jr., in command.

==Service history==
===1958–1981===
&quot;Swordfish&quot; completed fitting out and held her shakedown in the Atlantic Ocean. After post-shakedown availability and subsequent sea trials along the East Coast, she was assigned a home port at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, effective 16 March 1959. She steamed to Hawaii in July and was the second nuclear-powered submarine to join the United States Pacific Fleet, joining . Assigned to Submarine Squadron 1, &quot;Swordfish&quot; steamed over 35,000 miles during her first year in commission with over 80% of them submerged.

In January 1960, &quot;Swordfish&quot; deployed to the western Pacific Ocean (WestPac) for four months and became the first nuclear submarine in that area. During this time, President of the Republic of China Chiang Kai-shek was embarked for a one-day indoctrination cruise. She deployed to WestPac again on 20 June and on this occasion took President of the Philippines Carlos P. Garcia to sea for a one-day demonstration. The submarine conducted local operations in the Hawaiian area from January to May 1961. In late May, the submarine got underway for the West Coast of the United States where she operated between San Diego and San Francisco, with various Pacific Fleet units. &quot;Swordfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 July and operated locally until September when she deployed to the western Pacific for two months.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; sailed to Mare Island in January 1962 and became the first nuclear submarine to be overhauled on the Pacific coast. She returned to Hawaii on 29 September for refresher training and local operations. On 26 October, the submarine was again deployed to WestPac.

In late 1963, &quot;Swordfish&quot; observed from close range a Soviet anti-submarine warfare exercise in the North Pacific. She was detected, but the Soviets were unable to force her to surface. The mission provided recordings of the Soviets&#x27; radio chatter and plots of their radar search patterns. During the same operations &quot;Swordfish&quot; photographed the first Soviet nuclear-powered submarine being towed from a shipyard to be outfitted in another.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; continued operating from Pearl Harbor, on local operations and on deployments to the western Pacific, as a member of Submarine Division 71 until 30 June 1965 when she was assigned to Submarine Division 11 which was also based there. In late 1965, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation for special operations from 8 October to 3 December 1963, from 22 September to 25 November 1964, and from 20 May to 23 July 1965.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; arrived at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 1 November 1965 to undergo a refueling and SubSafe overhaul which lasted until 31 August 1967. Sea trials were held in September and weapons trials in early October. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 October and conducted refresher training until 31 December 1967. The period 1 January to 2 February 1968 was spent in preparation for overseas movement. &quot;Swordfish&quot; deployed to the western Pacific on 3 February.
On 8 March 1968, , a Soviet Golf II-class submarine, sank northwest of Oahu. On 17 March, &quot;Swordfish&quot; put into Yokosuka, Japan, for emergency repairs to a bent periscope. It was suggested by the Soviets that &quot;K-129&quot; was lost after a collision with &quot;Swordfish&quot;. The United States Navy states that &quot;Swordfish&quot; was damaged in an ice pack in the Sea of Japan, and that &quot;K-129&quot; was some distant from &quot;Swordfish&quot; when she was lost.

In May 1968, anti-nuclear activists alleged that &quot;Swordfish&quot; had released radioactive coolant water into the harbor of Sasebo, Japan where she was moored at the time. Some sources state that Japanese scientists discovered levels up to twenty times normal background, others, that they could not detect any increase in radioactivity. The Japanese protested the incident to the United States, and Japanese Premier Eisaku Satō stated that U.S. nuclear ships would no longer be allowed to call at Japanese ports unless their safety could be guaranteed.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 September and remained in port the remaining four months of the year.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; conducted local operations in the Hawaiian area from 1 January to 11 May 1969 at which time she again deployed until 4 November. The remainder of the year was spent in a leave and upkeep period. She was deployed on special operations from 24 February to 9 April 1970 and then entered drydock at Pearl Harbor for an availability period which lasted until 30 September. The remainder of calendar year 1970 was spent conducting a period of crew training necessitated by the yard period.

Local operations during 1971 were broken by a tour in WestPac from 24 March to 22 September. During this deployment, the submarine visited Yokosuka, Buckner Bay, Pusan, and Hong Kong. &quot;Swordfish&quot; continued local operations until 26 June 1972 when she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her annual which lasted through 31 December 1973. Upon completion of the yard period, &quot;Swordfish&quot; resumed operations with her Pearl Harbor-based squadron.

On 22 June 1977, &quot;Swordfish&quot; launched a Mark 14 torpedo which made a circular run and hit the port screw. Fortunately, it was an exercise torpedo. &quot;Swordfish&quot; returned to port for 24 hours, did a screw change, and went back to sea.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; made a deployment to the western Pacific from October 1977 until March 1978, stopping in Yokosuka, Pusan, Chinhae, Guam, Philippines, and Hong Kong.

In September 1978 a paint scraper worth 15¢ was accidentally dropped into a torpedo launcher and jammed the loading piston in its cylinder. For a week divers tried to free the piston while &quot;Swordfish&quot; was waterborne but all attempts failed. She had to be dry-docked and subsequent repairs cost $171,000.

In July 1979 the &quot;Swordfish&quot; began a western Pacific deployment, stopping in Yokosuka, Pusan, and the territory of Guam. After refitting in Guam the ship began operations again, but was forced to return to Guam after several days to repair the diesel engine after the muffler exhaust valve broke, flooding the engine. After repairs were made the deployment continued without incident until the ship&#x27;s return to Pearl Harbor in December 1979.

Local operations were carried out until the ship was deployed to the western Pacific during the summer of 1980. Upon returning to Pearl Harbor the ship resumed local operations until entering Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for overhaul and refueling in March 1981.

===1985 safety incident===
In late October 1985, &quot;Swordfish&quot; was delayed in departing Pearl Harbor due to the failure of the drain pump. A replacement was obtained from , in the shipyard for decommissioning, but &quot;Swordfish&quot; put to sea before the pump was fully connected and tested, and the crew could not get the pump to operate. Since the engine room bilges could not be pumped, by the evening of 23 October, the first day at sea, the water in the engine room lower level bilge was over the deck plates (more than four feet). The crew tried to use a portable submersible pump, but were not successful.

When the water level got high enough to get up into the bottoms of the motors for the main lube oil pumps, causing grounds, the captain came aft and saw the situation and decided to take the boat shallow to allow pumping bilges. When the planesmen put a slight up-angle on the boat to come shallow the water in the bilges instantly rushed aft, greatly increasing its effect on trim (this is known as &quot;free surface effect&quot;, later classes of subs have flood control bulkheads in engineroom lower level to prevent this) and causing an up-angle of about 45 degrees.

When &quot;fire in engineroom lower level&quot; was announced, due to water in the main lube oil pump motors, a man in the aft end of engineroom upper level opened the watertight door into the stern room, which swung into the stern room, to retrieve a fire extinguisher. Just then the up-angle increased dramatically and the bilge water began pouring in. The door was shut before the boat surfaced. With the boat on an even keel, the water came up to the deadlight in the door.

The maneuvering watchstanders began to take the immediate actions for loss of shaft lube oil; the throttleman began to shut the throttles for the main engines. Without propulsion, the extreme up-angle caused the ship to quickly stop and begin moving backwards, sinking stern first. When the fire was announced, the Engineer had gone to Maneuvering (the control center of the engine room). He saw the depth gauge indicating a rapid increase in depth, ordered &quot;Ahead Full&quot; on his own initiative, and opened the starboard forward throttle himself in an effort to drive the ship to the surface. In Control, the Captain saw similar indications, and ordered &quot;Blow Aft!&quot;. Before the Chief of the Watch could initiate the blow on the aft group the up-angle became so steep that he was unable to maintain footing and slid to the rear of the Control compartment. He quickly climbed back up to the emergency blow &quot;chicken switches&quot; and opened the after group valve.

&quot;Swordfish&quot; surfaced successfully. However, during the up-angle the freshwater drain collecting tank vents were submerged and sucked contaminated water into the feed system. The steam generator water could not be analyzed immediately because nucleonics laboratory in the stern room had been inundated by the wave of bilgewater. After a while, the leading ELT found the necessary reagents and analyzed samples from both steam generators on the top hat in reactor compartment upper level. By this time the boat was in direct communication with Naval Reactors, which ordered the reactor shut down and cooled down and steam generators drained and refilled. The emergency diesel generator, located in engineroom lower level, initially had water in the generator from the incident but it was drained and the diesel was online before the reactor was shut down. The reactor was cooled down and steam generators were blown down with service air and refilled until all fresh water on the boat was exhausted, which was a couple of hours before arriving back in Pearl Harbor. Subsequent analysis of steam generator water revealed no leakage of reactor coolant into the steam generators.

Three of the boat&#x27;s four air conditioning compressors were shut down as part of the rig for reduced electrical. The temperature in the ship exceeded with near 100% humidity for the several hours required for a tugboat to be dispatched from Pearl Harbor and tow &quot;Swordfish&quot; home. The tugboat arrived the next morning and began the tow around noon, arriving in Pearl Harbor just after midnight.

The actions of the chief of the watch and the engineer saved &quot;Swordfish&quot; and her crew. The boat spent the rest of 1985 in port making repairs and returned to sea in January 1986, making a successful deployment to the western Pacific later in 1986.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Swordfish&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 2 June 1989. Her disposal through the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program (SRP) was completed at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, on 11 September 1995.

==Honors and awards==

* Navy Unit Commendation with seven stars (8 awards)
* Meritorious Unit Commendation with star (2 awards)
* Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon (2 awards)
* Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal
* Vietnam Service Medal with four campaign stars for Vietnam War service

&quot;Swordfish&quot; also received a number of classified awards.

==&quot;K-129&quot; incident legacy==
Russia has repeatedly requested copies of &quot;Swordfish&quot;″s logs to trace her at the time &quot;K-129&quot; was lost, but the Pentagon refuses to release them; &quot;Swordfish&quot; was involved in highly sensitive operations at that time. The United States has salvaged some parts of &quot;K-129&quot;, and has provided the Russian government with a videotape of a burial-at-sea ceremony for six &quot;K-129&quot; crew members whose remains were recovered when the American deep-sea drillship &quot;Hughes Glomar Explorer&quot; recovered parts of &quot;K-129&quot; in 1974.

<text>) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Baroque. It has become one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting for the way its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and for the uncertain relationship it creates between the viewer and the figures depicted.

The painting is believed by F. J. Sánchez Cantón to depict a room in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid during the reign of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some of the figures look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The five-year-old Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two little people and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.

&quot;Las Meninas&quot; has long been recognised as one of the most important paintings in the history of Western art. The Baroque painter Luca Giordano said that it represents the &quot;theology of painting&quot;, and in 1827 the president of the Royal Academy of Arts Sir Thomas Lawrence described the work in a letter to his successor David Wilkie as &quot;the true philosophy of the art&quot;. More recently, it has been described as &quot;Velázquez&#x27;s supreme achievement, a highly self-conscious, calculated demonstration of what painting could achieve, and perhaps the most searching comment ever made on the possibilities of the easel painting&quot;.

== Background ==

=== Court of Philip IV ===

In 17th-century Spain, painters rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting was regarded as a craft, not an art such as poetry or music. Nonetheless, Velázquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of Philip IV, and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain (). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, he painted only a few works, mostly portraits of the royal family. When he painted &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, he had been with the royal household for 33 years.

Philip IV&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth of France, died in 1644, and their only son, Balthasar Charles, died two years later. Lacking an heir, Philip married Mariana of Austria in 1649, and Margaret Theresa (1651–1673) was their first child, and their only one at the time of the painting. Subsequently, she had a short-lived brother Philip Prospero (1657–1661), and then Charles (1661–1700) arrived, who succeeded to the throne as Charles II at the age of three. Velázquez painted portraits of Mariana and her children, and although Philip himself resisted being portrayed in his old age he did allow Velázquez to include him in &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. In the early 1650s he gave Velázquez the Pieza Principal () of the late Balthasar Charles&#x27;s living quarters, by then serving as the palace museum, to use as his studio, where &quot;Las Meninas&quot; is set. Philip had his own chair in the studio and would often sit and watch Velázquez at work. Although constrained by rigid etiquette, the art-loving king seems to have had a close relationship with the painter. After Velázquez&#x27;s death, Philip wrote &quot;I am crushed&quot; in the margin of a memorandum on the choice of his successor.

During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez served as both court painter and curator of Philip IV&#x27;s expanding collection of European art. He seems to have been given an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory of many of the Spanish king&#x27;s paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely respected in Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubens—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez&#x27;s curatorship.

=== Provenance and condition===
The painting was referred to in the earliest inventories as &quot;La Familia&quot; (&quot;The Family&quot;). &quot;Las Meninas&quot; is described in the inventory of 1666 by García de Medrano. A detailed description of &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (&quot;the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age&quot;) in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor , that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez&#x27;s own head inclined to his right rather than his left.

The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the 1734 fire that destroyed the Alcázar, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa&#x27;s older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, &quot;The Family of Philip IV&quot;, which was repeated in the records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as &quot;Las Meninas&quot;.

In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the &quot;meninas&quot; have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the British conservator John Brealey, to remove a &quot;yellow veil&quot; of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century. The cleaning provoked, according to the art historian Federico Zeri, &quot;furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different&quot;. In addition, &quot;[t]he Spanish press criticized Brealey at every opportunity, arguing that only someone born and raised in Spain could truly comprehend, and be allowed to handle, such an iconic piece of their culture. One day, a small riot broke out outside the room where Brealey was working&quot;. However, in the opinion of López-Rey, the &quot;restoration was impeccable&quot;. Due to its size, importance, and value, the painting is not lent out for exhibition.

=== Painting materials===
A thorough technical investigation including a pigment analysis of &quot;Las Meninas&quot; was conducted around 1981 in the Museo del Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the Baroque period frequently used by Velázquez in his other paintings. The main pigments used for this painting were lead white, azurite (for the skirt of the kneeling ), vermilion and red lake, ochres and carbon blacks.

== Description ==

=== Subject ===

&quot;Las Meninas&quot; is set in Velázquez&#x27;s studio in Philip IV&#x27;s palace in Madrid. The high-ceilinged room is presented, in the words of Silvio Gaggi, as &quot;a simple box that could be divided into a perspective grid with a single vanishing point&quot;. In the centre of the foreground stands the Infanta Margaret Theresa (1). The five-year-old infanta, who later married Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, was at this point Philip and Mariana&#x27;s only surviving child. She is attended by two ladies-in-waiting, or : Doña  (2), who is poised to curtsy to the princess, and Doña  (3), who kneels before Margaret Theresa, offering her a drink from a red cup, or , that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two little people: the achondroplastic Austrian Mari Bárbola (4), and the Italian  (5), who playfully tries to rouse a sleepy mastiff with his foot. The dog is thought to be descended from two mastiffs from Lyme Hall in Cheshire, given to Philip III in 1604 by James I of England. Doña  (6), the princess&#x27;s chaperone, stands behind them, dressed in mourning and talking to an unidentified bodyguard (or ) (7).
To the rear and at right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez (8)—the queen&#x27;s chamberlain during the 1650s, and head of the royal tapestry works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown standing but in pause, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. As the art critic Harriet Stone observes, it is uncertain whether he is &quot;coming or going&quot;. He is rendered in silhouette and appears to hold open a curtain on a short flight of stairs, with an unclear wall or space behind. Both this backlight and the open doorway reveal space behind: in the words of the art historian Analisa Leppanen, they lure &quot;our eyes inescapably into the depths&quot;. The royal couple&#x27;s reflection pushes in the opposite direction, forward into the picture space. The vanishing point of the perspective is in the doorway, as can be shown by extending the line of the meeting of wall and ceiling on the right. Nieto is seen only by the king and queen, who share the viewer&#x27;s point of view, and not by the figures in the foreground. In the footnotes of Joel Snyder&#x27;s article, the author recognizes that Nieto is the queen&#x27;s attendant and was required to be at hand to open and close doors for her. Snyder suggests that Nieto appears in the doorway so that the king and queen might depart. In the context of the painting, Snyder argues that the scene is the end of the royal couple&#x27;s sitting for Velázquez and they are preparing to exit, explaining that is &quot;why the to the right of the Infanta begins to curtsy&quot;.

Velázquez himself (9) is pictured to the left of the scene, looking outward past a large canvas supported by an easel. On his chest is the red cross of the Order of Santiago, which he did not receive until 1659, three years after the painting was completed. According to Palomino, Philip ordered this to be added after Velázquez&#x27;s death, &quot;and some say that his Majesty himself painted it&quot;. From the painter&#x27;s belt hang the symbolic keys of his court offices.

A mirror on the back wall reflects the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King Philip IV (10) and Queen Mariana (11). The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows their view of the scene.
Of the nine figures depicted, five are looking directly out at the royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen&#x27;s reflection, affirm the royal couple&#x27;s presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest that the image of the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez&#x27;s canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is shown working on is unusually large for one of his portraits, and note that is about the same size as &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. The painting contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by the artist.

The point of view of the picture is approximately that of the royal couple, though this has been widely debated. Many critics suppose that the scene is viewed by the king and queen as they pose for a double portrait, while the Infanta and her companions are present only to make the process more enjoyable. Ernst Gombrich suggested that the picture might have been the sitters&#x27; idea:

 No single theory, however, has found universal agreement. Leo Steinberg suggests that the King and Queen are to the left of the viewer and the reflection in the mirror is that of the canvas, a portrait of the king and queen. 

Clark suggests that the work comprises a scene where the ladies-in-waiting are attempting to cajole the Infanta Doña Margarita to pose with her mother and father. In his 1960 book &quot;Looking at Pictures&quot;, Clark writes:

The back wall of the room, which is in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, including one of a series of scenes from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez&#x27;s son-in-law and principal assistant del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.

The paintings on the back wall are recognized as representing &quot;Minerva Punishing Arachne&quot; and &quot;Apollo&#x27;s Victory Over Marsyas&quot;. Both stories involve Minerva, the goddess of wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar points out that the legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is on the same side of the mirror as the queen&#x27;s reflection while the male legend, involving the god Apollo and the satyr Marsyas, is on the side of the king.

=== Composition ===
The painted surface is divided into quarters horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time. Velázquez presents nine figures—eleven if the king and queen&#x27;s reflected images are included—yet they occupy only the lower half of the canvas.

According to López-Rey, the painting has three focal points: the Infanta Margaret Theresa, the self-portrait and the half-length reflected images of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana. In 1960, Clark observed that the success of the composition is a result first and foremost of the accurate handling of light and shade:

However, the focal point of the painting is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture&#x27;s focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.

Depth and dimension are rendered by the use of linear perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.

Velázquez uses this light not only to add volume and definition to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female little person, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality does not make it a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.

Velázquez further emphasises the Infanta by his positioning and lighting of her maids of honour, who are set opposite one another: before and behind the Infanta. The maid on the viewer&#x27;s left is given a brightly lit profile, while her sleeve create a diagonal. Her opposite figure creates a broader but less defined reflection of her attention, making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.

A further internal diagonal passes through the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female little person and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible than those of the little person who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist&#x27;s sleeve, pointing directly to the face.

The mirror is a perfectly defined unbroken pale rectangle within a broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws the attention of the viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the little person in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the opalescent sheen of the mirror&#x27;s surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. Jonathan Miller pointed out that apart from &quot;adding suggestive gleams at the bevelled edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with the dimness of the surrounding wall that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen&quot;.

As the maids of honour are reflected in each other, so too do the king and queen have their doubles within the painting, in the dimly lit forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and care for their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture&#x27;s surface.

Adding to the inner complexities of the picture is the male little person in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of the figure in the background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.

Despite certain spatial ambiguities this is the painter&#x27;s most thoroughly rendered architectural space, and the only one in which a ceiling is shown. According to López-Rey, in no other composition did Velázquez so dramatically lead the eye to areas beyond the viewer&#x27;s sight: both the canvas he is seen painting, and the space beyond the frame where the king and queen stand can only be imagined. The bareness of the dark ceiling, the back of Velázquez&#x27;s canvas, and the strict geometry of framed paintings contrast with the animated, brilliantly lit and sumptuously painted foreground entourage. Stone writes:

According to Kahr, the composition could have been influenced by the traditional Dutch Gallery Pictures such as those by Frans Francken the Younger, Willem van Haecht, or David Teniers the Younger. Teniers&#x27; work was owned by Philip IV and would have been known by Velázquez. Like &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, they often depict formal visits by important collectors or rulers, a common occurrence, and &quot;show a room with a series of windows dominating one side wall and paintings hung between the windows as well as on the other walls&quot;. Gallery Portraits were also used to glorify the artist as well as royalty or members of the higher classes, as may have been Velázquez&#x27;s intention with this work.

=== Mirror and reflection ===
The spatial structure and positioning of the mirror&#x27;s reflection are such that Philip IV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer&#x27;s side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, not only is the gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana&#x27;s benefit, but the painter&#x27;s attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, the viewer&#x27;s position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.

The mirror on the back wall indicates what is not there: the king and queen, and in the words of Harriet Stone, &quot;the generations of spectators who assume the couple&#x27;s place before the painting&quot;. Writing in 1980, the critics Snyder and Cohn observed:

In &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, the king and queen are supposedly &quot;outside&quot; the painting, yet their reflection in the back wall mirror also places them &quot;inside&quot; the pictorial space.

Snyder proposes it is &quot;a mirror of majesty&quot; or an allusion to the mirror for princes. While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes &quot;it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character&quot;. Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Velázquez&#x27;s portrait is &quot;the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess—a mirror of the princess&quot;.

The painting was likely influenced by Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot;, of 1434. At the time, van Eyck&#x27;s painting hung in Philip&#x27;s palace, and would have been familiar to Velázquez. The &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; also has a mirror positioned at the back of the pictorial space, reflecting two figures who would have the same angle of vision as does the viewer of Velázquez&#x27;s painting; they are too small to identify, but it has been speculated that one may be intended as the artist himself, though he is not shown in the act of painting. According to Lucien Dällenbach:

== Interpretation ==
The elusiveness of &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, according to Dawson Carr, &quot;suggests that art, and life, are an illusion&quot;. The relationship between illusion and reality were central concerns in Spanish culture during the 17th century, figuring largely in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the best-known work of Spanish Baroque literature. In this respect, Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s play &quot;Life is a Dream&quot; is commonly seen as the literary equivalent of Velázquez&#x27;s painting:

Jon Manchip White notes that the painting can be seen as a résumé of the whole of Velázquez&#x27;s life and career, as well as a summary of his art to that point. He placed his only confirmed self-portrait in a room in the royal palace surrounded by an assembly of royalty, courtiers, and fine objects that represent his life at court. The art historian Svetlana Alpers suggests that, by portraying the artist at work in the company of royalty and nobility, Velázquez was claiming high status for both the artist and his art, and in particular to propose that painting is a liberal rather than a mechanical art. This distinction was a point of controversy at the time. It would have been significant to Velázquez, since the rules of the Order of Santiago excluded those whose occupations were mechanical. Kahr asserts that this was the best way for Velázquez to show that he was &quot;neither a craftsman or a tradesman, but an official of the court&quot;. Furthermore, this was a way to prove himself worthy of acceptance by the royal family.

Michel Foucault devoted the opening chapter of &quot;The Order of Things&quot; (1966) to an analysis of &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. Foucault describes the painting in meticulous detail, but in a language that is &quot;neither prescribed by, nor filtered through the various texts of art-historical investigation&quot;. Foucault viewed the painting without regard to the subject matter, nor to the artist&#x27;s biography, technical ability, sources and influences, social context, or relationship with his patrons. Instead he analyzes its conscious artifice, highlighting the complex network of visual relationships between painter, subject-model, and viewer:

For Foucault, &quot;Las Meninas&quot; illustrates the first signs of a new &quot;episteme&quot;, or way of thinking. It represents a midpoint between what he sees as the two &quot;great discontinuities&quot; in European thought, the classical and the modern: &quot;Perhaps there exists, in this painting by Velázquez, the representation as it were of Classical representation, and the definition of the space it opens up to us ... representation, freed finally from the relation that was impeding it, can offer itself as representation in its pure form.&quot;

In his 2015 analysis, Xavier d&#x27;Hérouville brings the painting closer to its first name, namely &quot;The Family of Philippe IV&quot;, which at the time earned it the term &quot;theology of painting&quot; by Luca Giordano, contemporary painter of Velázquez. Through this representation, the painter would have conceptualized the divine view of his creation. When the spectator places himself in front of the canvas, in place of the King&#x27;s study for which this painting was very exclusively intended, he finds himself instantly invested with the divine power, that of &quot;seeing without being seen&quot; &quot;the Family of Philip IV&quot;. The interface that constitutes this canvas must therefore be considered as a &quot;one-way mirror&quot; in which each of the protagonists of this representation looks at themselves, and behind which the monarch invests divine power, and his wife, can at leisure and in complete discretion to contemplate their life&#x27;s work, their &quot;Family&quot;, in the broadest sense of the term. Further still, this canvas can be seen not only as a summary of the state of advancement of his art at the time of painting, but also as a curriculum vitæ of Velázquez&#x27;s life and career. The latter having gone so far as to represent himself in this &quot;fresco&quot; at three key periods of his own existence within the Court of Spain: in the background and to the left, as the King&#x27;s painter, then to the right this time, at the very heart of &quot;the Family of Philip IV&quot;, alongside the governess, as valet of the King&#x27;s bedroom, and finally at the back and in the center, camped on the stairs, as Aposentador or Marshal of the Palace, the supreme function he exercised as the King&#x27;s best friend and confidant.

== &quot;Las Meninas&quot; as culmination of themes in Velázquez ==

Many aspects of &quot;Las Meninas&quot; relate to earlier works by Velázquez in which he plays with conventions of representation. In the &quot;Rokeby Venus&quot;—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although &quot;often described as looking at herself, [she] is more disconcertingly looking at us&quot;. In the early &quot;Christ in the House of Martha and Mary&quot; of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are clear that this is the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress.

In &quot;Las Hilanderas&quot;, believed to have been painted the year after &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, two different scenes from Ovid are shown: one in contemporary dress in the foreground, and the other partly in antique dress, played before a tapestry on the back wall of a room behind the first. According to the critic Sira Dambe, &quot;aspects of representation and power are addressed in this painting in ways closely connected with their treatment in &quot;Las Meninas&quot;&quot;. In a series of portraits of the late 1630s and 1640s—all now in the Prado—Velázquez painted clowns and other members of the royal household posing as gods, heroes, and philosophers; the intention is certainly partly comic, at least for those in the know, but in a highly ambiguous way.

Velázquez&#x27;s portraits of the royal family themselves had until then been straightforward, if often unflatteringly direct and highly complex in expression. On the other hand, his royal portraits, designed to be seen across vast palace rooms, feature more strongly than his other works the bravura handling for which he is famous: &quot;Velázquez&#x27;s handling of paint is exceptionally free, and as one approaches &quot;Las Meninas&quot; there is a point at which the figures suddenly dissolve into smears and blobs of paint. The long-handled brushes he used enabled him to stand back and judge the total effect.&quot;

== Influence ==
In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV&#x27;s private apartments, and was greatly impressed by &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. Giordano described the work as the &quot;theology of painting&quot;, and was inspired to paint &quot;A Homage to Velázquez&quot; (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as &quot;Las Meninas&quot;.

An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo of subjects depicted in &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa&#x27;s brother), and another the little person Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with little people, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo&#x27;s painting of &quot;The Family of the Artist&quot; also shows a composition similar to that of &quot;Las Meninas&quot;.

Francisco Goya etched a print of &quot;Las Meninas&quot; in 1778, and used Velázquez&#x27;s painting as the model for his &quot;Charles IV of Spain and His Family&quot;. As in &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, the royal family in Goya&#x27;s work is apparently visiting the artist&#x27;s studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of &quot;Las Meninas&quot; with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of &quot;imminent suffocation&quot;. Goya&#x27;s royal family is presented on a &quot;stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim smile, points and says: &#x27;Look at them and judge for yourself!&#x27; &quot;

The 19th-century British art collector William John Bankes travelled to Spain during the Peninsular War (1808–1814) and acquired a copy of &quot;Las Meninas&quot; painted by Mazo, which he believed to be an original preparatory oil sketch by Velázquez—although Velázquez did not usually paint studies. Bankes described his purchase as &quot;the glory of my collection&quot;, noting that he had been &quot;a long while in treaty for it and was obliged to pay a high price&quot;. 

A new appreciation for Velázquez&#x27;s less Italianate paintings developed after 1819, when Ferdinand VII opened the royal collection to the public. In 1879 John Singer Sargent painted a small-scale copy of &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, while his 1882 painting &quot;The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit&quot; is a homage to Velázquez&#x27;s panel. The Irish artist Sir John Lavery chose Velázquez&#x27;s masterpiece as the basis for his portrait &quot;The Royal Family at Buckingham Palace, 1913&quot;. George V visited Lavery&#x27;s studio during the execution of the painting, and, perhaps remembering the legend that Philip IV had daubed the cross of the Knights of Santiago on the figure of Velázquez, asked Lavery if he could contribute to the portrait with his own hand. According to Lavery, &quot;Thinking that royal blue might be an appropriate colour, I mixed it on the palette, and taking a brush he [George V] applied it to the Garter ribbon.&quot;

Between August and December 1957, Pablo Picasso painted a series of 58 interpretations of &quot;Las Meninas&quot;, and figures from it, which currently fill the &quot;Las Meninas&quot; room of the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, Spain. Picasso did not vary the characters within the series, but largely retained the naturalness of the scene; according to the museum, his works constitute an &quot;exhaustive study of form, rhythm, colour and movement&quot;. 

A print of 1973 by Richard Hamilton called &quot;Picasso&#x27;s Meninas&quot; draws on both Velázquez and Picasso. Photographer Joel-Peter Witkin was commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Culture to create a work titled &quot;Las Meninas, New Mexico&quot; (1987) which references Velázquez&#x27;s painting as well as other works by Spanish artists.

In 2004, the video artist Eve Sussman filmed &quot;89 Seconds at Alcázar&quot;, a high-definition video tableau inspired by &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. The work is a recreation of the moments leading up to and directly following the approximately 89 seconds when the royal family and their courtiers would have come together in the exact configuration of Velázquez&#x27;s painting. Sussman had assembled a team of 35, including an architect, a set designer, a choreographer, a costume designer, actors, and a film crew.

<text>Liebfraumilch or Liebfrauenmilch (German for &#x27;Our Lady&#x27;s Milk&#x27;, in reference to the Virgin Mary) is a style of semi-sweet white German wine which may be produced, mostly for export, in the regions Rheinhessen, Palatinate, Rheingau, and Nahe. The original German spelling of the word is , given to the wine produced from the vineyards of the &quot;Liebfrauenkirche&quot; or &quot;Church of Our Lady&quot; in the Rhineland-Palatinate city of Worms since the eighteenth century. The spelling &quot;Liebfraumilch&quot; is more common on labels of exported wine.

==Classification==
Back in the eighteenthh century, it was said that the term &quot;Liebfraumilch&quot; should only be used if the grapes grew in the area “as far as the tower of the Liebfrauenkirche casts its shadow”. But this rule was not anchored in law. This “genuine” Liebfraumilch is available as “Wormser Liebfrauenstift-Kirchenstück” from the winegrowers Gutzler, Schembs, Spohr and Valckenberg. 

The genuine Wormser Liebfrauenmilch and today&#x27;s “Wormser Liebfrauenstift-Kirchenstück” have a smoky taste that originates from the wooden house debris from the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688-1697). In those days, the debris from the town was deposited around the Liebfrauenkirche and vineyards were planted on it. 

The generic label is typically used to market vintages from anywhere in most of the major wine growing areas of Germany, the notable exception being Mosel. Wine with very similar characteristics but made from higher quality grapes can be labeled as Spätlese or Auslese. In the US and the UK, perhaps the best known example has been Blue Nun, which no longer uses the designation.

The term &quot;Liebfraumilch&quot; is associated with low quality wine, and, consequently, the German wine classification requires it only to be at the &quot;Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete&quot; (QbA) level—the third rank out of ten. However, it must also be from Rheinhessen, Pfalz, Nahe, or Rheingau, and the grapes must be at least 70% Riesling, Silvaner, or Müller-Thurgau, and it must have residual sugar.

German wine is classified roughly into ten categories:
&quot;Tafelwein&quot; (dining wine), &quot;Landwein&quot;, QbA (as mentioned above), followed by QbP (with predicate), followed by &quot;Kabinett&quot;, &quot;Spätlese&quot; (late harvest), &quot;Auslese&quot; (special selection), &quot;Beerenauslese&quot; (lit. berry selection), and &quot;Trockenbeerenauslese&quot; (dry berry selection). Somewhat apart sits the &quot;Eiswein&quot; (ice wine), which is generally understood to be at least on par with the &quot;Beerenauslese&quot;, but helped with both Botryitis (as is the &quot;Beerenauslese&quot;) in conjunction with natural cryo extraction (icewine grapes have to be processed at -7 °C). Overall, these quality levels are following extract per litre measures (density levels) as these are indicative of sugar levels. Blue Nun, as a result, sits at level 1 out of 8 and, despite its international success, is rarely considered in the domestic market.

==In popular culture==
When a rack of wine topples over in the 1932 Hollywood film &quot;Downstairs&quot;, the wine cellar caretaker Otto (Otto Hoffman) laments a broken bottle of , very likely to be a subtle joke.

In &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&quot;, in the chapter &quot;The Curse if Scotland&quot;, Lord Peter has a bottle of Liebfraumilch with his lunch.

In the book &quot;Desert Solitaire&quot;, by Edward Abbey, the author stops at a liquor store to purchase a bottle of liebfraumilch on his way to Mount Tukuhnikivatz.

In the episode of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;Dates&quot;, Del Boy mentions to the matchmaker that he would like a &quot;refined&quot; woman that can tell the difference between &quot;Liebfraumilch and a can of Tizer&quot;.

“…Soon she did return with a bottle of liebframilch…” in the song lyrics of &quot;Spill the Wine&quot; by Eric Burdon and War (live video version, 1970. Note that various words throughout the live video version song differ from the original recorded version).

In the book &quot;Confessions of Felix Krull&quot; by Thomas Mann, the priest of the main character which described as a man who loves life, drinks Liebfraumilch with a portion of Fines Herbs omelet for breakfast.

<text>Bicycle-friendly policies and practices help some people feel more comfortable about traveling by bicycle with other traffic. The level of bicycle-friendliness of an environment can be influenced by many factors including town planning and cycling infrastructure decisions. A stigma towards people who ride bicycles and fear of cycling is a social construct that needs to be fully understood when promoting a bicycle friendly culture. 

==Urban planning==

Assuming people prefer to get to their destination quickly, urban planning and zoning may affect whether schools, shops, public transport interchanges and other destination are within a reasonable cycling distance of the areas where people live. If urban form influences these issues, then compact and circular settlement patterns may promote cycling. In 1990, the Netherlands adopted the &quot;ABC&quot; guidelines, specifically limiting infrastructure developments that are major attractants to locations that are readily accessible by non-car users.
The manner in which the public roads network is designed, built and managed can have a significant effect on the utility and safety of cycling as transport. Settlements that provide a dense roads network consisting of interconnected streets will tend to encourage cycling.

In contrast, other communities may use a cul-de-sac based, housing estate/housing subdivision model where minor roads are disconnected and only feed into a street hierarchy of progressively more &quot;arterial&quot; type roads. Designs that propose to resolve the contradiction between the cul-de-sac and the traditional interconnected network, such as the fused grid, have been proposed and built with varying levels of success.

In the UK, the principle of &#x27;filtered permeability&#x27; has been proposed in some government guidance to maximise the ease of movement of cyclists and pedestrians, whilst constraining it for motor vehicles, see permeability.

==Cycling infrastructure==
Cycling infrastructure includes bikeways, maps, signs, signals, protected intersections and bicycle parking.

===Selection of cycling-friendly infrastructure===
==Benefits of bicycle-friendly communities==
A community&#x27;s infrastructure can affect its citizens’ health, especially in regard to obesity and physical activity. Cities that incorporate bicycle routes have a higher percentage of bicycle commuters. Studies have shown that even moderate increases in physical activity can have a substantial effect on health. Bicycling to work has been shown to decrease mortality by as much as 40%.

Bicycling is often used as an alternative to travel by car. Automobile travel provides the perception of increased mobility and convenience for travelers, but also has high costs associated with taxes, insurance, fuel, maintenance, road construction and repair, and contributes to air pollution. When infrastructure is built to allow consumers to choose between automobile and other forms of travel, it reduces a community&#x27;s automobile dependency and allows for more efficient transport choices and land usage.

==Recognition==
In the U.S., the League of American Bicyclists has formally recognized some cities as bicycle-friendly communities for &quot;providing safe accommodation and facilities for bicyclists and encouraging residents to bike for transportation and recreation.&quot;

==Tourism==

The British tourist board award holiday accommodation providers who are cycle friendly with a &quot;Cycle Friendly&quot; award.

The League of American Bicyclists designated New Orleans as a Bicycle Friendly City in 2011.

<text>Panthalassa, also known as the Panthalassic Ocean or Panthalassan Ocean (from Greek &quot;all&quot; and &quot;sea&quot;), was the vast superocean that encompassed planet Earth and surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea, the latest in a series of supercontinents in the history of Earth. During the Paleozoic–Mesozoic transition ( 250 ), the ocean occupied almost 70% of Earth&#x27;s surface, with the supercontinent Pangaea taking up less than half. The original, ancient ocean floor has now completely disappeared because of the continuous subduction along the continental margins on its circumference. Panthalassa is also referred to as the Paleo-Pacific (&quot;old Pacific&quot;) or Proto-Pacific because the Pacific Ocean is a direct continuation of Panthalassa.

==Formation==

The supercontinent Rodinia began to break up 870–845  probably as a consequence of a superplume caused by mantle slab avalanches along the margins of the supercontinent. In a second episode 750  the western half of Rodinia started to rift apart: western Kalahari and South China broke away from the western margins of Laurentia; and by 720  Australia and East Antarctica had also separated. In the Early Jurassic the Pacific Plate opened originating from a triple junction between the Panthalassic Farallon, Phoenix, and Izanagi plates. Panthalassa can be reconstructed based on magnetic lineations and fracture zones preserved in the western Pacific.

== Reconstruction of ocean basin ==
Most of the oceanic plates that formed the ocean floor of Panthalassa have been subducted and so traditional plate tectonic reconstructions based on magnetic anomalies can therefore be used only for remains from the Cretaceous and later. The former margins of the ocean, however, contain allochthonous terranes with preserved Triassic–Jurassic intra-Panthalassic volcanic arcs, including Kolyma–Omolon (northeast Asia), Anadyr–Koryak (east Asia), Oku–Niikappu (Japan), and Wrangellia and Stikinia (western North America).
Furthermore, seismic tomography is being used to identify subducted slabs in the mantle from which the location of former Panthalassic subduction zones can be derived. A series of such subduction zones, called Telkhinia, defines two separate oceans or systems of oceanic plates—the Pontus and Thalassa oceans.
Named marginal oceans or oceanic plates include (clockwise) Mongol-Okhotsk (now a suture between Mongolia and Sea of Okhotsk), Oimyakon (between Asian craton and Kolyma-Omolon), Slide Mountain Ocean (British Columbia), and Mezcalera (western Mexico).

===Eastern margin===
The western margin (modern coordinates) of Laurentia originated during the Neoproterozoic break-up of Rodinia. The North American Cordillera is an accretionary orogen, which grew by the progressive addition of allochthonous terranes along this margin from the Late Palaeozoic. Devonian back-arc volcanism reveals how this eastern Panthalassic margin developed into the active margin it still is in the mid-Palaeozoic.
Most of the continental fragments, volcanic arcs, and ocean basins added to Laurentia this way contained faunas of Tethyan or Asian affinity. Similar terranes added to the northern Laurentia, in contrast, have affinities with Baltica, Siberia, and the northern Caledonies. The latter terranes were probably accreted along the eastern Panthalassa margin by a Caribbean–Scotia-style subduction system.

===Western margin===
The evolution of the Panthalassa–Tethys boundary is poorly known because little oceanic crust is preserved—both the Izanagi and the conjugate Pacific Ocean floor is subducted and the ocean ridge that separated them probably subducted 60–55 . Today, the region is dominated by the collision of the Australian Plate with a complex network of plate boundaries in south-east Asia, including the Sundaland block. Spreading along the Pacific-Phoenix ridge ended 83 Ma at the Osbourn Trough at the Tonga-Kermadec Trench.

During the Permian, atolls developed near the Equator on the mid-Panthalassic seamounts. As Panthalassa subducted along its western margin during the Triassic and Early Jurassic, those seamounts and palaeo-atolls were accreted as allochthonous limestone blocks and fragments along the Asian margin. One such migrating atoll complex now form a and body of limestone in central Kyushu, south-west Japan.

Fusuline foraminifera, a now extinct order of single-celled organisms, diversified extensively and developed gigantism—the genus &quot;Eopolydiexodina&quot;, for example, reached up to in size—and structural sophistication, including symbiont relationships with photosynthesising algae, during the Late Carboniferous and Permian, in what is known as the Carboniferous-Earliest Permian Biodiversification Event. The Capitanian mass extinction event 260 , however, put an end to that development, with only dwarf taxa persisting throughout the Permian until the final fusuline extinction in the Great Dying 252 . Permian fusulines also developed a remarkable provincialism by which fusulines can be grouped into six domains.
Because of the large size of Panthalassa, a hundred million years could separate the accretion of different groups of fusulines. Assuming a minimum accretion rate of , the seamount chains on which those groups evolved would be separated by at least . Those groups apparently evolved in completely different environments.

A significant sea-level drop at the end of the Permian led to the end-Capitanian extinction event. The cause for the extinction is disputed, but a likely candidate is an episode of global cooling, which transformed a large amount of sea-water into continental ice.

Seamounts accreted in eastern Australia as parts of the New England orogen reveal the hotspot history of Panthalassa. From the Late Devonian to the Carboniferous, Gondwana and Panthalassa converged along the eastern margin of Australia along a west-dipping subduction system, which produced (west to east) a magmatic arc, a forearc basin, and an accretionary wedge. Subduction ceased along that margin in the Late Carboniferous and jumped eastward. From the Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian the New England orogen was dominated by an extensional setting related to a subduction to strike-slip transition. Subduction was re-initiated in the Permian and the granitic rocks of the New England Batholith were produced by a magmatic arc, indicating the presence of an active plate margin along most of the orogen. Permian to Cretaceous remains of the convergent margin, preserved as fragments in Zealandia (New Zealand, New Caledonia, and the Lord Howe Rise), were rifted off Australia during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary break-up of eastern Gondwana and the opening of the Tasman Sea.

The Cretaceous Junction Plate, located north of Australia, separated the eastern Tethys from Panthalassa.

==Palaeo-oceanography==
Panthalassa was a hemisphere-sized ocean, much larger than the modern Pacific. It could be expected that the large size would result in relatively simple ocean current circulation patterns, such as a single gyre in each hemisphere, and a mostly stagnant and stratified ocean. Modelling studies, however, suggest that an east–west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient was present in which the coldest water was brought to the surface by upwelling in the east while the warmest water extended west into the Tethys Ocean.
Subtropical gyres dominated the circulation pattern. The two hemispherical belts were separated by the undulating Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

In northern Panthalassa, there were mid-latitude westerlies north of 60°N with easterlies between 60°N and the Equator. Atmospheric circulation north of 30°N is associated with the North Panthalassa High, which created Ekman convergence between 15°N and 50°N and Ekman divergence between 5°N and 10°N. A pattern developed that resulted in Sverdrup transport that went northward in divergence regions and southward in convergence regions. Western boundary currents resulted in an anti-cyclonic subtropical North Panthalassa gyre at mid-latitudes and a meridional anti-cyclonic circulation centred on 20°N.

In tropical northern Panthalassa, trade winds created westward flows while equatorward flows were created by westerlies at higher latitudes. Consequently, trade winds moved water away from Gondwana towards Laurasia in the northern Panthalassa Equatorial Current. When the western margins of Panthalassa were reached, intense western boundary currents would form the Eastern Laurasia Current. At mid-latitudes, the North Panthalassa Current would bring the water back east where a weak Northwestern Gondwana Current would finally close the gyre. The accumulation of water along the western margin, coupled with the Coriolis effect, would have created a Panthalassa Equatorial Counter Current.

In the southern Panthalassa, the four currents of the subtropical gyre, the South Panthalassa Gyre, rotated counterclockwise. The South Equatorial Panthalassa Current flowed westward between the Equator and 10°S into the western, intense South Panthalassa Current. The South Polar Current then completed the gyre as the Southwestern Gondwana Current. Near the poles easterlies created a subpolar gyre that rotated clockwise.

<doc id="222154" wikidata="Q125116225" url="?curid=222154" title="Blastulation">
<text>Blastulation is the stage in early animal embryonic development that produces the blastula. In mammalian development, the blastula develops into the blastocyst with a differentiated inner cell mass and an outer trophectoderm. The blastula (from Greek &quot;&quot; ( meaning &quot;sprout&quot;)) is a hollow sphere of cells known as blastomeres surrounding an inner fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel. Embryonic development begins with a sperm fertilizing an egg cell to become a zygote, which undergoes many cleavages to develop into a ball of cells called a morula. Only when the blastocoel is formed does the early embryo become a blastula. The blastula precedes the formation of the gastrula in which the germ layers of the embryo form.

A common feature of a vertebrate blastula is that it consists of a layer of blastomeres, known as the blastoderm, which surrounds the blastocoel. In mammals, the blastocyst contains an embryoblast (or inner cell mass) that will eventually give rise to the definitive structures of the fetus, and a trophoblast which goes on to form the extra-embryonic tissues.

During blastulation, a significant amount of activity occurs within the early embryo to establish cell polarity, cell specification, axis formation, and to regulate gene expression. In many animals, such as &quot;Drosophila&quot; and &quot;Xenopus&quot;, the mid blastula transition (MBT) is a crucial step in development during which the maternal mRNA is degraded and control over development is passed to the embryo. Many of the interactions between blastomeres are dependent on cadherin expression, particularly E-cadherin in mammals and EP-cadherin in amphibians.

The study of the blastula, and of cell specification has many implications in stem cell research, and assisted reproductive technology. In &quot;Xenopus&quot;, blastomeres behave as pluripotent stem cells which can migrate down several pathways, depending on cell signaling. By manipulating the cell signals during the blastula stage of development, various tissues can be formed. This potential can be instrumental in regenerative medicine for disease and injury cases. In vitro fertilisation involves the transfer of an embryo into a uterus for implantation.

== Development ==
The blastula stage of early embryo development begins with the appearance of the blastocoel. The origin of the blastocoel in &quot;Xenopus&quot; has been shown to be from the first cleavage furrow, which is widened and sealed with tight junctions to create a cavity.

In many organisms the development of the embryo up to this point and for the early part of the blastula stage is controlled by maternal mRNA, so called because it was produced in the egg prior to fertilization and is therefore exclusively from the mother.

=== Midblastula transition ===
In many organisms including &quot;Xenopus&quot; and &quot;Drosophila&quot;, the midblastula transition usually occurs after a particular number of cell divisions for a given species, and is defined by the ending of the synchronous cell division cycles of the early blastula development, and the lengthening of the cell cycles by the addition of the G1 and G2 phases. Prior to this transition, cleavage occurs with only the synthesis and mitosis phases of the cell cycle. The addition of the two growth phases into the cell cycle allows for the cells to increase in size, as up to this point the blastomeres undergo reductive divisions in which the overall size of the embryo does not increase, but more cells are created. This transition begins the growth in size of the organism.

The mid-blastula transition is also characterized by a marked increase in transcription of new, non-maternal mRNA transcribed from the genome of the organism. Large amounts of the maternal mRNA are destroyed at this point, either by proteins such as SMAUG in &quot;Drosophila&quot; or by microRNA. These two processes shift the control of the embryo from the maternal mRNA to the nuclei.

== Structure ==
A blastula (blastocyst in mammals), is a sphere of cells surrounding a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel. The blastocoel contains amino acids, proteins, growth factors, sugars, ions and other components which are necessary for cellular differentiation. The blastocoel also allows blastomeres to move during the process of gastrulation.

In &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos, the blastula is composed of three different regions. The animal cap forms the roof of the blastocoel and goes on primarily to form ectodermal derivatives. The equatorial or marginal zone, which compose the walls of the blastocoel differentiate primarily into mesodermal tissue. The vegetal mass is composed of the blastocoel floor and primarily develops into endodermal tissue.

In the mammalian blastocyst there are three lineages that give rise to later tissue development. The epiblast gives rise to the fetus itself while the trophoblast develops into part of the placenta and the primitive endoderm becomes the yolk sac. In the mouse embryo, blastocoel formation begins at the 32-cell stage. During this process, water enters the embryo, aided by an osmotic gradient which is the result of sodium–potassium pumps that produce a high sodium gradient on the basolateral side of the trophectoderm. This movement of water is facilitated by aquaporins. A seal is created by tight junctions of the epithelial cells that line the blastocoel.

=== Cellular adhesion ===

Tight junctions are very important in embryo development. In the blastula, these cadherin mediated cell interactions are essential to development of epithelium which are most important to paracellular transport, maintenance of cell polarity and the creation of a permeability seal to regulate blastocoel formation. These tight junctions arise after the polarity of epithelial cells is established which sets the foundation for further development and specification. Within the blastula, inner blastomeres are generally non-polar while epithelial cells demonstrate polarity.

Mammalian embryos undergo compaction around the 8-cell stage where E-cadherins as well as alpha and beta catenins are expressed. This process makes a ball of embryonic cells which are capable of interacting, rather than a group of diffuse and undifferentiated cells. E-cadherin adhesion defines the apico-basal axis in the developing embryo and turns the embryo from an indistinct ball of cells to a more polarized phenotype which sets the stage for further development into a fully formed blastocyst.

&quot;Xenopus&quot; membrane polarity is established with the first cell cleavage. Amphibian EP-cadherin and XB/U cadherin perform a similar role as E-cadherin in mammals establishing blastomere polarity and solidifying cell-cell interactions which are crucial for further development.

== Clinical implications ==
=== Fertilization technologies ===

Experiments with implantation in mice show that hormonal induction, superovulation and artificial insemination successfully produce preimplantation mouse embryos. In the mice, ninety percent of the females were induced by mechanical stimulation to undergo pregnancy and implant at least one embryo. These results prove to be encouraging because they provide a basis for potential implantation in other mammalian species, such as humans.

=== Stem cells ===
Blastula-stage cells can behave as pluripotent stem cells in many species. Pluripotent stem cells are the starting point to produce organ specific cells that can potentially aid in repair and prevention of injury and degeneration. Combining the expression of transcription factors and locational positioning of the blastula cells can lead to the development of induced functional organs and tissues. Pluripotent &quot;Xenopus&quot; cells, when used in an in vivo strategy, were able to form into functional retinas. By transplanting them to the eye field on the neural plate, and by inducing several mis-expressions of transcription factors, the cells were committed to the retinal lineage and could guide vision based behavior in the &quot;Xenopus&quot;.

<doc id="222156" wikidata="Q1756302" url="?curid=222156" title="Screaming Life/Fopp">
<text>Screaming Life/Fopp is a compilation album by the American rock band Soundgarden that combines their debut EPs in their entirety into a single release. It was originally released on May 11, 1990, through Sub Pop Records. Sub Pop later remastered and reissued the album on November 24, 2013.

==Overview==
The album combines the band&#x27;s first two studio EPs: &quot;Screaming Life&quot; (1987) and &quot;Fopp&quot; (1988). It was released in 1990 by Sub Pop despite having been recorded in 1987-88, after Soundgarden&#x27;s two subsequent full-length releases, &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; (1988) and &quot;Louder than Love&quot; (1989), had gained them considerable popularity. There are two cover songs on the album; &quot;Swallow My Pride&quot; is a Green River cover and &quot;Fopp&quot; is an Ohio Players cover.

The 2013 re-issue contains an extra track, &quot;Sub Pop Rock City&quot;, that is not present on the original release. &quot;Sub Pop Rock City&quot; was a track recorded during the same pre-&quot;Ultramega OK&quot; era but previously only available on the &quot;Sub Pop 200&quot; compilation.

Maçek III reviewed the 2013 remastered version of the album and said, &quot;As for the &#x27;remastering&#x27; aspect, to be sure, the album sounds as good as it ever has, especially to those of us who memorized every note by way of audio cassettes. However, the new version doesn&#x27;t sound markedly different from the previous release on CD, mostly because the songs were recorded tough and rough in the first place.&quot;

==Track listing==
All lyrics written by Chris Cornell, all music composed by Kim Thayil, except where noted.

<text>In Indonesian folklore, the Orang Pendek (Indonesian for &#x27;short person&#x27;) is the most common name given to a creature said to inhabit remote, mountainous forests on the island of Sumatra. The creature has allegedly been seen and documented for at least 100 years by forest tribes, local villagers, Dutch colonists, and Western scientists and travelers. Consensus among witnesses is that the animal is a ground-dwelling, bipedal primate covered in short fur, standing between 80 and 150 cm (30 and 60 in) tall.

== Location ==

While Orang Pendek and similar animals have historically been said to dwell in the landscapes of Sumatra in Indonesia, and Southeast Asia, claimed sightings have occurred largely within the Kerinci Regency of central Sumatra and especially within the borders of Kerinci Seblat National Park (&quot;Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat&quot; or TNKS). The park, 2° south of the equator, is located within the Bukit Barisan mountain range and features some of the most remote primary rainforest in the world. Habitat types within the park include lowland dipterocarp rainforest, montane forests, and volcanic alpine formations on Mount Kerinci, the second highest peak in Indonesia.

==Attestations==
The following sources make reference to the purported creature:

=== Suku Anak Dalam ===
The Suku Anak Dalam (&quot;Children of the Inner-forest&quot;) – also known as Orang Kubu, Orang Batin Simbilan, or Orang Rimba – are groups of nomadic people who have traditionally lived throughout the lowland forests of Jambi and South Sumatra. According to their legends, Orang Pendek has been a part of their world and a co-inhabitant of the forest for centuries.

In Bukit Duabelas, the Orang Rimba speak of a creature, known as &quot;Hantu Pendek&quot;, whose description closely matches that of Orang Pendek. However, Hantu Pendek is thought of more as a supernatural entity or demon rather than an animal, with the name translating to &quot;short ghost&quot;. According to the Orang Rimba, the Hantu Pendek travel in groups of five or six, subsisting on wild yams and hunting animals with small axes. Accounts of the creature claim it ambushes unfortunate Orang Rimba hunters traveling alone in the forest. Along the Makekal River on the western edge of Bukit Duabelas, people recount a legend of how their ancestors outsmarted these cunning yet dim-witted creatures during a hunting trip, and the story is often used to boast of their intellect and reason.

=== Dutch colonists ===
Dutch settlers in the early 20th century provided Westerners with their modern introduction to Orang Pendek-like animals in Sumatra. One account in particular is widely reported:
* &quot;Mr van Heerwarden, who described an encounter he had while surveying land in 1923&quot;:

I discovered a dark and hairy creature on a branch... The sedapa was also hairy on the front of its body; the colour there was a little lighter than on the back. The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached to a little above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs seemed to me rather short. I did not see its feet, but I did see some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.

<text>A subprefecture is an administrative division of a country that is below prefecture or province.

==Albania==
There are twelve Albanian counties or prefectures, each of which is divided into several districts, sometimes translated as subprefectures.

:Examples: District of Korçë, District of Sarandë

==Brazil==
In Brazil the subprefectures () are administrative divisions of some big cities, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The head of a subprefecture, the &quot;subprefeito&quot;, is indicated by the municipality&#x27;s mayor (in Brazil called &quot;prefeito&quot;).

In São Paulo there are 32 subprefectures. The largest in total area, Parelheiros, covers 353.5 km2, and the most populous, Capela do Socorro, has more than 600,000 inhabitants.

==Burkina Faso==
Example: Djibasso Subprefecture

==Central African Republic==
==Chad==

Examples: N&#x27;Gouri Subprefecture, Massakory Subprefecture

==China==

It was used in Qing dynasty. Called &quot;ting&quot; (廳 or 厅) in Chinese, it is also on the same level as a department (州) and a district (縣), and is below a prefecture (府).

Example:
* Aihun Ting in the late-Qing Heilongjiang

A separate term also translated as subprefecture was &quot;jūnmínfǔ&quot; ( , for instance at Qianshan in Guangdong.

==France==
A subprefecture is the administrative town of an arrondissement where an arrondissement does not contain the prefecture. The civil servant in charge of local executive power is the &quot;sous-préfet&quot;.

Examples: Aix-en-Provence, Apt, Arles, Bayonne, Boulogne-Billancourt, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Cambrai, Chalon-sur-Saône, Château-Thierry, Cherbourg, Le Havre, Narbonne, Reims, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Saint-Malo, Saint-Omer, Sedan, Vichy.

==Guinea==
==Ivory Coast==

A &quot;sous-préfecture&quot; is an administrative division of a department in Ivory Coast.

Examples: Anyama Subprefecture, Bingerville Subprefecture, Brofodoumé Subprefecture, Songon Subprefecture

==Japan==

Some Japanese prefectures have branch offices called 支庁 (shichō) in Japanese, which are translated in English as &quot;subprefectures&quot;, &quot;branch offices&quot;, or &quot;branches of the prefectural government&quot;. See details in Subprefectures of Japan and an example of Kushiro Subprefecture. 

==Taiwan==
* The word &quot;subprefecture&quot; is used to translate the term &quot;tīng&quot; (廳) from Chinese. This was a type of subdivision under Qing dynasty rule.
:* Examples include Tamsui Subprefecture (淡水廳 dàn shuĭ tīng) and Kavalan (Ga&#x27;malan) Subprefecture (噶瑪蘭廳 gá mă lán tīng, of Yilan City) (both in Taiwan).

* Under Japanese rule, the term 廳 (chō) is translated to prefecture, so 支廳 (shichō) is translated to subprefecture.

<doc id="222165" wikidata="Q270935" url="?curid=222165" title="Chris Cornell">
<text>Christopher John Cornell ( Boyle; July 20, 1964 – May 18, 2017) was an American musician. He was best known as the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and the primary lyricist for the rock bands Soundgarden and Audioslave. He also had a solo career and contributed to numerous movie soundtracks. Cornell was the founder and frontman of Temple of the Dog, a one-off tribute band dedicated to his late friend, musician Andrew Wood. Several music journalists, fan polls and fellow musicians have regarded Cornell as one of the greatest rock singers of all time.

Cornell is considered a key figure of the 1990s grunge movement with an extensive songwriting history, a nearly four-octave vocal range and a powerful vocal belting technique. Cornell released four solo studio albums, &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; (1999), &quot;Carry On&quot; (2007), &quot;Scream&quot; (2009), and &quot;Higher Truth&quot; (2015); the live album &quot;Songbook&quot; (2011); and two compilations, &quot;The Roads We Choose&quot; (2007) and &quot;Chris Cornell&quot; (2018), the latter released posthumously. He received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his song &quot;The Keeper&quot;, which appeared in the 2011 film &quot;Machine Gun Preacher&quot;, and co-wrote and performed &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, the theme song to the 2006 James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. His last solo release before his death was the charity single &quot;The Promise&quot;, written for the ending credits for the 2016 film of the same name.

Cornell sold 14.8 million albums, 8.8 million digital songs, and 300 million on-demand audio streams in the U.S. alone, as well as over 30 million records worldwide. Nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, he won three. Cornell was ranked No. 4 on the list of &quot;Heavy Metal&#x27;s All-Time Top 100 Vocalists&quot; by &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, No. 9 on the list of &quot;Best Lead Singers of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, No. 80 on the list of the &quot;200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and No. 12 on MTV&#x27;s &quot;22 Greatest Voices in Music&quot;. He was voted &quot;Rock&#x27;s Greatest Singer&quot; by readers of &quot;Guitar World&quot;.

Cornell struggled with depression for most of his life. He was found dead in his Detroit hotel room in the early hours of May 18, 2017, after performing at a Soundgarden concert an hour earlier at the Fox Theatre. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.

==Early life==
Cornell was born Christopher John Boyle on July 20, 1964, in Seattle, Washington, where he was raised. His parents are Edward F. Boyle, a pharmacist of Irish Catholic descent, and Karen Boyle ( Cornell), an accountant of Jewish background and self-proclaimed psychic. Cornell was one of six children; he had two older brothers and three younger sisters. He and his siblings adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Cornell, following their parents&#x27; divorce when they were teenagers. Cornell attended Christ the King, a Catholic elementary school, where he performed for the first time in front of a crowd, singing the 1960s anti-war song &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot;. When he was in seventh grade, his mother pulled him and his sister out of Catholic school for fear they were about to be expelled for being too inquisitive. He recalled the episode in a 1994 interview with &quot;Request&quot; magazine: &quot;With a religion like that, it&#x27;s not designed for anyone to question. Being young people who have a natural curiosity and half a brain, you&#x27;re going to start finding inconsistencies, which there are tons of in organized religion. We both sort of made it clear in classroom situations that we didn&#x27;t get it. &#x27;Explain this to me.&#x27; And they couldn&#x27;t, so we started creating a lot of problems.&quot; Cornell subsequently attended Shorewood High School, where he later dropped out.
Cornell traced his musical influences back to Little Richard via The Beatles. He spent a two-year period between the ages of nine and eleven solidly listening to The Beatles after finding a large collection of Beatles records abandoned in the basement of a neighbor&#x27;s house. Cornell described himself at this age as a loner; he was able to deal with his anxiety around other people through rock music. During his teenage years, he spiraled into severe depression, dropped out of school, and almost never left the house. At the age of 12, Cornell had access to alcohol and marijuana; he used them daily by 13, stopped for a year, but relapsed at age 15 for another year until he turned to music. At 14, he had a bad PCP experience and later had panic disorder and agoraphobia.

Cornell took piano and guitar lessons as a child. He credited his mother for saving his life when she bought him a snare drum, the instrument he first adopted on his path to becoming a rock musician. Before he was a successful musician, Cornell worked as a busboy, as a dishwasher, as a fish monger at a seafood wholesaler, and as a sous-chef at Ray&#x27;s Boathouse in Seattle.

In the early 1980s, Cornell was a member of a Seattle-based cover band called The Shemps, which featured bassist Hiro Yamamoto. After Yamamoto left The Shemps, the band recruited guitarist Kim Thayil. Cornell and Yamamoto stayed in contact, and after The Shemps broke up, the pair started jamming together, eventually bringing Thayil in to join them.

==Recording career==
===1984–1997 and 2010–2017: Soundgarden===

Soundgarden was formed in 1984 by Cornell, Thayil, and Yamamoto, with Cornell originally on drums and vocals. In 1985, they enlisted Scott Sundquist to take over as drummer so that Cornell could concentrate on vocals. Soundgarden&#x27;s first recordings were three songs that appeared on a compilation for C/Z Records called &quot;Deep Six&quot;. In 1986, Sundquist, who by that point had a wife and a child, decided to leave the band and spend time with his family. He was replaced by Matt Cameron, the drummer for Skin Yard, who became Soundgarden&#x27;s permanent drummer.

Soundgarden signed to Sub Pop, releasing the &quot;Screaming Life&quot; EP in 1987 and the &quot;Fopp&quot; EP in 1988 (a combination of the two was issued as &quot;Screaming Life/Fopp&quot; in 1990). Though the band was being courted by major labels, they signed to independent label SST Records in 1988 to release their debut album, &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;, for which they earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990. The band subsequently signed with A&amp;M Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign to a major label.

In 1989, Soundgarden released their second effort and their first album for a major label, &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s release, Yamamoto left the band to finish his master&#x27;s degree in physical chemistry at Western Washington University. He was replaced by former Nirvana guitarist Jason Everman. Everman was fired following the band&#x27;s tour in support of &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;. In 1990, they were joined by a new bassist, Ben Shepherd.

Along with Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden quickly became one of the most successful bands from Seattle&#x27;s emerging grunge scene in the early 1990s. With Shepherd, the new line-up recorded &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success and exposure amid the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene. &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; included the singles &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, &quot;Outshined&quot; and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;. The three singles gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations, while the videos for &quot;Outshined&quot; and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; gained considerable airtime on MTV. The song &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; and its music video was the subject of widespread controversy in 1991, and the video was removed from MTV&#x27;s playlist. &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was later covered by Johnny Cash on his 1996 album, &quot;Unchained&quot;. &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot; was released (along with the B-side &quot;HIV Baby&quot;) as a 7&quot; single through Sub Pop&#x27;s &quot;Single of the Month&quot; club a full year before the release of &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, and later re-recorded for the album. With &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, Soundgarden found their first mainstream success: it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992 and was later ranked number 45 in the October 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time.

Soundgarden&#x27;s fourth studio album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Superunknown&quot;, proved to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough album. Upon its release in March 1994, &quot;Superunknown&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album launched several successful singles, including &quot;Spoonman&quot; and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, and brought the band international recognition. &quot;Superunknown&quot; achieved quintuple platinum status in the United States, triple platinum status in Canada, and gold status in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the Netherlands. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Superunknown&quot; four out of five stars. Reviewer J.D. Considine said &quot;Superunknown&quot; &quot;demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career&quot;. Considine criticized &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;Half&quot;, stating that the former is &quot;not a very good song&quot;, while the latter &quot;is the virtual definition of a B-side.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Superunknown&quot; actually tries to broaden its audience by breaking heavy-metal genre barriers that Soundgarden used to accept.&quot; He added that &quot;Soundgarden ... want[s] something different from standard heavy metal.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album an A, saying &quot;Soundgarden is pumped and primed on &quot;Superunknown&quot;, and they deliver the goods.&quot; He praised it as a &quot;hard-rock milestone—a boiling vat of volcanic power, record-making smarts, and &#x27;90s anomie and anxiety that sets a new standard for anything called metal.&quot; The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. Two singles from &quot;Superunknown&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;Spoonman&quot;, won Grammy Awards, and the music video for &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; won a MTV Video Music Award and a Clio Award. &quot;Superunknown&quot; was ranked number 336 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; was ranked number 25 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest songs of the &#x27;90s.

The band&#x27;s fifth album was 1996&#x27;s self-produced &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;. The album spawned several singles, including &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;, &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; and &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot;. &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; was notably less heavy than the group&#x27;s preceding albums and marked a further departure from the band&#x27;s grunge roots. Soundgarden explained at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric.&quot;

However, tensions within the group arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell reportedly clashing over Cornell&#x27;s desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band&#x27;s trademark. Despite favorable reviews, the album couldn&#x27;t match the sales of &quot;Superunknown&quot;.

In 1997, Soundgarden received another Grammy award nomination for the lead single &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;. As tensions grew within the band, reportedly due to internal strife over its creative direction, Soundgarden announced that it was disbanding on April 9, 1997. In a 1998 interview, Thayil said, &quot;It was pretty obvious from everybody&#x27;s general attitude over the course of the previous half-year that there was some dissatisfaction.&quot;

On January 1, 2010, Cornell alluded to a Soundgarden reunion via his Twitter account, writing: &quot;The 12-year break is over and school is back in session. Sign up now. Knights of the Soundtable ride again!&quot; The message linked to a website that featured a picture of the group performing live and a place for fans to enter their e-mail address to get updates on the reunion. Entering that information unlocked an archival video for the song &quot;Get on the Snake&quot; from Soundgarden&#x27;s second studio album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;.

In March 2010, Soundgarden announced that they would be headlining Lollapalooza 2010. Soundgarden made the announcement through their website and email list. On April 16, 2010, Soundgarden held a secret show at the Showbox Theater on First Avenue in downtown Seattle, publicized via the band&#x27;s mailing list. The show was billed as &quot;Nudedragons&quot;, an anagram for Soundgarden.

Asked in August 2010 if Soundgarden would record new material, Cornell replied, &quot;it would be exciting to record one song, to hear how Soundgarden-ish that might be this much time later. But for me, it&#x27;s been more of a trip relearning the songs and playing them together. Some of the songs we&#x27;re approaching we&#x27;ve never played live.&quot;

Soundgarden made their first television appearance since their reunion on the second episode of Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s TBS show, &quot;Conan&quot;, on November 9, 2010, and toured North America in summer 2011. In summer 2012, Soundgarden released a new single and video, &quot;Live to Rise&quot;, for &quot;The Avengers&quot; movie soundtrack. Their sixth album, &quot;King Animal&quot;, was released in November 2012 to largely positive reviews.

Soundgarden had continued to tour worldwide, and guitarist Kim Thayil mentioned in several interviews that the band was to begin work on material for their seventh album.

Following Cornell&#x27;s death, the surviving members of Soundgarden discussed the possibility of moving on with a replacement for him, but Thayil confirmed in an October 2018 interview with &quot;Seattle Times&quot; that the band had once again dissolved. Speaking to &quot;Music Radar&quot; magazine in a July 2019 interview, Thayil also said that the surviving members of Soundgarden are trying to finish and release the album they were working on with Cornell. However, the master files of Cornell&#x27;s vocal recordings are currently being withheld, and they can&#x27;t complete the album without it.

===1998–2000 and 2006–2017: Solo career===
In 1998, Cornell began working on material for a solo album upon which he collaborated with Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider of the band Eleven. The album, titled &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;, was released on September 21, 1999. In his first ever solo tour to support &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;, Cornell spent seven months on the road from September 13, 1999, to March 7, 2000. He played 61 shows, two of which coincided with the debut of the album on September 21 and 22, 1999 at the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood California. Attendance was high, considering that Cornell performed the initial shows before fans were even familiar with the music. The touring band included several contributing musicians on the album: Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Rick Markmann, and Greg Upchurch. &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; proved commercially unsuccessful, selling 393,000 copies in the U.S.; however, the album&#x27;s single &quot;Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot; was nominated for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 2000 Grammy Awards. Cornell recorded a French version of the song that was released as a bonus track on &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;″s deluxe version and on the Japanese and European editions. The album also includes &quot;Wave Goodbye&quot;, Cornell&#x27;s tribute to his late friend Jeff Buckley. It has been noted that &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; is influenced by Buckley&#x27;s songwriting and distinctive vocal style. The album was re-released in 2015 on CD and vinyl and retitled &quot;Euphoria Mourning&quot;, with Cornell stating in the press release that he had originally intended that title for the album, but his manager at the time, Jim Guerinot, suggested that &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; without the &quot;u&quot; would be more fitting. &quot;The title was so beautifully poetic to begin with, just the concept of euphoria in mourning; it was a moment I felt inspired and I let all the air out of it. So when we decided to do its first vinyl release I thought, I want to change the fuckin&#x27; title! [Laughs] It&#x27;s time to change it,&quot; Cornell stated.
During this period, an unreleased song called &quot;Heart of Honey&quot; was recorded in collaboration with Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider. According to Johannes, &quot;Heart of Honey&quot; was recorded for the film &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; but not used. The song was leaked on the Internet. While doing solo tours between 2011 and 2016, Cornell would often pay tribute to the late Natasha Shneider and perform &quot;When I&#x27;m Down&quot;, (from the album &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; that Shneider produced) accompanied by a vinyl recording of the original piano track that Shneider performed for the song.

Though not officially released on CD, an hour-long acoustic concert Cornell performed on September 7, 2006, at O-Baren in Stockholm, is widely available for download under the title &quot;Chris Cornell: Unplugged in Sweden&quot;. A promotional CD for his solo album, &quot;Carry On&quot;, was released in March 2007, titled &quot;The Roads We Choose – A Retrospective&quot;. The 17-song CD included songs from Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Audioslave and Cornell&#x27;s solo work.

On June 5, 2007, Cornell released his second solo album, &quot;Carry On&quot;, produced by Steve Lillywhite. It debuted at number 17 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Among the artists who accompanied him on his second solo release was friend Gary Lucas, who contributed acoustic guitar to some of the tracks. Cornell stated that he was always writing, and that there were some songs that he was not able to put onto an Audioslave album. While recording his second solo album, Cornell was involved in a motorcycle accident. He was apparently &quot;rear-ended by a truck in Studio City, Los Angeles while riding his motorcycle&quot; and &quot;catapulted 20 feet into the air.&quot; He was able to walk away from the accident but had severe cuts and bruises. He returned to the studio later that day.

In 2007, Cornell appeared as a supporting act to Aerosmith on at least two legs of their 2007 world tour—Dublin, London, and Hyde Park—and to Linkin Park in Australia and New Zealand. These shows formed part of his own ongoing world tour, which began in April 2007 and continued into 2008 and 2009. Cornell described his touring band—comprising guitarists Yogi Lonich and Peter Thorn, bassist Corey McCormick and drummer Jason Sutter—as &quot;musicians that could get the whole picture&quot;, playing music by Soundgarden and Audioslave, as well as his solo material.

In 2008, Cornell was featured on the main stage of Linkin Park&#x27;s Projekt Revolution tour. While touring with the band, he teamed up with lead vocalist Chester Bennington to perform Temple of the Dog&#x27;s &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, and with Street Drum Corps for a number of Soundgarden tracks. Cornell also joined Linkin Park on stage to sing the second verse of their Grammy-winning song &quot;Crawling&quot;.

Cornell collaborated with producer Timbaland on his next studio album, &quot;Scream&quot;, which was released on March 10, 2009. Timbaland has referred to the recording sessions as &quot;The best work I&#x27;ve done in my career&quot; and predicted that Cornell would be the &quot;first rock star in the club&quot;. Cornell described &quot;Scream&quot; as &quot;a highlight of my career&quot;. The album was largely panned by critics, but was the highest-charting album of Cornell&#x27;s solo career, reaching No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On April 2, 2009, Cornell took over Atlanta Rock station, Project 961, WKLS. For 24 hours, the station became &quot;Chris-FM&quot; and included a two-hour special of Cornell DJing and playing favorite songs from his career. On September 11, 2009, Cornell performed John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

In January 2011, Cornell announced his solo acoustic &quot;Songbook&quot; tour, continuing a series of acclaimed solo acoustic shows in Los Angeles during 2009 and 2010. The first leg of the sold-out tour began on April 1, 2011, and continued through the U.S. and Canada until May 6, resuming in October and visiting New Zealand, Australia, South America and the U.S. again before ending on December 17. The tour received universally positive reviews.

In November 2011, Cornell released &quot;Songbook&quot;, an acoustic live album featuring songs recorded during Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Songbook&quot; tour in North America. His first live album as a solo artist, &quot;Songbook&quot; included stripped-down performances of songs from his entire career as a solo artist as well as with Soundgarden, Audioslave, and Temple of the Dog, plus covers of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot; and John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;. The album received largely positive reviews, with AllMusic calling it Cornell&#x27;s &quot;best solo offering to date&quot;. Cornell continued his &quot;Songbook&quot; tour in Europe and the U.S. during 2012 and 2013 to further acclaim.
On January 21, 2013, Cornell performed a 10-minute acoustic set at the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Ball, which recognized Medal of Honor recipients and Wounded Warriors. He also performed later in the evening with Soundgarden at Barack Obama&#x27;s Inaugural Ball, doing a three-song set at the event.

In January 2015, Cornell announced via his Twitter account that he was in the studio recording a new solo album. Cornell&#x27;s last studio album, &quot;Higher Truth&quot;, was released on September 18, 2015. The last solo release prior to his death was the charity single &quot;The Promise&quot;, written for the movie of the same name about the Armenian genocide. Prior to his death, Cornell committed all proceeds from the song to support refugees and vulnerable children.

On February 26, 2018, Cornell&#x27;s first posthumous song was released. He composed the music and added lyrics to Johnny Cash&#x27;s poems &quot;You Never Knew My Mind&quot; and &quot;I Never Knew Your Mind&quot;. The song, titled &quot;You Never Knew My Mind&quot;, is featured on the album &quot;Johnny Cash: Forever Words&quot;, a collection of songs created from Cash&#x27;s unused poetry, lyrics and letters, as interpreted by several artists.

In 2019, Cornell won a posthumous Grammy Award for the Best Rock Performance at the 61st Grammy Awards for his single &quot;When Bad Does Good&quot;.

===2001–2007: Audioslave===

Audioslave was formed after Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine and the remaining members were searching for another vocalist. Producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they contact Cornell. Rubin played the Soundgarden song &quot;Slaves &amp; Bulldozers&quot; for the remaining Rage Against the Machine band members to showcase his ability. Cornell was in the writing process of a second solo album, but decided to shelve that and pursue the opportunity to work with Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk when they approached him. Morello described Cornell: &quot;He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It didn&#x27;t just sound good. It didn&#x27;t sound great. It sounded transcendent. And ... when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can&#x27;t deny it.&quot; The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal and began working in the studio in late May 2001.

Their debut album, &quot;Audioslave&quot;, released in November 2002, spawned hits such as &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Like a Stone&quot; and &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot;, and has reached triple platinum status in the United States. The band was nearly derailed before the album&#x27;s release; Cornell was going through alcohol problems and a slot on the Ozzfest tour was canceled. During this time, there was a rumor that Cornell had checked himself into drug rehabilitation. He later confirmed it in an interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; that was conducted from a clinic payphone. In a &quot;San Diego CityBeat&quot; article, Cornell explained that he went through &quot;a horrible personal crisis&quot; during the making of the first record, staying in rehab for two months and separating from his wife. The problems were ironed out and Cornell remained sober. The band toured through 2003, before resting in 2004 to record their second album.

Audioslave&#x27;s second album, &quot;Out of Exile&quot;, was released in May 2005 and debuted at number one on the U.S. charts. The album has since gone on to achieve platinum status. The album features the singles &quot;Out of Exile&quot;, &quot;Be Yourself&quot;, &quot;Your Time Has Come&quot; and &quot;Doesn&#x27;t Remind Me&quot;. Cornell admitted to writing his most personal songs ever on this album, influenced by the positive changes in his life since 2002. He also described the album as more varied than the debut and relying less on heavy guitar riffs. Critics initially described Audioslave as an amalgamation of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, but by the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Out of Exile&quot;, noted that they had established a separate identity. The album was received more favorably than Audioslave&#x27;s debut; critics noted Cornell&#x27;s stronger vocals, likely the result of quitting smoking and drinking, and pointed out that &quot;Out of Exile&quot; is &quot;the sound of a band coming into its own&quot;. AllMusic praised the album as &quot;lean, hard, strong, and memorable&quot;.

On May 6, 2005, Audioslave played a free show in Havana, Cuba. Audioslave became the first American rock group to perform a concert in Cuba, playing in front of an audience of 70,000 people. The band traveled to Havana on May 4 to interact with Cuban musicians. Cornell commented: &quot;Hopefully, this concert will help to open the musical borders between our two countries.&quot; The 26-song set concert was the longest the band had ever played.

In early 2006 the band returned, recording their third album as they had written most of the material during the tour. The band released the album, titled &quot;Revelations&quot;, in September 2006. &quot;Revelations&quot; was influenced by 1960s and 1970s funk and R&amp;B music. The first two singles were &quot;Original Fire&quot; and &quot;Revelations&quot;. Two of the songs from the third album, &quot;Shape of Things to Come&quot; and &quot;Wide Awake&quot; were also prominently featured in Michael Mann&#x27;s 2006 film, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, prior to the release of the album. Despite the exposure to other forms of media and the positive critical buzz for their third album, Audioslave did not tour behind the release. They went into hiatus to allow Cornell to complete &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, the theme song for the 2006 James Bond film, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and Morello to pursue his own solo work under the moniker of the Nightwatchman.

All of Audioslave&#x27;s lyrics were written by Cornell, whilst all four members were credited with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as &quot;more collaborative&quot; and &quot;satisfying&quot; than Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s, which was &quot;a battle creatively&quot;. Cornell, for his part, saw Soundgarden&#x27;s songwriting method as inferior to Audioslave&#x27;s. Cornell&#x27;s lyrics were mostly apolitical; Audioslave&#x27;s Morello referred to them as &quot;haunted, existential poetry&quot;. They were characterized by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of existentialism, love, hedonism, spirituality and Christianity. Cornell&#x27;s battle with addiction to prescription drugs and alcoholism was a defining factor in the writing and recording process. Even though the singer admitted that he was &quot;never able to write effectively&quot; while drinking, and attended rehab after recording the debut album, Morello stated that &quot;Revelations&quot; was &quot;the first record [Cornell] didn&#x27;t smoke, drink, or take drugs through the recording.&quot; However, Morello said: 

News about Cornell&#x27;s departure emerged in July 2006, when insiders stated that after the third album he would leave to pursue for a solo career. The singer immediately denied the rumors, stating: &quot;We hear rumors that Audioslave is breaking up all the time. [...] I always just ignore [them].&quot; On February 15, 2007, Cornell officially announced his departure from Audioslave, stating that &quot;Due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences, I am permanently leaving the band Audioslave. I wish the other three members nothing but the best in all of their future endeavors.&quot; As the other three members were busy with the Rage Against the Machine reunion with de la Rocha coming back, and Morello and Cornell had each released solo albums in 2007, Audioslave officially disbanded.

On January 17, 2017, it was announced that Audioslave would reunite for their first show in twelve years at Prophets of Rage&#x27;s Anti-Inaugural Ball, protesting President Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration as President of the United States. The event took place on January 20, 2017.

Asked in February 2017 if there would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, frontman Cornell replied, 

==Other musical projects==
===Center for Disease Control Boys===
From 1986 to 1987, Cornell was also a member of the satirical Western swing band Center for Disease Control Boys.

===Temple of the Dog===

While still in Soundgarden, Cornell recorded an album with members of what would become Pearl Jam. This collaboration went under the name Temple of the Dog, and the self-titled album was released in 1991. The album is a tribute to their mutual friend, and Cornell&#x27;s former roommate, Andrew Wood. Wood, the former lead singer of Mother Love Bone, had died of a heroin overdose the year before. Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard of Mother Love Bone teamed up with Mike McCready, new vocalist Eddie Vedder, and drummer Dave Krusen in 1990, forming Pearl Jam. Cameron would eventually become Pearl Jam&#x27;s drummer in 1998.

&quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; has gone on to sell more than a million copies, thanks in large part to the singles &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot; and &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, the latter of which features a duet between Cornell and Vedder. This was the first time Vedder was recorded professionally. Vedder said about &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; in the 2009 book &quot;Grunge Is Dead&quot;; &quot;I really like hearing that song. I feel like I could be real proud of it – because one, I didn&#x27;t write it, and two, it was such a nice way to be ushered onto vinyl for the first time. I&#x27;m indebted to Chris time eternal for being invited onto that track.&quot;

During a 2003 Pearl Jam show at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Cornell appeared as a surprise guest. After playing a short acoustic set, Cornell joined Vedder and the rest of the band to perform &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; and &quot;Reach Down&quot;.

On October 6, 2009, Cornell made a surprise appearance during a Pearl Jam concert at the Gibson Amphitheater in Los Angeles. The reunited Temple of the Dog played &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;. At the end of the concert, Cornell took a bow with the band along with Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains.

In September 2011, he joined members of Pearl Jam for a Temple of the Dog live reunion at the two-day PJ20 Festival at Alpine Valley, Wisconsin.

On both October 25 and 26, 2014, Cornell joined Pearl Jam onstage to perform &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, during the 28th Annual Bridge School Benefit, the latter being the last time that Vedder and Cornell performed the song together. On January 30, 2015, Pearl Jam bandmates (minus Vedder) Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, and Matt Cameron joined Chris Cornell and Mike McCready during the Mad Season Sonic Evolution Concert at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony. The group performed two songs, &quot;Reach Down&quot; and &quot;Call Me a Dog&quot;.

The band toured for the first time in the fall of 2016 in celebration of the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album. Vedder did not participate on the tour citing &quot;family commitments&quot;, but the crowd sang his part in &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, and Cornell dedicated the song to Vedder during the band&#x27;s concert at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle on November 21, 2016.

===M.A.C.C.===
In 1992, Cornell and three other former members of Temple of the Dog played under the name M.A.C.C. (McCready, Ament, Cameron, Cornell), recording the song &quot;Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)&quot; for the 1993 album, &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;. The band performed the song live for the first time during the first Temple of the Dog tour in November 2016.

===Collaborations===
Cornell worked as a co-producer and backing vocalist on the Screaming Trees&#x27; 1991 album, &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot;.

In 1992, Cornell co-wrote the song &quot;The Message&quot; for the album &quot;Cuatro&quot; by the metal band Flotsam and Jetsam.

Cornell, together with Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, and Mark Arm of Mudhoney, contributed vocals on the Alice in Chains song &quot;Right Turn&quot;, from the 1992 EP &quot;Sap&quot;, although the band given credit for this song is Alice Mudgarden. The song was featured in the 2001 film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;.

Cornell contributed vocals on Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Stolen Prayer&quot; and &quot;Unholy War&quot; (which he also wrote) from the 1994 album, &quot;The Last Temptation&quot;. In 1997, Cornell collaborated with Eleven on a rendition of the song, &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, for the Christmas compilation album, &quot;A Very Special Christmas 3&quot;.

In the &#x27;90s, Cornell teamed up with Heart&#x27;s Ann and Nancy Wilson for a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, when the sisters were performing as &quot;The Lovemongers&quot;. Bootleg versions of the live performances are available online. Cornell and the Wilsons also performed &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and The Lovemongers&#x27; song &quot;Sand&quot; at Layne Staley&#x27;s funeral in 2002.

Cornell co-wrote (with Brian Howes) David Cook&#x27;s first post-&quot;American Idol&quot; album single, &quot;Light On&quot;, released in 2008. And in 2009, he contributed vocals on the song, &quot;Mister Dirt&quot;, from the album, &quot;Good.Night.Melody&quot;, by Joshua David Lewis.

In 2009, Cornell co-wrote a song with a fan named Rory Dela Rosa. Rory&#x27;s six-year-old daughter Ainslee had died from glioblastoma in April 2008, and he was diagnosed with the same brain cancer shortly afterwards. He reached out to Cornell to tell him how much his music impacted his life and also the bond it helped create for him and his daughter, and sent Cornell a poem called &quot;I Promise It&#x27;s Not Goodbye&quot;. Cornell was so moved that he turned the poem into a song with the same title. Rory then gave Cornell permission to post the song online. It was available for free download on Cornell&#x27;s official website in April 2009. Cornell also asked his fans to consider making a donation in memory of Rory&#x27;s daughter and to help ease the financial burden of his disease. In 2013, Cornell made the song available for streaming on his official website in honor of the kids who died in the Sandy Hook tragedy. Links were provided for donations in memory of the victims. Rory died in December 2009.

Cornell sang one song (which he co-wrote) on &quot;Slash&quot;, Slash&#x27;s solo record released in April 2010. The song is called &quot;Promise&quot; and it was premiered at amazon.com on March 26, 2010. He contributed vocals on the song, &quot;Lies&quot;, on the 2010 album, &quot;Third and Double&quot;, by Gabin which was subsequently released as a single in October 2010. Cornell appears on the Carlos Santana album &quot;Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time&quot;, where he sings on the cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;.

Cornell wrote the lyrics and shared vocals with Andrew Wood in the song &quot;Island of Summer&quot;, which was recorded while they were living together in Seattle. The song was released for the first time in the 2011 album &quot;Melodies &amp; Dreams&quot;, a collection of Wood&#x27;s unreleased recordings and demos.

Cornell sings backing vocals in a cover of the Everly Brothers&#x27; song &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;, on Rita Wilson&#x27;s debut album &quot;AM/FM&quot;, released in 2012.

On April 18, 2013, the Seattle band Heart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Cornell gave Heart&#x27;s induction speech and emotionally talked about what heroes and role models Ann and Nancy Wilson had been to him and other musicians in Seattle. &quot;For me, and for countless other men and women, they have earned, at long last, their rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,&quot; Cornell said. Cornell also joined fellow Seattle musicians Jerry Cantrell and Mike McCready to play guitar for Heart&#x27;s hit song &quot;Barracuda&quot; alongside Ann and Nancy Wilson at the ceremony.

On January 30, 2015, Cornell joined Mike McCready and Barrett Martin plus Duff McKagan, Sean Kinney, the Seattle Symphony and others in a special &#x27;Sonic Evolution&#x27; concert at Seattle&#x27;s Benaroya Hall in a tribute to Mad Season. The performance was released as a live album in August 2015, entitled &quot;Mad Season / Seattle Symphony: Sonic Evolution / January 30, 2015 / Benaroya Hall&quot;. Proceeds will benefit the Seattle Symphony and Vitalogy Foundation.

===Soundtrack contributions===
In 1992, Cornell contributed his first solo song &quot;Seasons&quot;, and Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Birth Ritual&quot; to the .

He also contributed the song &quot;Sunshower&quot; (a bonus track on the Japanese release of &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;) to the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, and a reworked version of the track &quot;Mission&quot;, retitled &quot;Mission 2000&quot;, was used on the to the 2000 film, &quot;&quot;.

Cornell and composer David Arnold collaborated on the song &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, which Cornell co-wrote and performed and which accompanies the opening titles for the 2006 James Bond film, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. &quot;You Know My Name&quot; is the first theme song since 1983&#x27;s &quot;Octopussy&quot; to use a different title than the film, and the first ever title theme song that did not appear on the soundtrack album. &quot;You Know My Name&quot; won a 2006 Satellite Award in the category of Best Original Song, and a 2007 World Soundtrack Award in the category of Best Original Song Written Directly for a Film. The song sold 323,000 digital copies and 3.5 million streams, and was also nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the 2008 Grammy Awards. It was the first song recorded for his solo album &quot;Carry On&quot;, which he began work on in 2007.
In August 2011, Cornell released &quot;The Keeper&quot;, an original song written for the Marc Forster-directed 2011 film &quot;Machine Gun Preacher&quot;. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2012. For the first 24 hours after its release, the song was exclusively available as part of the &quot;Donate to Download&quot; campaign for Sam Childers&#x27; Angels of East Africa children&#x27;s charity. The song is also the lead track on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

In 2012, Soundgarden released their first song in 15 years, &quot;Live to Rise&quot;, written for &quot;The Avengers&quot; movie soundtrack.

In 2013, Cornell wrote the song &quot;Misery Chain&quot;, for the soundtrack to the film &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;, in which he performed a duet with Joy Williams.

In 2016, Cornell covered the song &quot;Stay With Me Baby&quot; for the soundtrack of the HBO TV series &quot;Vinyl&quot;. Cornell said about recording the song; &quot;I was very honored to be asked to record a version of &#x27;Stay With Me Baby&#x27; for Vinyl. I get to pay tribute to Terry Reid, whose version of the song has been a favorite of mine for many years, and be included on a great soundtrack with an amazing group of artists.&quot;

In November 2016, Cornell sang a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Drive My Car&quot; on episode 18b of the animated children&#x27;s television series &quot;Beat Bugs&quot;.

His last soundtrack contribution was the song &quot;The Promise&quot;, written for the ending credits for the movie of the same name released in 2017.

==Influences, style and vocal ability==
Cornell cited Paul McCartney, XTC, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Ultravox, and Bauhaus as some of the artists he liked.

Cornell&#x27;s songwriting often features non-standard chord progressions and melodies that do not conform with one diatonic scale. A prominent example is &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, which not only involves many kinds of open chords and several key changes in short sequences, but also unique melody phrases with large-interval jumps.

A recurrent characteristic is his use of major-only chord sequences (&quot;Pretty Noose&quot;), which also leads to more subtle key changes.

Cornell&#x27;s most concentrated example of his own songwriting style remains on his first solo album &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;, as his subsequent works, whether with Audioslave or on his later solo albums, tend toward the conventional and only occasionally contain short but inventive interludes (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, &quot;Disappearing Act&quot;, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;).

Cornell was a baritone, with a vocal range of &quot;nearly&quot; four octaves (from C 2 to A 5). He had the ability to sing extremely high in the tenor range, as well as in the lower register of a baritone voice. He showcased this in various songs, most notably the studio and the demo versions of &quot;Beyond the Wheel&quot;, where he can be heard spanning three octaves. He also experimented with various different vocal styles, ranging from light falsetto, to high falsetto screams, and chants. In addition to singing rock and metal mainly with Soundgarden and Audioslave, Cornell sang blues, neo soul and stripped-down acoustic numbers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Jon Pareles wrote, &quot;As it rose, higher and higher, Mr. Cornell&#x27;s voice could sustain a melody through the fray, or it could confront hard-rock turbulence with grunts, rasps, wails, bitter moans and, at the top of his range, full-bodied shrieks that admitted no weakness.&quot;

==Other work==
Cornell made a cameo in the 1992 Seattle-based film &quot;Singles&quot; directed by Cameron Crowe, in which he appeared opposite Matt Dillon and Bridget Fonda. He also appeared onstage with Soundgarden performing the song &quot;Birth Ritual&quot; in a club. Cornell was Crowe&#x27;s original choice for the role of Cliff Poncier (played by Dillon), but he was unable to do it due to Soundgarden&#x27;s busy schedule. Cornell was the face of fashion producer John Varvatos&#x27; 2006 ad campaign.

Cornell became a restaurateur with the opening of his restaurant, Black Calavados, in Paris, and was also the owner of the music publishing company &quot;You Make Me Sick I Make Music&quot;.

In 2009, Cornell planned to turn Philip Carlo&#x27;s true crime book &quot;The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez&quot;, into a film, collaborating with Carlo to produce the screenplay. In 2011, James Franco was attached to direct the film and star in the role of Ramirez.

==In popular culture==
Garbage&#x27;s song &quot;Fix Me Now&quot; from the band&#x27;s debut album was originally called &quot;Chris Cornell&quot;. According to lead singer Shirley Manson, she was obsessed with Cornell at the time of the release of Soundgarden&#x27;s hit song &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;. A demo version of &quot;Fix Me Now&quot; has Manson singing Cornell&#x27;s name.

The line &quot;I&#x27;m looking California, and feeling Minnesota&quot; from Soundgarden&#x27;s song &quot;Outshined&quot; (written by Cornell), inspired the title of Steven Baigelman&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot;, starring Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz.

Cornell&#x27;s song &quot;Preaching the End of the World&quot; from his debut solo album &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;, inspired the title of Lorene Scafaria&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&quot;, starring Steve Carell and Keira Knightley.

Cornell was an answer on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; on February 12, 2018. The clue was, &quot;In 2017, music fans were saddened by the death of this Soundgarden singer&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1985, Cornell started dating Susan Silver, the manager of Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Screaming Trees, and they married in 1990. They had a daughter, Lillian Jean, born on June 28, 2000. Cornell and Silver divorced in 2004.

In 2004, he married Vicky Karayiannis, a Paris-based American publicist of Greek heritage. The couple had a daughter together, Toni, in September 2004, and a son, Christopher Nicholas, in December 2005. In 2012, the Cornells created the Chris and Vicky Cornell Foundation which works to aid the homeless, the poor, and abused or neglected children. In 2013, a portion of proceeds from ticket sales went to benefit the cause.

In a 2008 television interview, Cornell said about religion, &quot;I don&#x27;t follow any particular one. ... Ultimately I think I&#x27;m sort of a freethinker and kind of open. ... So many bad things–as well as good things–have happened based on people just sort of blindly following religion that I kind of feel like I want to stay away from any type of specific denomination or any religion period.&quot; He became a Greek Orthodox Christian during his relationship with Karayiannis.

===Friendships with Andrew Wood and Eddie Vedder===
Cornell was a close friend of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, they recorded the song &quot;Island of Summer&quot;, which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording of the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album &quot;Melodies &amp; Dreams&quot;, a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood&#x27;s sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood&#x27;s death: &quot;I&#x27;ve always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn&#x27;t deal well with Andy&#x27;s death. After he died, numerous times I&#x27;d be driving and I would look out the window and I thought I saw him. It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, &#x27;no, he&#x27;s actually dead.&#x27; This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It&#x27;s facing the reality.&quot;

During a 1994 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview on Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide, when asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter&#x27;s suicide into his lyrics after the fact, Cornell said:

Cornell was good friends with Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder. Cornell was one of the first people that Vedder met outside his Pearl Jam bandmates after moving to Seattle in 1990. The two were neighbors for a while and shared vocal duties in Temple of the Dog. Soundgarden manager Susan Silver recalled in the 2009 book &quot;Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music&quot; the moment in 1990 that Cornell walked Vedder onstage at the second show performed by Pearl Jam (then Mookie Blaylock) in Seattle: &quot;Alice in Chains filmed the show at Moore theatre in 1990 and that was the show this new band [Mookie Blaylock] opened for them. Everyone was still reeling from Andy [Andrew Wood]&#x27;s death... and they hadn&#x27;t really played out yet. The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage – he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world – in terms of people in Seattle – and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do – to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much to say, &#x27;This is your guy now.&#x27;&quot; Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready said about their friendship; &quot;Ed was from San Diego and he felt very intimidated in Seattle. Chris really welcomed him. Ed was super, super shy. Chris took him out for beers and told him stories. He was like, &#x27;Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [Ament] and Stone [Gossard]. I give you my blessing.&#x27; From then on, he was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do.&quot;

In September 2011, Vedder introduced Cornell at a concert in Alpine Valley before performing &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; with him, saying, &quot;I had no idea how he would affect my life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [the other members of Pearl Jam] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound.&quot; The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is also featured in the 2011 documentary &quot;Pearl Jam Twenty&quot;.

===Depression and substance abuse===
Cornell struggled with depression and had multiple addictions that he was able to manage until 1997, when Soundgarden disbanded and his first marriage was failing. At that point, Cornell turned to oxycodone and other substances. He said of that period: &quot;I went through a serious crisis with depression where I didn&#x27;t eat a whole meal every day. I was just kind of shutting down. I eventually found that the only way out of that was to change virtually everything in my life. That was a very frightening thing to do, but it was worthwhile.&quot; He checked into a rehabilitation center in 2002 and quit drinking and smoking around 2005.

Cornell stated in a 1996 interview: &quot;I know what it feels like to be suicidal, and I know what it feels like to be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don&#x27;t have the tolerance to create other hurdles as well.&quot; In 1999, Cornell said the following about depression:

At age 12, Cornell had access to alcohol, marijuana, and prescription drugs; he used them daily by 13, stopped for a year, but relapsed at 15 for another year until he turned to music. In a 2006 interview, Cornell revealed that at age 14, he had a bad PCP experience and later had panic disorder and agoraphobia:

In May 2007, Cornell was honored with the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award for &quot;his dedication and support of the MusiCares MAP Fund and his devotion to helping other addicts with the recovery process.&quot; The award was presented by Alice Cooper.

When asked how he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, 

In a 2011 interview, Cornell said the major change when Soundgarden re-formed was a lack of alcohol: &quot;The biggest difference I noticed... and we haven&#x27;t even really talked about it: there are no bottles of Jack Daniel&#x27;s around or beers. And we never talked about it... it&#x27;s just not there.&quot;

==Death and aftermath==

Around 12:15 a.m. on May 18, 2017, Cornell&#x27;s bodyguard found him unconscious in the bathroom of his hotel room, 1136, at the MGM Grand in Detroit, Michigan, after performing at a show with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre on May 17. He was lying on the floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth. An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell. Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30 a.m., at the age of 52. The cause of death was officially ruled a suicide by hanging. Police ruled out foul play by reviewing a hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after Cornell&#x27;s bodyguard left at around 11:35 p.m.

On June 2, 2017, the Wayne County Medical Examiner released its autopsy and toxicology report in the death of Cornell. The medical examiner confirmed that the cause of death was hanging and determined the manner of death to be suicide, adding that Cornell&#x27;s injuries were all &quot;consistent with hanging, partially suspended by the resistance exercise band&quot;, and that &quot;drugs did not contribute&quot; to the cause of death. Only prescription medications in therapeutic doses were found in Cornell&#x27;s system: the sedative Butalbital (5.4 μg/mL), commonly prescribed for the treatment of headache; four doses (41 ng/mL) of the anti-anxiety medication lorazepam (also known as Ativan); the decongestant pseudoephedrine (170 ng/mL) and its metabolite norpseudoephedrine (10 ng/mL); caffeine (from No-Doz tablets that Cornell had ingested); and naloxone (used to reverse opioid overdoses), which was reportedly administered by emergency personnel upon their arrival at the scene. No pills were found in Cornell&#x27;s stomach. Cornell&#x27;s widow stated that the Ativan was prescribed to him in 2016 as a sleep aid. 
Cornell&#x27;s widow contacted insurance lawyer Kirk Pasich a few minutes after her husband&#x27;s death. Pasich became the spokesperson for the widow and blamed Ativan for the singer&#x27;s death, stating that Cornell would not intentionally take his own life. Cornell&#x27;s widow said, &quot;When we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different. When he told me he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him.&quot; Following the release of the autopsy and toxicology report, Cornell&#x27;s widow released a statement to the press:

Three weeks after his death, the music video for Cornell&#x27;s single &quot;Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart&quot; was removed from YouTube. Released in September 2015, the video depicted the singer as a death row prisoner in the Old West who survived a hanging. Cornell&#x27;s son, Christopher, also appeared in the video.

Cornell publicly talked about his struggle with depression, isolation, and suicidal thoughts several times throughout his life. This started after Cornell stated he had ingested PCP for the first and only time, causing a &quot;deep scar on his psyche&quot;. This changed his life overnight. He said he became an introvert, experienced anxiety and depression, dealing with this period for over two years.

On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department released the full police report on Cornell&#x27;s death, along with photographs from Cornell&#x27;s hotel room and the 911 call from the MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell&#x27;s death. The call was made by a hotel employee at 12:56 a.m., reporting &quot;a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136.&quot; According to the report, Martin Kirsten (Cornell&#x27;s bodyguard) was at the singer&#x27;s hotel room at 11:30 p.m. to help him with his computer. It also says that Cornell&#x27;s wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35 p.m. Alarmed by what she heard, Vicky phoned Kirsten to ask him to check on her husband &quot;because he did not sound like he was OK.&quot; According to Vicky, Cornell kept saying, &quot;I am just tired,&quot; and hung up the phone. A call from Vicky at 12:15 a.m. prompted Kirsten to go to Cornell&#x27;s suite to check on him. Unable to enter the room because of the interior latch, Kirsten returned to his room and called hotel security. Security refused to assist.

Kirsten told police that he went to Cornell&#x27;s room at around 12:15 a.m., but could not access the locked room. He then had a telephone conversation with Vicky, who instructed him to kick the door open, as the hotel staff refused to do it. Kirsten told police in a signed statement that he kicked the bedroom door 6–7 times before it opened, then went inside, and the bathroom door was partially opened and he could see Cornell&#x27;s feet. Kirsten said that Vicky was on the phone with him the whole time asking for updates. Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell&#x27;s neck, then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m. and tried to resuscitate Cornell, with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at around 1:30 a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell&#x27;s wife.

Questioned by &quot;The Detroit News&quot; why it took 41 minutes to get a medical team to the scene after the bodyguard found Cornell lying on the floor, police insisted that there were no gaps. Investigators looked at the length of the phone call between Cornell and his wife, and the calls the bodyguard made to security and checked video surveillance footage from the hotel hallway, and determined the timeline was accurate, and the bodyguard&#x27;s story was accurate. On May 15, 2018, Vicky Cornell told &quot;The Detroit News&quot; that she was dissatisfied with the autopsy report, stating it was incomplete and giving rise to conspiracy theorists of which she and her family were victims. She pointed out that her husband also suffered from a head injury mentioned in two clinical reports that did not appear in the autopsy report.

On November 1, 2018, Vicky Cornell and her children filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming that Dr. Robert Koblin &quot;negligently and repeatedly&quot; prescribed &quot;dangerous mind-altering controlled substances to Chris Cornell which impaired Mr. Cornell&#x27;s cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life.&quot; The suit claims Koblin prescribed lorazepam over a period of 20 months without seeing Cornell. In his motion for dismissal, Koblin denied all accusations of negligence and said that Cornell was well aware of the risks inherent to the medication, which he was taking to treat anxiety. Koblin ordered Cornell the first prescription of lorazepam in September 2015. Koblin insisted that he did everything within his power to help Cornell, and that a malpractice law should shield him from being sued. In April 2021, the two parties settled on a confidential agreement.

===Memorial and tributes===
Cornell&#x27;s body was cremated on May 23, 2017. His funeral took place on May 26, 2017, at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.

It was later performed with Serj Tankian of System of a Down on vocals. At the Alternative Press Music Awards on July 17, the band Pierce the Veil paid tribute to Cornell with their rendition of &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; while images of Cornell were displayed on a screen above the stage.

On the first anniversary of Cornell&#x27;s death on May 18, 2018, Alice in Chains paid tribute to him by covering two Soundgarden songs, &quot;Hunted Down&quot; and &quot;Boot Camp&quot;, respectively, closing their headlining set at the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio. Towards the end of &quot;Boot Camp&quot;, the lights on stage spelled out &quot;CC&quot; for Chris Cornell and &quot;SG&quot; for Soundgarden as feedback rang out. Soundgarden had been scheduled to headline the festival in 2017 prior to Cornell&#x27;s death. On May 20, 2018, Tool dedicated their entire set at Rock on the Range to the friends and family of Cornell.

American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses paid tribute to Cornell on their Not In This Lifetime... Tour.

Alice in Chains&#x27; song &quot;Never Fade&quot; from their 2018 album &quot;Rainier Fog&quot; was partially inspired by Cornell&#x27;s death. One of Cornell&#x27;s acoustic guitars was also played by both Jerry Cantrell and William DuVall on the album.

In July 2018, Ann Wilson released her cover of Audioslave&#x27;s &quot;I Am The Highway&quot; in tribute to Cornell. The song is featured on her covers album &quot;Immortal&quot;, which honors Wilson&#x27;s friends and other artists that have inspired her and who died recently. A life-size bronze statue of Cornell was placed at Seattle Center in October 2018.

A compilation album titled &quot;Chris Cornell&quot; was released on November 16, 2018, featuring songs from Cornell&#x27;s solo career and his three bands.

On January 16, 2019, a five-hour tribute concert to Cornell named &quot;I Am The Highway&quot; was held at The Forum in Inglewood, CA and featured Foo Fighters, Metallica, Melvins, as well as members of Soundgarden, Audioslave and Temple of the Dog performing Cornell&#x27;s songs alongside artists such as Fiona Apple, Jerry Cantrell, William DuVall, Miguel, Nikka Costa, Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Jack Black, Geezer Butler, Ryan Adams, Taylor Momsen, Brandi Carlile, Perry Farrell, Juliette Lewis, Josh Homme, Miley Cyrus, Alain Johannes, Wayne Kramer, Peter Frampton and Ziggy Marley.

Eddie Vedder covered Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Seasons&quot; at Düsseldorf&#x27;s Mitsubishi Electric Halle on June 30, 2019, and dedicated it to Cornell&#x27;s daughter Lily.

On July 20, 2020, Cornell&#x27;s eldest daughter, Lily Cornell Silver, launched an IGTV interview series on Instagram titled &quot;Mind Wide Open&quot; in honor of her father&#x27;s 56th birthday. The mission of the series is to help destigmatize the conversations around mental health. The same day, Cornell&#x27;s estate released a previously unreleased cover of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; 1988 ballad &quot;Patience&quot;. The song was a single from the covers album &quot;No One Sings Like You Anymore, Vol. 1&quot; released on December 11, 2020.

===Connections to other singers&#x27; suicides===
Music journalists noted apparently coincidental relationships between Cornell&#x27;s suicide and those of two other rock singers, one in the past and another shortly afterward, who also hanged themselves.

Theodore Decker of the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;, the daily newspaper in Columbus, Ohio, where Cornell was due to play his next show, noted that Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the British post-punk band Joy Division, whom Cornell had said in a 1994 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview was popular with the members of Soundgarden, killed himself on May 18, 1980, exactly 37 years before Cornell, and by the same method as well. Curtis, known for lyrics that, as Cornell&#x27;s sometimes had, explored despair and depression, had become legendary as a result after his death, Decker recalled. However, Stephen Morris, one of Curtis&#x27;s bandmates (who later became New Order) recalled Curtis not as the &quot;brooding rock deity&quot; Decker said he became posthumously but as &quot;an ordinary bloke just like you or me&quot;. Decker recalled the other deaths of musicians who had risen from Seattle&#x27;s grunge scene in the early 1990s and called on Cornell&#x27;s fans to remember that he, too, was a human being who might still be alive if he had gotten the help he needed.

Two months after Cornell&#x27;s death, on July 20, 2017, on the day that would have been Cornell&#x27;s 53rd birthday, Chester Bennington, the lead vocalist of Linkin Park, also died by hanging himself. Bennington had been a close friend of Cornell&#x27;s; the two had performed together on some occasions and Bennington was the godfather to Cornell&#x27;s son, Christopher. Bennington also sang Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; at Cornell&#x27;s funeral. Bennington&#x27;s family and bandmates said he had taken Cornell&#x27;s death hard. Bennington&#x27;s Linkin Park bandmate Mike Shinoda said that the singer had been unable to complete a performance of the band&#x27;s song &quot;One More Light&quot;, about the death of a friend, both in rehearsals and live, when they appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; shortly after Cornell&#x27;s death. Bennington commented on Cornell&#x27;s death on Instagram, stating that he could not imagine a world without Cornell in it.

==Legacy==
In a 1989 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Axl Rose stated: &quot;I enjoy Soundgarden. The singer [Cornell] just buries me. The guy sings so great.&quot; Rose also stated that Cornell was the best vocalist in rock.

In a 2009 interview, Ronnie James Dio stated: &quot;I think Chris Cornell is such a great singer, and those guys [from Soundgarden] write so well and always write well – I mean, I love what he&#x27;s done with Audioslave and the things he&#x27;s done since then.&quot;

In a 2009 interview, Eddie Vedder stated that Cornell was &quot;the best singer that we&#x27;ve got on the planet&quot;.

In April 2017, Scott Stapp stated that Cornell was &quot;the greatest pure Rock singer&quot;. He added, 

After hearing about his death, Alice Cooper stated: Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid stated: &quot;There are barely any words to describe my grief over the loss of Chris Cornell...His impact as a singer, songwriter and guitarist will be felt for generations to come.&quot;

Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: 

Following his death, the sales and streams of Cornell&#x27;s discography grew by more than 550% from the week prior to his death. On platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora, his songs were streamed 32.5 million times during the week in which he died. The charting week prior to that, his tracks were played 5 million times. That same week, 38,000 copies of Cornell albums were sold, which represented a 1,700% gain in purchases; the week before his death, only 2,000 units were sold.

On August 10, 2020, Nile Rodgers and Merck Mercuriadis&#x27;s company Hipgnosis Songs Fund acquired 100% of Cornell&#x27;s catalog of song rights (241 songs), including the Soundgarden catalog.

<text>
Walter Max Ulyate Sisulu (18 May 1912 – 5 May 2003) was a South African anti-apartheid activist and member of the African National Congress (ANC). Between terms as ANC Secretary-General (1949–1954) and ANC Deputy President (1991–1994), he was Accused No.2 in the Rivonia Trial and was incarcerated on Robben Island where he served more than 25 years&#x27; imprisonment for his anti-Apartheid revolutionary activism. He had a close partnership with Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela, with whom he played a key role in organising the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the establishment of the ANC Youth League and Umkhonto we Sizwe. He was also on the Central Committee of the South African Communist Party.

== Family ==

Walter Sisulu was born in 1912 in the town of Ngcobo in the Union of South Africa, part of what is now the Eastern Cape province (then the Transkei). As was not unusual for his generation in South Africa, he was uncertain of his birthday, but celebrated it on 18 May. His mother, Alice Mase Sisulu, was a Xhosa domestic worker and his father, Albert Victor Dickinson, was a white civil servant and magistrate. Dickinson did not play a part in his son&#x27;s upbringing: Sisulu reportedly met him only once, in the 1940s, before he died in the 1970s. Sisulu and his sister, Rosabella, were raised by his mother&#x27;s family, who were descended from the Thembu clan. He was close with his uncle, Dyantyi Hlakula, who was passionate about Xhosa culture and who oversaw his initiation. Although he was technically of mixed race, Sisulu identified strongly as black and as Xhosa.

In his mid-teens, Sisulu left school – an Anglican mission school – to find work. In Johannesburg, he worked a range of jobs, including as a bank teller, gold miner, domestic worker, and baker. He was fired from the bakery for trying to organise his co-workers.

He founded Sitha Investments in 1939. It was situated at Barclay Arcade between West Street and Commissioner Street in the business district of Johannesburg. Its objective was to help black and Indian people buy houses. During its operations, Sitha was the only black-owned real estate agency in South Africa.

== Political career ==

In 1940, Sisulu joined the African National Congress (ANC), which had been founded in the year of his birth. The following year, Nelson Mandela moved to Johannesburg and was introduced to Sisulu, who by then was well connected among the city&#x27;s activist class. Sisulu later said, &quot;I had no hesitation, the moment I met him, that this is the man I need&quot; – the man, that is, &quot;for leading the African people&quot;. Sisulu encouraged Mandela to join the ANC, occasionally contributed to his law school tuition, and introduced him to his first wife, Evelyn Mase, who was Sisulu&#x27;s maternal relative.

=== 1944–1961: Youth League ===
In 1943, together with Mandela and Oliver Tambo, he joined the ANC Youth League, founded by Anton Lembede, of which Sisulu was initially the treasurer. He later distanced himself from Lembede after Lembede, who died in 1947, had ridiculed his parentage.

The Youth League&#x27;s drive for a more militant posture was given further fuel in 1948, when the National Party (NP) won national elections on a platform of legislating apartheid. In December 1949, at the ANC&#x27;s 38th National Conference, the Youth League leadership carried out a &quot;remarkable putsch&quot;, which successfully installed several younger and more militant members onto the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee – including Sisulu, who was elected ANC Secretary-General. The League also tabled a broad Programme of Action, which was notable for its explicit emphasis on African nationalism and mass mobilisation techniques. The culmination of this new strategy was the 1952 Defiance Campaign of passive resistance. Sisulu was on the planning council for the campaign and was arrested for his participation. In December, he and other organisers, including ANC President James Moroka, were found guilty of &quot;statutory communism&quot; under the remarkably broad Suppression of Communism Act, but had their sentences – nine months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour – suspended for two years.

Sisulu, along with several others, formed part of an ANC delegation to the 1953 World Democratic Youth meeting in Bucharest, Romania; before returning to South Africa, the group also travelled to Warsaw, Poland, to London, to Israel, and to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where Sisulu was part of a meeting with the Chinese Communist Party leadership. In 1955, Sisulu, Mandela, and Ahmed Kathrada watched the Congress of the People gathering – which adopted the Freedom Charter – from a nearby rooftop, unable to attend the meeting because of the banning orders against them. By this time, Sisulu was active not only in the ANC but also, covertly, in the South African Communist Party (SACP).

=== 1961–1963: Umkhonto we Sizwe ===
Paul Landau, a historian of the ANC, has argued that Sisulu and Mandela were the crucial forces, both intellectually and practically, behind the ANC&#x27;s &quot;turn to violence&quot; (that is, to armed struggle against the government) at the turn of the decade. When Umkhonto we Sizwe was established in 1961, Sisulu served on its High Command.
After 1952, he was jailed seven times in the next ten years, including five months in 1960, and was held under house arrest in 1962. At the Treason Trial (1956–1961), he was eventually sentenced to six years, but was released on bail pending his appeal.

=== 1963–1964: Rivonia Trial ===

He went underground in 1963, resulting in his wife, Albertina Sisulu, becoming the first woman to be arrested under the so-called 90 Day Act, the General Laws Amendment Act of 1963, which allowed the state to detain suspects for up to 90 days without charging them.

He was caught at Rivonia on 11 July, along with Govan Mbeki, Ahmed Kathrada and 14 others. At the conclusion of the Rivonia Trial, Sisulu was sentenced to life imprisonment on 12 June 1964. Part of his testimony during the trial included the commitment:I wish to make this solemn vow in full appreciation of the consequences it entails. As long as I enjoy the confidence of my people, and as long as there is a spark of life and energy in me, I shall fight with courage and determination for the abolition of discriminatory laws and for the freedom of all South Africans irrespective of colour or creed.

=== 1964–1989: Imprisonment ===
With other senior ANC figures, Sisulu served the majority of his sentence on Robben Island, though he was later transferred to Pollsmoor Prison. His wife, Albertina Sisulu, was frequently under banning orders – the first from 1964 to 1969 – which prevented her from travelling to Cape Town to visit him.

=== 1989–1994: End of apartheid ===
As part of the prelude to the negotiations to end apartheid, Sisulu and other Rivonia Trial defendants were released from prison on 15 October 1989; Sisulu was 77. His return to Soweto was greeted with celebrations in the street, and he told media of his long detention, &quot;It was not possible to despair because the spirit of the people outside was too great&quot;. In 1990, he formed part of the ANC delegation to the negotiations with the government which resulted in the Groote Schuur Minute. In July 1991, at the ANC&#x27;s first national conference since its unbanning the year before, Sisulu was elected ANC Deputy President. It was believed that he had been convinced to accept the job in order to prevent a disruptive power struggle between a younger generation of activists – such as Cyril Ramaphosa, Thabo Mbeki, and Chris Hani – vying for the deputy presidency.

== Retirement and death ==
In 1994, the ANC won a majority in South Africa&#x27;s first democratic elections and formed a government headed by Mandela, but Sisulu, weakened by age and his long imprisonment, declined to serve in public office. At the ANC&#x27;s 49th National Conference in December that year, he also declined to run for re-election to the party&#x27;s leadership. After his retirement, he and his family continued to live in Soweto, where they had lived before the Rivonia Trial.

Sisulu died at his home in Linden,Johannesburg on the evening of 5 May 2003, just shy of his 91st birthday, in the presence of his wife. He was given a &quot;special official funeral&quot; on 17 May 2003. Among the tributes he received after his death, Mandela – joking that both he and Sisulu &quot;had long passed the age when either of us would protest against the brevity of life&quot; – said:Our paths first intersected in 1941. During the past 62 years our lives have been intertwined. We shared the joy of living, and the pain. Together we shared ideas, forged common commitments. We walked side by side through the valley of death, nursing each other&#x27;s bruises, holding each other up when our steps faltered. Together we savoured the taste of freedom. From the moment when we first met he has been my friend, my brother, my keeper, my comrade.After Mandela&#x27;s death in 2013, Mac Maharaj – who had been on Robben Island with both men and later became a cabinet minister – told the media that he had had Sisulu and Mandela write obituaries for each other before 2003, and had kept both.

== Personality and public image ==
His admirers, including Mandela, frequently noted his humility. Those imprisoned with him on Robben Island remarked upon his unflappable calm and patience – as Mandela put it in his autobiography, &quot;He was often silent when others were shouting.&quot; After his release from prison, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Sisulu &quot;was always a voice for moderation, preaching the importance of a national reconciliation&quot;. Upon his death, Kathrada told the &quot;New York Times:&quot;I&#x27;ve always said that one can&#x27;t speak of Mandela without speaking of Sisulu. They complement each other... Mandela was highly respected, highly admired. But I would not be able to say he was as loved as Sisulu was. You know that difference between a father and a leader? That was the big difference between them.

== Personal life ==
In 1944, Sisulu married Albertina, a nurse, whom he had met in 1942 in Johannesburg; Mandela was his best man at their wedding. At the ceremony, Lembede warned Albertina: &quot;You are marrying a man who is already married to the nation.&quot; Sisulu later recalled, &quot;Even when I married my wife, I told her it was useless buying new furniture. I was going to be in jail.&quot; While he was in prison, Albertina became a very important anti-apartheid activist in her own right, with leadership roles in the United Democratic Front and Federation of South African Women. In 1982, Ruth First paid tribute to their marriage at an ANC celebration for Walter (in absentia) on his birthday, saying: &quot;His capacity to lead and her political strength are... the product of a good marriage, a good political marriage, but a good marriage, one that is based on genuine equality and on shared commitment.&quot; Both were born into Christian families, but, asked in 1992 whether they practised their religion, Albertina replied: &quot;There’s no time, my dear.&quot;

Together, the couple had five children: Max (born 1945), an ANC politician; Mlungisi, a businessman (born 1948, died 2015); Zwelakhe, a journalist (born 1950, died 2012); Lindiwe (born 1954), also an ANC politician; and Nonkululeko (born 1958). They also adopted three children: two – Beryl, a diplomat, and Gerald Lockman – are biologically the children of Walter&#x27;s deceased sister; while the third, Jongumzi, is the son of Sisulu&#x27;s cousin. Jongi served a five-year sentence on Robben Island for his anti-apartheid activism in the 1980s, and other family members were also periodically detained.

In 2002, Max&#x27;s wife, Elinor, published a biography of her parents-in-law, entitled &quot;Walter and Albertina Sisulu: In Our Lifetime&quot;.

== Awards and legacy ==

In 1992, Sisulu was awarded Isitwalandwe Medal, the highest honour granted by the ANC, for his contribution to the liberation struggle in South Africa. The government of India awarded him the Padma Vibhushan in 1998.

In 2004, Sisulu was ranked 33rd on SABC 3&#x27;s list of Great South Africans. The Walter Sisulu National Botanic Garden, Walter Sisulu University and Walter Sisulu Local Municipality are named after him.

<text>Ultramega OK is the debut studio album by American rock band Soundgarden, released on October 31, 1988, by SST Records. Following the release of the EPs &quot;Screaming Life&quot; (1987) and &quot;Fopp&quot; (1988), both for the Sub Pop record label, Soundgarden signed with SST and went to work on their debut full-length. The resulting album contained elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, and hardcore punk. The band supported the album with a tour of the United States, as well as its first overseas tour.

In 1990, the album earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance.

==Recording==
The album was recorded in spring 1988 in Seattle, Washington, and Newberg, Oregon, with producer Drew Canulette. Frontman Chris Cornell said that during the recording sessions the band wasn&#x27;t on the same page with Canulette. He said, &quot;Material-wise we went through the process that we always do, but the producer wasn&#x27;t used to the sound we wanted and didn&#x27;t know what was happening in Seattle.&quot;

Later, in a 1995 interview, Cornell admitted &quot;we made a huge mistake with &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;, because we left our home surroundings and people we&#x27;d been involved with and used this producer that really did affect our album in a kind of negative way. The producer was suggested by SST because they could get a good deal. I regret it, because in terms of material, it should have been one of the best records we ever did. It actually slowed down our momentum a little bit because it didn&#x27;t really sound like us.&quot;

Around that same time, veteran Seattle producer Jack Endino, who also produced Soundgarden&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Screaming Life&quot;, began the process of remixing the album, and actually completed a rough mix of &quot;Flower&quot;. But, due to the band wanting to move on and the financial costs involved with re-pressing and redistributing the record, it was put on hold. The project resumed in 2014 by Jack Endino and Kim Thayil, and was completed in 2017.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Ultramega OK&quot; has elements of 1960s psychedelic rock, 1970s hard rock and heavy metal, and 1980s hardcore punk. Drummer Matt Cameron said that the band tried to refine its sound while still trying to keep an edge. Steve Huey of AllMusic said that the album is the &quot;best expression of Soundgarden&#x27;s early, Stooges/MC5-meets-Zeppelin/Sabbath sound&quot;, and added that it is &quot;a dark, murky, buzzing record that simultaneously subverts and pays tribute to heavy metal&quot;.

Guitarist Kim Thayil recalls &quot;Flower&quot; as being the first time he blew across his guitar strings. This can be heard during the song&#x27;s introduction, when they are played in rhythm with the drums. &quot;Circle of Power&quot; was one of the few Soundgarden songs to be written without any input from Cornell, as it was written by Thayil and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. It is also the only Soundgarden song on which Yamamoto performs lead vocals.

&quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; is a Howlin&#x27; Wolf cover. On the original version of the album, &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; segued into a distorted excerpt from the Sonic Youth song, &quot;Death Valley &#x27;69&quot;. Soundgarden included it as a tribute/parody of Sonic Youth&#x27;s similar sampling of The Stooges song &quot;Not Right&quot; on their &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; album. This excerpt was removed from the 2017 reissue of &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;.

Cornell said that &quot;Flower&quot; is &quot;about a girl...who becomes a woman and basically invests everything in vanity and then burns out quick.&quot; Thayil stated that &quot;Nazi Driver&quot; is about &quot;cutting up Nazis and making stew out of them&quot;. Cornell observed that the lyrics and vocals for &quot;Incessant Mace&quot; are &quot;very European Gothic&quot;.

Three songs on the album were recorded as jokes or parodies by the band. The songs &quot;665&quot; and &quot;667&quot; are parodies of the idea of Satanic content in rock music, the idea being that if 666 is such a powerful number, then the surrounding numbers must be equally as powerful. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;One Minute of Silence&quot;, is a &quot;cover&quot; of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Two Minutes of Silence&quot; from the 1969 album, &quot;Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions&quot;, excluding Yoko Ono&#x27;s part. Cornell said that the band &quot;appreciated the Lennon arrangement so much&quot;. No instruments are played, although the band (presumably) can be faintly heard in the background. Cornell stated, &quot;We were trying real hard to shut up, but Kim couldn&#x27;t possibly shut up for a whole minute.&quot;

==Release and reception==

Cornell said, &quot;On [&quot;Ultramega OK&quot;] the production wasn&#x27;t what we were after at all, and that sort of hurt us critically.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey wrote: &quot;It may not be quite as complex or consistent as some of Soundgarden&#x27;s later albums, but &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; is easily the best document of grunge&#x27;s early, pre-Nirvana days.&quot; Ann Powers of &quot;Blender&quot; said, &quot;Not every moment is brilliant, but it sure is loud.&quot;

&quot;Flower&quot; was the only single released from the album. Its music video, directed by Mark Miremont, aired regularly on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, helping to call attention to the early Seattle grunge scene.

At the 1990 Grammy Awards, &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; received a nomination for Best Metal Performance.

==Packaging and title==
The album&#x27;s cover art, photographed by Lance Mercer, features a black and white picture of the band. According to Cornell, the album&#x27;s title was a joke conceived by Thayil. Cornell explained that the title &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; means &quot;absolutely, unbelievably not bad,&quot; and suggested that the British version was going to be called &quot;Ultramega UK&quot;. Cornell explained the title further, stating, &quot;With &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; we really liked the songs on that record but we were disappointed in the production. We were sort of making fun of the finished product. It was &quot;Ultramega Alright&quot;. &quot;Ultramega could have been better but not bad&quot;.&quot;

==Tour==
Soundgarden supported the album with a tour in the United States in the spring of 1989 and a tour in Europe, which began in May 1989 and was the band&#x27;s first overseas tour.

==Reissues==
&quot;Ultramega OK&quot; was reissued on LP in 2012. &quot;One Minute of Silence&quot; was not included on it.

A new reissue of &quot;Ultramega OK&quot; was released on March 10, 2017, on Sub Pop in four formats, namely, black and colored double LP, CD, cassette tape, and digital download. The album was fully remixed and remastered from the original tapes by Jack Endino. It includes, as bonus tracks, six early eight-track versions of songs from the same album, taken from a demo tape, informally called the &quot;Ultramega EP&quot; by the band members, recorded by Endino and Chris Hanzsek at Reciprocal Recording studio in 1987.

<text>ATV Network Limited, originally Associated TeleVision (ATV), was a British broadcaster, part of the ITV (Independent Television) network. It provided a service to London at weekends from 1955 to 1968, to the Midlands on weekdays from 1956 to 1968, and subsequently to the Midlands all week from 1968 to 1982. It was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; until 1968, and the &quot;Big Five&quot; after 1968, that between them produced the majority of ITV networked programmes. In 1982, ATV was restructured and rebranded as Central Independent Television, under which name it continued to provide the service for the Midlands.

ATV was awarded its first franchise by the Independent Television Authority (ITA) to provide the Independent Television service at weekends for the London region. This service started on Saturday, 24 September 1955, the second ITA franchise to go on air, and was extended until Sunday, 28 July 1968. ATV was also awarded the franchise to provide the weekdays Independent Television service for the Midlands region. This service started on Friday, 17 February 1956, the third ITA franchisee to go on air, and was extended until Monday, 29 July 1968.

Subsequent to the changes made by the ITA to the regional structure of the ITV network, ATV lost its London franchise, but was awarded the franchise to provide a seven-day service for the Midlands region which started on Tuesday, 30 July 1968 and was finally extended until 00:34 on Friday, 1 January 1982.

==History==
===Formation===
The company was formed from the merger of the &quot;Associated Broadcasting Development Company&quot; (ABDC) under the control of Norman Collins, and the &quot;Incorporated Television Programme Company&quot; (ITC) under the control of Prince Littler and Lew Grade, two showbusiness agents.

Both companies had applied for a contract to become one of the new ITV stations. ABDC won the contract but had insufficient money to operate it; ITC failed to win a contract, mainly due to a perceived conflicts of interest resulting from the business operations of Grade and Littler. By the time of the merger ABDC were well advanced with their plans whilst ITPC planned to operate as an independent producer selling their shows to the new network contractors.

When financial problems hit ABDC, the Independent Television Authority, the governing body of ITV, invited Grade and Littler to join the ABDC consortium. This provided the money required and put Littler and Grade in control of the new company, sidelining Collins.

The new company was originally named the &quot;Associated Broadcasting Company&quot; (&quot;ABC&quot;), but the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC), which wished to call their station &quot;ABC&quot; and ran a large chain of cinemas under those initials, successfully sued for prior ownership of the name. After the Associated Broadcasting Company had been operating for three weeks the name was changed to Associated TeleVision Ltd (ATV). The logo, designed for &quot;ABC&quot; and tweaked for &quot;ATV&quot;, was a &quot;shadowed eye&quot; inspired by the CBS logo and reputedly designed by Lew Grade on a transatlantic flight back from the US. The logo was one of the most recognisable in British broadcasting.

===Broadcasting===

The Associated Broadcasting Company began broadcasting in its own right on Saturday 24 September 1955, after jointly presenting the network&#x27;s opening night on Thursday 22 September. The name ATV was first seen in London on Saturday 8 October 1955. The company won two contracts, the weekend contract for London and the Monday–Friday contract for the Midlands. The latter service opened on 17 February 1956, with ABPC&#x27;s ABC Weekend TV providing the weekend programmes.

The company ran into financial difficulty due to the staggering losses of the first two years of ITV and start-up costs. The London weekday contractor Associated-Rediffusion shouldered some of ATV&#x27;s losses and further funding was achieved by selling shares to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper. The company structure was changed several times until 1966, when ATV and ITC both became subsidiaries of the Associated Communications Corporation (ACC), formed by turning the old structure on its head. This marked the point where Lew Grade advanced from being the greatest influence over the company to taking control.

ATV&#x27;s main impact was in variety and light entertainment.

In the contract and region changes in 1968, ATV lost the weekend franchise in London to the London Television Consortium, later renamed London Weekend Television, but its Midlands contract was renewed and extended for the full seven days. At this point the company was renamed &quot;ATV Network Limited&quot;.

===End of franchise===
During the 1970s, ATV received much criticism over its lack of local programming, particularly for the east of its region; such critics held that local shows had a Birmingham focus. In 1980, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) decided that ATV&#x27;s lack of regional programming and production (it had a major studio centre at Elstree in Hertfordshire, a legacy of its London contract, well outside its Midlands franchise) was hampering the region, so it insisted that the new applicant for the franchise be more clearly based in the region and have separate facilities for the East and West Midlands.

&quot;ATV Midlands Limited&quot;, a shell company created by ACC solely for the franchise process, applied successfully for the contract. As a condition of its award, ACC was forced to sell 49% of the company, relinquish executive roles, sell the Elstree studios and rename the company to demonstrate that it was effectively a new business.

ATV ceased broadcasting at 12.34am on the morning of Friday 1 January 1982 (the night of Thursday 31 December 1981), following Scottish Television&#x27;s networked Hogmanay Show. The final closedown was marked by a brief tribute to ATV from original announcer Shaw Taylor before duty announcer Mike Prince signed off with the playing of the National Anthem (an organ recording made at St. Chad&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham). The newly reformed company, Central Independent Television plc, began broadcasting with an extended promo at 9.25am that morning.

Central inherited the studios at ATV Centre, Birmingham and ATV Elstree along with land that ATV Midlands had purchased for their new Nottingham studio centre. Central also maintained control of ATV&#x27;s news archive and regional programmes, along with programming already in production or being shown at the time of changeover and schools programming; the rest of the ATV archive was sold by ACC.

ACC later divested itself of the remainder of Central after the Australian investor Robert Holmes à Court staged a boardroom coup and forced Grade to cede control. ACC remained in control of ITC and Stoll-Moss Theatres until 1988 when The Bell Group, the owners of ITC were taken over by the Bond Corporation. Subsequently, the new owners started an asset-stripping programme at ITC. In November 1988, ITC Entertainment was bought by its management.

In January 1995, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment bought ITC for $156 million, with Grade returning as chairman for life, bringing him back into control of ITC until his death in 1998. Carlton Communications spent much of the 1980s and 1990s buying up the intellectual property of the former ACC, including the rights to the ATV logo and company name, the ATV news archive (via its purchase of Central) and finally in early January 1999, the company bought ITC&#x27;s television and film library from PolyGram/Seagram for £91 million, which reunited the programme library of ATV and Central Television and doubled the stock of its library division &quot;Carlton International&quot;, by giving it a total of 15,000 hours of programming.

Granada plc merged with Carlton in 2004, and all of ATV&#x27;s national archive programming has been taken into their ownership. The regional news archive from both ATV and Central, plus some regional programmes, are stored at the Media Archive for Central England at the University of Lincoln.

==Studios==

For most of its time on air, ATV&#x27;s main production centre was based at Elstree, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, near London, where the majority of ATV&#x27;s earlier programming was produced and distributed. The Elstree studios had been film studios since 1914, and when ATV acquired them in May 1958, the intention was to use them for ITC TV shows shot on film. One of the first productions to be filmed was &quot;The Adventures of William Tell&quot;. ATV London used a number of other converted locations for live and video-taped shows during its first decade on air, such as the Wood Green Empire, the Hackney Empire, the former Highbury Film Studios, and briefly, the New Cross Empire, but it soon became clear these were inadequate and it was decided to convert the Elstree studios from film to electronic production. The first of four studios there opened in November 1960. 

Playout and presentation for ATV London was based at a separate master control facility at Foley Street in Central London, which included two studios for continuity and smaller-scale programming, such as &quot;Police 5&quot;. Shortly after ATV ceased transmission in London, the Foley Street centre was also used to transmit a management-run national ITV service during the ITV technicians&#x27; strike of August 1968.

ATV&#x27;s Midlands studios were originally based in Aston, Birmingham, jointly owned by ATV and ABC under the banner Alpha Television. They supplied both ATV and ABC, and supplemented production from Elstree. In readiness for colour television, a large &#x27;state of the art&#x27; television studio was built by ATV, the ATV Centre off Broad Street near the centre of Birmingham. This replaced the Aston studios, which were sold. The ATV Centre was in use until 1997 although two of the production studios had been &#x27;mothballed&#x27; in the early 1990s as demand for production studios fell. As of June 2014, the complex has been partially demolished to be replaced by the upcoming Arena Central development, with the main studio building off Bridge Street standing derelict, pending the commencement of further demolition work. The Alpha Tower remains as a listed building.

A documentary about the ATV Centre was released in 2011 by MACE (Media Archive for Central England). Entitled &quot;From ATVLand In Colour&quot; (referring to the nickname used on ATV&#x27;s children&#x27;s programme, &quot;Tiswas&quot;, and the building being purpose-built for colour broadcasting), the documentary features presenters, actors, announcers and behind-the-scenes staff talking about their time working there, and the programmes that were made there. Contributors include Chris Tarrant, Shaw Taylor, Jane Rossington and Bob Carolgees.

In the 1981 franchise review, the IBA ordered that for ATV Midlands to keep the franchise the Elstree centre must be sold and a studio centre built in the east of the region. ATV Midlands, renamed Central Independent Television, needed an immediate start for separate East and West Midlands facilities. The new east site was at Lenton Lane, Nottingham, and the land had been bought while ATV was still in control. Planning issues delayed construction so Central purchased an independent production studio in the city (at Giltbrook) as its East Midlands newsroom. Industrial action prevented this centre from being used, with the new studios ready by the time it was resolved.

In 1983 the Elstree centre was sold to the BBC for around £7 million, and is now home of the soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

&quot;East Midlands Television Centre&quot; in Nottingham began operation in September 1983 but was officially opened by H.R.H. Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, in March 1984. The studio was eventually sold in 2004 to the University of Nottingham as an independent facility and as the home of the Media Archive for Central England, where most of ATV&#x27;s and Central&#x27;s programmes are archived.

==Identity==
ATV&#x27;s logo has always consisted of a shadowed eye, inspired supposedly by the logo of CBS. This shadowed eye with the letters ATV inside came to represent the company. The first ident featured a single eye shape, moving to reveal the shadowed eye, and animating so that each of the letters ATV animate in accompanied by one of the three musical notes on the ident score. The caption below read &quot;Associated TeleVision Ltd.&quot;, the only time the station&#x27;s full name was displayed in an ident. The shadowed eye however was out of proportion, attributed to the hurry to redraw the ident following the name change from ABC.

Shortly after the launch of the Midlands franchise, the ident was again changed to an ident consisting of five stripes. Three of four vertical stripes contain the letters ATV, which animate in to the same musical score, with the other vertical stripe housing the logo and the stations airing times, either displaying both or those of the region being viewed in. the final stripe is horizontal, with the caption &#x27;Presents&#x27; inside.

The next ident, launched in 1959, featured the shadowed eye zooming into the screen, whilst the familiar letters animate in as in the previous versions. This was altered in 1964 to add either the region name below it, or the word &#x27;Presents&#x27; if the programme was an outside broadcast.

The company&#x27;s most recognisable ident, however, is the one launched in 1969. Called Zoom 2, it was the ident that heralded colour broadcasts to the region for the first time. Starting with three lightspots of red, blue and green that grow individually and combine to form six colours above the caption &#x27;In Colour&#x27;, the three lightspots fully merge forming a single cream dot which then animates out into the ATV shadowed eye, fully formed, in yellow, while the background dissolves from light grey to dark blue. The score for the ident featured four trumpets, four trombones, timpani and vibraphone in a twelve beat fanfare for the station, by ATV&#x27;s musical director Jack Parnell and arranged by Angela Morley. This ident was used from the introduction of colour in 1969 right until the ATV name ceased to be used in 1982. In addition to this, a variation was produced which only featured a white dot on a black background, growing and transforming into the white shadowed eye for programmes still being shown in black and white.

===Revival of brand===
In 2015, ITV Broadcasting Ltd surrendered its rights to the ATV trademark and it was acquired by Associated Television Productions Ltd which has produced programming for the Made Television network of local television channels.

The company, ATV Network Limited, was re-established in 2006 headed by former ATV cameraman, director and Head of Children&#x27;s Drama Alan Coleman. It aims to promote and celebrate the legacy of Lew Grade&#x27;s ATV, with a new logo, based on the &#x27;litespots&#x27; of the 1970s. Noting it felt the iconic symbol was best left in the past.

==Other ventures==

===ATV Music===
As a side note to ATV&#x27;s television activities, the company also set up a music publishing division. This was known as ATV Music and existed initially to publish TV-related music, such as theme tunes, composed by its in-house composers. It was formed after ATV acquired a substantial share of Pye Records. This company was eventually split away from the parent company and went through numerous different owners as well as buying into other established music publishers including Northern Songs, which was the Beatles&#x27; publishing company. ATV Music eventually settled into the hands of Michael Jackson before being merged into Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

<text>Pirahã (also spelled &quot;Pirahá, Pirahán&quot;), or Múra-Pirahã, is the indigenous language of the Pirahã people of Amazonas, Brazil. The Pirahã live along the Maici River, a tributary of the Amazon River.

Pirahã is the only surviving dialect of the Mura language; all others having died out in the last few centuries as most groups of the Mura people have shifted to Portuguese. Due to this, Pirahã can be considered its own language now, as no other Mura dialects have survived. Suspected relatives, such as Matanawi, are also extinct. Pirahã is estimated to have between 250 and 380 speakers. It is not in immediate danger of extinction, as its use is vigorous and the Pirahã community is mostly monolingual.

The Pirahã language is the subject of various controversial claims; for example, that it provides evidence against linguistic relativity. The controversy is compounded by the sheer difficulty of learning the language; the number of linguists with field experience in Pirahã is very small.

==Endonyms==
Speakers refer to their language as , and to their own ethnic group as .

==Phonology==

The Pirahã language is one of the phonologically simplest languages known, comparable to Rotokas (New Guinea) and the Lakes Plain languages such as Obokuitai. There is a claim that Pirahã has as few as ten phonemes, one fewer than Rotokas, or even as few as nine for women, but this requires analyzing as an underlying and having /h/ invariably substituted for /s/ in female speech. Although such a phenomenon is odd cross-linguistically, Ian Maddieson has found in researching Pirahã data that does indeed exhibit an unusual distribution in the language.

The &quot;ten phoneme&quot; claim also does not consider the tones of Pirahã, at least two of which are phonemic (marked by an acute accent and either unmarked or marked by a grave accent in Daniel Everett), bringing the number of phonemes to at least twelve. Sheldon (1988) claims three tones, high (¹), mid (²) and low (³).

===Phoneme inventory===
When languages have inventories as small and allophonic variation as great as in Pirahã and Rotokas, different linguists may have very different ideas as to the nature of their phonological systems.

====Vowels====
====Consonants====
The segmental phonemes are:

* is written .
* Everett posits that is an allophone of the sequence .
* Women sometimes substitute for .

The number of phonemes is at most thirteen, matching Hawaiian, if is counted as a phoneme and there are just two tones; if is not phonemic, there are twelve phonemes, one more than the number found in Rotokas, or eleven among women who uniformly replace /s/ with /h/. (English, by comparison, has thirty to forty-five, depending on dialect.) However, many of the phonemes show a great deal of allophonic variation. For instance, vowels are nasalized after the glottal consonants and (written &quot;h&quot; and &quot;x&quot;). Also,
* : the nasal after a pause, the trill before .
* : the nasal (an apical alveolar nasal) after a pause; is a lateral alveolar–linguolabial double flap that has only been reported for this language, where the tongue strikes the upper gum ridge and then strikes the lower lip. However, it is only used in certain special types of speech performances and so might not be considered a normal speech sound.
* : in women&#x27;s speech, occurs as before , and &quot;sometimes&quot; elsewhere.
* : in men&#x27;s speech, word-initial and are interchangeable. For many people, and may be exchanged in some words. The sequences and are said to be in free variation with and , at least in some words.

Because of its variation, Everett states that is not a stable phoneme. By analyzing it as , he is able to theoretically reduce the number of consonants to seven (or six for women with constant /h/-substitution).

== Syntax ==

===Pronouns===
The basic Pirahã personal pronouns are:
* &quot;I, we&quot;
* or &quot;you&quot;
* &quot;(s)he, they, this&quot;

These can be serially combined: or to mean &quot;we&quot; (inclusive and exclusive), and to mean &quot;you (plural)&quot;, or combined with &#x27;all&#x27;, as in &quot;we (all) go&quot;.

There are several other pronouns reported, such as &#x27;she&#x27;, &#x27;it&#x27; (animal), &#x27;it&#x27; (aquatic animal), and &#x27;it&#x27; (inanimate), but these may actually be nouns, and they cannot be used independently the way the three basic pronouns can. The fact that different linguists come up with different lists of such pronouns suggests that they are not basic to the grammar. In two recent papers, Everett cites Sheldon as agreeing with his (Everett&#x27;s) analysis of the pronouns.

Sheldon (1988) gives the following list of pronouns:
Pronouns are prefixed to the verb, in the order where includes a preposition &quot;to&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, etc. They may all be omitted, e.g., &quot;he will send you to me&quot;.

For possession, a pronoun is used in apposition (zero-marking):

Thomason &amp; Everett (2001) note the pronouns are formally close to those of the Tupian languages Nheengatu and Tenharim, which the Mura had once used as contact languages:
Both the Tupian and Pirahã third-person pronouns can be used as demonstratives, as in Pirahã &quot;I am really smart&quot; ( &quot;This one sees well: me&quot;). Given the restricted set of Pirahã phonemes, the Pirahã pronouns and are what one would expect if the Tupian pronouns were borrowed, and differs only in dropping the .

===Verbs===
Pirahã is agglutinative, using a large number of affixes to communicate grammatical meaning. Even the &#x27;to be&#x27; verbs of existence or equivalence are suffixes in Pirahã. For instance, the Pirahã sentence &quot;there is a paca there&quot; uses just two words; the copula is a suffix on &quot;paca&quot;:

Pirahã also uses suffixes that communicate evidentiality, a category lacking in English grammar. One such suffix, , means that the speaker actually observed the event in question:

(The suffix -sai turns a verb into a noun, like English &#x27;-ing&#x27;.)

Other verbal suffixes indicate that an action is deduced from circumstantial evidence, or based on hearsay. Unlike in English, in Pirahã speakers must state their source of information: they cannot be ambiguous. There are also verbal suffixes that indicate desire to perform an action, frustration in completing an action, or frustration in even starting an action.

There are also a large number of verbal aspects: perfective (completed) vs. imperfective (uncompleted), telic (reaching a goal) vs. atelic, continuing, repeated, and commencing. However, despite this complexity, there appears to be little distinction of transitivity. For example, the same verb, , can mean either &#x27;look&#x27; or &#x27;see&#x27;, and can mean either &#x27;die&#x27; or &#x27;kill&#x27;.

The verbs are, however, zero-marked, with no grammatical agreement with the arguments of the verb.

According to Sheldon (1988), the Pirahã verb has eight main suffix-slots, and a few sub-slots:
* Slot A
** intensive 
** Ø
* Slot B
** causative/incompletive 
** causative/completive 
** inchoative/incompletive 
** inchoative/completive 
** future/somewhere 
** future/elsewhere 
** past 
** Ø
* Slot C
** negative/optative + C1
*** Slot C1
**** preventive 
**** opinionated 
**** possible Ø
** positive/optative 
** negative/indicative + C2
** positive/indicative Ø + C2
*** Slot C2
**** declarative 
**** probabilistic/certain 
**** probabilistic/uncertain/beginning 
**** probabilistic/uncertain/execution 
**** probabilistic/uncertain/completion 
**** stative 
**** interrogative1/progressive 
**** interrogative2/progressive 
**** interrogative1 
**** interrogative2 
**** Ø
* Slot D
** continuative 
** repetitive 
** Ø
* Slot E
** immediate 
** intentive 
** Ø
* Slot F
** durative 
** Ø
* Slot G
** desiderative 
** Ø
* Slot H
** causal 
** conclusive 
** emphatic/reiterative + H1
** emphatic + H1
** reiterative + H1
** Ø + H1
*** Slot H1
**** present 
**** past 
**** pastImmediate 
These suffixes undergo some phonetic changes depending on context. For instance, the continuative reduces to after a consonant:

Also an epenthetic vowel gets inserted between two suffixes if necessary to avoid a consonant-cluster; the vowel is either (before or after , , or ) or (other cases):

Conversely, when the junction of two morphemes creates a double vowel (ignoring tones), the vowel with the lower tone is suppressed:

For further details, see Sheldon&#x27;s 1988 paper.

===Embedding===
Everett originally claimed that in order to embed one clause within another, the embedded clause is turned into a noun with the suffix seen above:

The examples of embedding were limited to one level of depth, so that to say &quot;He really knows how to talk about making arrows&quot;, more than one sentence would be needed.

Everett has also concluded that because Pirahã does not have number-words for counting, does not allow recursive adjective-lists like &quot;the green wealthy hunchbacked able golfer&quot;, and does not allow recursive possessives like &quot;The child&#x27;s friend&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house&quot;, a Pirahã sentence must have a length limit. This leads to the additional conclusion that the number of different possible sentences in Pirahã with any given vocabulary is finite.

Everett has also recently reinterpreted even the limited form of embedding in the example above as parataxis. He now states that Pirahã does not admit any embedding at all, not even one level deep. He says that words that appear to form a clause in the example are actually a separate unembedded sentence, which, in context, expresses the same thought that would be expressed by a clause in English. He gives evidence for this based on the lack of specialized words for clause-formation, the pattern of coreferring tokens in the purported clause-constructions, and examples where the purported clause is separated from the rest of the sentence by other complete sentences.

Everett stated that Pirahã cannot say &quot;John&#x27;s brother&#x27;s house&quot; but must say, &quot;John has a brother. This brother has a house.&quot; in two separate sentences.

According to Everett the statement that Pirahã is a finite language without embedding and without recursion presents a challenge for proposals by Noam Chomsky and others concerning universal grammar—on the grounds that if these proposals are correct, all languages should show evidence of recursive (and similar) grammatical structures.

Chomsky has replied that he considers recursion to be an innate cognitive capacity that is available for use in language but that the capacity may or may not manifest itself in any one particular language.

However, as Everett points out, the language can have recursion in ideas, with some ideas in a story being less important than others. He also mentions a paper from a recursion conference in 2005 describing recursive behaviors in deer as they forage for food. So to him, recursion can be a brain property that humans have developed more than other animals. He points out that the criticism of his conclusions uses his own doctoral thesis to refute his knowledge and conclusions drawn after a subsequent twenty-nine years of research.

Everett&#x27;s observation that the language does not allow recursion has also been vigorously disputed by other linguists, who call attention to data and arguments from Everett&#x27;s own previous publications, which interpreted the &quot;-sai&quot; construction as embedding. Everett has responded that his earlier understanding of the language was incomplete and slanted by theoretical bias. He now says that the morpheme attached to the main verb of a clause merely marks the clause as &#x27;old information&#x27;, and is not a nominalizer at all (or a marker of embedding). More recently, the German linguist Uli Sauerland of the &quot;Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft&quot; at Humboldt University (Berlin) has performed a phonetic reanalysis of experimental data in which Pirahã speakers were asked to repeat utterances by Everett. Sauerland reports that these speakers make a tonal distinction in their use of &quot;-sai&quot; that &quot;provides evidence for the existence of complex clauses in Pirahã&quot;.

==Lexicon==
Pirahã has a few loan words, mainly from Portuguese. Pirahã (&quot;cup&quot;) is from the Portuguese word , and (&quot;business&quot;) comes from Portuguese (&quot;merchandise&quot;).

===Kinship terms===
Everett (2005) says that the Pirahã culture has the simplest known kinship system of any human culture. A single word, (pronounced ), is used for both &#x27;mother&#x27; and &#x27;father&#x27; (like English &quot;parent&quot; although Pirahã has no gendered alternative), and they appear not to keep track of relationships any more distant than biological siblings.

===Numerals and grammatical number===
According to Everett in 1986, Pirahã has words for &#x27;one&#x27; () and &#x27;two&#x27; (), distinguished only by tone. In his 2005 analysis, however, Everett said that Pirahã has no words for numerals at all, and that and actually mean &quot;small quantity&quot; and &quot;larger quantity&quot;. Frank et al. (2008) describes two experiments on four Pirahã speakers that were designed to test these two hypotheses.

In one, ten spools of thread were placed on a table one at a time and the Pirahã were asked how many were there. All four speakers answered in accordance with the hypothesis that the language has words for &#x27;one&#x27; and &#x27;two&#x27; in this experiment, uniformly using for one spool, for two spools, and a mixture of the second word and &#x27;many&#x27; for more than two spools.

The second experiment, however, started with ten spools of thread on the table, and spools were subtracted one at a time. In this experiment, one speaker used (the word previously supposed to mean &#x27;one&#x27;) when there were six spools left, and all four speakers used that word consistently when there were as many as three spools left. Though Frank and his colleagues do not attempt to explain their subjects&#x27; difference in behavior in these two experiments, they conclude that the two words under investigation &quot;are much more likely to be relative or comparative terms like &#x27;few&#x27; or &#x27;fewer&#x27; than absolute terms like &#x27;one.

There is no grammatical distinction between singular and plural, even in pronouns.

A 2012 documentary aired on the Smithsonian Channel reported that a school had been opened for the Pirahã community where they learn Portuguese and mathematics. As a consequence, observations involving concepts like the notion of quantity (which has a singular treatment in Pirahã language) became impossible, because of the influence of the new knowledge on the results.

===Color terms===
There is also a claim that Pirahã lacks any unique color terminology, being one of the few cultures (mostly in the Amazon basin and New Guinea) that only have specific words for &#x27;light&#x27; and &#x27;dark&#x27; if that claim is true. Although the Pirahã glossary in Daniel Everett&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis includes a list of color words (p. 354), Everett (2006) now says that the items listed in this glossary are not in fact words but descriptive phrases (such as &quot;(like) blood&quot; for &quot;red&quot;).

==Unusual features of the language==
Everett, over the course of more than two dozen papers and one book about the language, has ascribed various surprising features to the language, including:
* One of the smallest phoneme inventories of any known language and a correspondingly high degree of allophonic variation, including two very rare sounds, and . Both are reported to be used as phonemes in only this language, but the latter is similar to the sound of blowing a raspberry, known among practically all cultures but not used as a linguistic phoneme. The Pirahã are by now apparently aware of the latter&#x27;s meaning in other cultures and avoid using the phoneme with foreigners.
* An extremely limited clause structure, not allowing for nested recursive sentences like &quot;Mary said that John thought that Henry was fired&quot;.
* No abstract color words other than terms for light and dark (though this is disputed in commentaries by Paul Kay and others on Everett (2005)).
* The entire set of personal pronouns appears to have been borrowed from Nheengatu, a Tupi-based lingua franca. Although there is no documentation of a prior stage of Pirahã, the close resemblance of the Pirahã pronouns to those of Nheengatu makes this hypothesis plausible.
* Pirahã can be whistled, hummed, or encoded in music. In fact, Keren Everett believes that current research on the language misses much of its meaning by paying little attention to the language&#x27;s prosody. Consonants and vowels may be omitted altogether and the meaning conveyed solely through variations in pitch, stress, and rhythm. She says that mothers teach their children the language through constantly singing the same musical patterns.

Daniel Everett claims that the absence of recursion in the language, if real, falsifies the basic assumption of modern Chomskyan linguistics. This claim is contested by many linguists, who claim that recursion has been observed in Pirahã by Daniel Everett himself, while Everett argues that those utterances that superficially seemed recursive to him at first were misinterpretations caused by his earlier lack of familiarity with the language. Furthermore, some linguists, including Chomsky himself, argue that even if Pirahã lacked recursion, that would have no implications for Chomskyan linguistics.

==Pirahã and linguistic relativity==
The concept of linguistic relativity postulates a relationship between the language a person speaks and how that person understands the world. The conclusions about the significance of Pirahã numeracy and linguistic relativity in Frank &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) are quoted below. In short, in this study the Pirahã were – by and large – able to match exact quantities of objects set before them (even larger quantities), but had difficulty matching exact quantities when larger quantities were set before them and then hidden from view before they were asked to match them.

A total lack of exact quantity language did not prevent the Pirahã from accurately performing a task which relied on the exact numerical equivalence of large sets. This evidence argues against the strong Whorfian claim that language for number creates the concept of exact quantity. [...] Instead, the case of Pirahã suggests that languages that can express large, exact cardinalities have a more modest effect on the cognition of their speakers: They allow the speakers to remember and compare information about cardinalities accurately across space, time, and changes in modality. [...] &quot;Thus, the Pirahã understand the concept of one (in spite of having no word for the concept). Additionally, they appear to understand that adding or subtracting one from a set will change the quantity of that set, though the generality of this knowledge is difficult to assess without the ability to label sets of arbitrary cardinality using number words.&quot; (emphasis added)
Being concerned that, because of this cultural gap, they were being cheated in trade, the Pirahã people asked Daniel Everett to teach them basic numeracy skills. After eight months of enthusiastic but fruitless daily study with Everett, the Pirahã concluded that they were incapable of learning the material and discontinued the lessons. Not a single Pirahã had learned to count up to ten or even to add 1 + 1.

Everett argues that test-subjects are unable to count for two cultural reasons and one formal linguistic reason. First, they are nomadic hunter-gatherers with nothing to count and hence no need to practice doing so. Second, they have a cultural constraint against generalizing beyond the present, which eliminates number-words. Third, since, according to some researchers, numerals and counting are based on recursion in the language, the absence of recursion in their language entails a lack of counting. That is, it is the lack of need that explains both the lack of counting-ability and the lack of corresponding vocabulary. However, Everett does not claim that the Pirahãs are cognitively incapable of counting.

==Knowledge of other languages==
Everett states that most of the remaining Pirahã speakers are monolingual, knowing only a few words of Portuguese. The anthropologist Marco Antônio Gonçalves, who lived with the Pirahã for 18 months over several years, writes that most of the men understand Portuguese, though not all of them are able to express themselves in the language. Women have little understanding of Portuguese and never use it as a form of expression. The men developed a contact &#x27;language&#x27; or pidgin that allowed them to communicate with regional populations, mixing words from Pirahã, Portuguese and Nheengatu, an Amazonian General Language.&quot;

Everett states that the Pirahã use a very rudimentary Portuguese lexicon with Pirahã grammar when speaking Portuguese and that their Portuguese is so limited to very specific topics that they are rightly called monolingual, without contradicting Gonçalves (since they can communicate on a very narrow range of topics using a very restricted lexicon). Future research on developing bilingualism (Pirahã-Portuguese) in the community, along the lines of Sakel and Gonçalves, will provide valuable data for the discussion on speakers&#x27; grammatical competence (e.g. regarding the effect of culture). Although Gonçalves quotes whole stories told by the Pirahã, Everett (2009) claims that the Portuguese in these stories is not a literal transcription of what was said, but a free translation from the pidgin Portuguese of the Pirahã.

In a 2012 study, Jeanette Sakel studied the use of Portuguese by a group of Pirahã speakers and reported that, when speaking Portuguese, most Pirahã speakers employ simple syntactic constructions, but some more proficient speakers utilize constructions that could be analysed as complex constructions, such as subordinating conjunctions and complement clauses.

<text>Whistled languages are linguistic systems that use whistling as a form of speech and facilitate communication between individuals. More than 80 languages have been found to practice various degrees of whistling, most of them in rugged topography or dense forests, where whistling expands the area of communication while movement to carry messages is challenging. The practice is generally threatened by increased modernization and faster roads, but successful conservation efforts are recorded.

== Definition ==
A whistled language is a system of whistled communication which allows fluent whistlers to transmit and comprehend a potentially unlimited number of messages over long distances. Whistled languages are different in this respect from free associative whistling, which may be done to simulate music, to attract attention, or, in the case of herders or animal trainers, to transmit simple messages or instructions to animal companions. Generally, whistled languages emulate the tones or vowel formants of a natural spoken language, as well as aspects of its intonation and prosody, so that trained listeners who speak that language can understand the encoded message.

Whistled language is rare compared to spoken language, but it is found in cultures around the world. It is especially common in tone languages where the whistled tones transmit the tones of the syllables (tone melodies of the words). This might be because in tone languages the tone melody carries more of the functional load of communication while non-tonal phonology carries proportionally less. The genesis of a whistled language has never been recorded in either case and has not yet received much productive study.

== History ==
Because whistled language is so much rarer than standard vocal language or non-verbal physical language such as sign language, historical research on whistled speech is sparse. 

In early China, the technique of transcendental whistling, or &quot;xiao&quot;, was a kind of nonverbal language with affinities to the spiritual aspects of Daoist meditation. The development of xiao as a practice and art form can be traced through the works of the Western Zhou dynasty, and it was initially used to convey a sense of grief, or to invoke the spirits of dearly departed loved ones. By the time of the Six Dynasties in Han China, xiao had become a widely-used complement to spoken language, irrespective of social class. Due to the shrill tones employed while whistling, xiao was often used to punctuate intense feelings or reactions, such as joy, displeasure, and surprise. 

In the Melpomene, the fourth book of his &quot;Histories&quot;, Herodotus makes a passing reference to an Ethiopian tribe who &quot;spoke like bats&quot;. While travelling through the territory of an ancient tribe on the southern Black Sea coast in 400 B.C.E, Xenophon wrote in the Anabasis that the Mossynoeci inhabitants could hear one another at great distances across the valleys. The same area encompasses the Turkish village of Kuşköy where whistled speech (kuş dili) is practiced today. Aelian later wrote in &quot;De Natura Animalium&quot; of the Kinoprosipi people of North Africa, who made use of &quot;acute whistling,&quot; who later historians believe were likely a tribe of the Anuak in South Sudan. 

In 1982 in the Greek village of Antia on Euboea island, the entire population knew the local whistled speech called &quot;sfyria&quot;, but only a few whistlers remain now.

== Causes of whistled language development ==

=== Ecology ===
Whistled languages have naturally developed in response to the necessity for humans to communicate in conditions of relative isolation, with possible causes being distance, noise levels, and night, as well as specific activities, such as social information, shepherding, hunting, fishing, courtship, or shamanism. Because of this usage, they are mostly related to places with mountains or dense forests. Southern China, Papua New Guinea, the Amazon forest, Subsaharan Africa, Mexico, and Europe encompass most of these locations.

They have been more recently found in dense forests like the Amazon where they may replace spoken dialogue in the villages while hunting or fishing to overcome the pressure of the acoustic environment. The main advantage of whistling speech is that it allows the speaker to cover much larger distances (typically but up to in mountains and less in reverberating forests) than ordinary speech, without the strain (and lesser range) of shouting. More specifically, whistle speech can reach a loudness of 130 dB, and the transmission range can reach up to 10 km (as verified in La Gomera, Canary Island). The long range of whistling is enhanced by the mountainous terrain found in areas where whistled languages are used. Many areas with such languages work hard to preserve their ancient traditions, in the face of rapidly advancing telecommunications systems in many areas.

=== Culture ===
In some cases (e.g. Chinantec) the whistled speech is an important and integral part of the language and culture; in others (e.g. Nahuatl) its role is much lesser. Whistled speech may be very central and highly valued in a culture. Shouting is very rare in Sochiapam Chinantec. Men in that culture are subject to being fined if they do not handle whistle-speech well enough to perform certain town jobs. They may whistle for fun in situations where spoken speech could easily be heard. 

In Sochiapam, Oaxaca, and other places in Mexico, and reportedly in West and Southern Africa as well (specifically among the VhaVenda), whistled speech is men&#x27;s language: although women may understand it, they do not use it.

Though whistled languages are not secret codes or secret languages (with the exception of a whistled language used by ñañigos insurgencies in Cuba during Spanish occupation), they may be used for secretive communication among outsiders or others who do not know or understand the whistled language though they may understand its spoken origin. Stories are told of farmers in Aas during World War II, or in La Gomera, who were able to hide evidence of such nefarious activities as milk-watering because they were warned in whistle-speech that the police were approaching.

=== Documentation ===
Various documentation, conservation, and revitalization effort are ongoing. In France, the whistling of Aas is being systematically audio-recorded using open source Lingua Libre. Those recordings have been used to create an interactive maps of Occitan villages names.

== Characteristics of whistled languages==

=== Tonal and non-tonal whistle languages ===

Whistled languages differ according to whether the spoken language is tonal or not, with the whistling being either tone or articulation based (or both). Most whistle languages, of which there are several hundred, are based on tonal languages.

A way in which true whistled languages differ from other types of whistled communication is that they encode auditory features of spoken languages by &#x27;transposing&#x27; (i.e.carrying over into a whistled form) key components of speech sounds. There are two types of whistled languages: those based on non-tone languages, which transpose F² formants patterns, those based on tone languages which transpose tonal-melodies. However, both types of whistle tones have a phonological structure that is related to the spoken language that they are transposing.

Tonal languages are often stripped of articulation, leaving only suprasegmental features such as duration and tone, and when whistled retain the spoken melodic line. Thus whistled tonal languages convey phonemic information solely through tone, length, and, to a lesser extent, stress, and most segmental phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are lost.

In non-tonal languages, more of the articulatory features of speech are retained, and the normally timbral variations imparted by the movements of the tongue and soft palate are transformed into pitch variations. Certain consonants can be pronounced while whistling, so as to modify the whistled sound, much as consonants in spoken language modify the vowel sounds adjacent to them.

Different whistling styles may be used in a single language. Sochiapam Chinantec has three different words for whistle-speech: sie3 for whistling with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, jui̵32 for bilabial whistling, and juo2 for finger-in-the-mouth whistling. These are used for communication over varying distances. There is also a kind of loud falsetto (hóh32) which functions in some ways like whistled speech.

==== Tonal whistle languages and types of tones ====

Only the tone of the speech is saved in the whistle, while aspects as articulation and phonation are eliminated. These are replaced by other features such as stress and rhythmical variations. However, some languages, like that of the Zezuru who speak a Shona-derived dialect, include articulation so that consonants interrupt the flow of the whistle. A similar language is the Tsonga whistle language used in the highlands in the Southern parts of Mozambique. This should not be confused with the whistled sibilants of Shona.

There are two different types of whistle tones - hole tones and edge tones. A hole (or &#x27;orifice&#x27;) tone is produced by a fast-moving cylinder (or &#x27;vena contracta&#x27;) of air that interacts with the slow-moving anulus of air surrounding it. Instability in the boundary layer leads to perturbations that increase in size until a feedback path is established whereby specific frequencies of the resonance chamber are emphasized. An edge tone, on the other hand, is generated by a thin jet of air that strikes an obstacle. Vortices are shed near the point of disturbance in the flow, alternating on each side of the obstacle or &#x27;wedge&#x27;.

One of the best-studied whistled languages is a whistled language based on Spanish called Silbo, whistled on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands (Rialland 2005). The number of distinctive sounds or phonemes in this language is a matter of disagreement, varying according to the researcher from two to five vowels and four to nine consonants. This variation may reflect differences in speakers&#x27; abilities as well as in the methods used to elicit contrasts. The work of Meyer clarifies this debate by providing the first statistical analyses of production for various whistlers as well as psycholinguistic tests of vowel identification.

==== Non-tonal whistle languages ====

In a non-tonal language, segments may be differentiated as follows:

:Vowels are replaced by a set of relative pitch ranges generally tracking the f2 formant of spoken language.

:Stress is expressed by higher pitch or increased length

:Consonants are produced by pitch transitions of different lengths and height, plus the presence or absence of occlusion. (&quot;Labial stops are replaced by diaphragm or glottal occlusions.&quot;)

=== Sound production techniques ===
Whistling techniques do not require the vibration of the vocal cords: they produce a shock effect of the compressed air stream inside the cavity of the mouth and/or of the hands. When the jaws are fixed by a finger, the size of the hole is stable. The air stream expelled makes vibrations at the edge of the mouth. The faster the air stream is expelled, the higher is the noise inside the cavities. If the hole (mouth) and the cavity (intra-oral volume) are well matched, the resonance is tuned, and the whistle is projected more loudly. The frequency of this bioacoustical phenomenon is modulated by the morphing of the resonating cavity that can be, to a certain extent, related to the articulation of the equivalent spoken form. &quot;Apart from the five vowel-phonemes [of Silbo Gomero]—and even these do not invariably have a fixed or steady pitch—all whistled speech-sound realizations are glides which are interpreted in terms of range, contour, and steepness.&quot;

==== Bilabial and labiodental techniques ====

There are a few different techniques of how to produce whistle speech, the choice of which is dependent on practical concerns. Bilabial and labiodental techniques are common for short and medium distance discussions (in a market, in the noise of a room, or for hunting); whereas the tongue retroflexed, one or two fingers introduced in the mouth, a blow concentrated at the junction between two fingers or the lower lip pulled while breathing in air are techniques used to reach high levels of power for long distance speaking. Each place has its favorite trend that depends on the most common use of the village and on the personal preferences of each whistler. Whistling with a leaf or a flute is often related to courtship or poetic expression (reported in the Kickapoo language in Mexico and in the Hmong and Akha cultures in Asia).

==== Physics ====
&quot;All whistled languages share one basic characteristic: they function by varying the frequency of a simple wave-form as a function of time, generally with minimal dynamic variations, which is readily understandable since in most cases their only purpose is long-distance communication.&quot; A whistled tone is essentially a simple oscillation (or sine wave), and thus timbral variations are impossible. Normal articulation during an ordinary lip-whistle is relatively easy though the lips move little causing a constant of labialization and making labial and labiodental consonants (p, b, m, f, etc.) problematical.

=== Comparison with spoken languages ===

==== Limited expressivity ====
The expressivity of whistled speech is likely to be somewhat limited compared to spoken speech (although not inherently so), but such a conclusion should not be taken as absolute, as it depends heavily on various factors including the phonology of the language. For example, in some tonal languages with few tones, whistled messages typically consist of stereotyped or otherwise standardized expressions, are elaborately descriptive, and often have to be repeated. However, in heavily tonal languages such as Mazatec and Yoruba, a large amount of information is conveyed through pitch even when spoken, and therefore extensive conversations may be whistled. In any case, even for non-tonal languages, measurements indicate that high intelligibility can be achieved with whistled speech (90%) of intelligibility of non-standardized sentences for Greek and the equivalent for Turkish.

==== Lack of comprehension ====
The lack of understanding can be seen with a confusion matrix. It was tested using two speakers of Silbo (Jampolsky 1999). The study revealed that generally, the vowels were relatively easy to understand, and the consonants a bit more difficult.

== Other means of expressing speech ==
In West Africa, speech may be conveyed by a whistle or other musical instrument, most famously the &quot;talking drums&quot;. However, while drums may be used by griots singing praise songs or for inter-village communication, and other instruments may be used on the radio for station identification jingles, for regular conversation at a distance whistled speech is used. As two people approach each other, one may even switch from whistled to spoken speech in mid-sentence.

<text>The Spur Ryal was an extremely rare English gold coin issued in the reign of King James I. The coin is a development of the earlier Rose Noble, or Ryal which was worth ten shillings when issued by Kings Edward IV and Henry VII, and fifteen shillings when issued by Queens Mary and Elizabeth I.

The Spur Ryal, so called because the sun and rose on the reverse resemble a spur, was introduced during James I&#x27;s second coinage (1604–1619) when it initially had a value of fifteen [[shillings]] (15/-), but in line with all gold coins its value was raised by 10% in 1612, to sixteen shillings and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] (16/6). The design of this first issue shows on the obverse the king in a ship holding a sword and shield, surrounded by the legend -- &quot;James by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;. The reverse shows a rose over a radiant star, with a lion and crown in each quarter surrounded by the legend (shorthand for the Latin &quot;A DOMINO FACTUM EST ISTUD ET EST MIRABILE&quot;) -- &quot;This is the Lord&#x27;s doing and it is marvellous (in our eyes)&quot;.

During James&#x27; third coinage (1619–1625) a new-style lighter spur ryal was issued with the value and weight reduced to fifteen shillings (15/-). On the obverse is a lion holding a sceptre over the royal shield which divides the value &quot;XV&quot; for fifteen shillings, surrounded by the legend -- &quot;James by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;. The reverse shows, as before, a rose over a radiant star, with a lion and crown in each quarter surrounded by the legend -- &quot;This is the Lord&#x27;s doing and it is marvellous (in our eyes)&quot;.

<doc id="222177" wikidata="Q1141026" url="?curid=222177" title="Gastrulation">
<text>Gastrulation is the stage in the early embryonic development of most animals, during which the blastula (a single-layered hollow sphere of cells), or in mammals the blastocyst, is reorganized into a two-layered or three-layered embryo known as the gastrula. Before gastrulation, the embryo is a continuous epithelial sheet of cells; by the end of gastrulation, the embryo has begun differentiation to establish distinct cell lineages, set up the basic axes of the body (e.g. dorsal–ventral, anterior–posterior), and internalized one or more cell types including the prospective gut.

== Gastrula layers ==

In triploblastic organisms, the gastrula is trilaminar (three-layered). These three germ layers are the ectoderm (outer layer), mesoderm (middle layer), and endoderm (inner layer). In diploblastic organisms, such as Cnidaria and Ctenophora, the gastrula has only ectoderm and endoderm. The two layers are also sometimes referred to as the &quot;hypoblast&quot; and &quot;epiblast&quot;. Sponges do not go through the gastrula stage.

Gastrulation takes place after cleavage and the formation of the blastula, or blastocyst. Gastrulation is followed by organogenesis, when individual organs develop within the newly formed germ layers. Each layer gives rise to specific tissues and organs in the developing embryo.
* The ectoderm gives rise to epidermis, the nervous system, and to the neural crest in vertebrates.
* The endoderm gives rise to the epithelium of the digestive system and respiratory system, and organs associated with the digestive system, such as the liver and pancreas.
* The mesoderm gives rise to many cell types such as muscle, bone, and connective tissue. In vertebrates, mesoderm derivatives include the notochord, the heart, blood and blood vessels, the cartilage of the ribs and vertebrae, and the dermis.
Following gastrulation, cells in the body are either organized into sheets of connected cells (as in epithelia), or as a mesh of isolated cells, such as mesenchyme.

== Basic cell movements ==
Although gastrulation patterns exhibit enormous variation throughout the animal kingdom, they are unified by the five basic types of cell movements that occur during gastrulation: 
# Invagination
# Involution
# Ingression
# Delamination
# Epiboly

== Etymology ==
The terms &quot;gastrula&quot; and &quot;gastrulation&quot; were coined by Ernst Haeckel, in his 1872 work &quot;Biology of Calcareous Sponges&quot;.
Gastrula (literally, &quot;little belly&quot;) is a neo-Latin diminutive based on the Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;a belly&quot;).

== Importance ==
Lewis Wolpert, pioneering developmental biologist in the field, has been credited for noting that &quot;It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation which is truly the most important time in your life.&quot;

==Model systems==

Gastrulation is highly variable across the animal kingdom but has underlying similarities. Gastrulation has been studied in many animals, but some models have been used for longer than others. Furthermore, it is easier to study development in animals that develop outside the mother. Model organisms whose gastrulation is understood in the greatest detail include the mollusc, sea urchin, frog, and chicken. A human model system is the gastruloid.

==Protostomes versus deuterostomes==

The distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is based on the direction in which the mouth (stoma) develops in relation to the blastopore. Protostome derives from the Greek word protostoma meaning &quot;first mouth&quot; (πρῶτος + στόμα) whereas Deuterostome&#x27;s etymology is &quot;second mouth&quot; from the words second and mouth (δεύτερος + στόμα).

The major distinctions between deuterostomes and protostomes are found in embryonic development:
* Mouth/anus
** In protostome development, the first opening in development, the blastopore, becomes the animal&#x27;s mouth.
** In deuterostome development, the blastopore becomes the animal&#x27;s anus.
* Cleavage
** Protostomes have what is known as &quot;spiral cleavage&quot; which is &quot;determinate&quot;, meaning that the fate of the cells is determined as they are formed.
** Deuterostomes have what is known as &quot;radial cleavage&quot; that is &quot;indeterminate&quot;.

==Sea urchins==

Sea urchins have been important model organisms in developmental biology since the 19th century. Their gastrulation is often considered the archetype for invertebrate deuterostomes. 

Sea urchins exhibit highly stereotyped cleavage patterns and cell fates. Maternally deposited mRNAs establish the organizing center of the sea urchin embryo. Canonical Wnt and Delta-Notch signaling progressively segregate progressive endoderm and mesoderm.

The first cells to internalize are the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), which have a skeletogenic fate, which ingress during the blastula stage. Gastrulation – internalization of the prospective endoderm and non-skeletogenic mesoderm – begins shortly thereafter with invagination and other cell rearrangements the vegetal pole, which contribute approximately 30% to the final archenteron length. The gut&#x27;s final length depends on cell rearrangements within the archenteron.

==Amphibians==

The frog genus &quot;Xenopus&quot; has been used as a model organism for the study of gastrulation.

===Symmetry breaking===
The sperm contributes one of the two mitotic asters needed to complete first cleavage. The sperm can enter anywhere in the animal half of the egg but its exact point of entry will break the egg&#x27;s radial symmetry by organizing the cytoskeleton. Prior to first cleavage, the egg&#x27;s cortex rotates relative to the internal cytoplasm by the coordinated action of microtubules, in a process known as cortical rotation. This displacement brings maternally loaded determinants of cell fate from the equatorial cytoplasm and vegetal cortex into contact, and together these determinants set up the organizer. Thus, the area on the vegetal side opposite the sperm entry point will become the organizer. Hilde Mangold, working in the lab of Hans Spemann, demonstrated that this special &quot;organizer&quot; of the embryo is necessary and sufficient to induce gastrulation.

The dorsal lip of the blastopore is the mechanical driver of gastrulation, and the first sign of invagination seen in the frog.

===Germ layer differentiation===
Specification of endoderm depends on rearrangement of maternally deposited determinants, leading to nuclearization of Beta-catenin. Mesoderm is induced by signaling from the presumptive endoderm to cells that would otherwise become ectoderm.

=== Cell signaling ===
In the frog, &quot;Xenopus,&quot; one of the signals is retinoic acid (RA). RA signaling in this organism can affect the formation of the endoderm and depending on the timing of the signaling, it can determine the fate whether its pancreatic, intestinal, or respiratory. Other signals such as Wnt and BMP also play a role in respiratory fate of the &quot;Xenopus&quot; by activating cell lineage tracers.

==Amniotes==

===Overview===
In amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals), gastrulation involves the creation of the blastopore, an opening into the archenteron. Note that the blastopore is not an opening into the blastocoel, the space within the blastula, but represents a new inpocketing that pushes the existing surfaces of the blastula together. In amniotes, gastrulation occurs in the following sequence: (1) the embryo becomes asymmetric; (2) the primitive streak forms; (3) cells from the epiblast at the primitive streak undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and ingress at the primitive streak to form the germ layers.

===Symmetry breaking===
In preparation for gastrulation, the embryo must become asymmetric along both the proximal-distal axis and the anteroposterior axis. The proximal-distal axis is formed when the cells of the embryo form the &quot;egg cylinder&quot;, which consists of the extraembryonic tissues, which give rise to structures like the placenta, at the proximal end and the epiblast at the distal end. Many signaling pathways contribute to this reorganization, including BMP, FGF, nodal, and Wnt. Visceral endoderm surrounds the epiblast. The distal visceral endoderm (DVE) migrates to the anterior portion of the embryo, forming the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE). This breaks anterior-posterior symmetry and is regulated by nodal signaling.
===Germ layer determination===
The primitive streak is formed at the beginning of gastrulation and is found at the junction between the extraembryonic tissue and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo and the site of ingression. Formation of the primitive streak is reliant upon nodal signaling in the Koller&#x27;s sickle within the cells contributing to the primitive streak and BMP4 signaling from the extraembryonic tissue. Furthermore, Cer1 and Lefty1 restrict the primitive streak to the appropriate location by antagonizing nodal signaling. The region defined as the primitive streak continues to grow towards the distal tip.

During the early stages of development, the primitive streak is the structure that will establish bilateral symmetry, determine the site of gastrulation and initiate germ layer formation. To form the streak, reptiles, birds and mammals arrange mesenchymal cells along the prospective midline, establishing the first embryonic axis, as well as the place where cells will ingress and migrate during the process of gastrulation and germ layer formation. The primitive streak extends through this midline and creates the antero-posterior body axis, becoming the first symmetry-breaking event in the embryo, and marks the beginning of gastrulation. This process involves the ingression of mesoderm and endoderm progenitors and their migration to their ultimate position, where they will differentiate into the three germ layers. The localization of the cell adhesion and signaling molecule beta-catenin is critical to the proper formation of the organizer region that is responsible for initiating gastrulation.

===Cell internalization===
In order for the cells to move from the epithelium of the epiblast through the primitive streak to form a new layer, the cells must undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to lose their epithelial characteristics, such as cell–cell adhesion. FGF signaling is necessary for proper EMT. FGFR1 is needed for the up regulation of SNAI1, which down regulates E-cadherin, causing a loss of cell adhesion. Following the EMT, the cells ingress through the primitive streak and spread out to form a new layer of cells or join existing layers. FGF8 is implicated in the process of this dispersal from the primitive streak.

== Cell signaling driving gastrulation ==
During gastrulation, the cells are differentiated into the ectoderm or mesendoderm, which then separates into the mesoderm and endoderm. The endoderm and mesoderm form due to the nodal signaling. Nodal signaling uses ligands that are part of TGFβ family. These ligands will signal transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, and this will then phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3. This protein will then attach itself to Smad4 and relocate to the nucleus where the mesendoderm genes will begin to be transcribed. The Wnt pathway along with β-catenin plays a key role in nodal signaling and endoderm formation. Fibroblast growth factors (FGF), canonical Wnt pathway, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and retinoic acid (RA) are all important in the formation and development of the endoderm. FGF are important in producing the homeobox gene which regulates early anatomical development. BMP signaling plays a role in the liver and promotes hepatic fate. RA signaling also induce homeobox genes such as Hoxb1 and Hoxa5. In mice, if there is a lack in RA signaling the mouse will not develop lungs. RA signaling also has multiple uses in organ formation of the pharyngeal arches, the foregut, and hindgut.

== Gastrulation &quot;in vitro&quot; ==
There have been a number of attempts to understand the processes of gastrulation using &quot;in vitro&quot; techniques in parallel and complementary to studies in embryos, usually though the use of 2D and 3D cell (Embryonic organoids) culture techniques using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These are associated with number of clear advantages in using tissue-culture based protocols, some of which include reducing the cost of associated &quot;in vivo&quot; work (thereby reducing, replacing and refining the use of animals in experiments; the 3Rs), being able to accurately apply agonists/antagonists in spatially and temporally specific manner which may be technically difficult to perform during Gastrulation. However, it is important to relate the observations in culture to the processes occurring in the embryo for context.

To illustrate this, the guided differentiation of mouse ESCs has resulted in generating primitive streak–like cells that display many of the characteristics of epiblast cells that traverse through the primitive streak (e.g. transient brachyury up regulation and the cellular changes associated with an epithelial to mesenchymal transition), and human ESCs cultured on micro patterns, treated with BMP4, can generate spatial differentiation pattern similar to the arrangement of the germ layers in the human embryo. Finally, using 3D embryoid body- and organoid-based techniques, small aggregates of mouse ESCs (Embryonic Organoids, or Gastruloids) are able to show a number of processes of early mammalian embryo development such as symmetry-breaking, polarisation of gene expression, gastrulation-like movements, axial elongation and the generation of all three embryonic axes (anteroposterior, dorsoventral and left-right axes).

In &quot;vitro&quot; fertilization occurs in a laboratory. The process of in &quot;vitro&quot; fertilization is when mature eggs are removed from the ovaries and are placed in a cultured medium where they are fertilized by sperm. In the culture the embryo will form. 14 days after fertilization the primitive streak forms. The formation of the primitive streak has been known to some countries as &quot;human individuality&quot;. This means that the embryo is now a being itself, it is its own entity. The countries that believe this have created a 14-day rule in which it is illegal to study or experiment on a human embryo after the 14-day period in &quot;vitro&quot;. Research has been conducted on the first 14 days of an embryo, but no known studies have been done after the 14 days. With the rule in place, mice embryos are used understand the development after 14 days; however, there are differences in the development between mice and humans.

<text>Secretin is a hormone that regulates water homeostasis throughout the body and influences the environment of the duodenum by regulating secretions in the stomach, pancreas, and liver. It is a peptide hormone produced in the S cells of the duodenum, which are located in the intestinal glands. In humans, the secretin peptide is encoded by the &quot;SCT&quot; gene.

Secretin helps regulate the pH of the duodenum by inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid from the parietal cells of the stomach and stimulating the production of bicarbonate from the ductal cells of the pancreas. It also stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate and water by cholangiocytes in the bile duct, protecting it from bile acids by controlling the pH and promoting the flow in the duct. Meanwhile, in concert with secretin&#x27;s actions, the other main hormone simultaneously issued by the duodenum, cholecystokinin (CCK), stimulates the gallbladder to contract, delivering its stored bile.

Prosecretin is a precursor to secretin, which is present in digestion. Secretin is stored in this unusable form, and is activated by gastric acid. This indirectly results in the neutralisation of duodenal pH, thus ensuring no damage is done to the small intestine by the aforementioned acid.

In 2007, secretin was discovered to play a role in osmoregulation by acting on the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and kidney.

== History ==
In 1902, William Bayliss and Ernest Starling were studying how the nervous system controls the process of digestion. It was known that the pancreas secreted digestive juices in response to the passage of food (chyme) through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum. They discovered (by cutting all the nerves to the pancreas in their experimental animals) that this process was not, in fact, governed by the nervous system. They determined that a substance secreted by the intestinal lining stimulates the pancreas after being transported via the bloodstream. They named this intestinal secretion &quot;secretin&quot;. This type of &#x27;chemical messenger&#x27; substance is now called a hormone, a term coined by Starling in 1905.

Secretin is frequently erroneously stated to have been the first hormone identified. However, British researchers George Oliver and Edward Albert Schäfer had already published their findings of an adrenal extract increasing blood pressure and heart rate in brief reports in 1894 and a full publication in 1895, making adrenaline the first discovered hormone.

== Structure ==
Secretin is initially synthesized as a 120 amino acid precursor protein known as prosecretin. This precursor contains an N-terminal signal peptide, spacer, secretin itself (residues 28–54), and a 72-amino acid C-terminal peptide.

The mature secretin peptide is a linear peptide hormone, which is composed of 27 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 3055. A helix is formed in the amino acids between positions 5 and 13. The amino acids sequences of secretin have some similarities to that of glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). Fourteen of 27 amino acids of secretin reside in the same positions as in glucagon, 7 the same as in VIP, and 10 the same as in GIP.

Secretin also has an amidated carboxyl-terminal amino acid which is valine. The sequence of amino acids in secretin is H–His-Ser-Asp-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Glu-Leu-Ser-Arg-Leu-Arg-Asp-Ser-Ala-Arg-Leu-Gln-Arg-Leu-Leu-Gln-Gly-Leu-Val–NH2.

==Physiology==

===Production and secretion===
Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells, which are found mainly in the mucosa of the duodenum, and in smaller numbers in the jejunum of the small intestine.

Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH that ranges between 2 and 4.5 depending on species; the acidity is due to hydrochloric acid in the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach via the pyloric sphincter. Also, the secretion of secretin is increased by the products of protein digestion bathing the mucosa of the upper small intestine.

Secretin release is inhibited by H2 antagonists, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4.5, secretin cannot be released.

=== Function ===
====pH regulation====
Secretin primarily functions to neutralize the pH in the duodenum, allowing digestive enzymes from the pancreas (e.g., pancreatic amylase and pancreatic lipase) to function optimally.

Secretin targets the pancreas; pancreatic centroacinar cells have secretin receptors in their plasma membrane. As secretin binds to these receptors, it stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and converts ATP to cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP acts as second messenger in intracellular signal transduction and causes the organ to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid that flows into the intestine. Bicarbonate is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH favorable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine.

Secretin also increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal Brunner&#x27;s glands to buffer the incoming protons of the acidic chyme, and also reduces acid secretion by parietal cells of the stomach. It does this through at least three mechanisms: 1) By stimulating release of somatostatin, 2) By inhibiting release of gastrin in the pyloric antrum, and 3) By direct downregulation of the parietal cell acid secretory mechanics.

It counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes by triggering increased insulin release from pancreas, following oral glucose intake.

====Osmoregulation====
Secretin modulates water and electrolyte transport in pancreatic duct cells, liver cholangiocytes, and epididymis epithelial cells. It is found to play a role in the vasopressin-independent regulation of renal water reabsorption.

Secretin is found in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and along the neurohypophysial tract to neurohypophysis. During increased osmolality, it is released from the posterior pituitary. In the hypothalamus, it activates vasopressin release. It is also needed to carry out the central effects of angiotensin II. In the absence of secretin or its receptor in the gene knockout animals, central injection of angiotensin II was unable to stimulate water intake and vasopressin release.

It has been suggested that abnormalities in such secretin release could explain the abnormalities underlying type D syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH). In these individuals, vasopressin release and response are normal, although abnormal renal expression, translocation of aquaporin 2, or both are found. It has been suggested that &quot;Secretin as a neurosecretory hormone from the posterior pituitary, therefore, could be the long-sought vasopressin independent mechanism to solve the riddle that has puzzled clinicians and physiologists for decades.&quot;

====Food intake====
Secretin and its receptor are found in discrete nuclei of the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular nucleus and the arcuate nucleus, which are the primary brain sites for regulating body energy homeostasis. It was found that both central and peripheral injection of Sct reduce food intake in mouse, indicating an anorectic role of the peptide. This function of the peptide is mediated by the central melanocortin system.

== Uses ==
Secretin is used in diagnostic tests for pancreatic function; secretin is injected and the pancreatic output can then be imaged with magnetic resonance imaging, a noninvasive procedure, or secretions generated as a result can gathered either through an endoscope or through tubes inserted through the mouth, down into the duodenum.

A recombinant human secretin has been available since 2004 for these diagnostic purposes. There were problems with the availability of this agent from 2012 to 2015.

==Research==
A wave of enthusiasm for secretin as a possible treatment for autism arose in the 1990s based on a hypothetical gut-brain connection; as a result the NIH ran a series of clinical trials that showed that secretin was not effective, which brought an end to popular interest.

A high-affinity and optimized secretin receptor antagonist (Y10,c[E16,K20],I17,Cha22,R25)sec(6-27) has been designed and developed which has allowed the structural characterization of secreting inactive conformation.

<text>ITV Central, previously known as Central Independent Television, Carlton Central, ITV1 for Central England and commonly referred to as simply Central, is the Independent Television franchisee for the Midlands. It was created following the restructuring of ATV and began broadcasting on 1 January 1982. The service is owned and operated by ITV plc under the licensee of &quot;ITV Broadcasting Limited&quot;. Historically Central made a major contribution to the ITV network schedule – especially in entertainment and drama – but today its main responsibility is the regional news service.

==History==
===Background===
During the 1970s ATV, the previous Midlands licence holder, was often criticised for its lack of regional output and character. Although ATV had purpose-built a modern colour production complex in the centre of Birmingham, most of its major productions were recorded at its main studios at Elstree in Hertfordshire, a legacy of the period when the company had also served London at the weekends until 1968. Its corporate headquarters were in Central London.

ATV attempted to address its problem in 1980 as part of its franchise reapplication; with plans for a second major facility in the area (to be based in Nottingham) and as part of the Independent Broadcasting Authority&#x27;s plan for the contract to provide separate news coverage for both the East Midlands and the West Midlands. The company name would also be changed from ATV Network Limited to ATV Midlands Limited, thus reinforcing the greater regional focus. The IBA accepted ATV&#x27;s assertion that ATV Midlands Ltd planned to take a more local identity and awarded the contract to ATV Midlands Ltd on the basis that further changes were to be implemented, including that the parent company, Associated Communications Corporation, would divest 49 percent of its shareholding in ATV Midlands Ltd in an attempt to introduce local shareholders and that ATV Midlands Ltd&#x27;s registered office should be within the region. To demonstrate this change of share structure the IBA insisted that ATV change its company name, to show that it was a substantially new company due to the requirement for a dual region.

===Launch===
The station began transmitting at 9:25 am on Friday 1 January 1982 with an authority announcement by duty announcer Su Evans, followed by an extended five-minute promo entitled &quot;Welcome to Central&quot;, voiced by Peter Wheeler, previewing the company&#x27;s network and regional programming, and the schedule for the first day of transmission.

Central initially ran a sole pan-regional service from Birmingham, as a result of an industrial dispute which prevented its East Midlands service from Nottingham commencing before September 1983. The split allowed Central to serve the West Midlands with its own service from Birmingham. There were few differences between the East and West sub-regions, but each had its own news service, advertisements, and during the early years of operation, continuity. This would lead to the BBC launching its own sub-regional service for the East Midlands during the 1980s, which became a region in its own right in January 1991, with the launch of &quot;BBC East Midlands Today&quot;.

===Operations===
By March 1984, the reorganisation of the company was complete, allowing pre-tax profits to double from £3.5 million to £6.5 million in its first two financial years. Shortly afterward, Zenith Productions was established as a subsidiary of Central Television, which produced programming for the UK and the USA – most famously including the company&#x27;s television adaptations of the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; novels. The formation of Zenith Productions on 3 April 1984 allowed the company to exploit markets outside of the US and UK, similarly to how Thames operated its Euston Films subsidiary. Central&#x27;s interests in onscreen fiction saw the company buy the Korda Film Library in 1986.

In January 1987, Central acquired the European division of the American production company FilmFair for £1.5million, which went on to produce several of the station&#x27;s networked children&#x27;s series before being sold onto the Storm Group (Caspian) in 1991. On the same day, Central bought a stake in Starstream, who co-founded and operated The Children&#x27;s Channel – the 22% stake was sold in November 1991 to United Artists Cable International (formerly a subsidiary of United Artists Theatres, the parent company now a division of Regal Entertainment Group, and the former cable company merged into TCI, the predecessor of Liberty Media). A few months later, Central became the first ITV station to broadcast its own overnight service, including short news bulletins, imported output and the long-running &quot;Jobfinder&quot; service – launched in 1986 in partnership with the Manpower Services Commission – which went on to run for 17 years and won a Royal Television Society award. Central was also awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award to Industry for Export twice, for selling its range of programming to over 80 countries around the world, in April 1987 and April 1989.

Under its growing business portfolio, Central created CTE (Central Television Enterprises) in December 1987 and opened international bureaux in Hamburg, New York City and Sydney for sales, sponsorship and newsgathering operations. CTE, the company&#x27;s key international distributor of programming, would later represent output sales for Carlton Communications (for its television channel program-HTV, Meridian and Carlton), who took over Central in 1994.

In 1989, the company founded Zodiac Entertainment – an American entertainment firm specialising in the production and distribution of animated cartoons. Central invested $35 million in the company before deciding to discontinue its production business in 1994, leaving Zodiac to become a distributor. Also in 1989, Central established &quot;Television Sales and Marketing Services Ltd&quot; (TSMS), a joint venture with Anglia Television providing airtime sales and program sponsorships, in part to recover production costs. In March 1994, Anglia acquired Central&#x27;s stake in the company to take full control with Central moving over to Carlton&#x27;s sales department.

In March 1990, Central formed a partnership with &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper to create &quot;Central Observer&quot;, making environmental themed films for British Satellite Broadcasting and terrestrial channels, with funding from the charity Television Trust for the Environment.

Central was unopposed in retaining its franchise in 1993, which allowed the company to bid only a token £2,000 a year (just over £5 a day) – though the company stressed the need to cut more jobs to become more cost-efficient, as the company had agreed to pay 11% of their annual advertising revenue on top of their winning bid. The station&#x27;s workforce was reduced to 1500 by 1990 and then to 900 by the start of 1992 – less than half of the payroll Central had employed in 1987.

Central also profited from the auction after Meridian, a consortium in which Central held a 20% stake, won the franchise to serve the South and South East of England. Post-1993, the company&#x27;s ITV network presence was further strengthened when it took over commissioning, presentation and compliance responsibility for a number of continuing Thames Television productions, such as &quot;Count Duckula&quot;, &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, &quot;Des O&#x27;Connor Tonight&quot;, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;Strike It Lucky&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.

By April 1993, with the added increase of 8.8% in advertising revenues to £250 million and its income from programme sales rising to £83.4 million, Central became the most successful ITV company after the start of the new franchises.

===Ownership and takeover===
Although the IBA required 49% of the new station to be owned locally by companies and individuals, the take-up was nowhere near as expected, leaving companies outside the region to buy shares including DC Thomson (15%), Ladbrokes (10%), Pergamon (9%) and British Rail (2%).

Shortly after the station began broadcasting, Australian entrepreneur Robert Holmes à Court – via his Bell Group – started the process of acquiring ACC, but was halted by the IBA, since the law prohibited foreign companies from controlling British television companies. By March, a rival bid from Gerald Ronson&#x27;s Heron Corporation also entered the race to takeover ACC. In April 1982, ACC was taken-over by Holmes à Court, with the IBA approving the deal in June on condition that ACC&#x27;s 51 percent stake in Central be put in trust, thus divesting ACC of all voting power until it had reduced its shares in the broadcaster.

By January 1983, 167 staff had bought shares in the station for a £1 each as part of an innovative shareholding scheme to help offload shares to local people in the Central region. In May 1983, ACC finally sold off its stake in Central; Sears Holdings purchased 20%, while Ladbrokes and DC Thomson also increased their stakes to 20% each, and Pergamon took its ownership to 12.5%, with 27.5% being held by single stakeholders.

In March 1987, Carlton Communications acquired 20 percent of Central from Ladbrokes for £30million which finally gave Carlton its first stake in a terrestrial broadcasting company, after a bid to buy Thames Television was blocked by the IBA two years beforehand. In January 1994 Central was bought in its entirety by Carlton for £750 million The new owners later restructured the company further by combining Central&#x27;s operations into one and moving its Birmingham studios to a smaller complex elsewhere in the city centre. Network programmes were now classed as &quot;Carlton UK Productions&quot; and around 140 jobs were lost from the downgraded Birmingham operation.

On 6 September 1999, the station was rebranded on-air as Carlton Central, though the registered company name remained Central Independent Television Limited. The new identity, produced by Lambie-Nairn, was also used on Central&#x27;s sister stations in the London and Carlton Westcountry regions. Only the &quot;Carlton&quot; name was used on air; however, Central&#x27;s regional news programmes retained the &quot;Central&quot; brand. With the merger of Carlton and Granada on 2 February 2004, the brand became ITV1 Central. It is currently owned by ITV plc and on 29 December 2006, the registered company name was changed from &quot;Central Independent Television Ltd&quot; to &quot;ITV Central Ltd&quot;. This company is, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed on www.companieshouse.gov.uk as a &quot;Dormant company&quot;.

===Incidents===
On 5 April 2005, it was revealed ITV Central could be fined by regulator Ofcom for broadcasting a pre-recorded late &quot;Central News&quot; bulletin for the East Midlands. The regulator later permitted ITV to pre-record some regional news bulletins shortly before transmission.

On 15 July 2008, the station was fined £25,000 for contempt of court.

==Studios==
Initially, Central inherited ATV&#x27;s Broad Street studios, ATV Centre, which was renamed Central House when the contractor changed its name – they were retained as Central&#x27;s headquarters, West Midlands studios and transmission facilities until 1997. Upon winning the franchise, Central decided to construct new studios for its East sub-region, based in Lenton Lane, Nottingham – the new complex was to be called &#x27;East Midlands Television centre&#x27;. Up until the studios were opened, Central&#x27;s East Midlands operations were based on an industrial estate at Giltbrook, near Eastwood on the outskirts of Nottingham. A temporary radio link from Giltbrook to the Waltham transmitter via BT Bowman/Sheriff (Nottingham) Telephone Exchange provided the contribution feed into the studio/transmission network. The Nottingham studios were to be staffed by employees originally based at Elstree (in the studio complex that became BBC Elstree), which led to many problems due to the relocation, including industrial action, which resulted in a long delay for the promised separate news service for the East Midlands until September 1983.

The Nottingham studio complex finally opened in January 1984, followed by an official opening by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on 2 March 1984. Five years later, Central opened a computerized news centre in Abingdon for the launch of its third sub-region, serving the South Midlands. &quot;Central News South&quot; was broadcast from the Abingdon studios, supplemented by news bureaux in Aylesbury, Gloucester and Swindon.
The Broad Street studios in Birmingham – which were rented – came under Central&#x27;s ownership in November 1991, by which time, its network and large scale programming capability had been transferred to Nottingham, scaling down the Birmingham operation to providing &quot;Central News West&quot;, regional programming and presentation operations, including those for CITV. In 1994, Central&#x27;s new owners Carlton acquired land on nearby Gas Street to begin work on building a new, smaller digital studio complex. The new centre was completed in 1997, when Central West&#x27;s regional news department moved from its Broad Street base, which was eventually demolished during the spring of 2015 to make way for the new &#x27;Arena Central&#x27; development.&quot; Having been one of the first fully computerised news programmes, &quot;Central News South&quot; was again a pioneer of new technology when, in the Spring of 2001, state-of-the-art Quantel digital video servers and edit suites were installed, along with a complete re-fit of camera and VTR equipment, placing Central South at the forefront of digital news-gathering in regional news.

In February 2004, ITV plc announced plans to close and sell the Lenton Lane production centre in Nottingham with over 350 jobs being axed in the process Following the closure of the studios, a new news-gathering centre was established in the city, but production and transmission of &quot;Central News East&quot; moved to the Birmingham studio in Spring 2005. The former studio complex is now part of the University of Nottingham and is known as &#x27;King&#x27;s Meadow Campus&#x27;. It still maintains one Studio (Studio 7), and this is rented out to television and film companies, generating income for the university. In October 2004, ITV plc closed Central&#x27;s presentation/transmission department and moved transmission to the Northern Transmission Centre in Leeds. Although there was heavy opposition, the role of presentation and transmission at Birmingham had been significantly reduced after network presentation was centralised to LNN in London in 2002 and so there was an inevitability that this function would be moved out. CITV (Children&#x27;s ITV), which had been presented by Central since 1983, was also re-homed to Granada&#x27;s studios in Manchester, with all content pre-recorded and with out-of vision presentation.

A documentary about the Broad Street studios was later released on DVD in October 2011. Entitled &#x27;From ATVLand in Colour&#x27; (referring to the nickname used on Tiswas, and the building being purpose-built by ATV for colour broadcasting), the documentary featured presenters, actors, announcers and behind-the-scenes staff talking about their time working in the studios, and the programmes that were made there by Central, and predecessor ATV. The five-part documentary, produced by ATVLAND Productions, was followed up in November 2012 by &quot;From Headlines to Tight Lines&quot;, a DVD on the history of the regional news magazine programme &quot;ATV Today&quot;.

ITV have since also sold the Gas Street office building to Cube Real Estate, a commercial property developer, which has refurbished the interior of the building. While Central maintains office space and a single ground floor studio, the other studio and floors are available to rent as office space. The property is marketed as &#x27;22 Gas Street&#x27;.

==Sub-regions==
Central currently operates two sub-regions:
*Central West serving City of Birmingham, West Midlands, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and parts of Gloucestershire.
*Central East serving Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Rutland and parts of Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire - broadcast from Birmingham with a newsgathering centre based in Nottingham.

Initially, as a result of a long-running industrial dispute, Central broadcast a single pan-regional news service from Birmingham. The East Midlands service of news, local advertisements and presentation was launched in September 1983, leaving the Birmingham-based service to adopt its focus on the rest of the region. In January 1989, Central launched a third sub-region for the South Midlands (the Oxford and Ridge Hill transmitters previously served by Central West), carrying its own news service and local advertisements.

The Central South region was disbanded in December 2006 after 17 years in operation – with the eastern half of the area merging with Meridian&#x27;s North region to form an ITV Thames Valley region. At the same time, ITV West&#x27;s broadcast footprint was expanded to cover North Gloucestershire from the West&#x27;s Bristol studios, while Herefordshire and Ludlow re-joined Central News West from Birmingham. While all Thames Valley news programmes were broadcast from Meridian&#x27;s studios in Whiteley in Hampshire, Central&#x27;s former Abingdon base was retained as a newsgathering centre.

Further changes in February 2009 saw the end of wholly separate programmes for Central&#x27;s East and West sub-regions. The pan-regional service included a short six-minute opt out within the 6 pm programme and separate late night bulletins for the two areas. In the former Central South area, ITV&#x27;s Thames Valley operations were fully merged with those in Meridian&#x27;s South sub-region and its former territory – including Oxfordshire, Swindon and Buckinghamshire – was formally transferred to the Meridian region when the regional licence was renewed in 2014.

On 23 July 2013, proposals for a more localised Channel 3 news service were approved by Ofcom – &quot;ITV News Central&quot; extended the East and West opt-out services from six minutes to twenty minutes during the half-hour 6 pm programme, in addition to separate lunchtime and weekend bulletins for the two sub-regions. In the former Thames Valley region, plans were approved for a ten-minute opt out within the 6 pm edition of &quot;ITV News Meridian&quot; for the south of England.

==Identity==
===Globe: 1982–85===
Upon launch, Central&#x27;s on screen presentation featured a sphere (which resembled a moon or a total eclipse) which would burst open with light, before reforming, accompanied by a light jingle, but was dropped and revised during 1983, so the moon ident would just appear of darkness with the colour spectrum appearing to its left hand side. This ident was dropped locally in 1985, but remained on the front and end of networked programmes until August 1988.

Although the symbol is well known as the &quot;globe&quot;, Russ J Graham of Transdiffusion said the ident passes through several stages that make the viewer wonder &quot;what is it?&quot;, before &quot;revealing nothing&quot;, noting he thought of it as an egg, but noted it was apparently based on a UFO hovering over the Midlands.

===Cake: 1985–98===

On 28 August 1985, a new presentation package was launched, which saw the moon redesigned into a three-dimensional shape. It was initially used solely for regional continuity purposes. It did not appear as a pre-programme front ident on network programming from Central, however, it having only been adopted for branding network programmes in April 1988, it began to be used as one of only a few animated end captions in ITV’s history, a few months after pre-programme ITV idents were dropped. The new logo was a circle in shape, but with a curved line running down the left hand side and five horizontal lines dividing the sphere up into twelve segments. The left six segments were coloured red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple and the whole symbol was computer-animated. The symbol, nicknamed &quot;The Aspirin&quot;, or more popularly &quot;The Cake&quot;, would have a variety of form ups, mainly involved with bringing the segments together or applying the colour to the symbol. The soundtrack was the same composition, but played in a variety of different ways. On 25 April 1987, a new promotional package was introduced with a new slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; in 1988.

Central also adopted the ITV 1989 generic look as another ident to use alongside the &quot;Cake&quot;. The generic ident was used in its raw form, along with altered music, and as part of another ident giving greater emphasis to the &quot;cake&quot;, and was only used into the ITN News. Between 1985 and 1997, well over 10,000 different sequences were made by Central&#x27;s Presentation team in Birmingham, including break bumpers, idents, &quot;next&quot; animations and trail designs, which give the channel a wider range of presentation than any other British television station. The last batch of Cake idents to be created was introduced on 1 January 1997, in which the &quot;cake&quot; became more abstract with both more advanced computer graphics used and more live action models &amp; sequences (including a physical neon sign version).

===Central: 1998–99===
From 19 January 1998, the channel started to be called ‘Central ITV’ during continuity announcements, although on screen it was just branded ‘Central’; trailers for programmes were now branded with the ITV logo. The &quot;cake&quot; lasted 13 years before being replaced on 27 April 1998, by adapting a version of the idents that had been used by Carlton since 25 November 1996. This featured the name &quot;Central&quot; in the font Gill Sans in centre screen against a bright and colourful background. The idents featured a 2D animation of either the letters interacting in some way, a letter being replaced with another object, or the word being part of a larger scene, such as a cross word of place names in the region. The look was retired on 5 September 1999.

===Carlton: 1999–2002===

Central adopted the Carlton &#x27;Star&#x27; branding on 6 September 1999, shortly before much of the network adopted the second generic look under the theme of &#x27;Hearts&#x27;. The Carlton idents featured an opening film featuring a heart at the end, before a star shaped light came from the heart, engulfing the screen, and showing the endboard, which featured a background of spinning stars in different colours with the brand name centre screen above an ITV logo. The ident itself technically was praised, however the presentational package received complaints and criticisms due to the fact that the Central brand was replaced by the &quot;Carlton&quot; brand. These idents only featured the Carlton name on screen but the announcements that featured with idents used the name &quot;Carlton for the Central Region&quot; and separate continuity was retained.

===ITV Central===

On 11 August 2001, the ITV1 brand was formed in which replaced the &#x27;ITV&#x27; on the Carlton idents. As the ITV1 idents began to be used on their own more and more, and Carlton and Granada owned all the franchises in England and Wales, Carlton and Granada decided to axe regional branding, and replace it with a full-time ITV1 identity. Before regional programmes, the logo &#x27;ITV1 Carlton&#x27; was used, until late 2003, when they were known as &#x27;ITV1 for Central England&#x27;. The regional idents were gradually phased out, and by 2006, on most days, the only regional branding was for the regional news. In November 2006, the Central name was retired, when regional idents were axed. It would then be known as just ITV1 at all times.

The Carlton brand continued to be seen on production captions until February 2004, with the caption &quot;A Carlton Production&quot; or &quot;A Carlton Production for Central England&quot; being used. This was replaced, following the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications to form ITV plc, with an ITV regional logo featuring the word &quot;Central&quot; below the ITV logo with the caption ‘An ITV Production’. Today, the majority of productions have been moved away from the Midlands region, and any productions are accredited to ITV Studios. On 14 January 2013, the station&#x27;s on-air identity reverted to ITV, along with all other ITV plc-owned franchises.

==Programmes==
Taking over from ATV as one of the &#x27;Big Five&#x27; of ITV companies, Central performed strongly on networked output, carrying on several ATV shows, most notably the soap-opera &quot;Crossroads&quot; and game shows including &quot;Bullseye&quot; and &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;. Original programming included comedy series such as &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; (more recently revived by the BBC) and the multi award-winning &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, drama series &quot;Boon&quot; and game shows such as &quot;The Price is Right&quot; and &quot;Blockbusters&quot;.

Perhaps the station&#x27;s most successful drama title was its adaptations of the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; novels, produced by its subsidiary Zenith Productions. Central also produced the critically acclaimed film &quot;Walter&quot; – starring Ian McKellen – for Channel 4&#x27;s first night of transmission. Less successful was one of Central&#x27;s first networked contributions – the &quot;Tiswas&quot; spin-off &quot;O.T.T.&quot;, which drew high viewing figures but also heavy criticism for its racy adult content. It was axed after one series and replaced by a low-budget sequel entitled &quot;Saturday Stayback&quot;. The company also attracted ire with the 1987 sitcom &quot;Hardwicke House&quot; (starring Roy Kinnear) about an anarchic comprehensive school. The first two episodes received so much public condemnation that the remainder were never transmitted.

Central also formed numerous international partnerships to produce major drama and documentary series – including &quot;Legacy of Civilization&quot; with Maryland Public Television, &quot;Nuclear Age&quot; with WGBH-TV (another key PBS affiliate) and NHK and &quot;Edens Lost&quot; (1989) with ABC.

In the field of news and current affairs, Central had enhanced and bettered on ATV&#x27;s reputation as a regional news provider by becoming the first British television station to offer three distinct services for different parts of the transmission area. It was also a major contributor to current affairs locally and nationally – from its documentary output such as &quot;Viewpoint&quot;, &quot;30 Minutes&quot; and &quot;England Their England&quot; to more populist series, including &quot;The Cook Report&quot; and the long-running debate show &quot;Central Weekend&quot;, which ran for 15 years in the Midlands on Friday nights. The programme was also the first on British television to examine seriously the AIDS virus, leading to a drama series on the topic, called &quot;Intimate Contact&quot;. Central also first reported on the Ethiopian famine in July 1984 with the documentary &quot;Seeds of Despair&quot;. In the same year, the company completed production on one of its more controversial programmes, &quot;Question of Leadership&quot;, a four-part series directed by Ken Loach about trade unions&#x27; responses to government actions. The IBA was concerned it breached balance guidelines, while the unions criticised it as defamatory. Even after several re-edits, the series was never transmitted, which was described as political censorship.

Central also played a major role in the ITV network&#x27;s infrastructure – not only producing children&#x27;s and schools programming, but also providing scheduling and presentation services with its dedicated Children&#x27;s ITV and ITV Schools&#x27; strands – the latter moving to Channel 4 in 1987.

With the creation of a dedicated ITV Sport network unit, Central also played a significant part in networked sports output under the leadership of Gary Newbon. The station produced nearly all of ITV&#x27;s football coverage for over a decade – including the FA Cup, UEFA Champions&#x27; League, the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA European Championship and Premier League highlights, as well as extensive live regional coverage of Football League matches involving Midlands clubs in &quot;The Central Match&quot;. The station also played its part in coverage of key European athletics meetings and world championship boxing with &quot;The Big Fight Live&quot; as a long-standing Saturday night fixture. In 2004, the department was moved to London and merged with the London News Network&#x27;s operations to form ITV Sport Productions.

<text>Marie Juliette Louvet (9 May 1867 – 24 September 1930) was the lover of the unmarried Prince Louis II of Monaco and the mother of his only child, Princess Charlotte of Monaco.

Known as Juliette, Louvet was the daughter of Jacques Henri Louvet (Pierreval, 10 September 1830 - Rouen, 7 September 1910) and his first wife (m. La Rue-Saint-Pierre, 3 February 1852), Joséphine Elmire Piedefer (La Rue-Saint-Pierre, 3 September 1828 - Pierreval, 10 July 1871).

She married the photographer Achille Delmaet on 6 October 1885 (his best known photographs are nudes of &quot;La Goulue&quot;, a cancan dancer of the Moulin Rouge), but they divorced on 14 January 1893. They had two children, Georges (1884-1955) and Marguerite (1886-1894). Juliette Delmaet became an entertainer of sorts, reportedly a cabaret singer. In 1897, she was a hostess in a Montmartre nightclub when she met Prince Louis of Monaco. She gave birth to their daughter, Charlotte, in Constantine, French Algeria, on 30 September 1898, where Louis served in the French Army with a regiment of Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique (African Light Horse), and where she justified her presence at the military barracks as a laundress and a dressmaker. Through her daughter she is the maternal grandmother of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco and Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy.

<text>Crossroads Charter Academy is a tuition-free K-12 public charter school located in Big Rapids, Michigan in Mecosta County.

==History==

Founded as a K–8 school in 1998, classes met in the former Big Rapids High School building on North State Street.

In 1999, the school added a ninth grade level and continued adding one grade level per year. In August 2002, Crossroads became a K–12 school. In that same year, the school began construction of its new high school building across West Spruce Street. Construction was completed in February 2003, and high school classes moved to that building afterward.

==Academics==

Students who earn satisfactory scores on the Michigan Educational Assessment Program examination and have a satisfactory grade point average may dual enrol at Ferris State University for credit in place of usual high school courses. Students may also attend the career center or the Math and Science Center, both administered by the Mecosta-Osceola Intermediate School District.

==Athletics==

The school participates in several sports, including men&#x27;s soccer, co-ed cross-country track, women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s soccer, co-ed track, and men&#x27;s baseball. 
Crossroads Charter Academy was distinguished as the first charter school in Michigan to win a state sports championship when the girls&#x27; cross country team won the state finals in 2004. The team won the championship again in 2005. In 2011, the school earned its third state championship trophy when the Boys Track and Field team tied for first place.

<doc id="222198" wikidata="Q1330443" url="?curid=222198" title="Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini">
<text>The Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43, (, &quot;Rapsodiya na temu Paganini&quot;) is a concertante work written by Sergei Rachmaninoff for piano and orchestra, closely resembling a piano concerto, all in a single movement. Rachmaninoff wrote the work at his summer home, the Villa Senar in Switzerland, according to the score, from 3 July to 18 August 1934. Rachmaninoff himself, a noted performer of his own works, played the piano part at the piece&#x27;s premiere on 7 November 1934, at the Lyric Opera House in Baltimore, Maryland, with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

Rachmaninoff, Stokowski, and the Philadelphia Orchestra made the first recording, on 24 December 1934, at RCA Victor&#x27;s Trinity Church Studio in Camden, New Jersey. The English premiere on 7 March 1935 at Manchester Free Trade Hall also featured Rachmaninoff with The Hallé conducted by Nicolai Malko. The best-known variation in the piece is the 18th variation, frequently selected in isolation in classical music compilations.

==Instrumentation==
The piece is scored for piano and orchestra:
* Woodwinds:
** 2 flutes
** piccolo
** 2 oboes
** cor anglais
** 2 clarinets in B
** 2 bassoons
* Brass:
** 4 horns in F
** 2 trumpets in C
** 3 trombones
** tuba
* Percussion:
** timpani
** snare drum
** triangle
** cymbals
** bass drum
** glockenspiel
* Strings:
** 1st violins
** 2nd violins
** violas
** cellos
** double basses
** concert harp
==Structure==

The piece is a set of 24 variations on the twenty-fourth and last of Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s Caprices for solo violin, which has inspired works by several composers. The whole composition takes about 22–24 minutes to perform. All variations are in A minor except where noted. 
* Section 1:
** Introduction: Allegro vivace 
** Variation 1: (Precedente)
** Theme: L&#x27;istesso tempo
** Variation 2: L&#x27;istesso tempo
** Variation 3: L&#x27;istesso tempo
** Variation 4: Più vivo
** Variation 5: Tempo precedente
** Variation 6: L&#x27;istesso tempo
** Variation 7: Meno mosso, a tempo moderato
** Variation 8: Tempo I
** Variation 9: L&#x27;istesso tempo
** Variation 10: L&#x27;istesso tempo
* Section 2:
** Variation 11: Moderato
** Variation 12: Tempo di minuetto (D minor)
** Variation 13: Allegro (D minor)
** Variation 14: L&#x27;istesso tempo (F major)
** Variation 15: Più vivo scherzando (F major)
** Variation 16: Allegretto (B minor)
** Variation 17: (Allegretto) (B minor)
** Variation 18: Andante cantabile (D major)
* Section 3:
** Variation 19: A tempo vivace
** Variation 20: Un poco più vivo
** Variation 21: Un poco più vivo
** Variation 22: Marziale. Un poco più vivo (Alla breve)
** Variation 23: L&#x27;istesso tempo
** Variation 24: A tempo un poco meno mosso (A minor → A major)

Although Rachmaninoff&#x27;s work is performed in one stretch without breaks, it can be divided into three sections, as shown above. These correspond to the three movements of a concerto: up to variation 10 corresponds to the first movement, variations 11 to 18 are the equivalent of a slow movement, and the remaining variations make a finale.

==Analysis==
After a brief introduction, the first variation is played &quot;before&quot; the theme. Paganini&#x27;s theme is stated on strings with the piano picking out salient notes, &quot;after&quot; the first variation. Rachmaninoff likely got the idea of having a variation before the theme from the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; symphony. Variations II to VI recombine elements of the theme. The pauses and rhetorical flourishes for the piano in variation VI herald a change of tempo and tone. The piano next gravely intones the &quot;Dies irae&quot; (of which, to some degree, the Paganini theme is an inversion), the &quot;day of wrath&quot; plainchant from the medieval Mass of the Dead, while the orchestra accompanies with a slower version of the opening motif of the Paganini theme. The piece is one of several by Rachmaninoff to quote the &quot;Dies Irae&quot; plainchant melody.
The slow 18th variation is by far the best known, and it is often included on classical music compilations without the rest of the work. It is based on an inversion of the melody of Paganini&#x27;s theme. In other words, the A minor Paganini theme is literally played &quot;upside down&quot; in D major, with a few other changes. Rachmaninoff himself recognized the appeal of this variation, saying &quot;This one is for my agent.&quot;

The 24th variation is more playful in tone than most of the other variations, ending with a glissando sweep of the keyboard, before quoting the original theme in the last bar. Due to the speed and the large leaps on the piano, the 24th and last variation of the rhapsody presents considerable technical difficulty for the pianist. Shortly before the world première performance, Rachmaninoff – a sufferer of performance anxiety – confessed trepidation over his ability to play it. Upon the suggestion of his friend Benno Moiseiwitsch, Rachmaninoff broke his usual rule against drinking alcohol and had a glass of crème de menthe, which he reputedly kept beneath the piano, to steady his nerves. His performance was a spectacular success, and prior to every subsequent performance of the Rhapsody, he drank crème de menthe. This led to Rachmaninoff nicknaming the twenty-fourth the &quot;Crème de Menthe Variation&quot;.

==Balletic interpretations==
In 1939, Michel Fokine wrote to Rachmaninoff from Auckland, New Zealand, where he was touring, seeking the composer&#x27;s approval to use &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; for his ballet &quot;Paganini&quot;, which he had almost finished choreographing. Fokine wanted to make a minor change to the score, involving the reuse of 12 earlier measures as a more theatrically effective introduction to the 18th Variation, which he wanted to play in the key of A major, rather than D major. Rachmaninoff agreed to the extra measures, although he said A major would not work and asked that the 18th Variation be played in D major, to provide greater tension. He also wondered why Niccolò Paganini had been turned into a guitar player in Fokine&#x27;s scenario, but did not object. &quot;Paganini&quot; was premiered in 1939 by The Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. The ballet was a success, which pleased Rachmaninoff, and he wrote his &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot; in 1940 with Fokine in mind. He played the piano version for Fokine, but both died before the idea got any further.

The Rhapsody has also been used for ballets by Leonid Lavrovsky (Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow, 1960), Frederick Ashton (Royal Ballet, London, 1980), and Ivo van Zwieten.

==Selected recordings==

The 18th variation, by far the most popular, has been used in various movie and TV show soundtracks to different degrees. This includes:

* &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953)
* &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980 film)
* &quot;Singapore Sling&quot; (1990 film)

Winifred Atwell recording of the 18th variation as a theme from &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; reached No. 9 on the UK chart.

The pop song &quot;If I Had You&quot; by The Korgis uses the melody fragment from the 18th variation.

The video game &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot; uses it as the intro theme.

<doc id="222199" wikidata="Q1111673" url="?curid=222199" title="Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy">
<text>Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy (Antoinette Louise Alberte Suzanne Grimaldi; 28 December 1920 – 18 March 2011) was a member of the princely family of Monaco. She was the elder sister of Prince Rainier III. Her parents were Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois and her former husband, Count Pierre de Polignac.

She was born in Paris, of French and Monegasque ancestry.

==Early life==
Princess Antoinette was born on 28 December 1920 in Paris, during the reign of her great-grandfather Prince Albert I, Prince of Monaco. She was the elder child and only daughter of Princess Charlotte of Monaco and her husband Count Pierre de Polignac. Her mother was the only child of Prince Louis, Hereditary Prince of Monaco.

She was named Antoinette Louise Alberte Suzanne, after her maternal great-great-grandmother Princess Antoinette; her maternal grandfather, Prince Louis; her maternal great-grandfather, Prince Albert I; and her paternal grandmother, Countess Susana de Polignac. She was third in the line of succession at the time of her birth, preceded by her grandfather and mother, and then second in the line after the ascension of Prince Louis II, though later moved down the line after the birth of her younger brother, Prince Rainier in 1923.

==Children==
Princess Antoinette had a long-term liaison with Alexandre-Athenase Noghès, a Monegasque-born attorney and international tennis champion, in the mid-1940s. The couple had three children born out-of-wedlock who were legitimated by their parents&#x27; subsequent marriage (on December 4, 1951) and, henceforth, included in the line of succession to the Monegasque Throne until the death of Antoinette&#x27;s brother, Prince Rainier III, in 2005; Elizabeth-Ann de Massy (1947–2020), Christian Louis de Massy (born 1949), and Christine Alix de Massy (1951–1989). Furthermore, there was no hereditary devolution of the title of « &quot;Baroness de Massy&quot; » but the children of Princess Antoinette, by Sovereign Ordinance of November 15, 1951, bear however the patronymic name of « &quot;de Massy&quot; ».

==Marriages==
# Princess Antoinette and Alexandre-Athenase Noghès subsequently married at the Monaco consulate in Genoa on 4 December 1951 (her first, his second) and divorced in 1954.&lt;br&gt;On 15 November 1951, Antoinette was created Baroness of Massy (&quot;Baronne de Massy&quot;). Her children (Elizabeth-Ann, Christian Louis and Christine Alix) were named Grimaldi at birth. They subsequently had their names changed to &quot;de Massy.&quot; Christian Louis claimed the title of Baron through his mother. His use of the title of Baron of Massy (&quot;Baron de Massy&quot;) was subsequently approved by Prince Albert II, but only on a non-hereditary basis.
# She married her second husband, Dr. Jean-Charles Rey (Monaco, 22 October 1914 – Monaco, 17 September 1994), president of the Conseil National (the Parlement of Monaco) in The Hague on 2 December 1961 and they divorced in 1974.
#Her third and last husband was John Brian Gilpin (Southsea, Hampshire, 10 February 1930 – London, 5 September 1983), a British ballet dancer, whom she married in Monaco on 28 July 1983. He died suddenly six weeks later.

==Life account==
Having divorced Noghès, she and her lover Jean-Charles Rey hatched a plan to depose her brother Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and declare herself regent on the basis of having a son who would one day inherit the throne. This led to the breakup of the relationship.

Rainier&#x27;s marriage to Grace Kelly in 1956 and the arrival of his heirs, Princess Caroline in 1957 and Prince Albert in 1958, effectively scuttled Antoinette&#x27;s plans. She was removed from the Palace by her sister-in-law, Princess Grace, and thereafter was estranged from the princely family for many years.

She was known to be somewhat eccentric and was described as &quot;completely mad&quot; by her servants. Having been banished from Monaco in the late 1950s, she lived down the coast from Monaco at Èze, with a large collection of dogs and cats. She was the president of Monaco&#x27;s Society for the Protection of Animals and Refuge and a patron of the UK-based Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.

Upon the accession of Albert II in 2005, Antoinette and her descendants lost their place in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, which is limited to the current sovereign&#x27;s descendants, siblings, and siblings&#x27; descendants.

The Princess Antoinette Park in Monaco&#x27;s La Condamine district was named in her honour.

==Death==
On 18 March 2011 Princess Antoinette died at The Princess Grace Hospital Centre, aged 90. Her funeral took place on 24 March 2011. She is buried in the Chapel of Peace in Monaco beside her parents, her daughters Elizabeth-Ann and Christine Alix, her last husband John Brian Gilpin and her nephew by marriage, Stefano Casiraghi.

<text>Vito Acconci (, ; January 24, 1940 – April 27, 2017) was an American performance, video and installation artist, whose diverse practice eventually included sculpture, architectural design, and landscape design. His performance and video art was characterized by &quot;existential unease,&quot; exhibitionism, discomfort, transgression and provocation, as well as wit and audacity, and often involved crossing boundaries such as public–private, consensual–nonconsensual, and real world–art world. His work is considered to have influenced artists including Laurie Anderson, Karen Finley, Bruce Nauman, and Tracey Emin, among others. 

Acconci was initially interested in radical poetry, creating 0 to 9 Magazine, but by the late 1960s he began creating Situationist-influenced performances in the street or for small audiences that explored the body and public space. Two of his most famous pieces were &quot;Following Piece&quot; (1969), in which he selected random passersby on New York City streets and followed them for as long as he was able, and &quot;Seedbed&quot; (1972), in which he claimed that he masturbated while under a temporary floor at the Sonnabend Gallery, as visitors walked above and heard him speaking.

In the late-1970s, he turned to sculpture, architecture and design, greatly increasing the scale of his work, if not his art world profile. Over the next two decades he developed public artworks and parks, airport rest areas, artificial islands and other architectural projects that frequently embraced participation, change and playfulness. Notable works of this period include: &quot;Personal Island&quot;, designed for Zwolle, the Netherlands (1994); &quot;Walkways Through the Wall&quot; at the Wisconsin Center, in Milwaukee, WI (1998); and &quot;Murinsel&quot;, for Graz, Austria (2003). Retrospectives of Acconci&#x27;s work have been organized by the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1978) and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1980), and his work is in numerous public collections, including those of the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum of American Art. He has been recognized with fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1976, 1980, 1983, 1993), John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1979), and American Academy in Rome (1986). In addition to his art and design work, Acconci taught at many higher learning institutions. Acconci died on April 28, 2017, in Manhattan at age 77.

==Life and work==

===Education===
Born Vito Hannibal Acconci in the Bronx, New York in 1940, Acconci attended a Roman Catholic elementary school, high school (Regis High School in New York City), and college. He received a BA in literature from the College of the Holy Cross in 1962 and an MFA in literature and poetry from the University of Iowa. He noted: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a woman in my classroom between kindergarten and graduate school.&quot; Then he returned to New York City to pursue a career as a poet.

===1960s and 70s===
Acconci began his career as a poet, editing and self-publishing the poetry magazine &quot;0 TO 9&quot; with Bernadette Mayer in the late 1960s. Produced in quantities of 100 to 350 copies per issue on a mimeograph machine, the magazine mixed contributions by both poets and artists.

In the late 1960s, Acconci transformed himself into a performance and video artist using his own body as a subject for photography, film, video, and performance. Most of his early work incorporated subversive social comment. His performance and video work was marked heavily by confrontation and Situationism. In the mid-1970s, Acconci expanded his métier into the world of audio/visual installations.

One installation/performance work from this period, perhaps his best known work, is &quot;Seedbed&quot; (January 15–29, 1972). In &quot;Seedbed&quot; Acconci lay hidden underneath a gallery-wide ramp installed at the Sonnabend Gallery, masturbating while vocalizing into a loudspeaker his fantasies about the visitors walking above him on the ramp. One motivation behind &quot;Seedbed&quot; was to involve the public in the work&#x27;s production by creating a situation of reciprocal interchange between artist and viewer.

Cindy Nemser was the first art critic to write about Acconci for &quot;Arts Magazine&quot; in 1971. Nemser also later did an interview with Acconci which became the cover piece for &quot;Arts Magazine&quot;.
In the article &quot;Video: the Aesthetics of Narcissism,&quot; Rosalind Krauss refers to aspects of Narcissism apparent in the video work of Acconci. &quot;A line of sight begin Acconci&#x27;s plane of vision ends on the eyes of his projected double.&quot; Krauss uses this description to underline aspects of narcissism in the Vito Acconci work &quot;Centers.&quot; In the piece Acconci is filming himself pointing directly at himself for about 25 minutes; by doing so Acconci makes a nonsensical gesture that exemplifies the critical aspects of a work of art through the beginning of the 20th century. Krauss also goes on to explain the psychological basis behind the actions of video in comparison to discussions of object art.

===1980s===
In the 1980s, Acconci turned to permanent sculptures and installations. During this time he invited viewers to create artwork by activating machinery that erected shelters and signs. One of the most prominent examples of these temporary installations is titled &quot;Instant House,&quot; which was first created in 1980, but was recently exhibited in the summer of 2012 at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. Later, in January 1983, Acconci was a visiting artist at Middlebury College. During that time, he completed &quot;Way Station I (Study Chamber),&quot; which was his first permanent installation. The work sparked immense controversy on the college&#x27;s campus, and was eventually set on fire and destroyed in 1985. Despite this, the sculpture marked a transition for Acconci&#x27;s career from performance artist to architectural designer. He turned to the creation of furniture and prototypes of houses and gardens in the late 1980s, and in 1988, the artist founded Acconci Studio, which focused on theoretical design and building. Acconci Studio is located on Jay Street in Brooklyn. Acconci designed the United Bamboo store in Tokyo in 2003, and collaborated on concept designs for interactive art vehicle Mister Artsee in 2006, among others including the highly acclaimed: Murinsel in Graz, Austria.

The artist has focused on architecture and landscape design that integrates public and private space. One example of this is &quot;Walkways Through the Wall,&quot; which flow through structural boundaries of the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and provide seating at both ends. An example of this interest on the private/public space is the collaboration he did with architect Steven Holl when commissioned on a collaborative building project for Storefront for Art and Architecture. The project replaced the existing facade with a series of twelve panels that pivot vertically or horizontally to open the entire length of the gallery directly onto the street. The project blurs the boundary between interior and exterior and, by placing the panels in different configurations, creates a multitude of different possible facades, and is now regarded as a contemporary architectural landmark. Another example of his work is &quot;Dirt Wall&quot; (1992) at the Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities Sculpture Garden in Colorado. The wall begins outside the Arvada Center and extends inside, rising from ground level to a height of 24 feet. The glass and steel wall contains a mixture of volcanic rock, various types of sand, red dolomite, and topsoil which are visible through the glass panels, and represents an attempt to bring what is underground up, and what is outside in.

===2000s===
One of his later works, &quot;Lobby-for-the-Time-Being&quot; is an installation in the North Wing Lobby of Bronx Museum of the Arts. It has been there since 2009. The installation fills the lobby with a web of white Corian, creating a long, undulating wall resembling giant paper snowflakes.

In 2008, in an interview with Brian Sherwin for &quot;Myartspace,&quot; Vito discussed &quot;Seedbed&quot; at length. Vito discussed the title &quot;Seedbed&quot; and the connection it had to the performance, stating, &quot;I knew what my goal had to be: I had to produce seed, the space I was in should become a bed of seed, a field of seed – in order to produce seed, I had to masturbate – in order to masturbate, I had to excite myself.&quot;

In 2010, Acconci completed &quot;Waterfall Out &amp; In,&quot; a water feature at the visitors&#x27; center of the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Part of the piece is indoors and part of the piece is outdoors.

In 2013, Acconci&#x27;s &quot;Way Station I (Study Chamber),&quot; a work that was vandalized and destroyed in 1985 after being constructed for Middlebury College, was reinstalled along with an exhibit at the college&#x27;s museum.

In 2014, Acconci was featured in a video segment, produced by Marc Santo, in which he talks about a few of his favorite projects that were never completed, including a Skate Park in San Jose and a museum of needles in Ichihara, Japan. &quot;I think what unbuildable stuff leads to is maybe a possible reexamination, not so much of the past, but of what&#x27;s to come,&quot; he said in the interview.

==Academic career==
Acconci taught at many institutions, including the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax; San Francisco Art Institute; California Institute of the Arts, Valencia; Cooper Union; School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Yale University; University of Iowa, Pratt Institute; and the Parsons School of Design. Prior to his death, he had most recently taught at Brooklyn College in the Art Department and Performance and Interactive Media Arts programs and was an Adjunct Associate Professor at Pratt Institute in the Graduate Architecture and Urban Design Department.

==Personal life and death==
Acconci had been married to the artist Rosemary Mayer in the 1960s. Acconci died on April 28, 2017. He was 77. His cause of death has not been released by his estate. He is survived by his wife, Maria Acconci.

<text>Timothy Commerford (born February 26, 1968) is an American musician, best known as the bassist and backing vocalist for rock band Rage Against the Machine and supergroups Audioslave and Prophets of Rage. Since 2013 and 2015, respectively, he has also been the lead singer and bassist of the bands Future User and Wakrat.

He was ranked eighth on &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;20 Underrated Bass Guitarists&quot; in 2014.

==Early life==
Commerford was born on February 26, 1968, in Irvine, California. Growing up, he was a fan of Rush, Gene Simmons, Sid Vicious, Steve Harris, and Geddy Lee.

==Career==
===Rage Against the Machine (1991–2000)===

In 1991, following the break-up of the band Lock Up featuring guitarist Tom Morello, the band&#x27;s drummer, Jon Knox, encouraged Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello. Tom soon called drummer Brad Wilk, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for Lock Up. This line-up went on to form Rage Against the Machine. After frequenting the L.A. club circuit, Rage Against the Machine signed a record deal with Epic Records in 1992. That same year, the band released their self-titled debut. They achieved a phenomenal amount of mainstream success and released three more studio albums.

Commerford&#x27;s appearances on Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s studio records have been marked with a running joke where his credits on the record were under nicknames, such as &quot;Y Tim K&quot; or &quot;Tim.com&quot;.

On September 7, 2000, Commerford climbed atop onstage scaffolding during the MTV Music Video Awards, and disrupted the proceedings when Limp Bizkit won an award. Commerford was arrested that evening, and a disgruntled de la Rocha quit the band soon after.

===Audioslave (2001–2007)===


After de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine, music producer Rick Rubin suggested the three remaining members of Rage get together with then-former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, and &quot;see what happens&quot;. The newly formed Audioslave later released their eponymous debut album in November 2002, which would attain triple platinum status. On February 15, 2007, Chris Cornell officially announced his departure from Audioslave, thus disbanding the group.

===Rage Against the Machine reunion (2007–2011)===

On April 29, 2007, Rage Against the Machine reunited at the Coachella Music Festival, and later played additional shows in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and England throughout 2007-2011.

===Future User, Wakrat and 7D7D (2014–present)===
Commerford co-founded the band Future User, together with Jordan Tarlow (keys), Jon Knox (drums) and producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien (guitars). Commerford plays bass and is the vocalist of the band. Commerford hid several months under the S.W.I.M persona on the first music videos, before unmasking himself in the &quot;Mountain Lion&quot; video. The &quot;Mountain Lion&quot; video featured road racing cyclist Lance Armstrong, a close friend of Commerford, while a skateboarding Commerford appears to inject himself with a steroid.

In 2015, he formed &quot;punk and hardcore-influenced band&quot;, named Wakrat. The band also features drummer Mathias Wakrat and guitarist Laurent Grangeon. The band debuted their first single, &quot;Knucklehead&quot;, in September 2015.

In 2022, Commerford launched a new project, 7D7D, with Mathias Wakrat and Jonny Polonsky. The group debuted their first single, &quot;Capitalism&quot;, in November.

===Prophets of Rage (2016–2019)===
In 2016, Commerford reunited with Tom Morello and Brad Wilk, and was joined by Chuck D and B-Real to form supergroup Prophets of Rage. They play covers from their Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill material, and new material as well.

===Other contributions===
Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk contributed to Maynard James Keenan&#x27;s side project Puscifer and his album &quot;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vagina&quot; on the track &quot;Momma Sed&quot;. Both have taken part in the production of Dave Grohl&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Sound City&quot; soundtrack, with the track &quot;Time Slowing Down&quot;. In 2010, Commerford was interviewed and appeared in the documentary &quot;&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 2001, Commerford married his longtime girlfriend, Aleece Dimas. They have two sons together. In November 2018, the couple announced they were divorcing, finalizing their divorce five years later in 2024.

Commerford is a self-described &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview in 2015, he claimed that the Moon landing was faked and he confronted Buzz Aldrin about it at a John Cusack movie premiere. In the same interview, Commerford also stated that he does not believe ISIS is real and cast doubt upon the ISIS beheading videos:

In December 2022, Commerford revealed he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier in the year, and had undergone surgery prior to going on tour with Rage Against the Machine that summer.

==Equipment==
Commerford has been using various Music Man StingRay basses since 2016, a brand he has liked since his beginnings with Rage Against The Machine. MusicMan released several custom Artist Series basses in 2021. He previously used Fender Jazz Basses with Fender Precision Bass necks and Lakland basses.

<doc id="222223" wikidata="Q60002" url="?curid=222223" title="Colossus (character)">
<text>Colossus (Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Nikolayevich Rasputin; Russian: Пётр Николаевич Распутин) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, he first appeared in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975).

A Russian mutant, he is a member of the X-Men. Colossus is able to transform himself into metallic form, making him the physically strongest of the team. He is portrayed as quiet, honest, and virtuous. He has had a fairly consistent presence in X-Men-related comic books since his debut. A talented artist, he only reluctantly agrees to use his powers in combat, feeling it is his responsibility to use his abilities for the betterment of human- and mutant-kind.

&quot;Wizard&quot; ranked Colossus at 184 on the &quot;Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time&quot;. In 2006, IGN placed Colossus in the 10th spot of their list of &quot;The Top 25 X-Men&quot;. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Colossus as No. 22 on their list of the &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;.

In film, Donald MacKinnon made a cameo appearance as Colossus in &quot;X-Men&quot; before Daniel Cudmore took over for &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, and &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; while Stefan Kapičić voiced a separate iteration of Colossus in &quot;Deadpool&quot;, &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;.

==Concept and creation==
Editor Roy Thomas, in charge of reviving the X-Men for &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975), told the creative team to go home and create some characters for the new team. Dave Cockrum recalled:
I just went home and Colossus was one of the first ones that came to mind. We needed a strong guy for the team, so I drew up a strong guy. The character&#x27;s armor just kind of fell into place. He was accepted pretty much as-is, except that I had given him bare legs because it seemed only logical that if we&#x27;re going to show him armored up, the legs should be bare like the arms. But Len Wein didn&#x27;t like male characters with bare legs. So we decided that his costume would be blue when he wasn&#x27;t armored up, and that we&#x27;d see his legs when he was armored up, due to the unstable molecules of his costume.

Cockrum detailed more of the character&#x27;s conception, &quot;Colossus was loosely based on a character I had come up with in college, named &#x27;Mr. Steel&#x27;&quot;... As for why the character was chosen to be Russian... &quot;Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Everybody was into détente and it was supposed to be an international group and the way I drew it, he looked like a Russian, so why the hell not? That was really all there was to it.&quot;... &quot;Len Wein chose Peter&#x27;s name. I imagine he used Rasputin because...it&#x27;s a recognizable Russian name.&quot;

==Publication history==

A mainstay of the X-Men comic book series until the 1990s, Colossus went on to appear regularly in the first series of &quot;Excalibur&quot;. While a member of the team, he had his own self-titled one-shot that depicted him and his teammate Meggan battling Arcade at his new Murderworld facility.

After returning to the X-Men alongside Excalibur teammates Shadowcat and Nightcrawler, Colossus stayed with the title until his death. He was later resurrected and was a regular in the third series of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; written by Joss Whedon. He is the feature of a limited series, &quot;Colossus: Bloodlines&quot;, in which he journeys back to Russia. Colossus has since returned as a regular in the X-Men series, appearing in various titles such as &quot;X-Men: Manifest Destiny&quot;, &quot;X-Men: Secret Invasion&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, and &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;.

Colossus appears in &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot;, a new series by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist Salvador Larroca which debuted in Dec. 2012. He appears in &quot;Extraordinary X-Men&quot;, written by Jeff Lemire and drawn by Humberto Ramos. He is part of a team which is led by Storm, and includes his sister Magik, Iceman, a teenaged version of Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, a re-purposed Sentinel named Cerebra, and Old Man Logan.

In 2025, Colossus will be getting a solo X-Men project.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===

Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Rasputin was born on a Soviet collective farm called the Ust-Ordynsky Collective near Lake Baikal in Siberia. He lived there with his mother Alexandra, father Nikolai, and sister Illyana. His older brother Mikhail had been a Soviet cosmonaut and had apparently died in a rocket accident. The 2006 comic mini-series &quot;Colossus: Bloodline&quot; established that the family was descended from Grigori Rasputin and a Romani woman named Elena.

Peter&#x27;s superhuman powers manifested during his adolescence while saving his sister from a runaway tractor. He was then contacted by Professor Charles Xavier, founder of the X-Men.

===X-Men===
Peter Rasputin was part of the second generation of X-Men, formed by Charles Xavier to save the original X-Men from the living island Krakoa. He agreed to leave the farm community where he was born to go to the United States with Xavier. Xavier gave him the name Colossus. After the battle was won, Colossus remained in the U.S. with the new X-Men.
Colossus is typically portrayed as peaceful, selfless, reluctant to hurt or kill, and often putting himself in danger to protect others. In some of his earliest missions, he battled the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard, and visited the Savage Land, where he met Nereel.

Peter&#x27;s family always remained in his thoughts and he frequently wrote letters home. Shortly after joining the X-Men, a woman known as Miss Locke kidnapped many of the team&#x27;s loved ones to force the X-Men to help her free her employer, Arcade, from captivity by one of Doctor Doom&#x27;s robots. Among her captives was Colossus&#x27; younger sister Illyana, whom Locke had kidnapped from the Siberian collective farm and transported to the United States. Arcade brainwashed Colossus into becoming &quot;The Proletarian&quot;, who then battled the other X-Men until they countered the brainwashing. The X-Men freed Illyana from captivity, and she went to live with her brother Peter at Xavier&#x27;s mansion. She was later held captive in a dimension known as Limbo, where she spent years while only mere moments elapsed on Earth, and became the adolescent sorceress Magik. As a result, an alternate-timeline version of Colossus dies in Limbo.

When the X-Men fought the evil mutant Proteus, Colossus attempted to kill Proteus, an act he found morally questionable even though he did it to save Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s life. During his early career with the X-Men, Peter started what was arguably his most significant relationship with fellow X-Man Kitty Pryde. Although they were only a couple for a short while, the relationship provided the foundation of a deep and lasting friendship.

Colossus was later almost killed in a battle with Mystique&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutants, but was saved by Rogue and the Morlock Healer.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, he became infatuated with the alien healer Zsaji, and realized his feelings for his teammate were not wholly genuine, ending his relationship with Kitty Pryde. Emotionally distraught, he afterwards engaged in a bar fight with Juggernaut.

During the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, Colossus became heavily involved in the X-Men&#x27;s efforts to save the Morlocks from the Marauders. When Kitty was severely injured by Harpoon, Peter gave in to his rage and snapped Riptide&#x27;s neck. He eventually passed out from previous wounds inflicted by Riptide. Magneto, with the aid of Shadowcat, used his powers to heal Peter&#x27;s armored form, but the process left him paralyzed. He was sent to Muir Island to recuperate, along with Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and the surviving Morlocks.

Over time, Colossus&#x27; wounds healed, but he was trapped in his armored form and could maintain his human form only with the utmost concentration. When he saw the X-Men in Dallas during the &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot;, he had his sister teleport him to the battle, as Destiny had not seen him in her vision of the X-Men&#x27;s demise. When the team decided to sacrifice themselves to stop the Adversary, Colossus gave his life alongside them to save the world. Like the rest of the X-Men, he was revived by Roma and decided to let the world believe him dead while he and the X-Men worked out of an Australian base.

Following the &quot;Inferno&quot; event, Illyana was returned to her original Earth age. Colossus decided it would be better for Illyana if she went back to live with their parents in Russia.

In time, Colossus was reunited with Nereel in the Savage Land and met her son.

After the X-Men began falling apart with Rogue vanishing, Wolverine taking off, Longshot quitting, and Storm apparently killed, Psylocke telepathically prodded the remaining three to disband and travel through the Siege Perilous to gain new lives. Peter emerged in New York with no memory of his past life, inventing a new persona for himself as &#x27;Peter Nicholas&#x27;, where he quickly became a successful artist. He battled the Genoshan Magistrates. He began having visions of a beautiful model, who turned out to be Callisto transformed by Masque. The two were kidnapped by the Morlocks, though Peter had no memory of his time with the X-Men. He resumed his armored form and defeated Masque. He was saved by Forge, Banshee, and Jean Grey, who decided it better that he live his new life rather than be dragged back into theirs.

Peter was psychically dominated by the Shadow King and sent to hunt down Stevie Hunter and Charles Xavier. Xavier had no choice but to destroy the Peter Nicholas persona to break the Shadow King&#x27;s hold. Colossus joined in the battle of Muir Island, and rejoined the X-Men as a member of Storm&#x27;s Gold Strike Force. Peter is shown to be traveling to the Savage Land, where he locates Nereel. He is astonished to learn that the child she bore was not his, but that of another lover. Disheartened, he departs the Savage Land.

The X-Men later found themselves in another dimension, where they discovered that Colossus&#x27; brother Mikhail was alive and acting as a messiah to the population of that world. Mikhail returned to Earth with the X-Men, but was distraught with having been responsible for the deaths of the original crew from his first trek into the other dimension.

Mikhail established himself as leader of the Morlocks and planned to use them as a part of his mass suicide which he thought would grant him retribution or at least reprieve from his guilt. This would prove to be a great source of grief for Peter in an upcoming string of family deaths that would lead to him temporarily disbanding from the X-Men.

However, unbeknownst to the X-Men, Mikhail survived. In a seemingly last second change of mind, Mikhail transported himself and the Morlocks to another world. Later, upon learning this, Peter was disappointed by his brother&#x27;s departure and blamed himself.

Back in Siberia, Peter&#x27;s parents were slain and Illyana kidnapped by the Russian government, who hoped to genetically evolve Illyana to the point where she would have the use of her powers again, to defeat the mutant known as the Soul Skinner. Colossus, with the help of the X-Men, saved Illyana and brought her back to the Mansion.

Later, Illyana became an early victim of the Legacy Virus and died from it. The loss of his immediate family, as well as brain damage that forced him to remain in armored form, caused Colossus to rethink his position with the X-Men and join Magneto and his Acolytes, who had offered him an alternative to the X-Men&#x27;s pacifist philosophy of peaceful mutant/human coexistence. Colossus recovered from the brain damage soon after, but decided to remain with the Acolytes of his own volition, hoping he could temper their extremist methods with what he had learned from Professor Xavier.

===Excalibur===
His stay with Magneto was not long once he realized that Avalon was not the place for him, either, particularly after Magneto was left brain-dead and the space station was destroyed by Holocaust. He left in search of the only person he felt truly cared for him, his former love and teammate Shadowcat, now a member of Excalibur. Colossus traveled to England, where he found Kitty in the arms of her new love, Pete Wisdom. Colossus, exhausted, mentally ill, and enraged, attacked Wisdom and, although the battle was short, Piotr nearly killed him. Colossus was subdued by Captain Britain and Meggan, later cured of his illness by Moira MacTaggert.

Colossus accepted Shadowcat&#x27;s new life and chose to become a member of Excalibur. Although Colossus, along with the rest of the team, soon accepted Kitty&#x27;s relationship with Wisdom, Kitty&#x27;s pet dragon, Lockheed, did not, and was often seen trying to reunite Kitty with Peter, whom he much preferred. One such example being snatching away the garter during Meggan and Captain Britain&#x27;s wedding and dropping it into Colossus&#x27; hand, who was then required to place it on Kitty&#x27;s leg, who had previously caught the bride&#x27;s flowers. With Excalibur, he participated in many adventures, including helping to save London from an ancient demon. Excalibur eventually disbanded, and Colossus returned with Nightcrawler and Shadowcat to the X-Men. But as soon as they returned, they faced a group of imposters following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X. During this time, he repaired his friendships with Wolverine and Storm, that were broken when he had joined the Acolytes. He formed a deep friendship with Marrow. Peter again found his long thought-dead brother Mikhail, but unfortunately lost him again when Apocalypse collected The Twelve in his quest for power.

===Death===
Using thoughts and notes from the recently murdered Moira MacTaggert, the X-Men&#x27;s resident scientist, Beast, claimed to have found the cure for the Legacy Virus. Unfortunately, it could only be made airborne with the death of its first user. Rather than wait for a safer version and allow others to die as Illyana had, Colossus injected himself with the cure. By using his powers and sacrificing himself, Colossus enabled the release of an airborne cure, effectively eradicating the disease. His body was cremated and Shadowcat took his ashes back to Russia to be scattered on his native soil.

===Return===
Nearly two years later, it was brought to the attention of the X-Men that a medical company, entitled Benetech, had developed a mutant cure. After gaining a sample of the cure, Dr. Henry (Beast) McCoy discovered a string of DNA hidden deep within the recesses of the formula. After matching the DNA, Beast and the other X-Men set out to investigate the truth behind Benetech.

During their infiltration, they discovered that Ord, an alien from the Breakworld, was responsible for the means with which the company was able to develop the cure. While the team was separated, Kitty descended into a hidden complex beneath the Benetech building and was able to unlock the true secret behind the cure: shortly after Peter&#x27;s self-sacrificing death, Ord had captured his body and left a duplicate that the X-Men had cremated.

After reviving him, Ord had used the Legacy Virus cure in Peter&#x27;s bloodstream to develop his mutant cure. After unknowingly releasing Peter from his cell, Kitty rejoined him with the X-Men. Together they subdued Ord as he tried to escape Earth. Since reuniting with his friends, Peter has returned to fight with the X-Men, and he and Kitty were able to resume their romantic relationship.

===Colossus: Bloodline===
During the &quot;Colossus: Bloodline&quot; limited series, Colossus made a trip to Russia in response to a call for help from his cousin, journalist Larisa Mishchenko. Her research had established that their family descended from Grigori Rasputin, and that their relatives were being systematically murdered. Rasputin is established as having been a powerful mutant, whose power and life essence had been passed down to his descendants. As his descendants are murdered, his great power is invested in greater measure in the remaining descendants. When there is only one descendant left, Rasputin will be reborn within that individual. Mister Sinister, an old ally of Rasputin, is revealed as the man behind the murders.

Larisa is murdered by Sinister, but Colossus and his brother Mikhail foil Sinister&#x27;s plot, and Mikhail banishes himself to a dimension where he can never die, but from which he can never return. If Sinister were to murder Colossus, Rasputin would be reborn in Mikhail, but locked in a dimension on his own. However, all those involved remained unaware of Colossus&#x27; son, Peter, in the Savage Land, whose presence could severely alter the situation. Colossus returned to the X-Men, a man without family. It is rumoured that the boy &quot;Michael Termani&quot; escaped the extermination and made his way to the United States of America in search of Colossus, whom he may be related to.

===Breakworld and beyond===
During an attack on the institute, Colossus engages Sebastian Shaw, although &quot;Shaw&quot; turned out to be an illusory attack by Cassandra Nova. It was revealed that Colossus is the mutant destined to destroy Breakworld according to the Breakworld&#x27;s precogs. However, on a mission to the Breakworld, the X-Men discover that this was not an actual prophecy but an elaborate scheme created by Aghanne, the insane leader of a Breakworld reform cult, intended to bring about that world&#x27;s destruction. Colossus is chosen for the prophecy as his unique organic steel form would allow him to destroy the planet&#x27;s power source, initiating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world. Realizing this, Colossus refuses to kill the planet although he does threaten to seize power and rule it if the Breakworld destroys the Earth as planned.

During the &quot;World War Hulk&quot; storyline, Colossus is one of the X-Men members that tries to defend Professor X against the Hulk, who has come looking for Charles as he is one of the members of the secret Illuminati that exiled him from Earth. During their battle, the Hulk reflects on Colossus&#x27; bravery, mentioning that Colossus might have made a &quot;decent opponent&quot; to the Hulk&#x27;s previous incarnations. Locked in a test of strength, Hulk demonstrates his superior power by bending Colossus&#x27;s arms backwards at the forearms, breaking them. Beast later uses a laser in the lab to heat his arms up near their melting point, while Strong Guy bends them back into place; his arms needed to be re-set in their metal form before he transformed back to his human form to avoid serious injury to them.

Colossus returns to Russia with Wolverine and Nightcrawler along for the ride. The trio are captured by the Russian government, who wish to find out why all their mutant agents succumbed to M-Day, and Colossus did not. This led to a battle against the Russians and Omega Red, who was being examined by their captors. After defeating Omega Red, the heroes receive a call from Cyclops informing them of their new home in San Francisco. They soon arrive back in the States, where they aid in rebuilding the X-Men.

Colossus was briefly a member of the Fifty State Initiative team called &quot;The Last Defenders&quot; alongside Nighthawk, She-Hulk, and Blazing Skull.

Joining the rest of the X-Men, Colossus relocates to San Francisco. Still mourning Kitty, the other X-Men try to cheer him up using various different methods from picking fights with him to throwing a party. In the end he tells them to leave him be, he just needs time. Later while walking through Golden Gate Park, he come across a little girl who needs help rescuing her &quot;Kitty&quot; from a tree to which he replies that nothing would make him happier.

===X-Infernus===

Colossus feels the X-Men are not doing enough to rescue Illyana from Limbo, and is upset. With the aid of Pixie, the team is able to enter Limbo, where they encounter hostile demons. After defeating the demons, the X-Men locate Illyana, who has been defeated by Witchfire. The X-Men and Magik defeat Witchfire by trapping her in the dimension that houses the Elder Gods. Illyana leaves Limbo with the X-Men when Cyclops and Colossus offer her a home.

===Utopia===
When the Dark Avengers head into San Francisco to battle any X-Men they can find, Colossus battles Venom. They later face off again when the combined Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia, with Colossus and the X-Men emerging victorious.

It&#x27;s also during this time that Colossus suffers from depression due to the loss of Kitty prior to the Messiah Complex. During this period, Magik arrives at Utopia to ask for help from the X-Men and her former teammates as there&#x27;s a battle coming in Limbo. The reunion helps alleviate some of Colossus&#x27;s depression, but after Magneto comes to Utopia, Magneto brings the bullet carrying Kitty back to Earth to save her in a show of good faith and Kitty and Colossus are reunited, but are initially unable to touch as Kitty spent so long phased to stop the bullet hitting something that she has &#x27;forgotten&#x27; how to resume a tangible state on her own. Due to Warlord Krunn&#x27;s mutant cure, Colossus was temporarily depowered and beaten in battle by him, but other Breakworld residents were able to restore Kitty to her fully tangible state.

===Fear Itself===

After the Juggernaut became Kuurth: Breaker of Stone during the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, one of the Heralds of a long-dormant god of fear known as the Serpent, Colossus made a bargain with Cyttorak, the other-dimensional being who originally empowered the Juggernaut, to gain the power to stand against Kuurth. Colossus became the new avatar of the Juggernaut and was able to push Cain Marko back until Cain was summoned by The Serpent. This decision caused Kitty to break up with Colossus, as she cannot cope with his increasingly displayed willingness to sacrifice himself when she wants someone who will be willing to &quot;live&quot; for her.

Due to this, Colossus decides to stay on Utopia with Cyclops&#x27; team of X-Men instead of returning to Westchester due to his fear of his new Juggernaut powers being unsafe around children. After another stressful battle, Colossus realized that his powers were far more dangerous than he realized, and he requested to be locked up alongside his sister, only to be freed when needed on missions.

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
At the onset of the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Colossus is featured in fights against several characters, including Spider-Man, Red Hulk, and Thing. He is one of the few X-Men teleported by Magik to the dark side of the moon to confront the Avengers over Hope Summers. When the disruptor devised by Iron Man blasts and divides the Phoenix Force, part of it bonds to Colossus, who becomes one of the Phoenix Five along with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik and Namor. He attempts to release his Juggernaut powers, but Cyttorak refuses, citing his affiliation with the Phoenix due to his newfound destructive powers. While empowered with his fragment of the Phoenix Force, Colossus attempts to regain Kitty&#x27;s affections, but she rejects him—wary of his power-mongering and that the Phoenix has changed him for the worse—he reacts angrily. Colossus is eventually defeated when Spider-Man manages to provoke him and Magik into attacking each other, causing them to incapacitate each other. Their Phoenix powers dissipate and are absorbed by Emma Frost and Cyclops (Namor having already been defeated). Following the defeat of Cyclops as the last of the Phoenix Five, Colossus and the other former members of the Phoenix Five did not surrender themselves to the authorities. Magik later purges the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword. Knowing that Magik could have repelled his servitude to Cyttorak at any time and that she made him keep the Juggernaut powers to teach him a lesson, Colossus evinces hatred toward the sister he once loved, going so far as to say he wants her killed.

===X-Force===
Colossus&#x27;s powers have gone out of control, apparently as a result of losing the Phoenix Force, causing parts of him to shift between flesh and organic steel rather than all flesh or all organic steel. He now appears as a member of Cable&#x27;s new X-Force team after Cable provides him with a device that stabilizes his condition.

===Amazing X-Men===
Colossus has since rejoined Wolverine&#x27;s team of X-Men after his sister convinced him to, after quitting Cable&#x27;s X-Force team following the results of the Cable and X-Force/Uncanny X-Force: Vendettas storyline. It is eventually discovered that Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik, Magneto and Colossus were actually infected with nano-sentinels by Dark Beast, after the incident with the Phoenix Force, and that was the real cause for their flawed abilities. He has since regained control of his organic steel powers and has stopped wearing Cable&#x27;s harness which helped him to stabilize his flesh and steel forms.

During this time, Cyttorak caused the Crimson Gem to reappear in the ancient temple and triggered a call for suitable candidates to become a new Juggernaut, which led to Colossus and Cain Marko joining a team of X-Men to stop the Gem from being claimed by forces such as Man-Killer and the former Living Monolith. However, when Adbol acquired the Gem for himself, Colossus invoked Cyttorak to confront him about the failure of all of his past Juggernauts, suggesting that Cyttorak withdraw his power from Adbol and empower a new avatar to a greater extent than any before. Unfortunately, Cyttorak chose to empower Marko rather than Colossus, with Marko resolving to destroy the X-Men present and then move on to kill Cyclops for the death of Professor X. With Marko now even immune to psychic attacks, he appeared truly unstoppable, but Colossus was able to defeat him by outmaneuvering the super-empowered Marko until he could strike the sea side cliff edge where they had been fighting, causing Cain to fall into the ocean below, taking him out of the fight at least for the moment.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Colossus is with the X-Men when they take part in the incursion event between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. Hulk&#x27;s Doc Green form uses Colossus in a Fastball Special that destroys the Triskelion.

===Extraordinary X-Men===
Colossus later joins Storm&#x27;s new team of X-Men who are living in an isolated part of Limbo after magically transporting the mansion there, renaming it X-Haven. Their mission is to provide a refuge and protect mutants from the effects of the M-Pox that has infected the mutants and rendered almost all of the mutant species sterile due to the Terrigen in the atmosphere. During the Apocalypse Wars, Colossus, Ernst, Anole, Glob Herman and No-Girl are separated from Storm&#x27;s team. When they re-encounter the missing students, they discover them to now be adults protecting an ark of 600 artificially created mutant embryos from the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse, one of whom is a celestially altered Colossus.

Colossus was eventually found by his teammates Iceman and Nightcrawler and teleported back to X-Haven by Cerebra. There, he was transformed back to normal by Apocalypse, who was tricked into doing so by Nightcrawler.

===&quot;Inhumans vs X-Men&quot; and &quot;X-Men Gold&quot;===
After Beast discovers that there isn&#x27;t a cure for the M-Pox and no way to alter the Terrigen cloud the X-Men are left with the choice to either stay on earth and fight for their right to live and risk becoming extinct in a matter of weeks or leave earth and start fresh somewhere else. The X-Men decide to go to war against the Inhumans to decide the fate of the Terrigen. With the war underway Colossus is stationed at X-Haven to protect it from a potential Inhuman counter-attack. When the Inhuman Royal Family arrives to do just that, Colossus is left to face them on his own. He later joins the rest of the X-Men in Iceland in the final battle against the Inhumans, where Medusa finally understands what the X-Men are fighting for so she voluntarily destroys the Terrigen.

After the Terrigen is destroyed the X-Men sends the refugees back home from X-Haven now that earth is habitable for mutants again. Still, the X-Men find themselves wondering how to move forward with the events of the war still fresh in their minds. Storm asks Kitty Pryde to return to the X-Men and take her place as leader, and in doing so Kitty moves the mansion from Limbo to Central Park and creates a new field team and recruits Colossus. Colossus and Kitty share many awkward moments given their history, trying to move forward as friends but still feeling a chemistry.

==Powers and abilities==
Colossus is a mutant with the ability to transform his entire body into a form of &quot;organic steel&quot;, with properties similar to osmium but of still unknown composition. Colossus must transform his entire body into this armored state; he cannot transform only a portion of his body. When he transforms, he gains approximately in height; official figures state his height at about in transformed state versus in normal human form. His weight is more than doubled. In his armored form, Colossus possesses superhuman strength, as well as superhuman stamina and durability. His physical strength is currently greater than when he first joined the X-Men, due to the realignment of his cells by Magneto following an injury during the Mutant Massacre. While in his armored form, Colossus requires no food, water or even oxygen to sustain himself and is extremely resistant to injury. He is capable of withstanding great impacts, large caliber bullets, falling from tremendous heights, electricity, and certain magical attacks. While he has great resistance to temperature extremes of hot and cold, extreme heat followed by rapid super-cooling has been shown to cause damage. As he is vulnerable to the anti-metal Antarctic Vibranium in his metal form, his body instinctively shifts to human form when faced with an Antarctic Vibranium weapon.

Colossus is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in Judo by Cyclops. He has had training in acrobatics and sword fighting from Nightcrawler. In his human form, he is still exceptionally strong and in superb physical condition, though not superhumanly so. He has completed college-level courses at Xavier&#x27;s school.

As the unstoppable Avatar of Cyttorak, Colossus gained additional superhuman strength and resistance to injury, as well as other mystical powers. Among these was the power to ignore impediments to his movement, hence the &quot;unstoppable&quot; moniker. These powers were later taken away from Colossus and returned to Cain Marko.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Colossus 11th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Colossus 7th in their &quot;Age Of Apocalypse: The 30 Strongest Characters In Marvel&#x27;s Coolest Alternate World&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Colossus 13th in their &quot;X-Force: 20 Powerful Members&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline, Piotr Rasputin/Colossus was a very haunted man, wearing a red mask to cover acid scars on his face. His sister, Illyana Rasputin, was thought to have died years prior, and his brother, Mikhail Rasputin, was captured by Apocalypse. Colossus became leader of the Super Soldiers and faced his brainwashed brother in combat. Now a Horseman of Apocalypse, Mikhail destroyed all of Russia&#x27;s superheroes except his brother, and from that day the severely beaten Colossus chose to dedicate his life to stopping Apocalypse and Mikhail. He left Russia to find the X-Men. Colossus was one of Magneto&#x27;s original recruits for his X-Men.

During his first mission as an X-Man, Colossus battled Sabretooth for the life of a young Jewish American mutant named Katherine Pryde/Shadowcat. Colossus fell in love with her, and the two would eventually marry. After years of fighting for Magneto&#x27;s cause, Colossus lost the will to fight on a battlefield in Africa. He decided to retire from the X-Men. As a final favor to Magneto, he agreed to teach the next generation of mutants with his wife.

Colossus came out of retirement two times. The first time, he was injured so severely only Magneto&#x27;s metal powers kept him alive. Colossus could not transform back to his human self without risking death. The second time, Magneto offered Colossus and Shadowcat an important mission. It was discovered that Illyana was indeed still alive and being held prisoner in a slave camp, and they needed to save her so they could restore the true timeline.

Colossus and Shadowcat sent their team into the Seattle Core to rescue Illyana. After they found her, Colossus demanded Shadowcat evacuate Illyana immediately, leaving their students behind. Shadowcat disagreed, but followed his orders after he told her that he would go back for their students. Colossus reached the front gate and peered back into the Core. Only one student, Husk, remained standing. Colossus allowed the gate to close without attempting to help. He returned to his wife and sister and claimed he had done all he could.

Colossus and Shadowcat delivered Illyana to Magneto, but after learning the reality Magneto was trying to save was a place where his sister was dead, Colossus went mad. He tried to follow his sister into the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal, injuring Iceman in the process, and when Shadowcat stepped in front of him, assuming he would calm down, he didn&#x27;t. Colossus crushed his wife and killed her. Insane with grief, he was finally taken down by Gambit.

Mortally injured, he reverts to his human form and dies after his sister returns from the M&#x27;kraan Crystal.

Years later when Weapon X had been transformed into Weapon Omega: Heir of Apocalypse, Colossus was brought back to life through the combined efforts of Sugarman and Dark Beast, who had taken great pains to find and preserve his body. Along with many other &quot;alphas&quot;, his mind was altered, turning him into a servant of Weapon Omega.

He was sent together with Azazel and Cyclops to confront another resurrected &quot;alpha&quot;, Penance. Penance used her telepathic powers to restore Colossus&#x27; true memories, and he swore to help her in her quest to rebuild the world and lead mutants to a brighter future. A fight broke out between him and Cyclop, but Azazel teleported Cyclops and himself away.

===Days of Future Past===
In the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline (Earth-811), Colossus was detained in the South Bronx Mutant Containment Facility, like most of the surviving X-Men. In this reality he married Kate Pryde and they had children. When his wife transferred her consciousness into the Kitty Pride of Earth-616 and fell unconscious, Colossus tried to protect her from the Sentinels. As one of the last mutants on Earth, he infiltrated the Baxter Building on a suicide run in which he was killed by Sentinels trying to avenge the deaths of Storm and Wolverine.

===Earth X===
In &quot;Earth X&quot;, Colossus has become Tsar Piotr of Russia. His country&#x27;s massive grain supply, protected by an army of Crimson Dynamos, provides one of the greatest food sources for the world. Occasionally, he is attacked by Life Model Decoys of Nick Fury, who seem to think that Piotr is a stereotypical Communist. It is mentioned in passing that at some point in the future, he will travel back in time and become Mister Sinister.

===Exiles===
Several versions of Colossus have been seen in the &quot;Exiles&quot; series:

* One was killed after betraying his Heroes for Hire teammates to save the alternative version of his sister, Magik.
* One dies protecting an alternative version of Shadowcat.

===Marvel Zombies===
A version of Colossus is seen in &quot;Dead Days&quot; when the zombified Alpha Flight attack the mansion. Later, he is seen among the survivors and fighting the other zombie heroes. Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Dr. Strange, Nick Fury and Thor fight a holding action to protect a teleporter from the zombie forces. The group realizes that their plan to evacuate survivors might lead to another innocent world being infected so they destroy the machine and willingly give themselves up to the zombies.

In Marvel Zombies: Halloween, Kitty Pryde and her son with Colossus, Peter Rasputin Pryde are two of the few surviving humans, years later.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Peter Rasputin reluctantly works as an arms smuggler for the Russian mob. Peter was saved from a firing squad as a young child by a boss in the Russian Mafia called Big Boris, who smuggles Peter from Siberia to the United States. Colossus&#x27; powers are similar to those of his Earth-616 counterpart. With the use of a deadly drug called Banshee, he has gained super strength to rival other powerhouses such as Thor. He is not immune to Rogue&#x27;s touch as shown in the &quot;Return to Weapon X&quot; storyline. He is also highly resistant to physical injury. He has withstood being slashed by Ultimate Wolverine&#x27;s adamantium claws. He has also survived a localized nuclear explosion. A few deviations from the Earth-616 version include the fact that Ultimate Colossus&#x27;s height remains the same when he changes. Unlike the mainstream version, his eyes remain vulnerable to pressure even in steel form, as shown when fighting Sam Wilson during &quot;Ultimate Nightmare&quot;.

Colossus is revealed as a mutant during an illegal arms transaction gone wrong. Everyone is killed by gunfire except for Peter, whose mutant ability saves him. Jean Grey finds him soon after and offers him a place among the X-Men.

When the X-Men embark on a world tour to promote Xavier&#x27;s book, Colossus inexplicably disappears to Russia. Cyclops and Jean Grey track him and find Peter working in a factory. Colossus tells them he left due to unhappiness with his place on the team and with life as a mutant, but Jean suggests that his true reason is unrequited feelings he has for a fellow team member. Peter later comes to terms with his &quot;gift,&quot; and becomes a Russian national hero when he rescues the crew of an incapacitated submarine. He leaves Russia to rejoin the X-Men.

Later, Colossus and the X-Men are forced out of the mansion with the U.S. Government on their tails. In a climactic battle between the X-Men and the Ultimates, Colossus is able to defeat Iron Man and Thor, but is finally temporarily incapacitated by Hawkeye who fires a compact nuclear warhead arrow (with a blast radius of about 20 feet) near him. With the surprise assistance from Iceman, the X-Men (without Professor Xavier) manage to regroup and escape.

The X-Men locate Magneto&#x27;s flying citadel using a signal sent by a captured Cyclops. Upon their arrival, Magneto subdues them. Despite being composed of metal, Colossus&#x27; great strength and willpower allow him to overcome Magneto&#x27;s control and beat Magneto mercilessly for the harm inflicted on Wolverine.

Unlike his mainstream counterpart, Ultimate Colossus is gay and does not have a romance with Ultimate Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat. This is implied during the Mark Millar&#x27;s run on the title, through his interactions with fellow X-Man Wolverine (this is implied during the &quot;Return of the King&quot; story arc, in which Colossus almost beats Magneto to a pulp when he threatens Wolverine). It is implied (through stereotype) when Jean Grey reveals to the readers that Peter&#x27;s favorite TV show is &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, but stated more directly in that the main reason Colossus left the X-Men might have been that he was unable to make the X-Man he&#x27;d fallen in love with love him, even in the slightest. Storm also suggests Peter is gay when Angel arrives at the school and Storm explains to him that the reason that all the girls &quot;and &quot;maybe&quot; Colossus&quot; stare at him is because he is good looking. It is more openly addressed later during a series of mutant murders by Sinister, Colossus tends to the wounds of Northstar, the only survivor. He is shocked when the openly gay Northstar asks if Colossus is single, which triggers a transformation into his metal state.

Colossus and Northstar amicably part ways and keep in touch even after Northstar&#x27;s team, the Academy of Tomorrow, come to blows with the X-Men. Colossus later agrees to accompany Northstar to his homecoming dance. This disturbs Nightcrawler, Peter&#x27;s friend, who begins to avoid and resent him. Their relationship becomes very strained after this and never really recovers, Nightcrawler believing that Colossus deliberately misled and &quot;betrayed&quot; him. This also marks a significant change in Nightcrawler&#x27;s character: much of his relationship with Colossus in the mainstream versions of them also involves Kitty Pryde (Colossus&#x27; recurring love interest throughout most of the various X-Men chronicles)&#x27;s close relationship with Nightcrawler. In this version, there is no romantic relations between Pryde and Rasputin and all three characters are affected. In other versions, Nightcrawler is routinely seen as an outsider trying desperately to fit in, more so than the other X-Men, but in this one his blatant homophobia and disgust towards Colossus is a strong theme. Comments have been made with a double meaning toward Peter&#x27;s sexuality, such as Bobby Drake saying &quot;Too bad he&#x27;s playing for the other team&quot; during a baseball game against the Academy of Tomorrow.

Following Xavier&#x27;s death, Northstar asks Colossus to come stay with him at the Academy of Tomorrow. Colossus finds a job as a construction worker and refuses to join Bishop&#x27;s X-Men team.

It has been revealed that Colossus is dependent on the mutant enhancement drug Banshee for his super-human strength. Without it, he cannot so much as lift his arms in his organic steel mode. It was also revealed that Peter came to work for the Russian mafia after being banished from his home by his father, who had accidentally discovered him in bed with another man. Colossus briefly formed a Banshee-enhanced splinter group of X-Men, but they have since rejoined the main group drug-free.

After rejoining the main X-Men team during the &quot;Ultimatum, a tsunami hits New York and kills numerous people and superheroes including Beast, Dazzler, and Nightcrawler. He fights against Magneto and his Brotherhood in their attack on the world. Colossus, alongside Jean Grey, Storm, Iceman, and Rogue, is one of the few X-Men to survive Magneto&#x27;s rampage.

At the end of Ultimate X #5, Colossus is shown being held in a government facility: &quot;Camp Angel&quot; along with Storm and Spiral. It can be inferred from the narration of Karen Grant that the government is using them for testing on how to remove the mutant gene. At the start of Ultimate Comics: X-Men as a series, Colossus is seen in this camp. Despite the government&#x27;s claims that mutants are being well-treated, Colossus is being maliciously tortured with electrical sticks. When the prison is overruled, and arguments started between Storm and Stacy X over the treatment of Warden Lake and Major Walker, until Colossus kills Lake, summoning a fleet of Nimrod Model Sentinels.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker went to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Colossus is shown to be a member of the Rasputin family, the autocratic rulers of the Eurasian Republic, a power bloc which has Russia as its center of political power. He is among the Rasputin family members that attend Maker&#x27;s event at The City in Latveria. He and the Rasputin family later attend a gathering following the death of Obadiah Stane where it is revealed that they are part of the Maker&#x27;s Council and that it is their turn to be the &quot;enemy&quot; according to Hulk. It is implied the Republic is known as a rogue state in a series of manufactured conflicts constructed to fuel the war economy practiced by the Council&#x27;s incorporated nation-states. Colossus and the Rasputin family are among the leaders that meet outside The City after it closed up with Maker, Kang the Conqueror, and Howard Stark still inside as they make plans to divide up the North American Union among themselves.

During a meeting with the rest of Maker&#x27;s Council and Nick Fury, it is revealed by Colossus, Magik, and Omega Red that they have any mutants sent to the Eurasian Republic where they are using them as weapons. When Nick Fury tries to have the Cumulo-Carrier &quot;Beast&quot; self-destruct, it doesn&#x27;t work as Colossus and the rest of Maker&#x27;s Council has been through different attempts before and that the Nick Fury they were meeting was one of the Life Model Decoys which is then destroyed by Emmanuel da Costa.

In a flashback, Colossus and the Rasputin family are told about Logan and his regenerative abilities by Dr. Alongya Prostovich as they plan to make use of a telepath in their possession to wipe his memory and get better control over him so that he can serve as their Winter Soldier.

=== X-Men Forever ===
In &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, Colossus returns to Russia after the events of &quot;X-Men&quot; #1-3, where he becomes a government agent, handled by Natalia Romanova, the Black Widow, with whom he has struck up a romance. Although overjoyed to see his old teammates again, he is intent on staying and serving his country.

<text>Edmund Georg Hermann Landau (14 February 1877 – 19 February 1938) was a German mathematician who worked in the fields of number theory and complex analysis.

==Biography==
Edmund Landau was born to a Jewish family in Berlin. His father was Leopold Landau, a gynecologist, and his mother was Johanna Jacoby. Landau studied mathematics at the University of Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1899 and his habilitation (the post-doctoral qualification required to teach in German universities) in 1901. His doctoral thesis was 14 pages long.

In 1895, his paper on scoring chess tournaments is the earliest use of eigenvector centrality.

Landau taught at the University of Berlin from 1899 to 1909, after which he held a chair at the University of Göttingen. He married Marianne Ehrlich, the daughter of the Nobel Prize-winning biologist Paul Ehrlich, in 1905.

At the 1912 International Congress of Mathematicians Landau listed four problems in number theory about primes that he said were particularly hard using current mathematical methods. They remain unsolved to this day and are now known as Landau&#x27;s problems.

During the 1920s, Landau was instrumental in establishing the Mathematics Institute at the nascent Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Intent on eventually settling in Jerusalem, he taught himself Hebrew and delivered a lecture entitled &quot;Solved and unsolved problems in elementary number theory&quot; in Hebrew on 2 April 1925 during the university&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremonies. He negotiated with the university&#x27;s president, Judah Magnes, regarding a position at the university and the building that was to house the Mathematics Institute.

Landau and his family emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1927 and he began teaching at the Hebrew University. The family had difficulty adjusting to the primitive living standards then available in Jerusalem. In addition, Landau became a pawn in a struggle for control of the university between Magnes and Chaim Weizmann and Albert Einstein. Magnes suggested that Landau be appointed Rector of the university, but Einstein and Weizmann supported Selig Brodetsky. Landau was disgusted by the dispute and decided to return to Göttingen, remaining there until he was forced out by the Nazi regime after the Machtergreifung in 1933, in a boycott organized by Oswald Teichmüller. Thereafter, he lectured only outside Germany. He moved to Berlin in 1934, where he died in early 1938 of natural causes.

In 1903, Landau gave a much simpler proof than was then known of the prime number theorem and later presented the first systematic treatment of analytic number theory in the &quot;Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen&quot; (the &quot;Handbuch&quot;). He also made important contributions to complex analysis.

G. H. Hardy and Hans Heilbronn wrote that &quot;No one was ever more passionately devoted to mathematics than Landau&quot;.

<doc id="222231" wikidata="Q935413" url="?curid=222231" title="There's No Disgrace Like Home">
<text>&quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; is the fourth episode of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on Fox in the United States on January 28, 1990. In the episode, Homer is ashamed of his family&#x27;s behavior at a catastrophic company picnic and enrolls them in therapy. The therapist, Dr. Marvin Monroe (Harry Shearer), struggles to solve their problems − culminating in a shock therapy-based showdown between the family members − before eventually giving up and refunding their money.

One of the first-produced episodes of the season, it is known for showcasing early designs and different characterizations for several members of the cast. The episode is inspired by the comedy of Laurel and Hardy and features cultural references to films such as &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;Freaks&quot; as well as the &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; television series. When the BBC began airing &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in November 1996, this episode was the first to be shown.

==Plot==
Homer takes his family to a company picnic, where he is embarrassed by the behavior of Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and Marge. Mr. Burns, Homer&#x27;s boss, fires any employee whose family members are not enjoying themselves. When Homer notices that Mr. Burns approves of a &quot;normal&quot;, well-mannered family who treat one another with respect, he wonders why his own family is so dysfunctional. The picnic is a catastrophe when Bart chases and tortures the swans, Lisa swims in the fountain, and Marge gets drunk from alcohol-spiked punch and performs a musical number.

Homer tries to prove his point to Bart, Lisa, and Marge by taking them on a tour of the neighborhood and peeking in windows to observe other families. The excursion makes the others uncomfortable for invading these families&#x27; privacy, and one homeowner shoots at them for trespassing. A depressed Homer visits Moe&#x27;s Tavern, where he sees a television advertisement for Dr. Marvin Monroe&#x27;s Family Therapy Center. Enticed by Monroe&#x27;s guarantee of &quot;family bliss or double your money back&quot;, Homer decides to sign the Simpsons up for an appointment.

To his family&#x27;s chagrin, Homer pawns their television to pay for the $250 therapy. When Monroe asks the Simpsons to draw pictures of the source of their problems, Bart, Lisa, and Marge draw Homer. Distracted, Homer draws an airplane in flight and Monroe scolds him for being a bad father figure. After Homer gets angry with Bart and tries to attack him with a lamp, Monroe gives the Simpsons padded mallets to work out their aggression without harming each other. The exercise fails when Bart removes the padding from his mallet and hits Monroe in the knee with the hard inner core.

In frustration, Monroe resorts to aversion therapy by wiring the family members to an electric generator, so they can deliver shocks to one another to deter misbehavior. However, they shock each other so many times that the generator becomes damaged (which leads to all of Monroe&#x27;s other patients leaving his office) and the entire city suffers a brownout, delighting Mr. Burns. Realizing he cannot help the Simpsons, Monroe unplugs the generator and begs them to leave. After Homer reminds him of the double-money-back guarantee, Monroe angrily pays him $500 on the condition that they never tell anyone of their visit to the center. The Simpsons decide to use the $500 to buy a new television.

==Production==
The episode shows signs of being one of the earliest produced. Several of the characters notably behave differently compared to the episodes surrounding it: akin to her portrayal in the &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; shorts, Lisa is an undisciplined brat indistinguishable from Bart, Marge gets drunk and is inattentive, and Homer is the voice of reason. These roles were reversed in later episodes. It was an early episode for Mr. Burns (who was known as Mr. Meanie in the first draft), who had been voiced by Christopher Collins in the previous episode. Originally, the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan, a concept that was later dropped. The idea that he would greet his employees using index cards was inspired by the way Reagan greeted people. The episode marks the first time Burns refers to &quot;releasing the hounds&quot;.

The episode marked the first appearance of Dr. Marvin Monroe and Itchy &amp; Scratchy; the latter had previously appeared in the shorts. It also marked the first appearance of yellow Smithers, who was drawn as an African-American in the previous episode. Eddie and Lou also appeared for the first time, although Lou was mistakenly animated with yellow instead of black, as he would later become. Lou was named after Lou Whitaker, a Major League Baseball player.

The idea behind the shock therapy scene was based on Laurel and Hardy throwing pies at each other. The scene was rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.

The episode&#x27;s title is a parody of the phrase &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home,&quot; first heard in the 1823 song &quot;Home! Sweet Home!,&quot; and best recognized from the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The scene in which the family enters Burns&#x27; Manor contains two cultural references. The Manor resembles Charles Foster Kane&#x27;s mansion from the 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. The characters refer to it as &quot;stately Burns Manor&quot;, a reference to the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series. In addition, there is a reference to &quot;Freaks&quot;, the Tod Browning cult horror film, in the repetition of the line &quot;one of us&quot;.

While drunk at Mr. Burns&#x27; picnic, Marge sings a version of the song &quot;Hey, Brother, Pour the Wine&quot; which was popularised by Dean Martin. The shock therapy scene is reminiscent of the 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

The episode made a brief appearance as inflight entertainment in the 1990 action film &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; (which aired the same day as Super Bowl XXIV on rival network CBS) finished forty-fifth in ratings for the week of January 22–28, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 11.2, equivalent to approximately 10.3 million viewing households. It was the second-highest-rated show on Fox that week, following &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.

Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, note: &quot;It&#x27;s very strange to see Homer pawning the TV set in an attempt to save the family; if this episode had come later Marge would surely have taken this stance.&quot; They continue, &quot;A neat swipe at family counseling with some great set pieces; we&#x27;re especially fond of the perfect version of The Simpsons and the electric-shock aversion therapy.&quot;

Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode is &quot;[his] least favorite episode of Season One&quot; and further commented: &quot;Homer feels embarrassed by the others? Marge acts poorly in public and doesn&#x27;t care about the upkeep of the family? Lisa (Yeardley Smith) engages in pranks and silliness? This ain&#x27;t the family we&#x27;ve grown to know and love.&quot;

It was the first episode to be broadcast on terrestrial television by the BBC on November 23, 1996, on a Saturday at 5:30 pm, because the episodes were shown out of order. The episode was screened with five million viewers, slightly less than the show &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, which previously held the timeslot. The episode also faced competition from ITV&#x27;s screening of &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;.

==Home media==
The episode was released first on home video in the United Kingdom, as part of a VHS release titled &quot;The Simpsons Collection&quot;; the episode was paired with season one episode &quot;Bart the General&quot;. It was released in the US on the VHS release &quot;The Best of The Simpsons, Vol. 1&quot; (1997), paired with &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot;. It was later re-released in the US in a collector&#x27;s edition boxed set of the first three volumes of &quot;The Best of The Simpsons&quot; collections. It was re-released in the UK as part of a VHS boxed set of the complete first season, released in November 1999. The episode&#x27;s debut on the DVD format was as a part of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season one DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Jean, and Reiss participated in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary. A digital edition of the series&#x27; first season was published December 20, 2010 in the United States containing the episode, through Amazon Video and iTunes.

<text>Colima (), located in central−western Mexico, is the capital of the state of the same name and the seat of the municipality of the same name, which is the easternmost and third largest municipality in Colima behind Tecomán and Manzanillo. It is located near the Colima volcano, which divides the state from Jalisco. Colima is the state&#x27;s second largest municipality by population after Manzanillo. 

In 2011, FDI Intelligence, a subsidiary of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; of London, ranked Colima first in small cities and tenth in Latin America as a place to live. It was evaluated under six categories: economic potential, human resources, cost-benefit ratio, quality of life, infrastructure and favorable business environment. In 2022, however, Colima was ranked as the murder capital of the world with a homicide rate of 182 per 100,000.

==Places==
The historic center of the city is a square called Jardín Libertad (Liberty Garden). It consists of a kiosk in the center, brought from Belgium in 1891, surrounded by palms and leafy trees and bushes. It often hosts live music on weekends.

The best known hotel of the city is Hotel Ceballos, located just off the main square called Jardín Libertad behind a set of arches. The hotel was begun by the Ceballos family. Hotel Ceballos has an area under and in front of the arches for outdoor dining. Here and in other restaurants in the city, one can try popular dishes such as atole with milk, white pozole, white menudo, tatemado, pipián mole, birria and sopes. On the side of the Hotel, there is pedestrian street called Andador Constitución. It retains traditional businesses such as the Joven Don Manuelito ice cream shop, which has been there since 1944. On the street proper, one can see street musicians and artists offering to paint or draw landscapes and portraits. At the end of this street, there is a large handcrafts store funded by a government agency called DIF, which focuses on crafts from the state such as indigenous clothing and ceramic figures, especially those of the Mexican hairless dog also known as the Xoloizcuintle or simply Xolo.

The Colima cathedral is called the Basílica Menor Catedral de Colima. The current structure was built in 1894, but since then it has been renovated various times, often due to earthquake damage. The style is Neoclassical with two towers at the front and a dome. The interior is sparse. The former state government palace is next to the cathedral. It is a two-story buildings in French Neoclassical design. It was finished in 1904 and designed by Lucio Urbe, who also did the cathedral. The façade contains a bell, which is a replica of the one Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang in Dolores Hidalgo and a clock brought over from Germany. The building surrounded an inner courtyard marked off by arches. The main stairwell contains mural work done in 1953 by the Coliman artist, Jorge Chávez Carrillo. The park behind the cathedral is Jardin Gregorio Torres Quintero, which contains mango, tabachin (Caesalpinia mexicana) and palm trees along with stands selling handcrafts, novelties and food. Stands here and other places in the city sell a local drink called the &quot;bate&quot; which is thick and somewhat gray in color, made from a toasted seed called chan or chía along with honey or piloncillo. Another traditional drink sold on streets and parks is called &quot;tuba&quot;. It is made from the flower of a type of palm tree, with apple, cucumber and peanut bits added.

On one side of Jardín Libertad is the Museo Regional de Historia, or the regional museum for Colima. The building dates from 1848 when it was a private home. Later it became a hotel and in 1988, it opened as a museum. The ground floor has a number of archeological pieces along with a replica of a shaft tomb, which is characteristic of the region. It recreates the burial of several peoples along with their belongings and Mexican hairless dogs (Xolos), which were thought to be guides to the next world. The upper floor contains documents and other objects which narrates the history of the state from the Conquest to the Mexican Revolution .

A short distance from Jardín Libertad is Jardín Hidalgo, dedicated to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. This square contains an equatorial sundial which is exact. It was designed by Julio Mendoza and contains explanations in several languages. On one side is located the Temple of San Felipe de Jesús. The main altar of this church contains six niches, with a crucifix at the top. The Del Carmen Chapel is next to it, which is a simple building that contains the image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel with the Infant Jesus in her arms. On another side is the Pinacoteca Universitaria Alfonso Michel which is a museum dedicated to the history of art in Colima. It is dedicated to Colima artist Alfonso Michel who is considered the best of the state from the 20th century, and who focused on cubist and impressionist painting. The building is traditional for the city with its corridors lined by arches. Along with its permanent collection, the museum hosts exhibitions by local artists.

The Piedra Lisa Park is named after a large smooth monolithic stone which was thrown here by the Colima Volcano thousands of years ago. According to local legend, visitors to the city who slide down the smooth face of the stone three times are destined to stay or return. This park is also home to an interactive science museum called the Xoloescuintle.

The Conjunto de la Secretaría de Cultura (Secretary of Culture Complex) is a series of buildings around a central plaza that contains a Juan Soriano sculpture by the name of &quot;El Toro.&quot; The three main buildings are the Edificio de Talleres which is for workshops on various artistic disciplines, the Casa de la Cultura Alfonso Michel or Edificio Central, which hosts various exhibitions along with a permanent collection of works by Alfonso Michel and Museo de las Culturas de Occidente María Ahumada de Gómez (María Ahumada de Gómez Museum of Western Cultures. The Ahumada Museum has a large collection of archeological pieces from the region. It divides into two areas. The ground floor is dedicated to the history of the state divided into phases.

The collection includes festival costumes, toys, masks, cooking utensils, metal miniatures, wood objects, pottery and fiber crafts.

==Colima Municipality==

As municipal seat, the city of Colima is the local government for 145 communities, with the most important being Colima, Tepames, Piscila, El Chanal and Los Asmoles. The only urban community is Colima with a high population density with almost all involved in commerce, services and some industry. These communities cover a territory of 668.2km2 and are bordered by the municipalities of Cuauhtémoc, Ixtlahuacán, Tecomán, Coquimatlán and Villa de Álvarez with the state of Jalisco to the east and the state of Michoacán to the southeast. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, an officer called a síndico and eleven representatives called regidores.

The municipality contains about one-quarter of the state&#x27;s total population. About 92% of the municipality&#x27;s population lives in the city proper. (123,543 in the city versus 8,730 in the rural areas ). , only 574 people spoke an indigenous language, with 239 of them living in the city proper. Over 95% of the population is Catholic, with about two percent following a Protestant or Evangelical form of Christianity. As of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 146,904, and covers an area of .

The city has radio stations, two broadcast television stations (channels 5 and 11), cable television services, and eight newspapers. The main highways that connect the municipality to the outside include Highway 4 to Manzanillo and Guadalajara and Highway 110 to Jiquilpan, Michoacán. Other modes of transportation include the Guadalajara-Colima-Manzanillo rail line, the Central Camionera and Central Suburbana de Autobuses bus stations and the regional airport Miguel de la Madrid Airport .

==Economy==

The city of Colima is the economic center of the state. Outside in the small communities of the municipality, agriculture is still the most important economic activity. The city has been ranked as first as liveable small city in Mexico and tenth in Latin America by FDI Intelligence. It is one of seventy-one urban areas and 308 municipalities that contribute over eighty percent of Mexico&#x27;s GDP. It is ranked twelfth in competitiveness. Its main competitive advantage is reliable and objective local laws with its weakness being sustainable use of the local environment. The working population of the municipality is 51,509, with 3,145 working in agriculture, 10,820 in industry, mining and construction and 35,809 in commerce and services . A study by the University of Colima concluded that the municipality is the most competitive in the state and one of the most competitive in the center west of Mexico. Two economic advantages the municipality has are its well development commerce and services sector and its low rate of unemployment. One main disadvantage is its lack of developed technology sector, with most businesses dedicated to basic commodities. Others include high bureaucratic costs, crime rate, over exploitation of aquifers and problems with waste management, especially hazardous materials.

Agriculture is exclusively practiced outside of the city proper, by the small rural communities which still depend on it economically, along with some mining and fishing. The municipality has a total of 70,000 hectares dedicated to agricultural production, which is over ten percent of the total. Most soils in the municipality are fertile. Most irrigated agriculture occurs in the west of the municipality on the Los Asmoles, Las Golondrinas and Los Ortinces mesas. Main crops include corn, rice, melons, animal feed, sugar cane and limes. Other important crops include sorghum, tomatoes, tomatillos, beans, peanuts, mangos, tamarind, coconut, papaya, agave and bananas. Livestock mostly consists of domestic fowl followed by cattle, horses, sheep, goats and pigs. Agriculture employs just over nine percent of the population.

Except for some limestone at the Cerro de Galindo, there are no exploitable minerals in the municipality. Industry is limited to food processing and packaging, especially of rice. There is also some production of oils, soaps and sweets. This sector of the economy employs just over twenty percent of the population.

About 68 percent of the population is employed in commerce and services. Colima is one of the state&#x27;s main commercial centers and is the major distribution center for goods destined for local consumption. The municipality has five traditional fixed markets, eight department stores, ten tianguis markets, one flea market and a very large number of small, independent retail stores. Despite being the capital, the city is not the state&#x27;s main tourist attraction, eclipsed by Manzanillo and Comala, as it lacks major cultural and historical sites. It is one of the state&#x27;s main commerce and distribution centers, with over two-thirds of the population employed in commerce and services within the city proper. The main economic activities in the city are commerce and services, including tourism. However, the city lacks major cultural and heritage sites, with makes it lag behind Manzanillo and the small town of Comala as a tourist attraction.

==History==

===Name===
The name comes from the Nahuatl &quot;Coliman&quot; which refers to the pre-Hispanic dominion of the area. It divides into syllables referring to the Colima Volcano, also called &quot;grandfather&quot; and the word for hand or dominion. This has been interpreted to mean &quot;place conquered by our grandfathers&quot; or &quot;dominion of the old god or god of fire&quot;, referring to the volcano.

The seal for the city was chosen in 1986 from a number submitted as part of a competition. The chosen seal contains fields of red to symbolize the hot climates and local flora such as bougainvilleas, pitayas, and palm trees. Blue represents water on which appears an image of King Collimán. Other images include an open book (education), the two volcanoes of the state, foliage called lambrequins and Mexican hairless dogs (xolos).

The city&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Ciudad de las Palmeras&quot; or City of the Palms.

===Colonial era===
The Spanish colonial settlement of Colima was founded on 15 July 1523 at a location now known as Caxitlán, near present-day Tecomán. This settlement was founded by Gonzalo de Sandoval under orders from Hernán Cortés in order to control the newly conquered Central Mexico region. Due to disease, the settlement was moved on 20 January 1527 to the current location with the name of Villa de San Sebastián Colima. It was the eighth settlement founded by the Spanish in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Hernán Cortés visited the settlement in 1535.

===19th century===
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla was in charge of the parish of Colima in 1792. This would lead to a friendship with Father José Antonio Díaz, who would be an insurgent leader in the area during the Mexican War of Independence. The Battle of el Llano de Santa Juana took place on 12 July 1811, with the city taken by the insurgents under Ignacio Sandoval and El Lego Gallaga. Insurgents under José Antonio Torres and Rafael Arteaga arrived to the city, bringing twenty Spanish hostages from Guadalajara. Eleven would be killed but nine were saved by Francisco Ramírez de Oliva. When royalist troops retook the city in March 1811, about three hundred insurgents and sympathizers were executed.

The city under Anastacio Brizuela swore allegiance to the Plan of Iguala in June 1821. When Independence was achieved in 1821, what is now the state of Colima still belonged to the province of Guadalajara. In September 1821, the municipalities of Colima and Zapotlán were ordered to negotiate their borders by the department of Guadalajara. During these negotiations, Zapotlán ceded Tonila to Colima, and Colima ceded Tecaltlán and Xilotlán to Zapotlán.

Colima and the territory it controlled were loyal to Iturbide. However, since it was then part of the territory of Guadalajara, it was forced to support the republic when it was proclaimed in 1823. The city and territory was made part of the state of Jalisco when it was established, with the city remaining the capital of the Colima province. The city tried to gain independence from Jalisco as a new state, but was denied. Anastacio Brizuela continued to work from 1823 to 1824 to separate the city and its province to make it a separate state. This occurred on 4 October 1824, separating from the state of Jalisco. However, this independence was not stable with the area passing back and forth between independent state and province of Jalisco. However, whether state or province, the city remained the seat of government for the area.

In 1824, the town of Colima was recognized as a city. The annual city fair was authorized in 1825 to occur for fifteen days in March.

When part of Jalisco, the city had problems because its political orientation was different from that of Guadalajara. It was also far from where political decisions were made, impeding economic development. This lack of support from Guadalajara kept ambitions for a distinct state alive, with city first petitioning for more support from Guadalajara, but not receiving it. The state and capital were formally recognized in the 1857 Constitution with Manuel Alvarez as the first constitutional governor.

The city hosted the government of Benito Juárez from March to April 1858.

During the French Intervention in Mexico, the state was taken over by those loyal to Maximilian I, reducing the state to an administrative department. Insurgent General Ramón Corona took the city on 31 January 1867 as part of efforts to restore the Mexican Republic.

The Manzanillo-Colima railroad was inaugurated in 1889.

===Mexican Revolution to the present===
Francisco I. Madero arrived to the city to campaign in 1909. After civil war broke out, forces loyal to this leader entered the city on 18 May 1911 under Eugenio Aviña. Insurgents under Juan José Ríos took control of the city between 1914 and 1916, beginning a series of social and economic reforms. Venustiano Carranza was in the city in 1916. While there, he was invited by Juan José Ríos to open the public library and formalize the state&#x27;s Red Battalion.

Since then, most of the city&#x27;s history has revolved around its growth. The population is expected to grow by 38,000 during the 2010s, with job growth of 14,000 and 44,000 more cars on the road. Problems that the city faces now include transit problems, unregulated growth, deteriorating road conditions and street lighting, the lack of public transportation, lack of public security and insufficient water treatment. The city generates eighty-seven tons of garbage every day. The municipal landfill receives about 175 tons of garbage each day. , for every 1,000 residents, there are 400 vehicles, ranking Colima third in the ratio of cars to people, down from first only a year earlier.

Unchecked urban sprawl, especially in the north and south of the city is a major environmental problem. Much of the building in the north is subdivisions which are only partially occupied. The Centro Universario de Gestión Ambiental at the University of Colima claims that there is apathy to environmental issues on the part of various levels of government.

== Geography ==

Most of the municipality is located in the Valley of Colima. About half of the municipality has rugged, mountainous terrain, most of which is on the south and southeastern sides but with an average altitude of only 550 masl. These areas are part of the areas belonging to the Colima Volcano and a set of mountains called the Cordillera Costera del Sur, which is part of the Sierra Madre del Sur, especially that of the north and northwest to the Cerro de los Gallos mesa. These mountains separate the area from the ocean.

On the north and northwest, there is a mesa area called the Cerro de los Gallos. Local peaks include Los Mezcales, Los Gallos, El Alcomún, Rincón de Galindo, Pistola Grande, Piscila, El Agostadero, La Salvia, Cerro Pelón, Piedra Ancha, Higuera Panda, Amarradero, La Yerbabuena, Peña Blanca, La Cebadilla, Tinajas, El Salto, Los Volcancillos, La Palmera, El Camichín, El Achoque, La Siempreviva, El Borrego and Copala.

Important rivers in the municipality include El Colima, Salado and the Naranjo or Coahuayana. Feeding into these rivers are streams such as El Zarco, El Astillero Salitrillos, Cardona, Colomitos and El Chico. During the rainy season, the following flow: El Manrique, La Estancia, La Cañada, Tepames, Tinajas and La Palmera.

The climate is semi-humid with rains in the summer, with an annual average temperature of between 24 and 26 °C. One exception to this is a section near the Cuauhtémoc border where the temperature is between 22 and 24°C and annual rainfall is between as opposed to the average for the rest of the municipality. Another exception are the communities of Estampilla and Las Tunas, where the climate is drier and hotter, with an average temperature of and an annual precipitation of between .

In the center, west and southeast, the dominant type of natural vegetation is low growth rainforest. About seventy-five percent of these trees shed their leaves during the dry season. The southeast also contains areas with medium-growth rainforest, which also is deciduous. Most of this forest is near the Ixtlahuacán border. In the highest elevations, south and southeast of the Tepames community, there are some localized forests of holm oak.

The growth of the city in recent decades has put severe stress on the local environment, with subdivisions clearing areas of tropical vegetation, and large quantities of garbage and wastewater improperly disposed. The Manrique River is considered the dirtiest in the state, with an estimated eight to nine tons of garbage within it. However, there have been well run reforestation programs in the municipality.

=== Climate ===
Colima has a tropical savanna climate, with consistently high temperatures and extremely dry conditions from November to May followed by heavy rainfall from June to October. The city is sometimes affected by hurricanes, which can bring up to of rain per day and lengthy periods of heavy rain.

== Gastronomy ==
Most of the traditional foods of the region of Colima are based out of corn, local fruits, pork and seafood found on the coasts near the region. Some of the most popular and representative dishes of Colima include: &quot;Sopitos&quot; Small deep fried tortillas topped with ground beef, shredded cabbage, onion, and cheese bathed in the juices where the meat has been cooked; &quot;Sopes Gordos&quot; which are medium-size, thick tortillas that are slightly pan fried, topped with refried beans and a variety meats which can include pork tenderloin, pork ribs, pork rinds or shredded chicken; &quot;Tostadas&quot; are larger tortillas that are thinned, deep fried and then topped with the same variety of meats as the &quot;Sopes Gordos&quot;; these two last dishes will also include shredded cabbage, onions, fresh tomatoes, a thin meat sauce, and shredded cheese as a garnishing.

The neighboring town of Comala characterizes itself for its wide variety of milk products and local varieties of fresh or dry cheeses, as well as for the production of sweet breads and pastries.

Colima is also known for its wide variety of fresh seafood restaurants. Some of the traditional seafood dishes include &quot;Ceviche&quot; - Ground raw fish cooked in a marinade of lime juice, garnished with shredded carrots, chopped cilantro, onions, tomatoes, jalapeño peppers and served on top of a deep fried tortilla. &quot;Pescado a la talla&quot; - A whole fish (typically red snapper) cut open and covered with a variety of chopped vegetables, and cooked wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled on top of hot coals.

There are three drinks that are very characteristics of the region: &quot;Tejuino&quot; - Thick, refreshing drink prepared with corn masa and molasses and it is served with a lot of ice, salt and lime. &quot;Tuba&quot; - A drink brought from the Philippines, is the sap from the coconut tree, which is traditionally extracted making cuts at the top of the palm tree right at the base where the coconuts grow, and it is usually topped with peanuts, almonds or freshly chopped fruits. &quot;Bate&quot; - This drink is made with chia seeds and it is served with molasses. &quot;Ponche de Comala&quot; - This is the only alcoholic drink that it is traditionally made in the region, and it is produced in the neighboring town of Comala; You can find different varieties of Ponche which can be water-based or milk-based. Water-based Ponche include pomegranate, prune, guayabilla, and the milk variety include flavors such as coffee, almonds, among others. To prepare Ponche, locally produced mezcal is used, which is locally known as &quot;Tuxca&quot;.

The region is also known for its interesting variety of sweets based out of coconut which are known as &quot;Cocadas&quot; or &quot;Alfajores&quot;. Sweets made out of tamarind, pineapple or guava as well as dehydrated plantain are also very popular.

== Archaeology ==
There are two main archeological zones in the municipality called La Campana and El Chanal. La Campana is about fifteen minutes outside of the city and is distinguished by a mound in the shape of a bell, which gives it the name. The site covers an area of about fifty hectares with only one percent explored. The site is also known for a construction style which uses rounded river stones and numerous burials.

El Chanal reached its height between 1,000 and 1,400 over an area of 120 hectares. The site has evidence of the extensive use of obsidian and metals such as copper and gold. Constructions at the site include a Mesoamerican ballcourt, the Plaza of the Altars, the Plaza of Day and Night and the Plaza of Time. Stairwells on pyramid bases often have glyphs similar to those found in central Mexico which may have a calendar function.

==Education==
The average number of years of schooling is 9.49 years, above the state average of 8.6, with men having only a slight advantage over women. (.3 years) However, there is a large gap between those in the city, with an average of 9.7 years versus those in the rural areas with an average of 5.9. The municipality has public and private schools that offer education from preschool to postgraduate. The municipality has 77 preschools, 104 primary schools, 34 secondary schools, 14 high schools and three technical schools.

University level education is available from the University of Colima, ITESM-Colima and UAP. There is also vocational training available through CONALEP and CEDART.

3.5% of the population in the city is illiterate versus 11.6% in the rural areas, for an average of about five percent.

== Transportation ==
Lic. Miguel de la Madrid Airport serves the city, it is located 22 km outside the capital, in the municipality of Cuauhtémoc. Most of the Colima airport flights go to Mexico City, with about 100,000 passengers going through the terminal in 2009.
Colima is linked to Guadalajara by a four-lane toll highway (Highway 54D).

Two companies manage the public transport: SINTRA (Sistema Integral de Transporte S.A. de C.V.) and SOCACOVA (Sociedad Cooperativa de Autotransportes Colima-Villa de Álvarez S.C.L.).

There are also government run taxi company,

There are also two bus terminals, Terminal de Transportes de Colima S.A., goes to major destinations across the state and the country, and a rural bus terminal that goes to the nearest towns.

<text>Durango, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Durango, is one of the 31 states which make up the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico, situated in the northwest portion of the country. With a population of 1,832,650, the 8th lowest of Mexico&#x27;s states, Durango has Mexico&#x27;s second-lowest population density, after Baja California Sur. The capital city, Victoria de Durango, is named after the first President of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria.
==Geography==
===General information===
The area of Durango is ; this accounts for about 6.3% of the entire territory of Mexico. It is the fourth largest state, lying at the extreme northwest of the Central Mexican Plateau, where it meets the Sierra Madre Occidental—the highest peaks in the state. The state has an average elevation of 1,775 meters above sea level, with a mean elevation of 1,750 m in the Valleys region and 2,450 m in the Sierra region. The city of Durango is on the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental, with an elevation of 1,857 m.

Durango is landlocked, bordered by Chihuahua, Coahuila, Zacatecas, Nayarit and Sinaloa. It is divided into 39 municipalities, based on the 1917 Constitution of Mexico, and several additional divisions have been made since.

The Sierra Madre Occidental blocks moisture from the Pacific Ocean, impacting the local climate of the state. Las Quebradas region, located over the mountain chain and on the northwest of the state, has a humid subtropical climate. Excepting the highest elevations, the rest of the state has semi-arid and temperate climates. It is hot and dry in the East, with some temperate areas existing at higher elevations.

Most of the state is mountainous and heavily forested, with the Sierra Madre Occidental covering around two-thirds of the state. Like much of northern Mexico, the state has worked to reforest the degraded forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental. Reforesting efforts have focused on replanting native tree species, versus those used for wood production. However, the tree density in many areas is still too low, especially on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental where tree poaching and clearing for agricultural activities is problematic.

Many rivers begin in Durango, but lead into other Mexican states. Some of these rivers empty into the Pacific, or into the lake area of La Comarca, while one, the Florida, flows into the Gulf of Mexico.

===Ecological regions===
Ecologically, the state is divided into four regions: La Quebrada, the Sierra, the Valleys and the Semi-desert.

The Semi-desert (sometimes called the Bolsón de Mapimí) is located in the northeast of the state and includes the municipalities of Hidalgo, Mapimí (including the &quot;Silent Zone&quot;, Tlahualilo, San Pedro del Gallo, San Luis del Cordero, Nazas, Lerdo, Gómez Palacio, Cuencamé, Santa Clara, General Simón Bolívar and San Juan de Guadalupe. Most of the terrain here is flat and its climate is dry. Temperatures are cold in the winter and hot in the summer. These municipalities are classified as either part of the Chihuahua Desert or in the transition zone. The area is relatively flat with some mountain ranges and a slight incline towards the interior of the country. The area was at one time under the sea, but today the vegetation consists of scrub, nopal cactus, maguey plants, barrel cactus and other arid zone plants. It is defined by two rivers: the Nazas and the Aguanaval. The region has two reservoirs: the Lázaro Cárdenas (Palmito) and the Francisco Zarco (Tórtolas), located between the Cuencamé and Lerdo municipalities. Animals that can be found here include coyotes, &quot;gavilanes&quot; (sparrowhawks), various snakes, owls, chameleons, tarantulas and scorpions. Most of the economically important natural resources come from mining, including deposits of gold, silver, iron and mercury. There are also large deposits of marble.

The La Laguna is short for &quot;La Comarca de la Laguna&quot; (the region of the lake) or Comarca Lagunera (region of lakes), an arid and semi-arid region that covers a significant portion of northeastern Durango and southeastern Coahuila. The area was created by sediments from torrential river flows deposited over large valleys. These river flows also created lagoons which served to recharge underground aquifers or remain as intermittent surface waters. Originally, the rivers supported habitat for native grasses, rush and ditch reed which provided habitat for various water birds and fish.

The area is home to Durango&#x27;s only caverns. The Rosario Caves (grutas) are located near Ciudad Lerdo, as well as the Mapimí Biosphere, noted for various plants and the desert tortoise. It is a highly protected area centering on where the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango meet.

The Valleys are located in the center of the state and include the municipalities of Nombre de Dios, Durango, Nuevo Ideal, Canatlán, Guadalupe Victoria, Pánuco de Coronado, Poanas, Súchil, Vicente Guerrero, Ocampo, San Bernardo, Indé, Coneto de Comonfort, El Oro, Rodeo, San Juan del Río and Peñón Blanco. The region consists principally of river valleys and plains located among small mountain ranges. The main peaks in this area include the San Jacinto in the Silla Mountains and Peñon Blanco, which many schoolchildren in the area take trips to. Other major geographical formations in the Valleys Region include cliffs called Las Catedrales, along with those called Malpaís and La Breña, which were formed by lava flows over 250,000 hectares. The area is also home to the Cerro de Mercado which is important for its large deposit of iron.

The valleys proper are flat and suitable for farming, with irrigation from the Nazas, Florido and Tunal Rivers. Reservoirs for this purpose include the Santiaguillo, Guatimapé and Refugio Salcido. It has large areas with grass, huizache, sabinos and poplar trees. There is a shallow wetland area called the Guatimapé, or Santiguillo. It provides vital habitat for flocks of migrating birds in winter, especially cranes, geese and ducks. Around this lake, there are Mennonite communities who are noted for their cheeses and cured meats. The region also provides habitat for coyotes, rabbits, squirrels, foxes, geese and ducks. The rivers contain fish such as catfish, bass, carp and tilapia. The area also has hot springs due to tectonic activity. The best known springs are the Zape, Atotonilco and the Hervideros. The area is home to the state capital of Durango and many former haciendas that attest to the area&#x27;s agricultural history.

The Sierra region is in the west of the state. It includes the municipalities of Guanaceví, Tepehuanes, and parts of Santiago Papasquiaro, Topia, Canelas, Otáez, Tamazula, San Dimas, Pueblo Nuevo, Mezquital, Durango, Ocampo and San Bernardo. The terrain is rugged with freezing temperatures in the winter and snow in the higher elevations. There is also a rainy season in the summer. The vegetation in the Sierra region is mostly pine–oak forest, consisting of pines, oak, cedar, and strawberry trees as well as grasslands. The fauna includes deer, pumas, coyotes, foxes, badgers and wild turkeys. Fish such as bass and catfish are found in the rivers, along with various species of birds and reptiles. Most of the state&#x27;s rivers originate in the mountains of this region.

Las Quebradas is found in the far west of the state, including parts of Mezquital, Pueblo Nuevo, San Dimas, Otáez, Santiago Papasquiaro, Tamazula, Topia, Canelas and Tepehuanes. The region is subdivided by the rugged, western flank of the Sierra Madre. The terrain features deep ravines, canyons and fast-flowing rivers. The Humaya, Tamazula, Los Remedios, Piaxtla, Presidio, and Baluarte rivers flow west to the Pacific through the state of Sinaloa. Further south, the Acaponeta, San Pedro Mezquital, and Huaynamota rivers flow southwest through the state of Nayarit. The region, especially its ravines and canyons, is hot and humid. It receives the most rainfall in the state. There is greater diversity of flora and fauna in its rainforests compared to the desert regions of the state. Animal species include pumas, white-tailed deer, armadillos, badgers, iguanas and a large number of bird species. At higher elevations, between 600 and 1200 meters, the vegetation changes to pine forests and the climate is more temperate. This area has had the most human habitation and agriculture.

When the Jesuits arrived to the Quebradas, they introduced the grazing of cattle and large-scale farming of corn, sugar cane and fruit trees. In the hotter and wetter areas, they introduced bananas, cherimoyas, guavas, zapotes, plums, avocados, oranges and other types of citrus. However, the difficulty of crossing the mountains to the more prosperous Valleys region limited the economy here.

Las Quebradas has mineral deposits, principally silver with some gold. Most of these deposits are found in an area that extends from the Humaya River to San Diego. During the 18th century, a number of royal mines were in operation here. They have been worked intermittently since them, with the last major activity in the late 19th and early 20th century. The deposits attracted Europeans, displacing the native Acaxes, Xiximes and other indigenous groups, whose numbers fell with the introduction of European diseases. Many of the towns in this area including Félix de Tamazula, Valle de Topia, Santa Veracruz de Topia, Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Siánori, Santa María de Otáez and San José de Canelas began as mining towns.

The mountains over 3,000 meters above sea level are dominated by dramatic landscapes, including waterfalls, old-growth pine forests and ravines, such as the Basís Quebrada on the Presidio River. The sinkholes and rock formations, such as the El Espinazo del Diablo, are visible from the old highway to Mazatlan. It is one of the most representative landscapes of northwest Mexico. Cerro Gordo is the highest point in the state and is considered sacred to both the Tepehuanes and the Huichol people. This area is home to the La Michilía Biosphere Reserve, which is a pioneer for the reintroduction of the critically endangered Mexican grey wolf.

The Tecuan National Forest is in the Quebradas.

==Economy==
As a rural state, traditional agriculture is still the main economic activity for most of the population, despite only ten percent of the land being suitable for crops, and only fifteen percent being suitable for pasture. The main crops include corn, beans, chilli peppers, apples, alfalfa, and sorghum. Fruits such as apples and pears are grown in Canatlán, Nuevo Ideal and Guatimapé; nuts in Nazas and San Juan del Rio; and membrillo, apricots and peaches in Nombre de Dios. Most agriculture is concentrated in the Valleys region, in particular, the municipalities of Guadalupe Victoria and Poanas. This is also the area with the highest profit agriculture. It is supported by its three main rivers: the Florida, the Alto Nazas, and the Tunal-Mezquital, which have been dammed primarily for agricultural purposes. Pastures in this area support large herds of cattle, much of which are exported to the United States. Sheep and goats are also raised here.

Despite its dry climate, another important agricultural area has been the La Laguna region. Cotton was the main commodity crop of the La Laguna from the late 19th century to the 1970s. While some cotton and other crops such as alfalfa, wheat, grapes, sorghum and corn are grown, it is limited to areas along the Nazas and Aguanaval rivers that provide irrigation. Most of the agricultural land is in the municipalities of Gómez Palacios, Lerdo and Tlahualilo, part of the Lagunera region. Tlahualilo is also known for the production of watermelon and other melons. The rest of the land is too dry. Livestock is another important activity raising sheep, goats, cattle and chickens.

In 1936, Mexican president Lázaro Cárdenas expropriated 225 profitable haciendas in the La Laguna region to create agricultural collectives called &quot;ejidos.&quot; However, this effort failed to significantly improve life for poor farmers in the region, often due to a lack of knowledge and technology, especially in the redistribution of water. The failure of this effort exacerbated the effects of droughts leading to crises in the 1950s and 1960s, only overcome with massive federal investment in hydraulic infrastructure, public works and industrialization. However, the effects of these works still have negative consequences for the La Laguna region.

In the Sierra and Quebrada regions, most agriculture is subsistence for auto-consumption. Important crops include corn, beans, potatoes and oats. The Sierra is an important dairy producer, with its cheese notable in the state. In Las Quebradas, rivers are an important source of fish, especially trout and catfish.

Today, forestry has great importance economically and politically. About 41% of the territory is covered in forest with under five percent covered in rainforest. The state ranks second in Mexico in expanses of temperate forest land areas with 4.9 million ha. It is the country&#x27;s main timber producer and the largest timber stock, estimated at 410,833,340 m3. Its output accounts to between 20 and 30% of Mexico&#x27;s total, producing mostly pine (73.3%) and oak. Although 18 municipalities have forestry operations, six account for just under 80% of the production. Most of the economy of the Sierra region revolves around forestry, including the sawmills and other wood processing facilities located there. Wood products from there are sold both in Durango and other parts of Mexico. They include plywood, furniture, shipping crates for agricultural products as well as pulp for paper. Most of this wood is pine but cedar is also cut in some areas of the Quebradas. Most forest land in the state is held by collectives called ejidos, but these have trouble competing with cheaper imported timber.

Minerals were the initial draw to the area for the Spanish, the heyday for this activity was the 18th century as most of the state&#x27;s historical landmarks can attest. However, mining continues to be an important economic activity. Durango is one of Mexico&#x27;s leading producers of gold. There are deposits of gold and silver in the Sierra region, San Dimas, Otáez and Topia. The Valleys region has deposits of gold, silver, iron and mercury.

Most of the state&#x27;s commerce is related to agriculture and mining.

Gomez Palacio is home to most of the state&#x27;s industry. There are factories which make cars, textiles, clothes, soap, oils, cookies, pasta and more. Food process, especially of chicken and dairy is important here as well.

Durango&#x27;s main source of income from outside the state starting in the mid-20th century has been with the production of films. The first known filming in the state occurred when Thomas Edison sent producer James White and cameraman Fred Bleckynden here to film train rides, along with landscapes and scenes of daily life in 1897. The project produced six films, each fifty feet long and included bullfights, women washing clothes, road repair and the arrival of the train in the city of Durango. The first movie set was constructed in 1922 in the former La Trinidad hacienda just outside the city of Durango, which made three movies.

In 1954, 20th century Fox filmed the movie &quot;White Feather&quot; (La Ley del Bravo) with Robert Wagner and Debra Paget. It was the first Hollywood feature to be shot in the state, followed closely by &quot;Robber&#x27;s Roost&quot; (Antro de ladrones) by United Artists. The two films mark the beginning of a movie industry that continues to the present day, although its heyday was in the 1960s and 1970s. The attractions for Hollywood here were the landscapes and the lighting. The first are similar to those of the Old West and the latter due to the climate. From 1954 to 1964, thirteen major productions were shot here and attracted stars such as Burt Lancaster, Audrey Hepburn, Charlton Heston, Maureen O&#x27;Hara and John Wayne who worked on films directed by the likes of John Huston and Sam Peckinpah. Between 1965 and 1973, John Wayne alone worked on seven films including the &quot;Sons of Katie Elder&quot;. During the 1970s a total of 86 films was shot here. Forty-three were U.S. productions; 33 were Mexican productions and nine where collaborations between the two countries.

To date, over 130 films have been shot here both because of the Western-type landscapes and the natural light. The state is still called La Tierra del Cine (Land of the Cinema) although movie production here has waned with the decline of westerns starting in the 1980s. Many of the old sets are still standing, if not used, and some have been converted into tourist attractions, and one has been converted into a real town.

Tourism is a small industry here, despite the state&#x27;s natural resources and history. The government has worked to promote the state for tourism, but this is concentrated mostly on the capital (including the movie sets around the city), two other towns in the state and to some extent, ecotourism.

There are many historic and tourist sites in the Valleys region, in particular in the city of Durango. The San Juan del Rio municipality has the house in which Francisco Villa was born. There are several important architectural sites in the city, including the Ganot-Peschard Museum of Archeology, which is recognized by the National Institute of Anthropology and History as a site of historical significance. In Súchil, the former hacienda of El Mortero was the home of the Count of the Valley of Súchil and is one of the state&#x27;s major examples of colonial architecture. The town of Mapimí has conserved its traditional urban layout which has permitted it to become a Pueblo Mágico. The most important mine is Ojuela, now famous for its hanging bridge which connects the town with the mine, separated by an extremely deep ravine. It one of the largest of its kind in the Americas. Nazas has a house that Benito Juárez slept in while he was here.

Probably the best-known tourist product of the state relates to scorpions. In the 1980s, a number of entrepreneurs turned the animal into an unofficial symbol of state pride. Most are sold encased in acrylic and mounted on knickknacks such as ashtrays, napkin holders, keychains, earrings, wood boxes and wall mountings. These objects dominate tourist markets such as the Gomez market in Durango City.

One reason for the limited economic development has been the limited transportation and other communications. The railroad was an important development in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but its benefits did not extend far past where the lines went. The state has one international airport serving the capital, which has limited flights to other major Mexican cities and to the United States. However, its geographical position is becoming a benefit, rather than a hindrance to economic development, with its proximity both to Mexico City and the northern border as well as both coasts.

As the nearest seaport, trade and travel to Mazatlan have always been important to the state. The port has been a source for luxury goods since the colonial period, generally paid for with silver mined in the state. The Interoceanic Highway now connects the state with both coasts, and cuts travel time to three hours, less than half what it was before.

==Demographics==

=== Largest cities===
==Culture==

Durango is a rural state. It is sparsely populated. The three main cities contain almost 65% of the total population (Durango – 35%, Gomez Palacio 20.1% and Lerdo 8.6%). The remaining 35% of the population is scattered among 37 small urban centers and 5,757 villages of less than 2,500 inhabitants. Ninety-one percent of these have less than 250 residents. The state is associated with elements of the wild frontier: banditry, Revolutionary battles, mining and drug traffic. It claims to be the birthplace of Francisco Villa.

For its history, Durango has been both a frontier and central Mexican entity, especially the city. During the colonial period, Durango eventually became one of the main cities of New Spain in part because it was both part of the center and periphery of the territory. One distinction the city has from other colonial cities is that it was not founded on or near a former indigenous population center. The indigenous here were (and are) distinct from those in the center and south culturally.

True to its dangerous reputation, the best-known animal of the state is the scorpion. The sting was possibly fatal in the past but the availability of antidote today makes this very rare. One reason why the creatures are so abundant is that the Sierra Madre Occidental make for perfect breeding grounds. Most scorpions range in size from one to twelve centimeters but a 17-centimeter one was found in 1963. Images of the animal appear drawn or etched into a variety of objects, but since the 1980s, the city of Durango has promoted souvenirs which have real dead scorpions encased in plastic. The arachnids are also cooked and served as a delicacy in markets such as Gomez in the capital. However, they were not traditionally eaten. Durango&#x27;s soccer team is called the Scorpions.

The state likes to promote itself as the &quot;Tierra del Cine&quot; (Land of the Movies) due to its history of the making of Hollywood western. Today, some film and TV is still shot here.

===Indigenous peoples===

Although a number of the state&#x27;s indigenous ethnicities disappeared with the coming of the Spanish, there are still a significant amount residing in the state, most still speaking Uto-Azteca languages. The four main ethnicities are Tepehuans (North and South), Huichols, Tarahumaras and Mexicaneros. The Mexicaneros speak Nahuatl. The Coras and Huichols speak languages named after their groups and are fairly closely related to Nahuatl. The Tepehuano and Tarahumara languages are of the Pima branch. Language preservation varies from communities in which the language dominates to those in which only vestiges remain.

The Southern Tepehuans are the largest indigenous group in Durango. The name comes from Nahuatl and means &quot;masters of the hills&quot; or possibly &quot;conquerors in battle.&quot; The Tepehuans call themselves &quot;o&#x27;dam&quot;, which means &quot;those who inhabit.&quot; Indigenous resistance to Spanish colonization was particularly fierce there in the north. Eventually, Spanish might forced many to flee into the rugged mountains, where most of the indigenous communities still reside. It was this process that led to the northern and southern branches of the Tepehuan communities. Main Southern Tepehuan communities include Santa María de Ocotán, San Francisco, Teneraca, Taxicarinaga, San Bernardino de Milpillas and Lajas.

The Tepehuan religion is a syncretism of indigenous and Catholic beliefs. The most important type of ceremony is the or , which centers on dance around a bonfire accompanied by one-stringed instruments. They are most common at the beginning and end of the agricultural cycle. For patron saint days, cattle are usually sacrificed for feasting, accompanied by the dance of the Matachines and violin music.

The second-largest indigenous group in Durango is the Huichol. Their communities are found on the edges of the state that border with Nayarit and Jalisco, where the Huichol are more numerous. The Huichol here identify with those in the other states, there is no separation.

The Mexicaneros are the remnants of the indigenous brought by the Spanish from central Mexico to colonize the region. Today, only a small number survive in the communities of San Agustín de Buenaventura and San Pedro Jícaras in the municipality of Mezquital. This is a mixed ethnic zone and they live near groups of Tepehuanos and Huichols who have traditionally been their enemies. Their presence as a community was practically unknown until the academic work of Honrad T. Preuss in the late 19th century. More recent studies of the people have been carried out by Neyra Patricia Alvarado.

The Tarahumaras are mostly in the state of Chihuahua but there are communities in the far north of Durango. The Coras have some presence in communities near the Northern Tepehuanos, although they are more numerous in Nayarit and Jalisco. The Northern Tepehuanos are profoundly religious but language and culture is not significantly different from those in the south.

===Handcrafts===
The craft items of the state are very similar to those of Zacatecas and Chihuahua. Most of the items made are utilitarian and ceremonial. They are less known compared to those of the middle and south of the country. Many craft items are still important to local cultures and identities.

The most widespread and developed handcraft in the state is pottery, found in just about all of the territory. All of the indigenous groups produce pottery, almost all for utilitarian and ceremonial purposes. There is more modern and varied pottery and ceramics in southern Durango, especially in and around the state capital in the municipalities of Durango, Poanas and Villa Unión. Common products include flower pots, jars, pots and cazuelas (large cooking vessels). The most decorative pottery is found in and around the city proper, with techniques such as (laying small rolls or balls of clay over a pot before firing to make a raised design) and , especially in the newer generations of pottery. Pottery production is still done by hand, often using crude wheels and local deposits of clay. The clays vary by region including the kaolin found in Peñón Blanco and Cuencamé. Those found in the Guadiana Valley produce cream tones. Green, red and white clays are found all over the state depending on the other minerals found in the soil of the area.

There are a number of notable artisans who produced glazed pieces, including José Trinidad (Trino) Núñez and Rafael del Campo. Other important artisans include Margarito Palacios, Santos Vega and Catarino González. In Gómez Palacios and Ciudad Lerdo, there are some workshops doing high-fire work.

The next most-widely done work is basketry and other items made with stiff fibers. These include baskets proper, carrying nets or bags, petites, sombreros, furniture and decorative items made from ixtle, wicker, mesquite roots, reeds, pine needles, pine strips and cactus ribs.

Textile work is produced all over the state, using cotton, ixtle, and wool usually to make clothing. Cloth made with both backstrap and pedal looms are found frequently, but the most-commonly made items are knitted. Embroidery is also widespread.

Indigenous crafts include embroidered clothing, household utensils, farm tools and ceremonial objects. The Huichols are noted for the making of sombreros, carrying bags, and items adorned with beads. They also make some items with wood and clay. Huichol handcrafts are distinguished by the use of symbols from their cosmology and include pottery, embroidery, yarn paintings and beadwork. The Tepehuans make bows and arrows, sombreros, traditional clothing and baskets. The Tarahumara make bows and stone-tipped arrows, ceramics, flutes and drums. The Mexicaneros and Southern Tepehuanos are noted for the making of morrales (carrying bags) with geometric designs. The Tarahumara and Northern Tepehuanes are noted for baskets made with pine strips, as well as those made from palm fronds and cane.

Leatherwork includes bags, wallets, belts, cigarette cases, briefcases, books and saddles. The working of volcanic stone (cantera) almost died out but has experienced something of a comeback. The work has a history from the colonial period when the first craftsmen arrived to work on the Cathedral. The main volcanic stone in Durango is white. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, the Montoya family, headed by brothers Jesús and Matías, then Benigno and Francisco, come from Troncoso, Zacatecas to work with the local stone. Today, there are about a dozen workshops in and around the city. Cabinetry and furniture-making is a dying art but can still be found in the Durango municipality. Major producers of traditional wares include the Pescador family and Saúl García Franco. Some communities make cartonería and fireworks items for festivas such as toritos, castillos and Judas effigies.

=== Other aspects of the culture ===
Juárez University sponsors the School of Painting, Sculpture and Handcrafts which teaches both fine and folk art. Handcraft instruction includes textiles, ceramics and glasswork. The glasswork includes delicate flower vases, glassware and multicolored decorative wall hangings.

Much of the state&#x27;s cuisine is based on corn, although wheat products such as flour tortillas and various breads are readily found. Beef is important but pork dishes are also common. As much of Durango has a colder climate, especially in the higher elevations, soups are popular as a main as well as a first course. While relatively isolated from central Mexico, there is strong influence here from that region.

One of the best known dishes, caldillo duranguense, is essentially a hearty beef soup with roasted green chili peppers. Gorditas are a particularly popular and important food historically, as they were a mainstay for field hands who found the pockets of corn or wheat convenient for carrying and eating meats and sauce outside of the home. Although found in other parts of Mexico, tacos de tripe (intestines) are particularly popular here. Asado rojo de puerco, known as asado de boda in other parts of north-central Mexico is popular. Tamales are popular but they are smaller and have more meat than those made further south. Moles are popular as well. There is barbacoa, but the meat used is as often beef as it is the mutton used farther south. Popular northern dishes include machaca as well as burritos, influence from neighboring Chihuahua. During Lent population (most Catholics) tend to lean toward vegetarian dishes with or without cheese, as fish is not common in the diet of this landlocked state. Local specialties include pinole, which is best known in Santiago Papasquiaro.

The raising of cattle in various parts leads to the making of a variety of cheeses. Some, like manchego and asadero, are available in other parts of the north, but local varieties such as queso ranchero are also consumed. Concentrated sweet paste made from quince is often called cajeta (used for a milk product in other parts of Mexico) as well as the more common name of ate. Other traditional sweets are similar to those found in central Mexico.

The most important secular celebration of the state is the Durango State Fair (Feria de Durango) which has occurred each year since 1948. The first fair queen was crowned in 1950. The most important annual events in the Semi-desert region are the municipal fairs of Gómez Palacio, Mapimí and Santa Ana in Nazas. In the Valleys region the most important annual events are the Apple Festival in Canatlán and the Nut Festival in San Juan del Rio. Important religious observances include those in La Sauceda in Canatlán, El Nayar, La Sierra de Gampon in Guadalupe Victoria and El Tizonazo in Indé. In the Sierra region, most towns observe the feast days of their patron saint with plays based on Biblical stories. Celebrations related to Christmas and the New Year are also important.

In Quebradas, patron saint days are important and often feature indigenous music. The Tepehuans continue the tradition of the mitote, a kind of ceremonial dance, three times per year: in February to ask for health, in May to call the rains and in October to celebrate the first harvests of corn. Those of Mexica, Huicholes and Tarahumara also conserve many aspects of their traditional dance and music.

Traditional music ranges from the purely indigenous to that from Europe, often with mixtures. The state has produced a number of noted musicians including composer Silvestre Revueltas, concert pianist Ricardo Castro, composer and musician Alberto M. Alvarado and contralto Fanny Anitúa. The oldest popular music in the region consists of jarabes and sones which can be found in other parts of Mexico. After 1840, new musical forms came to the state including polkas, shottises, gavotas, redovas, waltzes and other forms from Central Europe. They were first introduced to the upper classes but were adopted by others to eventually form much of northern Mexican music. The first locally produced variations included polkas such as El Revolcadero, Las Virginias, Las Cacerolas and El Jaral as well as shottis called Amor de Madre. The most noted local musician is Alberto M. Alvarado, who was active during the late 19th and early 20th century. His waltz, Recuerdo, is considered emblematic of the state at that time. He also composed works with patriotic themes such as Cuauhtémoc, Corazón Latino and Danza Yaqui. During the Revolution, corridos became popular such as Adelita, La Rielera and Carabina Treinta Treinta by Benjamín Argumedo. These became the basis for the latter narcocorridos which portray the activities of drug traffickers. Mestizo dance and music includes polkas, which became established here during the Mexican Revolution. In the center and south of the state a traditional dance called the choti can be found. The best known of these include El Amor de Madre, El Revolcadero, Los Arbolitos and El Senderito.

Bullfighting was a popular spectator sport for many years. Cockfights are still popular in the state as well as horse racing in rural areas. Many of these occur during fairs and patron saint days. Until the popularity of sports from the United States such as baseball, the most popular sport in the state was a Basque game called rebote often played against the walls of the Catheral in Durango until this was banned in 1769. Courts were constructed on the outskirts of town and remained popular until about the mid-20th century.

Sister cities include Durango, Colorado and Durango, Spain which was arranged in 1984.

==History==
===Conquest and colonial period===

Durango sits on a corridor that linked central Mexico with the northwest. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area had attracted migration into it by Huichols, Coras, Tepehuanos and Tarahumaras. These were sedentary people whose spread was checked by hostility from nomadic tribes. The eastern edge of the state was dominated by Chichimecas (particularly the Zacatecos and Caxcanes) and various tribes of the Laguna region, which were distinguished by their informal social structure and nudity.

Durango was the center of a colonial entity called Nuevo Vizcaya or sometimes México del Norte (Northern Mexico). It included all or part of what are now Durango, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Sonora and Arizona. The diocese also included all or part of New Mexico, Colorado, Coahuila, Texas, Zacatecas, California and Baja California.

The first Spaniard in this area was José de Angulo who arrived to the Sierra de Topia in 1532. The next expedition into the area occurred in 1552 under Ginés Vázques de Mercado, arriving to where the city of Durango is now, naming the area the Guadiana Valley after an area in Spain with a similar environment. The Cerro de Mercado is named after him, and the city is named after Durango in Spain. Other explorers such as Nuño de Guzmán, Alvar Cabeza de Vaca and Juan de Tapia realized expeditions but were not successful in establishing a permanent presence. However, the expedition of Cabeza de Vaca gave rise to the myth of the cities of gold and silver called Cibola and Quivira. The other expeditions would give rise to claims to the area by Jalisco and Michoacán.

The Spanish left the area alone for a time but the discovery of silver and other metals in Zacatecas in 1546 renewed interest in the area. Francisco de Ibarra was sent northwest from Zacatecas by his uncle Diego de Ibarra and the viceroy. Ibarra worked to conquer and hold the territory from 1554 to 1567. After being named conqueror and governor in 1562, Ibarra settle in San Juan (del Río) and constructed a fort. From here he directed the discovery and exploitation of various mines in the state. He divided the new territory into six provinces: Guadiana, Copala, Maloya, Chiametla, Sinaloa and Santa Barbara, naming a head of government for each. Holding the land proved difficult, with Ibarra needing to reconquer areas especially in the outer periphery of Nuevo Vizcaya both because of indigenous attacks as well as the rugged terrain. Much of the territory would not be subdued until late in the 18th century.

The city of Durango was officially established on July 8, 1563 with a mass celebrated by Brother Diego de Cadena where 5 de Febrero and Juarez Streets are now. It was founded specifically to be the capital of Nueva Vizcaya, near both to the new mines and the royal road connecting Mexico City and points north. The name Durango comes from Ibarra&#x27;s hometown for some time the city was called Durango and Guadiana interchangeably.

It is distinct from cities further north as it was laid out when Philip II&#x27;s Ordenanzas and Descubrimiento y Población order was still in effect. The cathedra began as the parish church, which was made with adobe with a straw roof (the last church of this construction is found in Ocotán, Durango). However, it burned down in the colonial period, leading to the construction of the current structure over time.

Most of the other colonial period towns were founded as missions and or as mining centers. The first mining towns were Pánuco and Avino established in 1562. El Mezquital was founded in 1588. In 1597, the town of Santiago Papasquiaro and the mission of Santa Catarina de Tepehuanes was founded. Cuencamé was founded in 1598.

The first hospital in the state, Hospital de Caridad, was founded in 1588 in Nombre de Dios. The first hospital in the capital was the Hospital de San Cosme y San Damián, founded in 1595, the same year that the first school, the Colegio de Gramática, was founded.

The Spanish began the process of consolidating their power by the establishment of missions. The first was a Franciscan mission in Nombre de Dios in 1558. After, missions were established in Peñol (Peñón Blanco), San Juan Bautista del Río, Analco, Indé, Topia, La Sauceda, Cuencamé and El Mezquital. The Jesuits joined the Franciscans starting in 1590 and both orders began organizing the territory using Spanish norms. Later missions spread to Mapimí, Santiago Papasquiaro, Tepehuanes, Guanaceví, Santa María del Oro, Tamazula, Cerro Gordo (Villa Ocampo) and San Juan de Bocas (Villa Hidalgo). Originally the territory was under the archdiocese of Guadalajara, but it proved too difficult to administer the large territory. In 1620, Pope Paul V established a new archdiocese in the city of Durango, with Gonzalo de Hermosillo as the first archbishop.

The city was officially recognized as such in 1631, receiving its coat-of-arms; however, it almost disappeared during the early colonial period. The indigenous of the area resisted Spanish domination from the beginning. In 1606, the Acaxes rebelled against the Spanish due to their enslavement to work in mines. The first century of Spanish occupation saw large rebellions by the Tepehuans and Tarahumaras. These continued into most of the 17th century and the Tarahumaras continued into the century after that. The Tepehuan uprising of 1616, the most significant uprising of this time period. It almost caused the abandonment of the capital city, with the government moving to Parral for a time, but in the end, the Tepehuan were forced to flee into the mountains, dividing the ethnicity into north and south. The conquest of New Vizcaya was formally finished with the signing of several treaties with indigenous groups in 1621 and 1622. Durango city did not start growing again until 1680. This was because the mines in Parral had started to give out and the violence had been reduced enough by Spanish authorities. By the late 17th century, the city was ringed by haciendas, especially for sheep, which helped support the city.

The subduing of the local native peoples did not completely end indigenous hostilities. In the 18th century Apaches and Comanches migrated in, being displaced by what is now the United States. Their attacks on towns and haciendas continues well into the late 19th century. Despite these difficulties, Durango was a base for the conquest and settlement of points north including Saltillo, Chihuahua and Parral into what is now Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, along with numerous other communities on the Pacific coast from Nayarit into California.

Durango&#x27;s economic heyday came in the 18th century, when mines such as Guanaceví, Cuencamé and San Juan del Río began to produce in 1720. The first major mine owner of the era was José del Campo Soberrón y Larrea, who built a palatial residence for himself in the city of Durango in 1776 and received the title of Count of the Valley of Suchil. Starting in the second half of the 18th century, more mines came online. The next major mine owner was Juan José Zambrano, whose mines in Guarizamay did not earn him a noble title but did give him political power in the area. He constructed the second major palatial residence of the city of Durango. However, Zambrano&#x27;s activities were curtailed by the problems caused by the American Revolution and other wars disrupting commerce with England, leading to shortages of mercury, essential for the extraction of silver.

In 1778, the Spanish government opened up trade in more Pacific ports, including Mazatlan, which had an economic benefit to Durango. Not only did products from the area have an outlet, incoming merchandise destined for Chihuahua and Zacatecas passed through the area. This attracted business people including foreign ones from Germany, England, France and Spain who built large businesses here in the 19th century.

During its height, Durango City&#x27;s religious and cultural culture rivaled that of continental Europe even being a center for Italian liturgical music despite its isolation. The Durango Cathedral has one of the larger collections of 18th-century cathedral music in the America, roughly comparable to those in Oaxaca and Bogotá, but smaller than that of Mexico City. Much of the work is that of José Bernardo Abella Grijalva and most shows Italian influence. The historic center of the city and a number of haciendas reflect its 18th-century colonial heritage.

===19th century===
During Mexico&#x27;s War of Independence, Nuevo Vizcaya began to break up. The first divisions were the creation of the states of Chihuahua and Durango, with Santiago Baca Ortiz as the first governor of the state of Durango along with the separation of the Sinaloa province, which included Sonora and Arizona. The state of Coahuila was separated shortly thereafter. With the 1824 Constitution the states of Durango and Chihuahua were created. Mining was depressed at the time, and the governor negotiated with the English to explore deposits of iron on the Cerro de Mercado. The English constructed installations such as those in Piedras Azules (La Ferrería) to process iron ore. These required large quantities of charcoal, which led to mass deforestation in the area. This eventually made the plant unviable.

Public education was first established in the state in 1824. The first secular institute of higher education in the state was the Colegio Civil y la Academia de Juisprudencia founded in 1833.

The northeast of the state had problems industrializing mostly due to incursions by Apaches into Durango which began in 1832 and later Comanches. Attacks by Comanches remain a major problem until the 1850s, forcing haciendas and textile mills to build walls around them. Counter-attacks on the Comanches diminished their raids, but they did not stop completely until the 1880s.

The rise of the state&#x27;s second economic and political center, the cities of Gómez Palacio and Lerdo began in the 19th century, when cotton began to be planted along the Nazcas River. This cotton production became important, with sales of the raw material to Mexico City and to European textile mills, especially in England. Large-scale production began in the mid-century, dominating the local economy by the 1870s. Textile production also began here, although shortly after this industry would shift to Torreon. Other textile mills were established in areas such as Tunal, Santiago Papasquiaro, Poanas and Peñon Blanco, but the lack of coal meant that power had to be provided by nearby rivers, which was not efficient enough. This and attacks during the Mexican Revolution brought the demise of the textile industry in the state. Many mills and cotton haciendas eventually wound up in the hands of American investors.

The civil war between liberals and conservatives had the state controlled by liberal forces in 1858, then by conservative ones from 1864 to 1866.

In the late 19th century, rail and telegraph lines reached the state and revitalized Gómez Palacio and Lerdo as industrial centers. The railroad connected the city of Durango with Mexico City and the US border, allowing for shipment of local goods, particularly those from mining, to national and foreign markets. Agriculture and livestock production increased with the end of Comanche insurgencies and the arrival of a train line in 1892 gave the city a new connection with the rest of Mexico. It directly connected the city with Piedras Negras, Coahuila allowing the export of iron ore to foundries in Monclova, where coal was abundant. In 1902, a branch of the railroad reached Tepehuanes, allowing for the exploitation of natural resources in the northwest of the state.

However, the city of Durango remained the political center of the state as well as the regional commercial center for agricultural and handcrafted products. Mayors of the city at this time concentrated on improving infrastructure, such as government buildings, hospitals, water supply lines and public streets. The population of the city grew during this time.

===20th century to the present===

While the state received high amounts of investment leading to economic development in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries, the benefits were mostly to foreign enterprises, often given permission to operate on indigenous lands and other rural communities. By 1910, North Americans own just about the entire southwest Sierra Madre Occidental region of the state or 65% of the land of the entire state. These areas have the highest concentrations of mining and timber resources.

Durango was one of the areas active during the Mexican Revolution. The first uprising in the state occurred on November 19, 1910 in Gómez Palacio. Various revolutionary leaders were from here and/or used the state as a base of operations including Francisco Villa, Calixto Contreras, Severingo Cenceros, J. Agustín Castro and Oreste Pereyra, especially in the La Lagunera region. The Division del Norte had a base in the Hacienda de la Loma to unite forces in Durango and Chihuahua.

The economic effects on the state were profound. There was a mass exodus of foreigners and a loss of production in both haciendas and factories. On June 18, 1913, insurgents took the city of Durango, burning businesses here. The war led to economic depression that lasted for decades. After the war, there was a process of land redistribution that lasted several decades, but it did not affect the largest land holdings on the most productive of lands. After the Revolution, large land holdings were broken up into ejidos under governor Enrique R. Calderón, particularly in the Comarca Lagunera de Durango. During the same time the municipalities of Mapimí and Goméz Palacio were split off from the municipality of Tlahualilo.

Despite Durango&#x27;s support during the Revolution, the new government had trouble controlling the state as late as the 1930s as it resisted federal modernization efforts. The questions of land reform and education were central to Durango&#x27;s discontent during this time period. Between 1926 and 1936, militias were formed to participate in the Cristero War and other uprisings such as the Escobar Military Revolt in 1929. One major point of contention was the government&#x27;s efforts to take the church out of secular life, especially education, which threatened centuries-old ways of life, especially for many farmers and villagers. These rebellions were strongest in the center and south of the state, including the capital of Victoria de Durango. Rebel activity in parts of Mezquital were such that secular teachers were withdrawn for a time.

In the mid-20th century, several institutions of higher education were established, including universities and institutes of technology. This included the establishment of the UJED at the former Jesuit college in the city of Durango.

The two newest municipalities were established in the latter 20th century. Vicente Guerrero was split from Suchil and the last, Nuevo Ideal, was created in 1989.

The destruction of Durango&#x27;s city center during the Mexican Revolution led to development outside of it. The first neighborhood, Colonia Obrera, was established near the rail line just outside what was the city proper. It was the first of various neighborhoods to follow these lines. The population grew noticeably in the 1960s and 1970s mostly due to migration from rural areas, increasing urban sprawl to 1,058 hectares. One major factor of this growth was the droughts of this time on agricultural production as well as expectations of industrial development. About the same time, the city government started efforts to regulate this growth.

The growth of the cities has prompted projects in infrastructure, especially in transportation from the latter 20th century to the present. Industrial parks such as Durango and Gomez Palacio were established. The most recent projects have an eye towards connecting the state better to participate in the global economy. In the 20th century, the Pan American highway was built through here (known today as Highway 45). However, a later reconstruction of the highway shifted it east into Zacatecas. This meant that any industrial progress in the state happened in the northern city of Gomez Palacios, and not in the capital. In the 1980s, highways to Gomez Palacios and Ciudad Juarez were modernized, and a highway to Torreón and Monterrey was built. The InterOceanic Highway, which crosses the north of Mexico to connect the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean is Highway 40. The most important leg of this highway for Durango is that which connects it from the capital to Mazatlán, Sinaloa. It cut the drive time between to two places to four hours, replacing a winding mountain road plagued by bandits for many decades. The centerpiece of this highway is the Baluarte Bridge, one of the highest suspension bridges in the world. Pride in this construction can be seen in the city of Durango, with a replica of the bridge found to the side of the Guadiana Park.

Durango has historically been an area associated with banditry and smuggling. Durango is part of the &quot;golden triangle&quot; of Mexico&#x27;s drug trade. Most of the violence is due to turf battles between the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels. The 2000s were a particularly difficult time as this was during Felipe Calderon&#x27;s efforts to combat the drug cartels and for a time Joaquin Guzman (&quot;El Chapo&quot;) hid out in the state. Most of the violence was in relation to control over the drug routes here. Drug-related violence was a major problem, with hundreds of bodies found in clandestine graves, around the city of Durango in particular. The violence reached a peak here between 2009 and 2011. Highway robberies were also a particular problem, especially on the highway leading to Mazatlan, then considered the most dangerous in Mexico. A new toll highway was built and opened at the end of this period to combat this.

<text>The State of Mexico, officially just Mexico, is one of the 32 federal entities of Mexico. Commonly known as Edomex (from ), to distinguish it from the name of the whole country, it is the most populous state and the second most densely populated.

Located in central Mexico, the state is divided into 125 municipalities. The state capital city is Toluca de Lerdo (&quot;Toluca&quot;), while its largest city is Ecatepec de Morelos (&quot;Ecatepec&quot;). The State of Mexico surrounds Mexico City on three sides. It borders the states of Querétaro and Hidalgo to the north, Morelos and Guerrero to the south, Michoacán to the west, and Tlaxcala and Puebla to the east.

The territory now comprising the State of Mexico once formed the core of the pre-Hispanic Aztec Empire. During the Spanish colonial period, the region was incorporated into New Spain. After gaining independence in the 19th century, Mexico City was chosen as the new nation&#x27;s capital; its territory was separated from the state. Years later, parts of the state were broken off to form the states of Hidalgo, Guerrero, and Morelos. These territorial separations have left the state with the size and shape it has today, with the Toluca Valley to the west of Mexico City and a panhandle that extends around the north and east of this entity.

The demonym used to refer to people and things from the state is , distinct from (&#x27;Mexican&#x27;), which describes the people or things from the whole country.

==Origin and etymology==
&quot;Mēxihco&quot; was originally the Nahuatl name for the Valley of Mexico where the cities of the Mexica (the proper name for the Aztec Triple Alliance) were located. As such, the district that became Mexico City was properly known as Mexico-Tenochtitlan in the years shortly before and after the Spanish conquest. After the Spanish Conquest, the term &quot;México&quot; came to be used for Tenochtitlan/Mexico City and all the pre-conquest lands it controlled, including several other aforementioned states originally incorporated in the boundaries of the state of Mexico.

There are two possible origins for the name &quot;Mexico.&quot; The first is that it derives from &quot;metztli&quot; (moon) and &quot;xictla&quot; (navel) to mean &quot;from the navel of the moon&quot;. This comes from the old Aztec idea that the craters on the moon form a rabbit figure with one crater imitating a navel. The other possible origin is that it is derived from &quot;Mextictli&quot;, an alternate name for the god Huitzilopochtli.

&quot;Anáhuac&quot; was the proper term for all territories dominated by the Aztec Empire, from &quot;Cem Anáhuac&quot;, &quot;the entire earth&quot; or &quot;surrounded by waters&quot; e.g. the waters of Lake Texcoco which were considered to be the center of the Aztec world, and as such was proposed as an early name for the entire nation of Mexico prior to independence, to distinguish it from the (preexisting) administrative division of New Spain that became the State of Mexico.

==History==
===Prehistoric to Pre-Hispanic period===

The earliest evidence of human habitation in the current territory of the state is a quartz scraper and obsidian blade found in the Tlapacoya area, which was an island in the former Lake Chalco. They are dated to the Pleistocene era which dates human habitation back to 20,000 years. The first people were hunter-gatherers. Stone age implements have been found all over the territory from mammoth bones to stone tools to human remains. Most have been found in the areas of Los Reyes Acozac, Tizayuca, Tepexpan, San Francisco Mazapa, El Risco and Tequixquiac. Between 20,000 and 5000 BCE, the people here eventually went from hunting and gathering to sedentary villages with farming and domesticated animals. The main crop was corn, and stone tools for the grinding of this grain became common. Later crops include beans, chili peppers, and squash grown near established villages. Evidence of ceramics appears around 2500 BCE with the earliest artifacts of these appearing in Tlapacoya, Atoto, Malinalco, Acatzingo and Tlatilco.

In the pre-historic State of Mexico, the Tepexpan Man is an important finding for Mexican and foreign anthropologists; it is an important key to understanding what the Valley of Mexico area was like, 5,000 years ago, as well as helping establish the occupation chronology of the region. Currently, some scholars attribute an age of 11,000 years, others 8,000, and some have suggested 5,000 years old. This individual was originally identified as a male, but recent research confirms a female identity, although this is still a subject of discussion.

Sacrum bone found in Tequixquiac is considered a work of prehistoric art. These people were thought to be nomadic, hunting large animals such as mammoths and gathering fruits as evidenced by archaeological evidence found at the site. One of the most salient discoveries of primitive art in America was found in here, called the Tequixquiac Bone, which had no known purpose, but reflected the ideological sense of the artist who carved the piece of bone from a camelid around 22,000 years BCE. The first native settlers of Tequixquiac were the Aztecs and Otomi, who decided to settle here permanently for the abundance of rivers and springs. They were engaged mainly in agriculture and the breeding of domestic animals.

The earliest major civilization of the state is Teotihuacan, with the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon being built between 100 BCE and 100 CE. Between 800 and 900 CE, the Matlatzincas established their dominion with Teotenango as capital. This city is walled with plazas, terraces, temples, altars, living quarters, and a Mesoamerican ball game court. In the 15th century, the Aztecs conquered the Toluca and Chalco valleys to the west and east of the Valley of Mexico respectively. Part of the Toluca Valley was held by the Purépechas as well. Other dominions during the pre-Hispanic period include that of the Chichimecas in Tenayuca and of the Acolhuas in Huexotla, Texcotizingo and Los Melones. Other important groups were the Mazahuas in the Atlacomulco area. Their center was at Mazahuacán, next to Jocotitlán volcano. The Otomis were centered in Jilotepec.

===Spanish Colonial period===
The origin of the modern state is the reorganization of Aztec lands starting after the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire. These lands were initially called the &quot;audiencia&quot; of Mexico and included Mexico City and much of the modern states of Guerrero, Morelos, and Hidalgo. As the Spanish expanded their control west and south, the entirety was called &quot;New Spain&quot; with former Aztec lands being called &quot;Mexico&quot;. The organization of New Spain would change throughout the colonial period, but the territory of the Aztecs would keep the name &quot;Mexico&quot;.

After the Conquest in 1521, Hernán Cortés&#x27; cousin Juan Altamirano was given dominion of the Toluca Valley. Other conquistadors such as Antonio Caicedo, Juan de Jaramillo, Cristobal Hernandez, and Juan de Samano received encomiendas in the state. Franciscan missionaries came soon after such as Martin de Valencia, Juan de Tecto, Juan de Ahora, and Pedro de Gante, who established missions and the first school called San Antonio de Padua.

In 1535, the areas around Mexico City were divided into several &quot;alcaldías mayores&quot; called Chalco y Ameca, Tlayacapan y Coatepec, Otumba, Ecatepec, Sultepec, Zacualpan, Temascaltepec, Malinalco, Metepec and Ixtlahuaca with Toluca and Texcoco recognized as cities. Other orders followed such as the Dominicans, the Augustinians and the Jesuits.

During the colonial period, most of the area&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture, with some mining in the areas of Temascaltepec, Sultepec, Valle de Bravo, Tlatlaya, Amatepec, and Zacualpan and the production of pulque in Otumba and Texcoco. In addition, certain areas were known for crafts such as wool processing in Texcoco and Sultepec, soap in Toluca, saddles in Almoloya de Juárez, and rebozos in various areas. However, the vast majority of the area&#x27;s population was extremely poor due to exploitation.

=== Independence ===

During the Mexican War of Independence, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla marched into what is now Mexico State from Michoacán in 1810, passing from the northwest to Toluca on his way to Mexico City. East of Toluca, he fought royalist forces at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces on 30 October 1810. While Hidalgo won the battle, he chose not to proceed to Mexico City and then turned towards Celaya. During the rest of the War, most battles were fought between local insurgent leaders such as Manuel de la Concha and Castillo Bustamante and royalist forces. Battles were fought in Sultepec, Amanalco, Temascaltepec, Lerma, Tenango, Tenancingo and Tecualoya.

After the War, the State of Mexico was created by the 1824 Constitution, with the first state congress convening in March of that year in Mexico City. This state still encompassed the vast territory of the old Aztec Empire. The first head of the state was Melchor Múzquiz. The vast territory of the state was divided into eight districts: Acapulco, Cuernavaca, Huejutla, Mexico, Taxco, Toluca, Tula and Tulancingo. Mexico City was the capital of the state. However, soon after, the federal government chose Mexico City as the capital of the new nation. Under the guidelines of the 1824 Constitution, the capital was appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The choice was made official on 18 November 1824 and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 ac) centered on the Zocalo. This area was then separated from the State of Mexico, forcing the state&#x27;s government to move from the Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine) in the city to Texcoco. This area did not yet include the population centers of the towns of Coyoacán, Xochimilco, Mexicaltzingo and Tlalpan, all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico. As the &quot;federal district&quot; of Mexico City grew in size, these and other territories were taken from the State of Mexico. The capital of the state was moved permanently to Toluca in 1830.

The struggles between the liberals (federalists) and the conservatives (centralized power) in the 19th century affected the state, especially in those areas that would later break away to form the states of Hidalgo, Morelos, and Guerrero. During the Mexican–American War, the Americans occupied Toluca and Mexico City, with the state government temporarily located in the unoccupied Sultepec.

By 1852, the state had lost a significant amount of territory to the creation of the state of Guerrero, which prompted the reorganization of the municipalities here. During the Reform War, General José María Cobos took and sacked a number of municipalities in the territory remaining. During this war, a number of major figures such as Melchor Ocampo, Santos Degollado and were executed by firing squad in the Toluca Valley regions.
In 1869, the areas to the northeast and south of Mexico City were converted to the states of Hidalgo and Morelos, respectively. The state promulgated a new constitution in 1869, which established the state as consisting of the districts of Chalco, Cuautitlan, Ixtlahuaca, Jilotepec, Lerma, Otumba, Sultepec, Temascaltepec, Tenango del Valle, Tenancingo and Texcoco, which is the territory the state has today.
The period before the Mexican Revolution was relatively prosperous for the state, especially under governor José Vicente Villada, who promoted public education, government reform, the establishment of a teachers&#x27; college for women, and the Instituto Cientifico y Literario (later UAEM). Mines in various parts of the state were at maximum production.

===Mexican Revolution to present===
Battles were fought in the state during the Mexican Revolution, especially by Zapatistas in the southwest part of the state, with Genovevo de la O and Francisco de Pacheco entering with their armies in 1912. Fighting intensified after Victoriano Huerta took power in 1913. In 1915, Toluca was the site of the Convencion de Generales y Gobernadores Revolucionaries (Convention of Generals and Revolutionary Governors) on two occasions. In 1917, the state had another new constitution, which divided the state into sixteen districts and 118 municipalities.

The extension of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area began in 1940 with the creation of the industrial zone of Naucalpan. The increase of the metro area&#x27;s population, commerce, and industry has continued to this day. The Consejo del Area Metropolitana was created in 1988 to coordinate concerns and actions of the Greater Mexico City area in both the Distrito Federal and the State of Mexico.

From 1824 to 1941, the state had no seal. Governor Wenceslao Labra proposed one in 1940, which was adopted the following year. It was designed by Pastor Velázquez with the motto of &quot;Patria, Libertad, Trabajo y Cultura&quot; (&quot;Country, Liberty, Work, and Culture&quot;).

In 1956, the Instituto Cientifico y Literario was converted into the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México.

During much of the rest of the 20th century, works to divert water from the Lerma River and other locations to Mexico City were built as well as highways through the state to connect Mexico City with the rest of the country.

In 1990, the &quot;Comisión Coordinadora para la Recuperación Ecológica de la Cuenca del Alto Lerma&quot; (&quot;Coordinating Commission for the Ecological Recuperation of the Upper Lerma River Basin&quot;) was established.

==Geography==

=== Limits ===
Its main neighbor is Mexico City.

The State of Mexico is located in the central zone of the Mexican Republic, in the eastern part of the Anáhuac table. It borders to the north with the states of Querétaro and Hidalgo; to the south with Guerrero and Morelos; to the east with Puebla and Tlaxcala; and to the west with Guerrero and Michoacán, as well as with Mexico City, which it surrounds to the north (northwest), east (southeast) and west (southwest).

=== Locations and ecosystems ===
The state is located in the center of the country, consisting mostly of the eastern side of the Anahuác Mesa. Most of the state consists of the Toluca Valley, the Tierra Caliente, the Mezquital Valley with the eastern panhandle mostly defined by the Chalco Valley. The state has a territory of 22,499.95 km2.

The state is divided into five natural regions: the Volcanos of the Valley of Mexico, the hills and plains north of the state, the western mountains, the Balsas Depression, and the mountains and valleys of the southeast.

The physical geography of the state varies. The eastern portion is dominated by the Sierra Nevada, which divides the state from Puebla. In this mountain chain are the Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl volcanos. The Sierra de Monte Alto and Sierra de Monte Bajo divide the west side of the Federal District from the state and contain peaks such as Cerro de la Bufa and Monte de las Cruces. The Sierra de Xinantécatl is to the south of the Toluca Valley. At the northern edge of this mountain range is the Nevado de Toluca volcano. In the northwest of the state is the Sierra de San Andrés Timilpan. Most of the rock and soil formation in the state is of volcanic origin.

There are three river basins in the state: the Lerma, the Balsas, and the Pánuco. The most important is the Lerma River, which begins in the municipality of Almoloya del Río and passes through a large number of municipalities in the state. The southwestern part of the state is dominated by the Balsas River basin. The eastern panhandle of the state is dominated by the Pánuco River basin. On the various rivers of the state are dams such as José Antonio Alzate in Temoaya, Ignacio Ramirez in Almoloya, Guadalupe in Cuautitlán Izcalli, Madín in Naucalpan, Vicente Guerrero in Tlatlaya, Tepetitlan in San Felipe del Progreso as well as those in Valle del Bravo and Villa Victoria.

About seventy percent of the state has a temperate moist climate, which consists of the highlands of the Toluca Valley and the areas around Texcoco in the north, the Toluca Valley and the areas around Texcoco. Average year-round temperature varies between 12C and 18C with annual precipitation above 700 millimeters. Higher elevations, about 13% of the state, in the center and east of the state have a semicold climate with average temperatures below 16C. Hotter climes are in the relative lowlands in the southwest, with an average temperature of between 18C and 22C, and constitute about eight percent of the territory. The hottest regions occupy five percent of the state in the extreme southwest with temperatures averaging over 22C. The coldest areas in the highest elevations such as the Nevado de Toluca, Popocatepetl, and Iztaccihuatl. Snow can be found on these elevations year-round. There are some arid areas along the borders of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala with annual precipitation between 500 and 700 milliliters.

Due to the various climates, the state has a wide variety of flora. 609,000 hectares are covered in trees, most of which are in the temperate and cold climates of the state. In the extreme southwest of the state, rainforests can be found and desert plants in the Hidalgo border area. In the highest altitudes, such as the peak of the Nevada de Toluca, alpine grassland can be found. In the extreme west, some forests receive thousands of monarch butterflies each winter.

The state has 49 environmentally protected areas, with the most important being the Nevado de Toluca National Park. Other important areas include the state parks of Otomi-Mazahua, Sierra Morelos, and Nahuatlaca-Matlatzinca. The Bosencheve National Park extends into Mexico State from Michoacán and is one of the major monarch butterfly sanctuaries. At the far east is the Iztaccíhuatl–Popocatépetl National Park which is shared with the neighboring state of Puebla.

==Government and politics==
===Government===
The state is governed according to the Constitution of the State of Mexico and the law of the State of Mexico. The previous constitutions of 1827, 1861, and 1870 were replaced in 1917. The government is composed of legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The legislative branch is composed of the Congress of the State of México; the executive branch is composed of the Governor, Cabinet, and Public Prosecutor; and the judicial branch is composed of the Judicial Council, High Court of Justice, and lower courts.

The state is divided into 125 municipalities, which are governed by local councils (&quot;&quot;) and a mayor, and have their own municipal laws. The municipalities are in turn grouped into 8 regions:

# Toluca Region
# Zumpango Region
# Texcoco Region
# Tejupilco Region
# Atlacomulco Region
# Coatepec Harinas
# Valle de Bravo
# Jilotepec

There are two metropolitan areas; the first is Greater Mexico City, in which there are 27 municipalities, and the city of Toluca, in which there are 6 municipalities.

The judiciary (&quot;) is composed of:
*The High Court of Justice (&quot;), the state&#x27;s highest court.
*The Judicial Council (&quot;), responsible for administration of the judiciary.
*The trial courts (&quot;).
*The small claims courts (&quot;&quot;).

The trial courts are divided based on municipalities.

==Demographics==

The fast-growing state contains about 14% of the country&#x27;s population and is one of the most densely populated, with 740 people per square km. Since Mexico City has not absorbed many citizens since 1990, Greater Mexico City&#x27;s explosive expansion is largely absorbed by the state, along with similar trends in Greater Toluca. Outside of these two metropolitan zones, the state is composed largely of villages. Historically, however, a handful of other states had been larger population centers until the 1960s, today it has by far the highest population in the country. In 2005, 85% of the population lived in urban centers, and 39% were born in other parts of Mexico.

Five ethnicities are native to the state: the Mazahua, the Otomi, the Nahuas, the Matlazincas and the Ocuitecos or Tlahuicas. There are also communities of Mixtecs, Zapotecs, Totonaca, Mazateca, Mixe, Purépecha and Maya. According to the 2005 census, the state has 312,319 people who speak an indigenous language, which is about 3 out of every 100 people. Two-thirds of those speaking an indigenous language also speak Spanish.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.74% of the state of Mexico&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

==Education==
The state has over three million students who attend about 15,000 schools from kindergarten to high school. It is the largest school system in the country after that of Mexico City. However, as late as 1990, there were over half a million people who were illiterate over the age of 15.

The state university is the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (UAEM) which offers 48 majors. This and other institutes of higher education have an enrollment of over 100,000 students. The beginnings of this institution go back to 1828 when the first Instituto Literario for the state was established in what is now the borough of Tlalpan in Mexico City. It was re-established in Toluca in 1833. In 1886, the name was changed to the Instituto Científico y Literario. In 1943, the institution gained autonomy from direct state control, and in 1956, it was reorganized as the UAEM. In 1964, the Ciudad Universitaria on the west side of Toluca was constructed.

Another important public university is the Universidad Autónoma de Chapingo, located in Texcoco. It is an agricultural college offering technical and bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The school began as the Escuela Nacional de Agricultura (National School of Agriculture) which was founded in 1854 at the Monastery of San Jacinto in Mexico City. The school was moved in 1923 to the ex Hacienda of Chapingo by President Álvaro Obregón. One distinguishing feature of the campus is the mural done in the old chapel, now University Ceremonies Room by Diego Rivera called &quot;Tierra Fecundada&quot; (Fertile Land). It is considered to be one of Rivera&#x27;s best works. More recently, the school acquired an unnamed mural by Luis Nishizawa. This work depicts the agriculture of Mexico in both the past and the present. It is placed in a building that is commonly called &quot;El Partenón&quot;.
Other important educational institutions include the Universidad Technológica del Sur del Estado de Mexico Universidad Tecnológica del Sur del Estado de México and a campus of the ITESM Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Toluca.

Recently, the Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Ecatepec (TESE) has become relevant due to the number of students, careers, and location.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===

The state contains 9,723 km of highways with about 90% being state and 10% federal. There are 1227.4 km of rail line and two airports, &quot;Lic. Adolfo López Mateos&quot; in Toluca and &quot;Dr. Jorge Jiménez Cantú&quot; in Atizapán de Zaragoza. Helicopter facilities exist in Chimalhuacán and Jocotitlán. Toluca Airport had served as a major 2nd airport for Mexico City, with coaches especially Volaris running between the two, but in recent years the popularity dwindled. However, with the new airport plans for the capital canceled, Toluca Airport looks again to capitalize on congestion at Mexico City International Airport, and potentially again with Tren Interurbano.

The Ferrocarril Suburbano is a commuter rail line that connects downtown Mexico City with northern Mexico State municipalities. Service began operations in 2008 with the Buenavista Lechería line. The Buenavista-Cuauhtitlan line was inaugurated in 2009, bringing the total rail ine to 27 km serving communities such as Tultitlán, San Rafael, Tlanepantla and others.

Newspapers of Estado de México include: &quot;Amanecer de México&quot;, &quot;Antesala la Verdad Sin Complicaciones&quot;, &quot;Aventuras de Vaqueros&quot;, &quot;De los Municipios Conurbados Imagen&quot;, &quot;Diario Puntual&quot;, &quot;El Diario de Toluca &quot;, &quot;El Heraldo de Toluca &quot;, &quot;El Sol de Toluca&quot;, &quot;Extra de El Sol&quot;, &quot;Global Energy&quot;, &quot;Impulso&quot;, &quot;Metro&quot;, &quot;Milenio Estado de México&quot;, &quot;Solo Ofertas&quot;, and &quot;Tollocan a 8 Columnas.&quot;

==Economy==
The state provides 9.7% of the country&#x27;s gross national product, with over 12% of all of Mexico&#x27;s active workforce employed in the state. The most important sector of the economy is industry and manufacturing, with over 10% of the state&#x27;s land urbanized. The State of Mexico ranks second in the country for industrial output. The most important industries include chemicals, food products, textiles, paper products, metalworks, and the construction and maintenance of transport vehicles. This sector employs the highest percentage of the population at 27.7%.

The next largest employer is commerce at 21.5%. One important segment of this sector is the hotel and restaurant industry. Outside of the metropolitan areas, tourism is an important element in the state economy, with attractions such as Valle de Bravo, Teotihuacan, Ixtapan de la Sal, and others.

Most of the state&#x27;s land is devoted to agriculture (38.1%) or forest (34.9%). Much of these crop forest lands are ejido or communal lands. The State of Mexico is the main producer of cut flowers in the country with the municipality of Villa Guerrero producing up to 75% of Mexico&#x27;s total floral output. The main crop is corn, with peas, barley, beans, potatoes, alfalfa, wheat, avocados and guava also grown. Livestock is raised on about 17% of the state&#x27;s farmland with cattle being the most important animal. Almost all of the forest lands in the state are used for producing forestry products such as wood and paper. However, this sector only employs 1.3% of the state&#x27;s population.

Other sectors of the economy include financial services, employing 21.4% of the population, and transportation which employs 14.4%. While mining has been historically important, today it is only a minor activity despite residual deposits of gold, silver, lead, and other minerals.

===Tourism===
====Archeological sites====

Main archeological sites include Teotihuacan, Malinalco, Teotenango, and Calixtlahuaca. The best-known and most important of these is the massive Mesoamerican Teotihuacan, with thousands visiting it each year. This city predates the Aztecs and the Toltecs, and is distinguished by two large pyramids, the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon.

In Malinalco, the archeological site is officially called the Cuauhtinchan Archeological Zone but it is more commonly called the Cerro de los Idolos. The site is located on a cliff overlooking the town. The visible complex dates from the Aztec Empire but the site&#x27;s use as a ceremonial center appears to be much older. The main building served as a sanctuary for Aztec warriors. This complex has been compared to Ellora in India, Petra on the shores of the Dead Sea and Abu Simbel in Egypt.

Teotenango was an important pre-Hispanic fortified city located in the southern part of the Valley of Toluca. It was initially founded during the last stages of the Teotihuacan civilization by a group generally referred to as the &quot;Teotenancas.&quot; Later, the Matlatzincas conquered the city and expanded it. The city existed for about 1,000 years, being abandoned only after the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire. In the 15th century, it and the rest of the southern Toluca Valley was conquered by the Aztecs. In the 16th century, the Spanish took over, forced the residents to abandon the old city in favor on a new settlement on the valley floor.

Calixtlahuaca is another Matlazinca site located just outside the city of Toluca. The site is at least 3,000 years old and shows Teotihuacan, Toltec and Aztec influences. Located on the skirts of the Tenismó mountain, the most outstanding structure is the temple dedicated to Ehécatl, or Quetzalcoatl in his wind god aspect.

====Spanish colonial and other historical sites====
Most of the state&#x27;s colonial attractions are promoted through the &quot;Pueblos con Encanto&quot; program. These include the monasteries and churches located in towns such as de Acolman, Aculco, Amanalco, Amecameca, Ayapango, El Oro, Ixtapan de la Sal, Malinalco, Metepec, Otumba, Temascalcingo, San Juan Teotihuacán, Tlalmanalco, Tonatico and Villa del Carbón. Other colonial structures can be found in Ozumba, Toluca and the cities that surround Mexico City.

The state has twenty-six museums and 543 libraries dependent on the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura. Major institutions include the Centro Cultural Mexiquense and the Notary Archive, the Executive and Legislative Archives in Toluca.

====Natural landmarks====
The natural feature most closely associated with the state is the Nevado de Toluca or Xinantécatl volcano, which is just south of the capital of Toluca. This extinct volcano rises 4,690 masl, making it the fourth highest peak in Mexico. At the top is a very large crater that contains two lakes called the Laguna del Sol and the Laguna de la Luna. The volcano and its immediate surroundings are part of the Nevado de Toluca National Park and the Los Venado National Park.

Valle de Bravo along with neighboring Lake Avandaro is a major weekend getaway for many in Mexico City and Mexico State. The town is filled with red tile roofs and stone paved streets and has been named a &quot;Pueblo Magico&quot; by the federal tourism agency. The lake is a result of the damming of a regional river and is home to more than forty nautical clubs.

The Grutas de la Estrella is located in the far south of the state on the border with Guerrero. It is a series of live caves in which running water creates formations, some of which are called &quot;The Mammoth&quot;, the &quot;Bride and Groom&quot;, &quot;The Hand&quot; and &quot;The Palace&quot;. They have lighting and other infrastructure as well as guided tours.

Most of the other natural attractions are situated on water sources. Ixtapan de la Sal and Tonatico are noted for their hot-water springs and water parks. Ixtapan de la Sal has attracted the construction of spas and water parks. Tonatico has the fifty-meter high El Salto Waterfall. The Lagunas de Zempoala (Zempoala Lakes) are located on the Santiago Tianguistenco-Cuernavaca highway. The area has forests and cabins. The Isla de la Aves (Island of the Birds) is located in a lake in the municipalities of Atlacolmulco and Timilpan and has an aviary.

Chalma

Chalma is a small community, which is part of the municipality of Malinalco. Its small population is almost completely dedicated to the pilgrims who come to visit the Sanctuary of Chalma, the second most important pilgrimage site in Mexico. The sanctuary is dedicated to an image of what many people describe as a &quot;black Christ&quot; on a cross that legend says miraculously appeared in an area cave where the worship of a deity commonly known as Oxtoteotl used to take place. Actually, Oxtoteotl is an aspect of Tezcatlipoca, the &quot;Smoking Mirror&quot;, and the &quot;black Christ&quot; is really Tezcatlipoca, which the Spanish friars superimposed on the existing representation of Tezcatlipoca to convert the natives. Pilgrimages to this Christian sanctuary follow many of the patterns of the prehispanic rituals, including walking the narrow paths to the town itself, bathing in the waters of a special fresh-water spring, and dancing at the sanctuary.

====Others====
To honor the native peoples of the area, there are the Centro Ceremonial Otomi in Temoaya and the Centro Ceremonial Mazahua in San Felipe del Progreso. Both of these have museums, auditoriums, handcrafts centers as well as large forested areas for camping and hiking. Both were built to honor and preserve these indigenous cultures.

Zacango is the state&#x27;s major zoo with over 2,000 species from all over the world. It is located fourteen km from the city of Toluca in the municipality of Calimaya. It is one of the few zoos in Mexico where all the animals live in natural-like enclosures.

The &quot;Cosmovitral&quot; is a stained glass mural as well as the name of a building and botanical garden located in Toluca. The building takes its name from the murals which are set in the building&#x27;s huge windows and on the ceiling. The building originally was constructed in 1910 as the 16 de Septiembre Market, but when this was closed in 1975, Leopoldo Flores successfully convinced the city government to convert the building into a space for art. The Cosmovitral is located downtown, on the corner of Juárez and Lerdo de Tejada streets. The best known aspect of this work is the &quot;Hombre Sol&quot; or &quot;Sun Man&quot;. Each year on the spring equinox, the sun aligns with this panel of the stained glass work. This image has become one of the symbols of the state.

==Culture==

Ceramics have been made in the Toluca Valley region since far into the pre-Hispanic period, mostly by Matlatzincas and Nahuas. The tradition continued into the colonial period although it much changed in both technique and design. Today both manufactured and handcrafted ceramics are produced in the state. The most traditional handcrafted wares are produced in places such as Metepec, Valle de Bravo, Texcoco, and Almoloya de Juárez among others. The best-known pottery and ceramics locale is Metepec, which specializes in large decorative pieces and sculptures called Trees of Life. Cooking utensils are made as well.

Objects made from precious metals such as silver are a specialty of the Mazahua people of the Toluca Valley. One specialty is jewelry and other decorative objects made with fine silver or gold wire. One community associated with this work is San Felipe del Progreso, where both wire and hammered items are made. Other communities of metalworkers exist in Naucalpan and Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl. In addition to jewelry, items such as bells, sculptures, religious paraphernalia, and more can be found.

Waxworks is dedicated mostly to the making of decorative and aromatic candles. These range from simple to elaborately carved samples. These are mostly made in Amecameca, Tenango del Valle and Toluca.

The making of piñatas, decorative cut-outs, and other objects from paper and/or cardboard is known in Acolman, Metepec, Toluca, Huixquilucan, Nezahualcoyotl and Otumba. This tradition dates back to pre-Hispanic times with bark paper, but newer materials have been incorporated since then. For example, paper cut-out banners or papel picado was originally done with crepe paper (called &quot;papel chino&quot; in Spanish) but today it can be seen done on thin plastic sheets.

The making of fireworks is best known in Tultepec in the municipality of Lerma. Not only are firecrackers and rockets made, but elaborate contraptions with firecrackers placed to move the parts when lit are made as well. These can be called &quot;castillos&quot; (castles) or &quot;toritos&quot; (little bulls) depending on their shape. These are used during religious and secular festivals such as Saints&#x27; Day and Independence Day. Tultepec holds a fireworks festival each year.

Other crafts practiced in the state include the making of candies, basketry, artistic ironwork, and items from bone, horn, stone, and wood.

Traditional dances performed in the state include the Danza de los Concheros, Danza de Moros y Cristianos, Doce Pares de Francia, Morisma, and Santiagos. One particular to Mexico State is the El Tzimare-cu, which is performed by the Otomi communities in Xonacatlán, Villa Cuauhtemoc, and Temoaya.

The state is known for its red and black moles, the barbacoa of Capulhuac and Tenango del Valle, the chorizo sausage of Toluca, and the cheese products of Ayapango and Aculco. Beverages include pulque and &quot;tecui.&quot;

Major festivals and fairs in the state include the Feria de San Isidro Labrador, an agricultural fair in Metepec, the Festival de la Quimera, a cultural fair in Metepec, the Feria Internacional del Caballo horse fair in Texcoco, the Feria de la Nuez (Nut Fair) in Amecameca, the Festival de las Almas and Fiests de San Francisco de Asis in Valle de Bravo and the Feria de Alfeñique, which sells candies and other traditional goods for Day of the Dead.

The Orquesta Sinfónica del Estado de México or Mexico State Symphonic Orchestra was established in 1971 by Enrique Bátiz Campbell. It is based in Toluca in the Felipe Villanueva Hall. It has given performances in various parts of both the state and nation of Mexico. It has made more recordings than any other state orchestra in the country, and in the 2000s it made its first appearances outside of Mexico in the United States and Europe.

<text>Nayarit, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Nayarit, is one of the 31 states that, along with Mexico City, comprise the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided in 20 municipalities and its capital city is Tepic.

It is bordered by the states of Sinaloa to the northwest, Durango to the north, Zacatecas to the northeast and Jalisco to the south. To the west, Nayarit has a significant share of coastline on the Pacific Ocean, including the islands of Marías and Marietas. The beaches of San Blas and the so-called &quot;Riviera Nayarit&quot; are popular with tourists and snowbirds. 
Besides tourism, the economy of the state is based mainly on agriculture and fishing. It is also one of two states where the tarantula species &quot;Brachypelma klaasi&quot; is found, the other being Jalisco.

Home to Uto-Aztecan indigenous peoples such as the Huichol and Cora, the region was exposed to the &quot;conquistadores&quot; Hernán Cortés and Nuño de Guzmán in the 16th century. Spanish governance was made difficult by indigenous rebellions and by the inhospitable terrain of the Sierra del Nayar. The last independent Cora communities were subjugated in 1722. 
The state&#x27;s name recalls the Cora people&#x27;s label for themselves: &quot;Náayerite&quot;, commemorating Nayar, a resistance leader.

==History==


Radiocarbon dating estimate Aztatlán colonization of the western Mexican coast – including parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco – as occurring as early as 900 AD, with some evidence suggesting it might have been as early as 520 AD. Encountered on the western coast by the Spanish invaders in 1500, the cultures were descended from these original Aztatlán settlements and other Classic-stage cultures who had merged with them.

Hernán Cortés was the first known European to enter into the area now known as Nayarit, which he claimed for Spain as part of Nueva Galicia. Under Nuño de Guzmán, Spaniards took the region with considerable brutality, causing the indigenous inhabitants to revolt, in what was later referred to as the Mixtón War. After almost two centuries of resistance, the last independent Cora communities were incorporated into Spanish administration by force in 1722. Then followed intense missionary efforts by Jesuits to convert the indigenous.

In the colonial period, the port of San Blas was one of the most important trade ports on the American Pacific coast. Galleons transporting goods from Manila, the Philippines arrived here before the rise of the port of Acapulco. Today, the town still boasts colonial architecture from its heyday, such as the &quot;aduana&quot; (customs office), the &quot;contaduría&quot; (accounting offices) and the fortress that protected the port against pirates.

In Nayarit, the struggle for independence from Spain was initiated by the priest José María Mercado, who conquered Tepic and San Blas before being defeated and executed by Spanish royalists. In 1824, in the first constitution of the Mexican Republic, Nayarit was a part of Jalisco. In the mid-1800s Comanche Indians, from Texas and Oklahoma, attacked Tepic causing widespread destruction. During the second half of the 19th century, Nayarit was one of the most turbulent territories in Mexico. The population was in open revolt, demanding access to land.

Nayarit was one of the last territories admitted as a state of the Mexican federation, which occurred on May 1, 1917.

== Geography ==
Nayarit covers , making it one of the smaller states in Mexico. Nayarit is located between latitude lines 23°05&#x27; north and 20°36&#x27; south and longitude lines 103°43&#x27; east and 105°46&#x27; west. Its terrain is broken up by the western ends of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. Its highest mountains are: San Juan, Sanguangüey, El Ceboruco, Cumbre de Pajaritos and Picachos. Nayarit has two volcanoes, Ceboruco and Sangangüey. In the northeast are broad, tropical plains watered by the Río Grande de Santiago, a continuation of the Lerma River. The main state rivers are the Río Grande de Santiago, San Pedro Mezquital, Acaponeta, Ameca, and Las Cañas. The Río Grande de Santiago is the largest river in Nayarit. The Santiago and its tributaries are of major importance for agricultural irrigation. The Ameca and the Las Cañas lie on the border between Nayarit and the states of Jalisco and Sinaloa, respectively. Notable lagoons in Nayarit include Santa María del Oro, San Pedro Lagunillas and Agua Brava.

=== Municipalities ===
Nayarit – as with all states of Mexico – is geographically divided into municipalities &quot;(municipios)&quot;, creating twenty municipalities in Nayarit:

=== Environment ===
Nayarit&#x27;s natural vegetation varies with altitude; coastal lowlands and river valleys were, historically, covered with tropical dry forest, containing many native deciduous trees that lost their leaves during the dry seasons. The Sinaloan dry forests now cover the northern coastal lowlands, and extend up the valleys of the San Pedro Mezquital River and the Río Grande de Santiago and its tributaries. The Jalisco dry forests ecoregion covers coastal Nayarit south of San Blas and the Islas Marías.

The Marismas Nacionales–San Blas mangroves, a network of coastal Pacific lagoons and tidal mangrove forests, extend along the state&#x27;s northern coast and into adjacent Sinaloa state. The mangroves are home to abundant wildlife, including migratory and resident waterbirds.

The mountains are home to pine–oak forests, which vary in density with elevation. Oak forests and woodlands tend to grow at lower elevations, interspersed with smaller areas of humid cloud forest in areas of higher rainfall. The highest elevations contain forests of conifers, pines and oak.

Nayarit also contains hundreds of miles of rainforest in the Sierra. Its wildlife includes hundreds of bird species, both resident and breeding/migratory populations, including parrots, like the lilac-crowned amazon (&quot;Amazona finschi&quot;) and numerous hummingbirds, such as the Mexican woodnymph (&quot;Thalurania ridgwayi&quot;). There are also 119 registered species of mammals, including white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), collared peccary (&quot;Dicotyles tajacu&quot;), brocket deer (&quot;Mazama americana&quot;), several types of armadillo, coyote, wild felines such as puma (&quot;Felis concolor&quot;), jaguarundi (&quot;Puma yagouarundi&quot;), bobcat or &quot;lince rojo&quot;, ocelot (&quot;Felis pardalis&quot;) and many more species. Historically, the Mexican wolf, Mexican grizzly bear and jaguar would have been present in the region, as well, though the bears are now extinct; the Mexican wolf and jaguar survive today only in a few fragmented locations, due to decades of hunting and human encroachment on their habitats. Most of the rain forest has been exploited, especially around the region of Santa María del Oro. The conservation and protection of the rain forest and wildlife of Nayarit is an issue of crucial importance.

The Islas Marías were designated as the Islas Marías Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2010.

== Demographics ==
=== Largest cities===

Nayarit is Mexico&#x27;s twenty-ninth most populous state. According to the census of 2020, the state had a population of 1,235,456 and its population density was 39/km2.

===Indigenous groups===
Nayarit is the home to four indigenous groups: the Wixaritari (Huichol), the Naayeri (Cora), the Odam (Tepehuan) and the Nahuatl-speaking Mexicaneros. The indigenous groups mostly inhabit the Nayar highlands, but are also frequently encountered in Tepic and on the Pacific coast, where they have also established colonies. They are known for their crafts and artwork which they sell. About five percent of the state population speaks an indigenous language.

== Economy ==
Nayarit is predominantly an agricultural state, and produces a large variety of crops such as beans, sorghum, sugar cane, maize, tobacco, rice, chiles, peanuts, melons, tomatoes, coffee, mangoes, bananas, and avocados. In addition to these crops, livestock and fishing are also central to the local economy. Approximately six percent of the land in Nayarit is pasture land, with the most common livestock being cattle, horses, pigs, goats, and sheep. Nayarit has 289 kilometers of coastline, which provides an abundance of fish and shellfish, including bass, snapper, sharks, and oysters. There are over 75 cooperatives related to the fishing industry alone in Nayarit. Much of the food produced in Nayarit is exported to the larger urban areas surrounding Mexico City and Guadalajara, and much of the agricultural labor is performed by migrant laborers. Although mining exists in Nayarit, it is mostly of non-metallic substances such as limestone or kaolin.

Beginning in the late 90&#x27;s, Nayarit has become known as a producer of specialty Arabica coffee, regarded for its fine taste and high density beans grown in the volcanic soils of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Nayarit coffee is exported all over the world, including to the UK and Australia via the Grupo Terruño Nayarita farmers cooperative.

In recent years, Nayarit has worked to build its tourism sector, marketing the &quot;Riviera Nayarit&quot; as a safe, beautiful destination served by Puerto Vallarta International Airport. Popular resort towns include Bucerías, Punta de Mita, La Cruz de Huanacaxtle, San Blas, Santiago Ixcuintla, Sayulita and Tecuala. However, some residents in these and other towns are concerned that the growth in the tourism industry might have harmful impacts on the community. Timeshare scams with links to the local Nayarit Mafia are quite common.

==Media==
Newspapers of Nayarit include: &quot;El Periódico en que Nayarit Opina Día a Día&quot;, &quot;El Semanario que refleja qué hay en Nayarit&quot;, &quot;Matutino Gráfico&quot;, &quot;Meridiano de Nayarit&quot;, and &quot;Realidades.&quot;
