<text>In mathematics, the exterior algebra or Grassmann algebra of a vector space formula_1 is an associative algebra that contains formula_2 which has a product, called exterior product or wedge product and denoted with formula_3, such that formula_4 for every vector formula_5 in formula_6 The exterior algebra is named after Hermann Grassmann, and the names of the product come from the &quot;wedge&quot; symbol formula_3 and the fact that the product of two elements of formula_1 is &quot;outside&quot; formula_6 

The wedge product of formula_10 vectors formula_11 is called a &quot;blade of degree formula_10&quot; or &quot;formula_10-blade&quot;. The wedge product was introduced originally as an algebraic construction used in geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogues: the magnitude of a -blade formula_14 is the area of the parallelogram defined by formula_5 and formula_16 and, more generally, the magnitude of a formula_10-blade is the (hyper)volume of the parallelotope defined by the constituent vectors. The alternating property that formula_4 implies a skew-symmetric property that formula_19 and more generally any blade flips sign whenever two of its constituent vectors are exchanged, corresponding to a parallelotope of opposite orientation. 

The full exterior algebra contains objects that are not themselves blades, but linear combinations of blades; a sum of blades of homogeneous degree formula_10 is called a -&quot;vector&quot;, while a more general sum of blades of arbitrary degree is called a &quot;multivector&quot;. The linear span of the formula_10-blades is called the formula_10-&quot;th exterior power&quot; of formula_6 The exterior algebra is the direct sum of the formula_10-th exterior powers of formula_2 and this makes the exterior algebra a graded algebra.

The exterior algebra is universal in the sense that every equation that relates elements of formula_1 in the exterior algebra is also valid in every associative algebra that contains formula_1 and in which the square of every element of formula_1 is zero.

The definition of the exterior algebra can be extended for spaces built from vector spaces, such as vector fields and functions whose domain is a vector space. Moreover, the field of scalars may be any field. More generally, the exterior algebra can be defined for modules over a commutative ring. In particular, the algebra of differential forms in formula_10 variables is an exterior algebra over the ring of the smooth functions in formula_10 variables.

== Motivating examples ==
=== Areas in the plane ===
The two-dimensional Euclidean vector space formula_31 is a real vector space equipped with a basis consisting of a pair of orthogonal unit vectors
formula_32

Suppose that
formula_33
are a pair of given vectors in , written in components. There is a unique parallelogram having formula_34 and formula_35 as two of its sides. The &quot;area&quot; of this parallelogram is given by the standard determinant formula:
formula_36

Consider now the exterior product of formula_34 and :
formula_38
where the first step uses the distributive law for the exterior product, and the last uses the fact that the exterior product is an alternating map, and in particular formula_39 (The fact that the exterior product is an alternating map also forces formula_40) Note that the coefficient in this last expression is precisely the determinant of the matrix . The fact that this may be positive or negative has the intuitive meaning that v and w may be oriented in a counterclockwise or clockwise sense as the vertices of the parallelogram they define. Such an area is called the signed area of the parallelogram: the absolute value of the signed area is the ordinary area, and the sign determines its orientation.

The fact that this coefficient is the signed area is not an accident. In fact, it is relatively easy to see that the exterior product should be related to the signed area if one tries to axiomatize this area as an algebraic construct. In detail, if denotes the signed area of the parallelogram of which the pair of vectors v and w form two adjacent sides, then A must satisfy the following properties:
# for any real numbers &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;, since rescaling either of the sides rescales the area by the same amount (and reversing the direction of one of the sides reverses the orientation of the parallelogram).
# , since the area of the degenerate parallelogram determined by v (i.e., a line segment) is zero.
# , since interchanging the roles of v and w reverses the orientation of the parallelogram.
# for any real number &quot;r&quot;, since adding a multiple of w to v affects neither the base nor the height of the parallelogram and consequently preserves its area.
# , since the area of the unit square is one.

With the exception of the last property, the exterior product of two vectors satisfies the same properties as the area. In a certain sense, the exterior product generalizes the final property by allowing the area of a parallelogram to be compared to that of any chosen parallelogram in a parallel plane (here, the one with sides e1 and e2). In other words, the exterior product provides a &quot;basis-independent&quot; formulation of area.

===Cross and triple products===

For vectors in R3, the exterior algebra is closely related to the cross product and triple product. Using the standard basis , the exterior product of a pair of vectors
: formula_41
and
: formula_42
is
: formula_43
where is the basis for the three-dimensional space ⋀2(R3). The coefficients above are the same as those in the usual definition of the cross product of vectors in three dimensions, the only difference being that the exterior product is not an ordinary vector, but instead is a bivector.

Bringing in a third vector
: formula_44
the exterior product of three vectors is
: formula_45
where e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3 is the basis vector for the one-dimensional space ⋀3(R3). The scalar coefficient is the triple product of the three vectors.

The cross product and triple product in three dimensions each admit both geometric and algebraic interpretations. The cross product can be interpreted as a vector which is perpendicular to both u and v and whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by the two vectors. It can also be interpreted as the vector consisting of the minors of the matrix with columns u and v. The triple product of u, v, and w is geometrically a (signed) volume. Algebraically, it is the determinant of the matrix with columns u, v, and w. The exterior product in three dimensions allows for similar interpretations. In fact, in the presence of a positively oriented orthonormal basis, the exterior product generalizes these notions to higher dimensions.

== Formal definition ==
The exterior algebra formula_46 of a vector space formula_1 over a field formula_48 is defined as the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;), where

:formula_49

by the two-sided ideal formula_50 generated by all elements of the form formula_51 such that formula_52. Symbolically,
: formula_53

The exterior product formula_3 of two elements of formula_46 is defined by
: formula_56

== Algebraic properties ==

=== Alternating product ===
The exterior product is by construction &quot;alternating&quot; on elements of , which means that formula_57 for all formula_58 by the above construction. It follows that the product is also anticommutative on elements of , for supposing that ,
: formula_59
hence
: formula_60

More generally, if formula_61 is a permutation of the integers , and , , ..., are elements of , it follows that
: formula_62
where formula_63 is the signature of the permutation .

In particular, if formula_64 for some , then the following generalization of the alternating property also holds:
: formula_65

Together with the distributive property of the exterior product, one further generalization is that a necessary and sufficient condition for formula_66 to be a linearly dependent set of vectors is that
: formula_65

=== Exterior power ===
The th exterior power of , denoted , is the vector subspace of spanned by elements of the form
: formula_68

If , then formula_69 is said to be a -vector. If, furthermore, formula_69 can be expressed as an exterior product of formula_10 elements of , then formula_69 is said to be decomposable (or simple, by some authors; or a blade, by others). Although decomposable -vectors span , not every element of formula_73 is decomposable. For example, given with a basis , the following 2-vector is not decomposable:
: formula_74

==== Basis and dimension ====
If the dimension of formula_1 is formula_76 and formula_77 is a basis for formula_1, then the set
: formula_79
is a basis for . The reason is the following: given any exterior product of the form
: formula_80
every vector formula_81 can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors ; using the bilinearity of the exterior product, this can be expanded to a linear combination of exterior products of those basis vectors. Any exterior product in which the same basis vector appears more than once is zero; any exterior product in which the basis vectors do not appear in the proper order can be reordered, changing the sign whenever two basis vectors change places. In general, the resulting coefficients of the basis -vectors can be computed as the minors of the matrix that describes the vectors formula_81 in terms of the basis .

By counting the basis elements, the dimension of formula_73 is equal to a binomial coefficient:
: formula_84
where is the dimension of the &quot;vectors&quot;, and is the number of vectors in the product. The binomial coefficient produces the correct result, even for exceptional cases; in particular, formula_85 for .

Any element of the exterior algebra can be written as a sum of -vectors. Hence, as a vector space the exterior algebra is a direct sum
: formula_86
(where, by convention, , the field underlying , and ), and therefore its dimension is equal to the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is .

==== Rank of a &quot;k&quot;-vector ====
If , then it is possible to express formula_69 as a linear combination of decomposable -vectors:
: formula_88
where each formula_89 is decomposable, say
: formula_90

The rank of the -vector formula_69 is the minimal number of decomposable -vectors in such an expansion of . This is similar to the notion of tensor rank.

Rank is particularly important in the study of 2-vectors . The rank of a 2-vector formula_69 can be identified with half the rank of the matrix of coefficients of formula_69 in a basis. Thus if formula_94 is a basis for , then formula_69 can be expressed uniquely as
: formula_96
where formula_97 (the matrix of coefficients is skew-symmetric). The rank of the matrix formula_98 is therefore even, and is twice the rank of the form formula_69.

In characteristic 0, the 2-vector formula_69 has rank formula_101 if and only if
: formula_102 and formula_103

=== Graded structure ===
The exterior product of a -vector with a -vector is a formula_104-vector, once again invoking bilinearity. As a consequence, the direct sum decomposition of the preceding section
: formula_105
gives the exterior algebra the additional structure of a graded algebra, that is
: formula_106

Moreover, if is the base field, we have
: formula_107 and formula_108

The exterior product is graded anticommutative, meaning that if formula_109 and , then
: formula_110

In addition to studying the graded structure on the exterior algebra, studies additional graded structures on exterior algebras, such as those on the exterior algebra of a graded module (a module that already carries its own gradation).

=== Universal property ===
Let be a vector space over the field . Informally, multiplication in formula_111 is performed by manipulating symbols and imposing a distributive law, an associative law, and using the identity formula_112 for . Formally, formula_111 is the &quot;most general&quot; algebra in which these rules hold for the multiplication, in the sense that any unital associative -algebra containing with alternating multiplication on must contain a homomorphic image of . In other words, the exterior algebra has the following universal property:
Given any unital associative -algebra and any -linear map formula_114 such that formula_115 for every in , then there exists &quot;precisely one&quot; unital algebra homomorphism formula_116 such that for all in (here is the natural inclusion of in , see above).


To construct the most general algebra that contains and whose multiplication is alternating on , it is natural to start with the most general associative algebra that contains , the tensor algebra , and then enforce the alternating property by taking a suitable quotient. We thus take the two-sided ideal in generated by all elements of the form for in , and define formula_111 as the quotient
: formula_118
(and use as the symbol for multiplication in ). It is then straightforward to show that formula_119 contains and satisfies the above universal property.

As a consequence of this construction, the operation of assigning to a vector space its exterior algebra formula_119 is a functor from the category of vector spaces to the category of algebras.

Rather than defining formula_119 first and then identifying the exterior powers formula_73 as certain subspaces, one may alternatively define the spaces formula_73 first and then combine them to form the algebra . This approach is often used in differential geometry and is described in the next section.

=== Generalizations ===
Given a commutative ring formula_124 and an formula_124-module , we can define the exterior algebra formula_126 just as above, as a suitable quotient of the tensor algebra . It will satisfy the analogous universal property. Many of the properties of formula_126 also require that formula_128 be a projective module. Where finite dimensionality is used, the properties further require that formula_128 be finitely generated and projective. Generalizations to the most common situations can be found in .

Exterior algebras of vector bundles are frequently considered in geometry and topology. There are no essential differences between the algebraic properties of the exterior algebra of finite-dimensional vector bundles and those of the exterior algebra of finitely generated projective modules, by the Serre–Swan theorem. More general exterior algebras can be defined for sheaves of modules.

== Alternating tensor algebra ==
For a field of characteristic not 2, the exterior algebra of a vector space formula_1 over formula_48 can be canonically identified with the vector subspace of formula_132 that consists of antisymmetric tensors. For characteristic 0 (or higher than ), the vector space of formula_10-linear antisymmetric tensors is transversal to the ideal , hence, a good choice to represent the quotient. But for nonzero characteristic, the vector space of -linear antisymmetric tensors could be not transversal to the ideal (actually, for , the vector space of formula_48-linear antisymmetric tensors is contained in formula_50); nevertheless, transversal or not, a product can be defined on this space such that the resulting algebra is isomorphic to the exterior algebra: in the first case the natural choice for the product is just the quotient product (using the available projection), in the second case, this product must be slightly modified as given below (along Arnold setting), but such that the algebra stays isomorphic with the exterior algebra, i.e. the quotient of formula_132 by the ideal formula_50 generated by elements of the form . Of course, for characteristic (or higher than the dimension of the vector space), one or the other definition of the product could be used, as the two algebras are isomorphic (see V. I. Arnold or Kobayashi-Nomizu).

Let formula_138 be the space of homogeneous tensors of degree formula_139. This is spanned by decomposable tensors
: formula_140

The antisymmetrization (or sometimes the skew-symmetrization) of a decomposable tensor is defined by
: formula_141
and, when formula_142 (for nonzero characteristic field formula_143 might be 0):
: formula_144
where the sum is taken over the symmetric group of permutations on the symbols . This extends by linearity and homogeneity to an operation, also denoted by formula_145 and formula_146, on the full tensor algebra .

Note that
: formula_147

Such that, when defined, formula_148 is the projection for the exterior (quotient) algebra onto the r-homogeneous alternating tensor subspace.
On the other hand, the image formula_149 is always the alternating tensor graded subspace (not yet an algebra, as product is not yet defined), denoted . This is a vector subspace of , and it inherits the structure of a graded vector space from that on . Moreover, the kernel of formula_150 is precisely , the homogeneous subset of the ideal , or the kernel of formula_145 is . When formula_152 is defined, formula_153 carries an associative graded product formula_154 defined by (the same as the wedge product)
: formula_155

Assuming formula_48 has characteristic 0, as formula_153 is a supplement of formula_50 in , with the above given product, there is a canonical isomorphism
: formula_159
When the characteristic of the field is nonzero, formula_145 will do what formula_146 did before, but the product cannot be defined as above. In such a case, isomorphism formula_162 still holds, in spite of formula_163 not being a supplement of the ideal , but then, the product should be modified as given below (formula_164 product, Arnold setting).

Finally, we always get isomorphic with , but the product could (or should) be chosen in two ways (or only one). Actually, the product could be chosen in many ways, rescaling it on homogeneous spaces as formula_165 for an arbitrary sequence formula_166 in the field, as long as the division makes sense (this is such that the redefined product is also associative, i.e. defines an algebra on ). Also note, the interior product definition should be changed accordingly, in order to keep its skew derivation property.

=== Index notation ===
Suppose that &quot;V&quot; has finite dimension &quot;n&quot;, and that a basis of &quot;V&quot; is given. Then any alternating tensor can be written in index notation with the Einstein summation convention as
: formula_167
where &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot;1⋅⋅⋅&quot;i&quot;&quot;r&quot; is completely antisymmetric in its indices.

The exterior product of two alternating tensors &quot;t&quot; and &quot;s&quot; of ranks &quot;r&quot; and &quot;p&quot; is given by
: formula_168

The components of this tensor are precisely the skew part of the components of the tensor product , denoted by square brackets on the indices:
: formula_169
The interior product may also be described in index notation as follows. Let formula_170 be an antisymmetric tensor of rank . Then, for , is an alternating tensor of rank , given by
: formula_171
where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot;.

== Duality ==

=== Alternating operators ===
Given two vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;X&quot; and a natural number &quot;k&quot;, an alternating operator from &quot;V&quot;&quot;k&quot; to &quot;X&quot; is a multilinear map
: formula_172
such that whenever &quot;v&quot;1, ..., &quot;v&quot;&quot;k&quot; are linearly dependent vectors in &quot;V&quot;, then
: formula_173

The map
: formula_174
which associates to formula_175 vectors from formula_176 their exterior product, i.e. their corresponding formula_175-vector, is also alternating. In fact, this map is the &quot;most general&quot; alternating operator defined on formula_178 given any other alternating operator formula_179 there exists a unique linear map formula_180 with formula_181 This universal property characterizes the space of alternating operators on formula_182 and can serve as its definition.

=== Alternating multilinear forms ===

The above discussion specializes to the case when , the base field. In this case an alternating multilinear function
: formula_183
is called an alternating multilinear form. The set of all alternating multilinear forms is a vector space, as the sum of two such maps, or the product of such a map with a scalar, is again alternating. By the universal property of the exterior power, the space of alternating forms of degree formula_10 on formula_1 is naturally isomorphic with the dual vector space . If formula_1 is finite-dimensional, then the latter is to . In particular, if formula_1 is formula_76-dimensional, the dimension of the space of alternating maps from formula_189 to formula_48 is the binomial coefficient .

Under such identification, the exterior product takes a concrete form: it produces a new anti-symmetric map from two given ones. Suppose and are two anti-symmetric maps. As in the case of tensor products of multilinear maps, the number of variables of their exterior product is the sum of the numbers of their variables. Depending on the choice of identification of elements of exterior power with multilinear forms, the exterior product is defined as
: formula_191
or as
: formula_192
where, if the characteristic of the base field formula_48 is 0, the alternation Alt of a multilinear map is defined to be the average of the sign-adjusted values over all the permutations of its variables:
: formula_194

When the field formula_48 has finite characteristic, an equivalent version of the second expression without any factorials or any constants is well-defined:
: formula_196
where here is the subset of shuffles: permutations &quot;σ&quot; of the set such that , and . As this might look very specific and fine tuned, an equivalent raw version is to sum in the above formula over permutations in left cosets of .

=== Interior product ===

Suppose that formula_1 is finite-dimensional. If formula_198 denotes the dual space to the vector space , then for each , it is possible to define an antiderivation on the algebra ,
: formula_199

This derivation is called the interior product with , or sometimes the insertion operator, or contraction by .

Suppose that . Then formula_200 is a multilinear mapping of formula_198 to , so it is defined by its values on the -fold Cartesian product . If &quot;u&quot;1, &quot;u&quot;2, ..., &quot;u&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 are formula_202 elements of , then define
: formula_203

Additionally, let formula_204 whenever formula_205 is a pure scalar (i.e., belonging to ).

==== Axiomatic characterization and properties ====
The interior product satisfies the following properties:
# For each and each (where by convention formula_206),
#: formula_207
# If formula_5 is an element of formula_1 (), then is the dual pairing between elements of formula_1 and elements of .
# For each , formula_211 is a graded derivation of degree −1:
#: formula_212

These three properties are sufficient to characterize the interior product as well as define it in the general infinite-dimensional case.

Further properties of the interior product include:
* formula_213
* formula_214

=== Hodge duality ===

Suppose that formula_1 has finite dimension . Then the interior product induces a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces
: formula_216
by the recursive definition
: formula_217

In the geometrical setting, a non-zero element of the top exterior power formula_218 (which is a one-dimensional vector space) is sometimes called a volume form (or orientation form, although this term may sometimes lead to ambiguity). The name orientation form comes from the fact that a choice of preferred top element determines an orientation of the whole exterior algebra, since it is tantamount to fixing an ordered basis of the vector space. Relative to the preferred volume form , the isomorphism is given explicitly by
: formula_219

If, in addition to a volume form, the vector space &quot;V&quot; is equipped with an inner product identifying formula_1 with , then the resulting isomorphism is called the Hodge star operator, which maps an element to its Hodge dual:
: formula_221

The composition of formula_222 with itself maps formula_223 and is always a scalar multiple of the identity map. In most applications, the volume form is compatible with the inner product in the sense that it is an exterior product of an orthonormal basis of . In this case,
: formula_224
where id is the identity mapping, and the inner product has metric signature — &quot;p&quot; pluses and &quot;q&quot; minuses.

=== Inner product ===
For a finite-dimensional space, an inner product (or a pseudo-Euclidean inner product) on defines an isomorphism of formula_1 with , and so also an isomorphism of formula_73 with . The pairing between these two spaces also takes the form of an inner product. On decomposable -vectors,
: formula_227

the determinant of the matrix of inner products. In the special case , the inner product is the square norm of the &quot;k&quot;-vector, given by the determinant of the Gramian matrix . This is then extended bilinearly (or sesquilinearly in the complex case) to a non-degenerate inner product on formula_228 If &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;, , form an orthonormal basis of , then the vectors of the form
: formula_229
constitute an orthonormal basis for , a statement equivalent to the Cauchy–Binet formula.

With respect to the inner product, exterior multiplication and the interior product are mutually adjoint. Specifically, for , , and ,
: formula_230
where is the musical isomorphism, the linear functional defined by
: formula_231
for all . This property completely characterizes the inner product on the exterior algebra.

Indeed, more generally for , , and , iteration of the above adjoint properties gives
: formula_232
where now formula_233 is the dual -vector defined by
: formula_234
for all .

=== Bialgebra structure ===
There is a correspondence between the graded dual of the graded algebra formula_119 and alternating multilinear forms on . The exterior algebra (as well as the symmetric algebra) inherits a bialgebra structure, and, indeed, a Hopf algebra structure, from the tensor algebra. See the article on tensor algebras for a detailed treatment of the topic.

The exterior product of multilinear forms defined above is dual to a coproduct defined on , giving the structure of a coalgebra. The coproduct is a linear function , which is given by
: formula_236
on elements . The symbol formula_237 stands for the unit element of the field . Recall that , so that the above really does lie in . This definition of the coproduct is lifted to the full space formula_119 by (linear) homomorphism. 
The correct form of this homomorphism is not what one might naively write, but has to be the one carefully defined in the coalgebra article. In this case, one obtains
: formula_239

Expanding this out in detail, one obtains the following expression on decomposable elements:
: formula_240
where the second summation is taken over all -shuffles. By convention, one takes that Sh(&quot;k,&quot;0) and Sh(0,&quot;k&quot;) equals {id: {1, ..., &quot;k&quot;} → {1, ..., &quot;k&quot;}}. It is also convenient to take the pure wedge products formula_241 and formula_242
to equal 1 for &quot;p&quot; = 0 and &quot;p&quot; = &quot;k&quot;, respectively (the empty product in formula_119). The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements formula_244 is &quot;preserved&quot; in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right.

Observe that the coproduct preserves the grading of the algebra. Extending to the full space formula_245 one has
: formula_246

The tensor symbol ⊗ used in this section should be understood with some caution: it is &quot;not&quot; the same tensor symbol as the one being used in the definition of the alternating product. Intuitively, it is perhaps easiest to think it as just another, but different, tensor product: it is still (bi-)linear, as tensor products should be, but it is the product that is appropriate for the definition of a bialgebra, that is, for creating the object . Any lingering doubt can be shaken by pondering the equalities and , which follow from the definition of the coalgebra, as opposed to naive manipulations involving the tensor and wedge symbols. This distinction is developed in greater detail in the article on tensor algebras. Here, there is much less of a problem, in that the alternating product formula_3 clearly corresponds to multiplication in the exterior algebra, leaving the symbol formula_248 free for use in the definition of the bialgebra. In practice, this presents no particular problem, as long as one avoids the fatal trap of replacing alternating sums of formula_248 by the wedge symbol, with one exception. One can construct an alternating product from , with the understanding that it works in a different space. Immediately below, an example is given: the alternating product for the &quot;dual space&quot; can be given in terms of the coproduct. The construction of the bialgebra here parallels the construction in the tensor algebra article almost exactly, except for the need to correctly track the alternating signs for the exterior algebra.

In terms of the coproduct, the exterior product on the dual space is just the graded dual of the coproduct:
: formula_250

where the tensor product on the right-hand side is of multilinear linear maps (extended by zero on elements of incompatible homogeneous degree: more precisely, , where formula_251 is the counit, as defined presently).

The counit is the homomorphism formula_252 that returns the 0-graded component of its argument. The coproduct and counit, along with the exterior product, define the structure of a bialgebra on the exterior algebra.

With an antipode defined on homogeneous elements by , the exterior algebra is furthermore a Hopf algebra.
== Functoriality ==
Suppose that formula_1 and formula_254 are a pair of vector spaces and formula_255 is a linear map. Then, by the universal property, there exists a unique homomorphism of graded algebras
: formula_256
such that
: formula_257

In particular, formula_258 preserves homogeneous degree. The {{math|&quot;k&quot;}}-graded components of formula_259 are given on decomposable elements by
: formula_260

Let
: formula_261

The components of the transformation {{tmath|{\textstyle\bigwedge}^{\!k}(f)}} relative to a basis of formula_1 and formula_254 is the matrix of formula_264 minors of {{tmath|f}}. In particular, if formula_265 and formula_1 is of finite dimension {{tmath|n}}, then formula_267 is a mapping of a one-dimensional vector space formula_218 to itself, and is therefore given by a scalar: the determinant of {{tmath|f}}.

=== Exactness ===
If formula_269 is a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then
: formula_270

is an exact sequence of graded vector spaces, as is
: formula_271

=== Direct sums ===
In particular, the exterior algebra of a direct sum is isomorphic to the tensor product of the exterior algebras:
: formula_272

This is a graded isomorphism; i.e.,
: formula_273

In greater generality, for a short exact sequence of vector spaces formula_274 there is a natural filtration 
: formula_275
where formula_276 for formula_277 is spanned by elements of the form formula_278 for formula_279 and formula_280
The corresponding quotients admit a natural isomorphism
: formula_281 given by formula_282

In particular, if &quot;U&quot; is 1-dimensional then
: formula_283
is exact, and if &quot;W&quot; is 1-dimensional then
: formula_284
is exact.

== Applications ==
=== Oriented volume in affine space ===
The natural setting for (oriented) formula_10-dimensional volume and exterior algebra is affine space. This is also the intimate connection between exterior algebra and differential forms, as to integrate we need a &#x27;differential&#x27; object to measure infinitesimal volume. If formula_286 is an affine space over the vector space {{tmath|V}}, and a (simplex) collection of ordered formula_287 points formula_288, we can define its oriented formula_10-dimensional volume as the exterior product of vectors formula_290 formula_291 (using concatenation formula_292 to mean the displacement vector from point formula_293 to formula_294); if the order of the points is changed, the oriented volume changes by a sign, according to the parity of the permutation. In {{tmath|n}}-dimensional space, the volume of any formula_76-dimensional simplex is a scalar multiple of any other.

The sum of the formula_296-dimensional oriented areas of the boundary simplexes of a {{tmath|k}}-dimensional simplex is zero, as for the sum of vectors around a triangle or the oriented triangles bounding the tetrahedron in the previous section.

The vector space structure on formula_119 generalises addition of vectors in {{tmath|V}}: we have formula_298 and similarly a {{math|&quot;k&quot;}}-blade formula_299 is linear in each factor.

=== Linear algebra ===
In applications to linear algebra, the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the determinant and the minors of a matrix. For instance, it is well known that the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix (with a sign to track orientation). This suggests that the determinant can be &quot;defined&quot; in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors. Likewise, the {{math|&quot;k&quot; × &quot;k&quot;}} minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen {{math|&quot;k&quot;}} at a time. These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to linear transformations as well: the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the oriented volume of any given reference parallelotope. So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined in terms of what the transformation does to the top exterior power. The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a basis-independent way to talk about the minors of the transformation.

=== Physics ===
{{main|Electromagnetic tensor}}
In physics, many quantities are naturally represented by alternating operators. For example, if the motion of a charged particle is described by velocity and acceleration vectors in four-dimensional spacetime, then normalization of the velocity vector requires that the electromagnetic force must be an alternating operator on the velocity. Its six degrees of freedom are identified with the electric and magnetic fields.

=== Electromagnetic field ===
In Einstein&#x27;s theories of relativity, the electromagnetic field is generally given as a differential 2-form formula_300 in 4-space or as the equivalent alternating tensor field formula_301 the electromagnetic tensor. Then formula_302 or the equivalent Bianchi identity formula_303
None of this requires a metric.

Adding the Lorentz metric and an orientation provides the Hodge star operator formula_222 and thus makes it possible to define formula_305 or the equivalent tensor divergence formula_306 where formula_307

=== Linear geometry ===
The decomposable {{math|&quot;k&quot;}}-vectors have geometric interpretations: the bivector formula_308 represents the plane spanned by the vectors, &quot;weighted&quot; with a number, given by the area of the oriented parallelogram with sides formula_309 and {{tmath|v}}. Analogously, the 3-vector formula_310 represents the spanned 3-space weighted by the volume of the oriented parallelepiped with edges {{tmath|u}}, {{tmath|v}}, and {{tmath|w}}.

=== Projective geometry ===
Decomposable {{math|&quot;k&quot;}}-vectors in formula_73 correspond to weighted {{Math|&quot;k&quot;}}-dimensional linear subspaces of {{tmath|V}}. In particular, the Grassmannian of {{math|&quot;k&quot;}}-dimensional subspaces of {{tmath|V}}, denoted {{tmath|\operatorname{Gr}_k(V)}}, can be naturally identified with an algebraic subvariety of the projective space {{nowrap|formula_312}}. This is called the Plücker embedding, and the image of the embedding can be characterized by the Plücker relations.

=== Differential geometry ===
The exterior algebra has notable applications in differential geometry, where it is used to define differential forms. Differential forms are mathematical objects that evaluate the length of vectors, areas of parallelograms, and volumes of higher-dimensional bodies, so they can be integrated over curves, surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds in a way that generalizes the line integrals and surface integrals from calculus. A differential form at a point of a differentiable manifold is an alternating multilinear form on the tangent space at the point. Equivalently, a differential form of degree {{math|&quot;k&quot;}} is a linear functional on the {{math|&quot;k&quot;}}th exterior power of the tangent space. As a consequence, the exterior product of multilinear forms defines a natural exterior product for differential forms. Differential forms play a major role in diverse areas of differential geometry.

An alternate approach defines differential forms in terms of germs of functions.

In particular, the exterior derivative gives the exterior algebra of differential forms on a manifold the structure of a differential graded algebra. The exterior derivative commutes with pullback along smooth mappings between manifolds, and it is therefore a natural differential operator. The exterior algebra of differential forms, equipped with the exterior derivative, is a cochain complex whose cohomology is called the de Rham cohomology of the underlying manifold and plays a vital role in the algebraic topology of differentiable manifolds.

=== Representation theory ===
In representation theory, the exterior algebra is one of the two fundamental Schur functors on the category of vector spaces, the other being the symmetric algebra. Together, these constructions are used to generate the irreducible representations of the general linear group (see &quot;Fundamental representation&quot;).

=== Superspace ===
The exterior algebra over the complex numbers is the archetypal example of a superalgebra, which plays a fundamental role in physical theories pertaining to fermions and supersymmetry. A single element of the exterior algebra is called a supernumber or Grassmann number. The exterior algebra itself is then just a one-dimensional superspace: it is just the set of all of the points in the exterior algebra. The topology on this space is essentially the weak topology, the open sets being the cylinder sets. An {{math|&quot;n&quot;}}-dimensional superspace is just the {{tmath|n}}-fold product of exterior algebras.

=== Lie algebra homology ===
Let formula_313 be a Lie algebra over a field {{tmath|K}}, then it is possible to define the structure of a chain complex on the exterior algebra of {{tmath|L}}. This is a {{tmath|K}}-linear mapping
: formula_314
defined on decomposable elements by
: formula_315

The Jacobi identity holds if and only if {{tmath|\partial\partial = 0}}, and so this is a necessary and sufficient condition for an anticommutative nonassociative algebra formula_313 to be a Lie algebra. Moreover, in that case formula_317 is a chain complex with boundary operator {{tmath|\partial}}. The homology associated to this complex is the Lie algebra homology.

=== Homological algebra ===
The exterior algebra is the main ingredient in the construction of the Koszul complex, a fundamental object in homological algebra.

== History ==
The exterior algebra was first introduced by Hermann Grassmann in 1844 under the blanket term of &quot;Ausdehnungslehre&quot;, or &quot;Theory of Extension&quot;.
This referred more generally to an algebraic (or axiomatic) theory of extended quantities and was one of the early precursors to the modern notion of a vector space. Saint-Venant also published similar ideas of exterior calculus for which he claimed priority over Grassmann.

The algebra itself was built from a set of rules, or axioms, capturing the formal aspects of Cayley and Sylvester&#x27;s theory of multivectors. It was thus a &quot;calculus&quot;, much like the propositional calculus, except focused exclusively on the task of formal reasoning in geometrical terms.
In particular, this new development allowed for an &quot;axiomatic&quot; characterization of dimension, a property that had previously only been examined from the coordinate point of view.

The import of this new theory of vectors and multivectors was lost to mid-19th-century mathematicians,
until being thoroughly vetted by Giuseppe Peano in 1888. Peano&#x27;s work also remained somewhat obscure until the turn of the century, when the subject was unified by members of the French geometry school (notably Henri Poincaré, Élie Cartan, and Gaston Darboux) who applied Grassmann&#x27;s ideas to the calculus of differential forms.

A short while later, Alfred North Whitehead, borrowing from the ideas of Peano and Grassmann, introduced his universal algebra. This then paved the way for the 20th-century developments of abstract algebra by placing the axiomatic notion of an algebraic system on a firm logical footing.

<text>Itasca State Park () is a state park of Minnesota, United States, and contains the headwaters of the Mississippi River. The park spans of northern Minnesota, and is located about north of Park Rapids, Minnesota and from Bagley, Minnesota. The park is part of Minnesota&#x27;s Pine Moraines and Outwash Plains Ecological Subsection and is contained within Clearwater, Hubbard, and Becker counties.

Itasca State Park was established by the Minnesota Legislature on April 20, 1891, making it the first of Minnesota&#x27;s state parks and second oldest in the United States, behind Niagara Falls State Park. Henry Schoolcraft determined Lake Itasca as the river&#x27;s source in 1832. It was named as a National Natural Landmark in 1965, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. About 500,000 people visit Itasca State Park annually.

==History==
Approximately 7–8,000 years ago, Native American hunters pursued wild animals for food in the Itasca State Park region. These early people ambushed bison, deer, and moose at watering sites and killed them with stone–tipped spears. The bison kill site along Wilderness Drive in the park gives visitors historical insight about this period.

A few thousand years later, a group of people of the Woodland Period arrived at Lake Itasca. They lived in larger, more permanent settlements and made a variety of stone, wood, and bone tools. Burial mounds from this era can be seen today at the Itasca Indian Cemetery.

In 1832 Anishinaabe guide Ozawindib led explorer Henry Schoolcraft to the source of the Mississippi River at Lake Itasca. It was on this journey that Schoolcraft, with the help of an educated missionary companion, created the name Itasca from the Latin words for &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;head&quot; (&quot;veritas caput&quot;). In the late 19th century, Jacob V. Brower, historian, anthropologist and land surveyor, came to the park region to settle the dispute of the actual location of the Mississippi&#x27;s headwaters. Brower saw this region being quickly transformed by logging, and was determined to protect some of the pine forests for future generations. It was Brower&#x27;s tireless efforts to save the remaining pine forest surrounding Lake Itasca that led the state legislature to establish Itasca as a Minnesota State Park on April 20, 1891, by a margin of only one vote. Through his conservation work and the continuing efforts of others throughout the decades, the grounds of Itasca had been maintained.

Established in 1909, Itasca Biological Station and Labs (IBSL) is one of the oldest and largest continuously operated inland field training centers in the United States. This site serves as a research facility and a site for summer-session undergraduate field biology courses for the University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences. Each year new College of Biological Sciences students attend the &quot;Nature of Life&quot; orientation program which is held by the lake, allowing the study of a diverse, undisturbed environment from the organismal level to that of an entire ecosystem.
==Landscape==
Lake Itasca, the official source of the Mississippi River and a scenic area of northern Minnesota, has remained relatively unchanged from its natural state. Most of the area has a heavy growth of timber that includes virgin red pine, which is also Minnesota&#x27;s state tree. Some of the red pine in Itasca are over 200 years old.

The Itasca terrain is sometimes referred to as &quot;knob and kettle.&quot; The knobs are mounds of debris deposited directly by the ice near the edge of glaciers or by melt–water streams flowing on or under the glacier&#x27;s surface. The kettles are depressions, usually filled with water, formed by dormant ice masses buried or partially buried under glacial debris that later melted. The retreat of the ice around 10,000 years ago left behind 157 lakes of varying size that cover of Itasca State Park. The glaciers deposited a moraine, a combination of silt, clay, sand, and gravel that covers the landscape to a depth of around . The park also integrates of upland and of swamp.

== Biology and ecology ==

===Plant life===
The Itasca area&#x27;s old-growth pine forests are almost as famous as the Mississippi headwaters. The area is currently one of the few places in state that has preserved these ancient pines from destruction. These pine forests were the main concern of Brower when he pushed to preserve the area as a state park. Logging operations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries depleted the large pine forests found in the park. Logging ended around 1920.

Pine restoration has been attempted dating back to 1902, but with limited success. Fire suppression in the area has eliminated wildfires in the park since the 1920s. Fire is necessary to the regeneration of white, red, and jack pines in the area because it opens the forest floor and canopy for new trees to grow. An overpopulation of white-tailed deer also stunt the regeneration efforts of these pines, as deer browse young pine seedling and prevent them from maturing into trees.

A combination of jack pine and northern pin oak dominated the park before European settlement. Among the numerous varieties of trees Itasca accommodates are quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, paper birch, red pine, white pine, as well as a mix of northern hardwoods. Current vegetation of the park now include: eastern white pine, red pine, aspen–birch, mixed hardwoods, jack pine barrens, and conifer bog. Logged areas of white and red pine are now home to a combination of aspen and birch trees, with aspen being the most dominant species of tree in the park today. The four principal forest communities in this locale remain to be aspen–birch, red pine, white pine, and northern hardwoods. 

The park is home to fourteen plants placed on the state endangered species list; these consist of ram&#x27;s–head lady&#x27;s slipper &quot;(Cypripedium arietinum)&quot;, olivaceous spike–rush &quot;(Eleocharis olivacea)&quot;, bog adder&#x27;s–mouth &quot;(Malaxis paludosa)&quot;, slender naiad &quot;(Najas gracillma)&quot;, and sheathed pondweed &quot;(Potamogeton vaginatus)&quot;.

Three terrestrial biomes, coniferous forest, deciduous forest, and prairie all intersect in the Itasca region and allow habitat for numerous vegetation and animals. Itasca is home to over 200 bird species encompassing: bald eagles, loons, grebes, cormorants, herons, ducks, owls, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatches, kinglets, vireos, tanagers, finches, and warblers. Residing among the many trails in the park are over 60 types of mammals including beaver, porcupine, black bear, and timber wolves.

The white-tailed deer overpopulation has caused problems within the park. According to 1998 statistics it was estimated that the density of deer is around 15 to 17 per square mile compared with the 4–10 per square mile in similar areas in Wisconsin. The cause of the deer boom was the addition of man-made open spaces and a deer protection zone put in place from the early 20th century until the 1940s. Annual deer hunts have been held since 1940 in an effort to curb white tail deer population.

The caddisfly &quot;Chilostigma itascae&quot; is only known to live in Nicollet Creek in the park.

===National Natural Landmark designation===
Under the name of Itasca Natural Area, the area was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service under the Historic Sites Act. It received this designation in November 1965 from the United States Secretary of the Interior, giving it recognition as an outstanding example of the nation&#x27;s natural history. The designation describes its significance:
The area contains some of the finest remaining stands of virgin red pine, spruce-balsam fir, and maple-basswood-aspen forest, supporting 141 bird and 53 mammal species, including bald eagles.
== Climate ==

Itasca State Park lies in northern Minnesota; a location that can be affected by three major air masses. An Arctic air stream extends south from Canada during the winter months; Pacific air that follows strong west winds move over the area and during the summer month a tropical air stream flows north from the Gulf of Mexico. These various air masses have a strong effect on the climate of the area around Itasca State Park.

The winter climate produces extremely cold temperatures, with an average minimum temperature for Itasca being . This cold weather is accompanied with snowfall amounts averaging around annually. A combination of the Arctic air with heavy snowfall and wind can create severe blizzard conditions in the area.

In the summer, the Pacific and tropical winds from the Gulf create warm to hot temperatures, with the highs during July averaging . However a clash of cool, dry polar air from Canada and the moisture from the southern tropical Gulf air can lead to showers and thunderstorms. The average annual rainfall in the Itasca area is . It has a relatively short growing season, with the first frost usually occurring in late September to early October and the first frost-free days not occurring until mid-May or early June.

==Recreation==

Itasca State Park&#x27;s recreational activities cover all four seasons of the year. Within the restored log building headquarters is a 31-bed youth hostel operated by Hostelling International USA, open to travelers of all ages.

Spring reels in the fishermen for the May fishing openers of walleye, northern pike, bass, and panfish. The park is in full bloom including a vast array of wildflowers. Birding is also a popular spring activity as the varying species return from migration.

Lake Itasca is a popular location for summer activities in Minnesota, with 496,651 visitors in 2006. Fishing, canoeing, boating, and kayaking equipment are always accessible. On land recreation consists of biking via the Heartland Trail, horseback riding, and hiking. A section of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through the park&#x27;s southern tier and includes three backcountry campsites. Numerous historical sites are available to view. The headwaters of the Mississippi River are one of the most visited sites featured at the park. Tourists can visit the new Mary Gibbs Visitor Center and the exhibits at the Jacob V. Brower Visitor Center. The park also offers a climb up the historic Aiton Heights Fire Tower.

Fall unveils the beautiful array of colors amidst the variety of trees throughout the park. This is another recommended season to bike, hike, or even take a leisurely walk through the designated trails. The park offers worth of hiking trails.

Winter lures in the ice fishermen, who gather on Lake Itasca. Snowmobilers can travel hundreds of miles of groomed snowmobile trails, while the skiers use of cross country skiing trails (both novice and skilled level) that are maintained regularly.

==Park facilities==

Scattered around the boundaries of Itasca State Park stand a variety of historical and tourist attractions. Constructed over a 37-year period from 1905 to 1942, development was undertaken by two Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps as well as two Works Progress Administration (WPA) camps. Architects for this later development were from the Minnesota Central Design Office of the National Park Service with Edward W. Barber and V.C. Martin serving as principal architects for the park buildings. Log construction was generally used because timber was easily available in the area.

===Rustic style design===
Itasca&#x27;s rustic style design is the largest collection of log–constructed buildings in the state park system. It provides a uniform appearance to the park, setting it apart from all others. Douglas Lodge, built in 1905, is the oldest surviving building and the first to be constructed in the Rustic Style. This structure is located along the south shore of Lake Itasca and was built using peeled logs harvested from the surrounding forests. Funded by State legislature in 1903, it became the first building to house the park&#x27;s visitors. Originally, it was called &quot;Itasca Park Lodge&quot; or &quot;State House&quot;, but was later named after Minnesota Attorney General Wallace B. Douglas, a prominent figure in the battle to save the timber in Itasca State Park at the start of the 20th century. At the time, very few governments were setting aside land for conservation, which shows the significance of this encounter. Douglas Lodge has provided tourist facilities since 1911 and remains functional today after undergoing renovations in the years following its grand opening. The Lodge is used as a hotel for guests to stay in, and the main lobby for the &quot;Douglas Lodge Cabins&quot; around it. There is also a restaurant famous for wild rice soup.

The Clubhouse, assembled in 1911, overlooks Lake Itasca. The interior contains ten dormitories placed around a two–story Rustic Style lobby. The Clubhouse contains a very large fireplace, couches, and a very great staircase. Over the years, the Clubhouse encountered few problems in the maintenance department other than minor deterioration in the lower logs, which were replaced in 1984. Today, guests may stay in the ten rooms.

The Old Timer&#x27;s Cabin is also found on the shores of Lake Itasca, located north of the Clubhouse. This was the first CCC–constructed building to appear in the park. The CCC originally referred to the Old Timer&#x27;s Cabin as the &quot;Honeymooner&#x27;s Cabin&quot; because of its small size and relative isolation .

Forest Inn is one of the largest creations by the CCC in the state park system, standing . It took a crew of 200 CCC members to produce the finished product, complete with both split stone and log components. The stone used in the walkways were scrap pieces from the quarries and stone works of the St. Cloud area and the logs used on the cabin came from the pine and balsam fir within the park vicinity.

===Mississippi headwaters===
The headwaters of the Mississippi River are clearly defined by a long outlet dam at the north end of Lake Itasca. This setup allows tourists to wade in shallow water or cross over it by way of the bridge constructed of logs. In 1903 a 24-year-old park commissioner named Mary Gibbs played a significant role in saving the tall pine forests and shoreline of the Mississippi River Headwaters by resisting efforts to log the area. In honor of her efforts, the Mary Gibbs Visitor Center, which encloses a restaurant, gift shop, various displays and exhibits of the park&#x27;s features, and an outdoor plaza now exists. Visitors can walk across the rocks connecting the sides of the Mississippi. There is also a bridge, for those who don&#x27;t want to get wet.

===Archaeological and cemetery sites===
Itasca State Park currently contains more than 30 known archaeological and cemetery sites. The study of archaeological remains in the Itasca area was started by Jacob V. Brower in the late 19th century. Survey work on archaeological remains place human activity in the Itasca area as early as 8,000 years ago. Human activity spans over several historical periods, from Early Eastern Archaic, through the Archaic and Woodland periods.

==== Itasca Bison Kill Site ====
The Itasca Bison Kill Site is the oldest archaeological site within Itasca State Park. The site dates back to the Early Eastern Archaic period. The discovery took place in 1937 during the construction of the Wilderness Drive. It is located near the southwestern shore of Lake Itasca by Nicollet Creek. An initial finding of the remains of human made artifacts prompted the University of Minnesota to conduct an extensive excavation of the area in 1964 and 1965. Excavation of the area revealed a large of amount of bones from an extinct species of Bison hence the name of the site. Human tools, such as knives, spears and scrapers were discovered in the vicinity.

==== Itasca State Park Site ====
The Itasca State Park Site was discovered and excavated by Jacob Brower in the late 19th century. The site consists of ten burial mounds, dating back approximately 800 years, along the northeastern shore of Lake Itasca. An effort was made in the late 1980s to rebury American Indian remains that had been removed. This act was in collaboration with a statewide effort to rebury the several thousand remains that had been excavated.

==== Other sites ====
Several other major sites exist in Itasca, including the Headwaters Site, which is located along the northeast shore of Lake Itasca, and a village site discovered by Jacob Brower in the late 19th century. Significant portions of this site have been converted into trails, parking lots and visitor service facilities. Archaeological remains have also been discovered at the Headwater&#x27;s West Terrace Site along the west bank of the Mississippi near Lake Itasca, the Bear Paw Campground Site which lies adjacent to Lake Itasca, as well as Pioneer Cemetery which is located on the eastern shore of Lake Itasca and contains the remains of early European pioneers.

<text>Ernest André Gellner (9 December 1925 – 5 November 1995) was a British-Czech philosopher and social anthropologist described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, when he died, as one of the world&#x27;s most vigorous intellectuals, and by &quot;The Independent&quot; as a &quot;one-man crusader for critical rationalism&quot;.

His first book, &quot;Words and Things&quot; (1959), prompted a leader in &quot;The Times&quot; and a month-long correspondence on its letters page over his attack on linguistic philosophy. As the Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics for 22 years, the William Wyse Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge for eight years, and head of the new Centre for the Study of Nationalism in Prague, Gellner fought all his life—in his writing, teaching and political activism—against what he saw as closed systems of thought, particularly communism, psychoanalysis, relativism and the dictatorship of the free market. Among other issues in social thought, modernisation theory and nationalism were two of his central themes, his multicultural perspective allowing him to work within the subject-matter of three separate civilisations: Western, Islamic, and Russian. He is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism.

==Background==
Gellner was born in Paris to Anna, née Fantl, and Rudolf, a lawyer, an urban intellectual German-speaking Austrian Jewish couple from Bohemia (which, since 1918, was part of the newly established Czechoslovakia). Julius Gellner was his uncle. He was brought up in Prague, attending a Czech language primary school before entering the English-language grammar school. This was Franz Kafka&#x27;s tricultural Prague: antisemitic but &quot;stunningly beautiful&quot;, a city he later spent years longing for.

In 1939, when Gellner was 13, the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany persuaded his family to leave Czechoslovakia and move to St Albans, just north of London, where Gellner attended St Albans Boys Modern School, now Verulam School (Hertfordshire). At the age of 17, he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, as a result of what he called &quot;Portuguese colonial policy&quot;, which involved keeping &quot;the natives peaceful by getting able ones from below into Balliol.&quot;
At Balliol, he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) and specialised in philosophy. He interrupted his studies after one year to serve with the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade, which took part in the Siege of Dunkirk (1944–45), and then returned to Prague to attend university there for half a term.

During this period, Prague lost its strong hold over him: foreseeing the communist takeover, he decided to return to England. One of his recollections of the city in 1945 was a communist poster saying: &quot;Everyone with a clean shield into the Party&quot;, ostensibly meaning that those whose records were good during the occupation were welcome. In reality, Gellner said, it meant exactly the opposite:

He returned to Balliol College in 1945 to finish his degree, winning the John Locke prize and taking first class honours in 1947. The same year, he began his academic career at the University of Edinburgh as an assistant to Professor John Macmurray in the Department of Moral Philosophy. He moved to the London School of Economics in 1949, joining the sociology department under Morris Ginsberg. Ginsberg admired philosophy and believed that philosophy and sociology were very close to each other.

Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse had preceded Ginsberg as Martin White Professor of Sociology at the LSE. Hobhouse&#x27;s &quot;Mind in Evolution&quot; (1901) had proposed that society should be regarded as an organism, a product of evolution, with the individual as its basic unit, the subtext being that society would improve over time as it evolved, a teleological view that Gellner firmly opposed.

Gellner&#x27;s critique of linguistic philosophy in &quot;Words and Things&quot; (1959) focused on J. L. Austin and the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, criticising them for failing to question their own methods. The book brought Gellner critical acclaim. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1961 with a thesis on &quot;Organisation and the Role of a Berber Zawiya&quot; and became Professor of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method just one year later. &quot;Thought and Change&quot; was published in 1965, and in &quot;State and Society in Soviet Thought&quot; (1988), he examined whether Marxist regimes could be liberalised.

He was elected to the British Academy in 1974. He moved to Cambridge in 1984 to head the Department of Anthropology, holding the William Wyse chair and becoming a fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, which provided him with a relaxed atmosphere where he enjoyed drinking beer and playing chess with the students. Described by the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; as &quot;brilliant, forceful, irreverent, mischievous, sometimes perverse, with a biting wit and love of irony&quot;, he was famously popular with his students, was willing to spend many extra hours a day tutoring them, and was regarded as a superb public speaker and gifted teacher.

His &quot;Plough, Sword and Book&quot; (1988) investigated the philosophy of history, and &quot;Conditions of Liberty&quot; (1994) sought to explain the collapse of socialism with an analogy he called &quot;modular man&quot;. In 1993, he returned to Prague, now rid of communism, and to the new Central European University, where he became head of the Center for the Study of Nationalism, a program funded by George Soros, the American billionaire philanthropist, to study the rise of nationalism in the post-communist countries of eastern and central Europe. On 5 November 1995, after returning from a conference in Budapest, he had a heart attack and died at his flat in Prague, one month short of his 70th birthday.

Gellner was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==&quot;Words and Things&quot;==

With the publication in 1959 of &quot;Words and Things&quot;, his first book, Gellner achieved fame and even notoriety among his fellow philosophers, as well as outside the discipline, for his fierce attack on &quot;linguistic philosophy&quot;, as he preferred to call ordinary language philosophy, then the dominant approach at Oxbridge (although the philosophers themselves denied that they were part of any unified school). He first encountered the strong ideological hold of linguistic philosophy while at Balliol:

&quot;Words and Things&quot; is fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal &quot;Mind&quot; (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.

==Social anthropology==
In the 1950s, Gellner discovered his great love of social anthropology. Chris Hann, director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, writes that following the hard-nosed empiricism of Bronisław Malinowski, Gellner made major contributions to the subject over the next 40 years, ranging from &quot;conceptual critiques in the analysis of kinship to frameworks for understanding political order outside the state in tribal Morocco (&quot;Saints of the Atlas&quot;, 1969); from sympathetic exposition of the works of Soviet Marxist anthropologists to elegant syntheses of the Durkheimian and Weberian traditions in western social theory; and from grand elaboration of &#x27;the structure of human history&#x27; to path-breaking analyses of ethnicity and nationalism (&quot;Thought and Change&quot;, 1964; &quot;Nations and Nationalism&quot;, 1983)&quot;. He also developed a friendship with the Moroccan-French sociologist Paul Pascon, whose work he admired.

==Nationalism==

In 1983, Gellner published &quot;Nations and Nationalism&quot;. For Gellner, &quot;nationalism is primarily a political principle that holds that the political and the national unit should be congruent&quot;. Gellner argues that nationalism appeared and became a sociological necessity only in the modern world. In previous times (&quot;the agro-literate&quot; stage of history), rulers had little incentive to impose cultural homogeneity on the ruled. But in modern society, work becomes technical; one must operate a machine, and to do so, one must learn. There is a need for impersonal, context-free communication and a high degree of cultural standardisation.

Furthermore, industrial society is underlined by the fact that there is perpetual growth: employment types vary and new skills must be learned. Thus, generic employment training precedes specialised job training. On a territorial level, there is competition for the overlapping catchment areas (such as Alsace-Lorraine). To maintain its grip on resources and its survival and progress, the state and culture must for these reasons be congruent. Nationalism, therefore, is a necessity.

<text>Isaac ben Solomon Luria Ashkenazi (; July 25, 1572), commonly known in Jewish religious circles as Ha&#x27;ari, Ha&#x27;ari Hakadosh or Arizal, was a leading rabbi and Jewish mystic in the community of Safed in the Galilee region of Ottoman Syria, now Israel. He is considered the father of contemporary Kabbalah, his teachings being referred to as Lurianic Kabbalah.

While his direct literary contribution to the Kabbalistic school of Safed was extremely minute (he wrote only a few poems), his spiritual fame led to their veneration and the acceptance of his authority. The works of his disciples compiled his oral teachings into writing. Every custom of Luria was scrutinized, and many were accepted, even against previous practice.

Luria died at Safed on July 25, 1572, and is buried at the Safed Old Jewish Cemetery. The Ari Ashkenazi Synagogue, also located in Safed, was built in memory of Luria during the late 16th century.

== Early life ==
Luria was born in 1534 in Jerusalem in what is now the Old Yishuv Courtyard to an Ashkenazi father, Solomon, and a Sephardic mother.

&quot;Sefer HaKavanot U&#x27;Ma&#x27;aseh Nissim&quot; records that one day, Luria&#x27;s father remained in the synagogue alone, studying, when the prophet Elijah appeared to him and said, &quot;I have been sent to you by the Almighty to bring you tidings that your holy wife shall conceive and bear a child, and that you must call him Yitzchak. He shall begin to deliver the believers from the qlippoth. Through him, numerous souls will receive their tikkun. He is also destined to reveal many hidden mysteries in the Torah and to expound on the &quot;Zohar&quot;. His fame will spread throughout the world. Take care therefore that you not circumcise him before I come to be the Sandak [who holds the child during the brit milah ceremony].&quot;

While still a child, Luria lost his father and was raised by his rich maternal uncle Mordechai Frances, a mültazim (tax farmer) from Cairo in Ottoman Egypt. His uncle placed him under the best Jewish teachers, including the leading rabbinic scholar David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra. Luria showed himself a diligent student of rabbinical literature and under the guidance of another uncle, Bezalel Ashkenazi, best known as the author of the &quot;Gathered Method&quot; (), he became proficient in that branch of Jewish learning.

At the age of fifteen he married a cousin, the daughter of Mordechai Frances, and being amply provided for financially he was able to continue his studies. Around the age of twenty-two he became engrossed in the study of the &quot;Zohar&quot;, a major work of the Kabbalah that had recently been printed for the first time, and adopted the life of a recluse. Retreating to the banks of the Nile for seven years, he secluded himself in an isolated cottage, giving himself up entirely to meditation. He visited his family only on Shabbat. But even at home, he would not utter a word, even to his wife. When it was necessary for him to say something, he would say it in the fewest words possible, and then, only in Hebrew.

==Teachings==
In 1569, Luria moved back to the Jerusalem Sanjak, and after a short sojourn there, where his new kabbalistic system seemed to have met with little success, he settled in the Safed Sanjak. Safed in the Galilee had become a center for kabbalistic studies over the previous decades, led by Moses ben Jacob Cordovero. There is evidence that Luria also regarded Cordovero as his teacher. Joseph Sambari (1640–1703), an Egyptian chronicler, testified that Cordovero was &quot;the Ari&#x27;s teacher for a very short time.&quot; Luria probably arrived in early 1570, and Cordovero died on June 27 that year (the 23d day of Tammuz). Bereft of their most prominent authority and teacher, the community looked for new guidance, and Luria helped fill Cordovero&#x27;s former role.

Soon Luria had two classes of disciples: novices, to whom he expounded elementary kabbalah, and initiates, who became the repositories of his secret teachings and his formulas of invocation and conjuration. The most renowned of the initiates was Hayyim ben Joseph Vital, who, according to his master, possessed a soul that Adam&#x27;s sin had not soiled. With him, Luria visited the grave of Shimon bar Yochai and those of other eminent teachers; it is said that these graves were unmarked, but through the mystical guidance given by Elijah, each grave was recognized.

Luria&#x27;s kabbalistic circle gradually widened and became a separate congregation in which his mystic doctrines were supreme, influencing all the religious ceremonies. On Shabbat, Luria dressed himself in white and wore a fourfold garment to signify the four letters of the Tetragrammaton.

Many Jews who had been exiled from Spain following the Edict of Expulsion believed they were in the time of trial that would precede the appearance of the Messiah in Galilee. Those who moved to Damascus Eyalet in anticipation of this event found a great deal of comfort in Luria&#x27;s teachings due to his theme of exile. Although he did not write down his teachings, they were published by his followers and by 1650 his ideas were known by Jews throughout Europe.

Luria delivered his lectures spontaneously, without ever writing down his ideas (with a few exceptions, including kabbalistic poems in rabbinical Aramaic for the Shabbat table). The foremost advocate of his kabbalistic system was Vital, who collected all the disciples&#x27; lecture notes. Numerous works were produced from these notes, the most important of which was the &quot;Etz Chaim&quot;, &quot;Tree of Life&quot;, in eight volumes (see below). Originally, it circulated only in manuscript copies. Each of Luria&#x27;s disciples had to pledge—under pain of excommunication—not to allow any copy be made for a foreign country, so that for a time all the manuscripts remained in Ottoman Syria. Eventually, one was brought to Europe and was published at Zolkiev in 1772 by Isaac Satanow. In this work, both the theoretical and the devotional-meditative teachings of Lurianic Kabbalah, based on the Zohar, are elaborated upon.

Tzimtzum was one of Luria&#x27;s most important ideas that he stressed in his lectures.

<text>Richard Gilford Adeney (25 January 1920 – 16 December 2010) was a British flautist who played principal flute with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the English Chamber Orchestra, was a soloist and a founding member of the Melos Ensemble.

== Career ==

Richard Adeney was born the son of the painter Bernard Adeney (1878–1966). He was determined early in life, to &quot;become the best flute player in the world&quot;, as he stated in his autobiography. He was educated at Dartington Hall School and subsequently studied at the Royal College of Music, where one of his contemporaries and close friends was Malcolm Arnold, who composed in 1940 a &quot;Grand Fantasia for flute, trumpet and piano&quot; for him and a pianist, premiered in February 1941. In his student days in the late 1930s Adeney worked with Vaughan Williams and Sir Malcolm Sargent. In the Second World War he was unconditionally exempted from military service as a conscientious objector.

He joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1941, initially as second flute, and played with them until 1950 and again from 1961 to 1970, under such conductors as Henry Wood and Wilhelm Furtwängler. He was one of the founding members of the Melos Ensemble, principal flautist of the English Chamber Orchestra (ECO) until the 1970s when he was succeeded by William Bennett, and also regularly performed as a soloist. Malcolm Arnold composed a &quot;Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet&quot; for him and other particular friends. Richard Adeney, Sidney Sutcliffe and Stephen Waters gave the work its first performance in 1952. In 1954 Malcolm Arnold wrote a &quot;Concerto for Flute and Strings&quot; for his friend, who recorded it in 1979, together with the concerto for flute and orchestra (1972).

Richard Adeney was closely associated with Benjamin Britten, and performed in many performances and recordings of the composer&#x27;s works, notably in 1962 with the Melos Ensemble in the premiere and recording of the War Requiem that Britten conducted himself. He participated in the premiere and first recording of Britten&#x27;s Curlew River in 1964. He recalled: &quot;Curlew River had more rehearsal time than any other new work that I have ever played&quot;. In 1967 he participated in a concert in the Royal Albert Hall including Britten&#x27;s The Burning Fiery Furnace.

Richard Adeney performed in notable recordings, such as Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concertos&quot;, which was recorded under Britten&#x27;s baton, or in his St Matthew Passion conducted by David Willcocks. He premiered the &quot;Elegy&quot; for flute, harp and string orchestra by John Veale in 1951. With the Melos Ensemble he recorded chamber music for both woodwinds and strings, such as Ravel&#x27;s Introduction and Allegro along with Osian Ellis (harp), Gervase de Peyer (clarinet), Emanuel Hurwitz and Ivor McMahon (violin), Cecil Aronowitz (viola) and Terence Weil (cello). both 1961 and 1967.

Adeney performed regularly at the Aldeburgh Festival. After having played under conductors as Sergiu Celibidache, Bruno Walter, Sir Thomas Beecham and Claudio Abbado, he ended his professional career in 1990.

Adeney died on 16 December 2010, aged 90, in Paddington.

A concert to celebrate his life was held on 6 May 2011 including performances by his colleague William Bennett.

== Career outside music ==

Richard Adeney has also been a teacher. In 1948 he was teaching courses of the first Bath Assembly (later called &quot;Bath International Music Festival&quot;). He contributed to the biography of Malcolm Arnold and is the author of &quot;flute&quot;, his autobiography. A sample provided by the publisher refers to working with Koussevitzky on the Symphony No. 4 by Brahms, musing on the state of mind of the player in the performance. Richard Adeney has also been a photographer whose photos appear on record covers and illustrate his autobiography and other books. One of his pictures showing Britten and the harpist Ellis appears in the Britten-Pears Foundation pages. For twenty-five years he was a volunteer with &quot;The Samaritans&quot;.

<text>Sir James Galway (born 8 December 1939) is an Irish virtuoso flute player from Belfast, nicknamed &quot;The Man with the Golden Flute&quot;. After several years working as an orchestral musician, he established an international career as a solo flute player. In 2005, he received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music at the Classic Brit Awards.

==Early life==
Galway was born in North Belfast as one of two brothers. His father, who played the flute, was employed at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard until the end of the Second World War and spent night-shifts cleaning buses after the war, while his mother, a pianist, was a winder in a flax-spinning mill. Raised as a Presbyterian and surrounded by a tradition of flute bands and many friends and family members who played the instrument, he was taught the flute by his uncle at the age of nine and joined his fife and drum corps. At the age of eleven Galway won the junior, senior, and open Belfast flute Championships in a single day. His first instrument was a five-key Irish flute, and at the age of twelve or thirteen, he received a Boehm instrument.

==Education and career==

Galway was educated at Mountcollyer Secondary Modern School in Belfast. He left school at the age of fourteen and worked as an apprentice to a piano repairer for two years.

He subsequently studied the flute at the Royal College of Music under John Francis and at the Guildhall School of Music under Geoffrey Gilbert. He then briefly studied at the Paris Conservatoire under Gaston Crunelle. While in Paris, he asked for lessons from the celebrated French flute player Jean-Pierre Rampal, who offered him advice on his playing, but felt he was already too good a flute player to need lessons from either Rampal or the conservatory. He left Paris to take up his first orchestral flute-playing job at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera in London.

He went on to spend fifteen years as an orchestral player. In addition to Sadler&#x27;s Wells, he played with Covent Garden Opera, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He auditioned for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Herbert von Karajan and was principal flute in the orchestra from 1969 to 1975. To Karajan&#x27;s surprise and dismay, after a period of some disagreement, Galway decided that he would leave to pursue a solo career.

In 1982 Galway was the featured guest star on the &quot;Andy Williams Early New England Christmas special&quot;, broadcast on CBS.

In addition to his performances of the standard classical repertoire, he features contemporary music in his programmes, including new flute works commissioned by and for him by composers including David Amram, Malcolm Arnold, William Bolcom, John Corigliano, John Wolf Brennan, Dave Heath, Lowell Liebermann and Joaquín Rodrigo. The album &quot;James Galway and The Chieftains in Ireland&quot; by Galway and The Chieftains reached number 32 in the UK Albums Chart in 1987.

Galway still performs regularly and is one of the world&#x27;s best-known flute players. His recordings have sold over 30 million copies.

In 1990, he was invited by Roger Waters to play at &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; concert, held in Potsdamer Platz; he played Pink Floyd&#x27;s songs &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot; and &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot;. Galway performed for the Academy Award-winning ensemble recording the soundtracks of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, composed by Howard Shore. In June 2008, he was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame along with Liza Minnelli and B. B. King.

He performs on Nagahara flutes, as well as some Muramatsu Flutes. Conn-Selmer produces his line of flutes, &quot;Galway Spirit Flutes&quot;.

Galway is president of Flutewise, a global charitable organisation that supports young flute players, run by Liz Goodwin. In 2003 he formed the Music Education Consortium together with Julian Lloyd Webber, Evelyn Glennie, and Michael Kamen to pressure the British Government into providing better music education in schools. He has been an Ambassador for the National Foundation for Youth Music, a UK charity.

He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1977 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours, and was knighted for services to music in the 2001 Birthday Honours, the first wind player ever to receive that honour.

Galway is a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity, and an ambassador of the UK charity Help Musicians.

In December 2013, Galway launched &quot;First Flute&quot;, an online interactive series of lessons for beginning flute students of all ages.

He received the 2014 Gramophone Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Personal life==
Galway has been married three times. His first marriage, to a French woman, produced a son. He married his second wife, Anna (Annie) Renggli, a daughter of a well-known Swiss architect, in 1972, and moved from Berlin to Lucerne, Switzerland, her hometown. The couple had twin daughters and a son. In 1978 he recorded for her an instrumental version of John Denver&#x27;s &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot;. It peaked at no. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.

After this divorce, he moved to Meggen, Switzerland, a village next to Lucerne, where he resides now with his third wife, the American-born flute player Jeanne Galway (née Cinnante), whom he married in 1984. They often tour together, playing duets. In addition, they give masterclasses and lectures.

Galway is a devout Christian who visits various types of churches while travelling (as long as they are not – in his view – modern and &quot;happy-clappy&quot;), and prays before his concert performances. He also wears a cross pendant, about which he says, &quot;It&#x27;s not jewellery. It&#x27;s something that reminds me of what I should be doing and how I should be behaving.&quot;

In August 1977, Galway was run over by a speeding motorcycle in Lucerne, breaking his left arm and both legs and required a four-month hospital stay. He has the eye condition nystagmus, and is a patron of the Nystagmus Network, a charity that supports people with the condition. In December 2009, he fell down a flight of stairs at his home, fracturing his left wrist and breaking his right arm.

Appearing on &quot;The Nolan Show&quot; in June 2015, Galway stated that he views his national identity as Irish. He was critical of the actions of the Northern Irish government during his childhood, and singled out prominent Unionist figures such as Ian Paisley whom Galway blamed for fostering the divisions that led to The Troubles. His comments were criticised by prominent Unionist politicians, among them Sammy Wilson. Describing Northern Ireland as &quot;the British-occupied part of Ireland&quot;, Galway further elaborated he would like &quot;Ireland to be Ireland&quot; and that when people ask him where he comes from he says &quot;Ireland&quot; and when asked if he is &quot;Irish&quot;, he replies affirmatively. He did, however, accept substantive British honours, first an OBE, and later a knighthood.

His younger brother, George (1940–2020), was a jazz musician (clarinet, flute, and saxophone) and teacher based in Manchester, England. George&#x27;s elder child and James&#x27;s nephew, Martin Galway, is a musician known for his work on Commodore 64 computer game music in the 1980s.

<text>The National Air and Space Museum (NASM) of the Smithsonian Institution is a museum in Washington, D.C., in the United States, dedicated to human flight and space exploration.

Established in 1946 as the National Air Museum, its main building opened on the National Mall near L&#x27;Enfant Plaza in 1976. In 2023, the museum welcomed 3.1 million visitors, making it the fourth-most visited museum in the United States and eleventh-most in the world.

The museum is a center for research into the history and science of aviation and spaceflight, as well as planetary science and terrestrial geology and geophysics. Almost all of its spacecraft and aircraft on display are original primary or backup craft (rather than facsimiles). Its collection includes the Apollo 11 Command Module &quot;Columbia&quot;, the &quot;Friendship 7&quot; capsule which was flown by John Glenn, Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, the model of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; used in the science fiction television show &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, and the Wright brothers″ &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; airplane near the entrance.

The museum operates a annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, at Dulles International Airport. It includes the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, which houses the museum&#x27;s restoration and archival activities. Other preservation and restoration efforts take place at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland.

The museum&#x27;s main building on the National Mall is undergoing a multi-year, $360M renovation that started in 2018, during which some of its spaces and galleries are closed. As of August 2024, 13 of the museum&#x27;s 23 galleries are open to the public, with 10 of them still closed for renovation. The remaining 10 galleries of the museum are expected to reopen by 2026.

==History==

=== National Air Museum ===
The Air and Space Museum was originally called the National Air Museum when formed on August 12, 1946, by an act of Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman. Some pieces in the National Air and Space Museum collection date back to the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia after which the Chinese Imperial Commission donated a group of kites to the Smithsonian after Smithsonian Secretary Spencer Fullerton Baird convinced exhibiters that shipping them home would be too costly. The Stringfellow steam engine intended for aircraft was added to the collection in 1989, the first piece actively acquired by the Smithsonian now in the current NASM collection.
After the establishment of the museum, there was no one building that could hold all the items to be displayed, many obtained from the United States Army and United States Navy collections of domestic and captured aircraft from World War I. Some pieces were on display in the Arts and Industries Building, some were stored in the Aircraft Building (also known as the &quot;Tin Shed&quot;), a large temporary metal shed in the Smithsonian Castle&#x27;s south yard. Larger missiles and rockets were displayed outdoors in what was known as Rocket Row. The shed housed a large Martin bomber, a LePere fighter-bomber, and an Aeromarine 39B floatplane. Still, much of the collection remained in storage due to a lack of display space.

The combination of the large numbers of aircraft donated to the Smithsonian after World War II and the need for hangar and factory space for the Korean War drove the Smithsonian to look for its own facility to store and restore aircraft. The current Garber Facility was ceded to the Smithsonian by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1952 after the curator Paul E. Garber spotted the wooded area from the air. Bulldozers from Fort Belvoir and prefabricated buildings from the United States Navy kept the initial costs low.

=== Construction of current building ===

The museum&#x27;s prominent site on the National Mall once housed the city&#x27;s armory, which became Armory Square Hospital during the Civil War; it nursed the worst wounded cases who were transported to Washington after battles. The rest of the site was occupied by a cluster of temporary war buildings that existed from World War I until the 1960s.

The space race in the 1950s and 1960s led to the renaming of the museum to the National Air and Space Museum, and finally congressional passage of appropriations for the construction of the new exhibition hall, which opened July 1, 1976, at the height of the United States Bicentennial festivities under the leadership of Director Michael Collins, who had flown to the Moon on Apollo 11.

=== Later history ===
In 1988, a glass-enclosed pavilion named the Wright Place was constructed and opened at the east end of the museum. It contained a restaurant known as Flight Lane, but the restaurant closed in 2001 and reopened as a food court on May 24, 2002, with McDonald&#x27;s (later added with a McCafé), Boston Market, and Donato&#x27;s Pizza serving as the tenants.

The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center opened on December 15, 2003, funded by a private donation.

The museum received COSTAR, the corrective optics instrument installed in the Hubble Space Telescope during its first servicing mission (STS-61), when it was removed and returned to Earth after Space Shuttle mission STS-125. The museum also holds the backup mirror for the Hubble which, unlike the one that was launched, was ground to the correct shape. There were once plans for it to be installed to the Hubble itself, but plans to return the satellite to Earth were scrapped after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in 2003; the mission was re-considered as too risky.

In 2018, the museum received Schmitt Space Communicator, the device with the on-flight internet connection launched by Solstar on a New Shepard rocket to send the first tweet from space.

The Smithsonian has also been promised the International Cometary Explorer, which is currently in a solar orbit that occasionally brings it back to Earth, should NASA attempt to recover it.

==Architecture==

Because of the museum&#x27;s close proximity to the United States Capitol, the Smithsonian wanted a building that would be architecturally impressive but would not stand out too boldly against the Capitol building. St. Louis–based architect Gyo Obata of HOK designed the museum as four simple marble-encased cubes containing the smaller and more theatrical exhibits, connected by three spacious steel-and-glass atria which house the larger exhibits such as missiles, airplanes and spacecraft. The mass of the museum is similar to the National Gallery of Art across the National Mall, and uses the same pink Tennessee marble as the National Gallery. Built by Gilbane Building Company, the museum was completed in 1976. The west glass wall of the building is used for the installation of airplanes, functioning as a giant door.

===Renovation===
Since 1976, the Air and Space Museum has received basic repair. In 2001, the glass curtain walls were replaced.
The Air and Space Museum announced a two-year renovation of its main entrance hall, &quot;Milestones of Flight&quot; in April 2014. The renovation to the main hall (which had not received a major update since the museum opened in 1976) was funded by a $30 million donation from Boeing. The gift, which will be paid over seven years, is the largest corporate donation ever received by the Air and Space Museum. Boeing had previously given donations totaling $58 million. The hall will be renamed the &quot;Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall&quot;. The renovation (whose total cost was not revealed) began in April 2014, and will involve the temporary removal of some exhibits before the hall is refurbished. Because some exhibits represent century-old achievements that no longer resonate with the public, some items will be moved to other locations in the museum while new exhibits are installed. 

The first new exhibit, a 1930s wind tunnel, will be installed in November 2014. Following completion, the hall will present a &quot;more orderly&quot; appearance, and allow room for the placement of future new exhibits (which will include moving the filming model of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; from the original 1960s &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series into the hall). The renovation will also include the installation of a &quot;media wall&quot; and touch-screen information kiosks to allow visitors to learn about items on display. An additional gift from Boeing is funding the renovation of the &quot;How Things Fly&quot; children&#x27;s exhibit, new museum educational programming, and the creation of an accredited course on flight and space technology for elementary and secondary school teachers.

In June 2015, the Smithsonian made public a report which documented the need for extensive renovations to the Air and Space Museum. Many of the building&#x27;s mechanical and environmental systems were redesigned during its construction from 1972 to 1976, which left them inadequate to handle the environmental, visitor, and other stresses placed on the building and its exhibits. Subsequently, these systems are in serious disrepair and exhibits are being harmed. The report noted that the HVAC system is close to failure, and the roof has been compromised so badly that it must be replaced. The Tennessee marble façade has cracked and become warped, and in some areas is so damaged it could fall off the building. 

The museum&#x27;s glass curtain walls (among those elements of the 1976 structure whose design was altered for cost reasons) are too permeable to ultraviolet radiation. Several exhibits (such as the spacesuit worn by John Young during the Gemini 10 mission, and the coating on the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; aircraft) have been damaged by this radiation. Additionally, the Smithsonian&#x27;s report noted that cutbacks in building design prior to and during construction left the museum with too few amenities, main entrances which are partially obscured, and exhibit space which does not meet current ADA accessibility standards. New security measures, required after the September 11 attacks in 2001, have created extensive queues which extend outside the building. Exposed, lengthy queues are both a security hazard and often cause visitors to wait in inclement weather.

On June 30, 2015, the Smithsonian began seeking approval for a $365 million renovation to the National Air and Space Museum. The agency hired the firm of Quinn Evans Architects to design the renovations and improvements. Interior changes include improving handicapped accessibility, main entrance visibility, and perimeter security. The entire façade will be replaced (using Tennessee marble again). The glass curtain walls will be replaced with triple glazed, thermally broken panels set in an aluminum frame. The curtain walls will be reinforced with steel to help improve their resistance to explosive blasts. 

Additional changes the Smithsonian would like to make, but which are not contained in the $365 million price tag, include the installation of 1,300 solar panels on the roof and the Independence Avenue side of the museum, the construction of vestibules over the main entrances, and reconstruction of the terraces (which leak water into the parking garage and offices beneath the structure). The Smithsonian said it would submit its designs to the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) on July 9, 2015, for review and approval. If the NCPC authorizes the changes, the museum could begin work in 2018 and finish in 2024.

In March 2016, Smithsonian officials said the project&#x27;s cost had risen to $600 million.

In late June 2016, Smithsonian officials projected the museum&#x27;s renovation to cost $1 billion. This included $676 million for construction, $50 million to build new storage space, and $250 million for new exhibits. The Smithsonian said it would raise the exhibit funds from private sources, but asked Congress to appropriate the rest. Demolishing the building and erecting a new structure would cost $2 billion, the agency stated.

In October 2018, the museum announced a 7-year renovation process and began closing some galleries between December 2018 and January 2019, began closing some of the galleries. The museum remained open throughout the renovation process until its closure in early 2020 with the other Smithsonian museums because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On March 3, 2022, the museum temporarily reopened as it continued to operate through the month until March 28, 2022, when it closed for six months. The renovation includes demolishing the food court pavilion (closed in 2017) to make way for the , three-story, Jeff Bezos Learning Center. The western side of the museum featuring eight new galleries, the planetarium, museum store and a cafe reopened on October 14, 2022, as part of Phase I while the eastern side scheduled to reopen in 2024.

==Controversies==
=== Enola Gay ===
Controversy erupted in March 1994 over a proposed commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Japan. The centerpiece of the exhibit was the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, the B-29 bomber that dropped Little Boy on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. When the first draft of the script for the exhibit was leaked by &quot;Air Force Magazine&quot;, the responses were very critical. Two sentences described as infamous that sparked controversy were, &quot;For most Americans, this war was fundamentally different than the one waged against Germany and Italy – it was a war of vengeance. For most Japanese, it was a war to defend their unique culture against western imperialism.&quot; 

Veterans&#x27; groups, led by the Air Force Association and The Retired Officers Association, argued strongly that the exhibit&#x27;s inclusion of Japanese accounts and photographs of victims politicized the exhibit and insulted U.S. airmen. Editorials called the National Air and Space Museum &quot;an unpatriotic institution&quot; due to the political nature of initial proposed script. Due to harsh backlash from the Air Force Association, The Retired Officers Association, and numerous members of Congress, a revision was created and a second draft proposed. This second revision was greeted with a large amount of Congressional involvement that resulted in line-by-line reviews of the script, which led to the less radical display that was seen in 1995. This was not met without resistance from the scholarly community, though. The Organization of American Historians felt as if Congress&#x27;s attempts to police and penalize the Smithsonian Institution led to a &quot;transparent attempt at historical cleansing.&quot; 

Also disputed was the predicted number of U.S. casualties that would have resulted from an invasion of Japan, had that been necessary, after the museum director, Martin O. Harwit, unilaterally reduced the figure by 75% on January 9, 1995, at the height of the dispute. On January 18 the American Legion called for a congressional investigation of the matter, and on January 24, 1995, 81 members of Congress called for Harwit&#x27;s resignation. Harwit was forced to resign on May 2. Although the exhibit was &quot;radically reduced&quot; and criticized by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;the most diminished display in Smithsonian history,&quot; the Air and Space Museum placed the forward fuselage of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and other items on display as part of a non-political historical exhibition. Within a year, it had drawn more than a million visitors, making it the most popular special exhibition in the history of the NASM, and when the exhibition closed in May 1998, it had drawn nearly four million visitors.

=== Other ===
On October 8, 2011, the museum was temporarily closed after demonstrators associated with the Occupy D.C. demonstration attempted to enter the museum. Some protesters were pepper sprayed by museum security after a guard was pinned against a wall. One woman was arrested.

On December 5, 2013, Smithsonian food workers protested about a living wage. A journalist was detained for illicit filming.

==Directors==
Carl W. Mitman was the first head of the museum, under the title of Assistant to the Secretary for the National Air Museum, heading the museum from 1946 until his retirement from the Smithsonian in 1952.

Directors have included:
==Photo gallery==

The main museum on the mall includes 61 aircraft, 51 large space artifacts, over 2,000 smaller items as of June 1, 2007.

==Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory==

The Phoebe Waterman Haas Public Observatory opened its doors to the public in 2009 as part of the celebration of the International Year of Astronomy. It has a 16-inch Boller &amp; Chivens telescope, a Sun Gun Telescope and hydrogen-alpha (red light, to see the chromosphere) and calcium-K (purple light) telescopes. The observatory opens to public from Wednesdays through Sundays from noon to 3 P.M. and is open about once a month at night time.

== Public programs and outreach ==

In 2014, the museum began a television show for middle school students, called &quot;STEM in 30&quot;. The show teaches students science, technology, engineering, math, art and history through artifacts at the museum and special guests from air and space history. The show is currently in its seventh season. The museum also has regular programs called What&#x27;s New in Aerospace that feature special guests.

==Fellowships==
The museum has four research fellowships: Charles A. Lindbergh Chair in Aerospace History (also known as the Lindbergh Chair,) the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Fellowship, the Verville Fellowship, and the Postdoctoral Earth and Planetary Sciences Fellowship. The Lindbergh Chair is a one-year senior fellowship to assist a scholar in the research and composition of a book about aerospace history. Announced in 1977 at the 50th anniversary of Lindbergh&#x27;s famous solo flight, 1978 was the first year that the Lindbergh Chair was occupied—British aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith was selected as the first recipient.

<doc id="221554" wikidata="Q2115993" url="?curid=221554" title="Psychogeography">
<text>Psychogeography is the exploration of urban environments that emphasizes interpersonal connections to places and arbitrary routes. It was developed by members of the Letterist International and Situationist International, which were revolutionary groups influenced by Marxist and anarchist theory as well as the attitudes and methods of Dadaists and Surrealists. 

In 1955, Guy Debord defined psychogeography as &quot;the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals.&quot; One of the key tactics for exploring psychogeography is the loosely defined urban walking practice known as the &quot;dérive&quot;. As a practice and theory, psychogeography has influenced a broad set of cultural actors, including artists, activists and academics.

==Development==

Psychogeography was originally developed by the Letterist International &#x27;around the summer of 1953&#x27;. Debord describes psychogeography as &#x27;charmingly vague&#x27; and emphasises the importance of practice in psychogeographical explorations. The first published discussion of psychogeography was in the Lettrist journal &quot;Potlatch&quot; (1954), which included a &#x27;Psychogeographical Game of the Week&#x27;:Depending on what you are after, choose an area, a more or less populous city, a more or less lively street. Build a house. Furnish it. Make the most of its decoration and surroundings. Choose the season and the time. Gather together the right people, the best records and drinks. Lighting and conversation must, of course, be appropriate, along with the weather and your memories.

If your calculations are correct, you should find the outcome satisfying. (Please inform the editors of the results.)The Lettrists&#x27; reimagining of the city has its precursors in aspects of Dadaism and Surrealism. The concept of the flâneur is also cited as an influence on the development of psychogeography.:3;18 Widely credited to Charles Baudelaire, who was influenced by Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Man of the Crowd&quot;, it was further developed theoretically by Walter Benjamin.

Ivan Chtcheglov, in his highly influential 1953 essay &quot;Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau&quot; (&quot;Formulary for a New Urbanism&quot;), established many of the concepts that would inform the development of psychogeography. Forwarding a theory of unitary urbanism, Chtcheglov wrote &quot;Architecture is the simplest means of articulating time and space, of modulating reality, of engendering dreams&quot;. Similarly, the Situationists found contemporary architecture both physically and ideologically restrictive, combining with outside cultural influence, effectively creating an undertow, and forcing oneself into a certain system of interaction with their environment: &quot;[C]ities have a psychogeographical relief, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes which strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones&quot;. Following Chtcheglov&#x27;s exclusion from the Lettrists in 1954, Guy Debord and others worked to clarify the concept of unitary urbanism, in a bid to demand a revolutionary approach to architecture.

The Situationists&#x27; response was to create designs of new urbanized space, promising better opportunities for experimenting through mundane expression. Their intentions remained completely as abstractions. Guy Debord&#x27;s truest intention was to unify two different factors of &quot;ambiance&quot; that, he felt, determined the values of the urban landscape: the soft ambiance — light, sound, time, the association of ideas — with the hard, the actual physical constructions. Debord&#x27;s vision was a combination of the two realms of opposing ambiance, where the play of the soft ambiance was actively considered in the rendering of the hard. The new space creates a possibility for activity not formerly determined by one besides the individual.

At a conference in Cosio di Arroscia, Italy in 1956, the Lettrists joined the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus to set a proper definition for the idea announced by Gil J. Wolman: &quot;Unitary Urbanism - the synthesis of art and technology that we call for — must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated.&quot; It demanded the rejection of functional, Euclidean values in architecture, as well as the separation between art and its surroundings. The implication of combining these two negations is that by creating abstraction, one creates art, which, in turn, creates a point of distinction that unitary urbanism insists must be nullified. This confusion is also fundamental to the execution of unitary urbanism as it corrupts one&#x27;s ability to identify where &quot;function&quot; ends and &quot;play&quot; (the &quot;ludic&quot;) begins, resulting in what the Lettrist International and Situationist International believed to be a utopia where one was constantly exploring, free of determining factors.

One of the first collaborations between Debord and Danish Asger Jorn is their screen printed Guide psychogéographique de Paris: discours sur les passions de l’armour (Psychogeographic Guide of
Paris: 1957). Later they created &quot;The Naked City (psychogeographic map of Paris:1958),&quot; for which they cut apart a typical map of Paris and repositioned the pieces. The resulting map corresponded with parts of Paris that were ‘stimulating’ and “worthy of study and preservation”; they then drew red arrows between these parts of the city to represent the fastest and most direct connections from one place to another, preferably made by taxi, as it was seen as the most independent and free way to travel through the city as opposed to buses.

Eventually, Debord and Asger Jorn resigned themselves to the fate of &quot;urban relativity&quot;. Debord readily admits in his 1961 film &quot;A Critique of Separation&quot;, &quot;The sectors of a city…are decipherable, but the personal meaning they have for us is incommunicable, as is the secrecy of private life in general, regarding which we possess nothing but pitiful documents&quot;. Despite the ambiguity of the theory, Debord committed himself firmly to its practical basis in reality, even as he later confesses, &quot;none of this is very clear. It is a completely typical drunken monologue…with its vain phrases that do not await response and its overbearing explanations. And its silences.&quot; &quot;This apparently serious term &#x27;psychogeography&#x27;&quot;, writes Debord biographer Vincent Kaufman, &quot;comprises an art of conversation and drunkenness, and everything leads us to believe that Debord excelled at both.&quot;:114

Before settling on the impossibility of true psychogeography, Debord made another film, &quot;On the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time&quot; (1959). The film&#x27;s narrated content concerns itself with the evolution of a generally passive group of unnamed people into a fully aware, anarchistic assemblage, and might be perceived as a biography of the situationists themselves. Among the rants which construct the film (regarding art, ignorance, consumerism, militarism) is a desperate call for psychogeographic action:
Moments later, Debord elaborates on the important goals of unitary urbanism in contemporary society:
Giving a quote that he attributed to Karl Marx, Debord says:
While a reading of the texts included in the journal &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot; may lead to an understanding of psychogeography as dictated by Guy Debord, a more comprehensive elucidation of the term would come from research into those who have put its techniques into a more developed practise. While Debord&#x27;s influence in bringing Chtchglov&#x27;s text to an international audience is undoubted, his skill with the &#x27;praxis&#x27; of unitary urbanism has been placed into question by almost all the subsequent protagonists of the Formulary&#x27;s directives. Debord was indeed a notorious drunk (see his Panegyrique, Gallimard 1995) and this altered state of consciousness must be considered along with assertions he made regarding his attempts at psychogeographical activities such as dérive and constructed situation. The researches undertaken by WNLA, AAA and the London Psychogeographical Association during the 1990s support the contention of Asger Jorn and the Scandinavian Situationniste (Drakagygett 1962 - 1998) that the psychogeographical is a concept only known through practise of its techniques. Without undertaking the programme expounded by Chtchglov, and the resultant submission to the urban unknown, comprehension of the Formulary is not possible. As Debord himself suggested, an understanding of the &#x27;beautiful language&#x27; of situationist urbanism necessitates its practice.

==Dérive==

Along with détournement, one of the main Situationist practices is the &quot;dérive&quot; (, &quot;drift&quot;). The dérive is a method of drifting through space to explore how the city is constructed, as well as how it makes us feel. Guy Debord defined the &quot;dérive&quot; as &quot;a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances.&quot; He gave a fuller explanation in &quot;Theory of the Dérive&quot; (1956), first written as a member of the Letterist International: In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there… But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.The &quot;dérive&quot;&#x27;s goals include studying the terrain of the city (psychogeography) and emotional disorientation, both of which lead to the potential creation of Situations.

==Contemporary psychogeography==


In 1987 the psychoanthropologist Howard F. Stein of the University of Oklahoma published &quot;Developmental Time, Cultural Space: Studies in Psychogeography,&quot; introducing a new way of looking at how human beings deal with geographical entities, and how the latter resonate in their unconscious mind with personal ones. This was followed in 1989 by a book titled &quot;Maps from the Mind: Readings in Psychogeography&quot;, edited by Howard Stein and by William Niederland, an eminent psychoanalyst, which incorporated fifteen chapters on various psychogeographical subjects by interdisciplinary scholars. The main focus of this new psychogeography was the application of psychoanalytic insights to our interactions with geographical entities.

Since the 1990s, as situationist theory became popular in artistic and academic circles, avant-garde, neoist, and revolutionary groups emerged, developing psychogeographical praxis in various ways. Influenced primarily through the re-emergence of the London Psychogeographical Association and the foundation of The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture, these groups have assisted in the development of a contemporary psychogeography. Between 1992 and 1996 The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture undertook an extensive programme of practical research into classic (situationist) psychogeography in both Glasgow and London. The discoveries made during this period, documented in the group&#x27;s journal &quot;Viscosity&quot;, expanded the terrain of the psychogeographic into that of urban design and architectural performance. Morag Rose has identified three dominant strands in contemporary psychogeography: literary, activist and creative.:29

The journal &quot;&quot; (which appears to have ceased publication sometime in 2000) collated and developed a number of post-avant-garde revolutionary psychogeographical themes. The journal also contributed to the use and development of psychogeographical maps which have, since 2000, been used in political actions, drifts and projections, distributed as flyers. Since 2003 in the United States, separate events known as Provflux and Psy-Geo-conflux have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments, under the academic umbrella of psychogeography. An article on the second annual Psy-Geo-conflux described psychogeography as &quot;a slightly stuffy term that&#x27;s been applied to a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities.&quot; Psychogeography has also made a methodological appearance in Library and Information Science. 

Psychogeography also became a device used in literature. In Britain in particular, psychogeography has become a recognised descriptive term used in discussion of successful writers such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd. Sinclair is &#x27;[a]rguably the most high-profile British psychogeographer&#x27; and is credited with having a strong influence on the term&#x27;s greater public use in the United Kingdom.:9 Though Sinclair makes infrequent use of the jargon associated with the Situationists, he has certainly popularized the term by producing a large body of work based on pedestrian exploration of the urban and suburban landscape. Scholar Duncan Hay asserts that Sinclair&#x27;s work does not represent the utopian and revolutionary foundations of Situationist practice, and instead &#x27;finds its expression as a literary mode, a position that would have appeared paradoxical to its original practitioners&#x27;.:3 Sinclair has distanced himself from the term, declaring it a &#x27;very nasty set of branding&#x27;.:19 Will Self also contributed to the popularisation of the term in Great Britain through a column in the Saturday magazine of the national broadsheet &quot;The Independent&quot;.:11; The column, which started out in the British Airways inflight magazine, ran in &quot;The Independent&quot; until October 2008. 

Sinclair and similar thinkers draw on a longstanding British literary tradition of the exploration of urban landscapes, predating the Situationists, found in the work of writers William Blake, Arthur Machen, and Thomas de Quincey. The nature and history of London were a central focus of these writers, utilising romantic, gothic, and occult ideas to describe and transform the city. Sinclair drew on this tradition combined with his own explorations as a way of criticising modern developments of urban space in the key text &quot;Lights Out for the Territory&quot;. Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s bestselling &quot;London: A Biography&quot; was partially based on similar sources. Merlin Coverley gives prominence to this literary tradition in his book &quot;Psychogeography&quot; (2006). Coverley recognises the situationist origins of psychogeographic practice are sometimes overshadowed by literary traditions, but that they had a shared tradition through writers like Edgar Allan Poe, Daniel Defoe, and Charles Baudelaire.

The documentaries of filmmaker Patrick Keiller are also considered to be an example of psychogeography.

The concepts and themes seen in the popular comics&#x27; writer Alan Moore in &quot;From Hell&quot; are also now seen as significant works of psychogeography. Other key figures in this version of the idea are Walter Benjamin, J. G. Ballard, and Nicholas Hawksmoor. Part of this development saw increasing use of ideas and terminology by some psychogeographers from Fortean and occult areas including earth mysteries, ley lines and chaos magic, a course pioneered by Sinclair. A core element in virtually all these developments remains a dissatisfaction with the nature and design of the modern environment, and a desire to make the everyday world more interesting.

Aleksandar Janicijevic, the initiator of the Urban Squares Initiative, defined psychogeography for the group in the following terms: &quot;The subjective analysis–mental reaction, to neighbourhood behaviours related to geographic location. A chronological process based on the order of appearance of observed topics, with the time delayed inclusion of other relevant instances&quot;. In 2013 Aleksandar Janicijevic published &quot;Urbis – Language of the urban fabric&quot; as a visual attempt to rediscover lost or neglected urban symbols. In 2015 another book was published, &quot;MyPsychogeography&quot;, an attempt to synthesize sketches and ideas which have informed his art practice.

== Early life and education ==
Kline was born on October 24, 1947, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Margaret Agnes Kirk and Robert Joseph Kline (1909–1996). His father was a classical music lover and amateur opera singer who owned The Record Bar, a record store in St. Louis that opened in 1942. He also sold toys during the 1960s and 1970s; his father&#x27;s family owned Kline&#x27;s Inc., a department store chain. Kevin Kline described his mother as the &quot;dramatic theatrical character in our family&quot;. His father was of German-Jewish descent, and his mother Catholic; Kline was raised in his mother&#x27;s faith. He has an older sister, Kate, and two younger brothers, Alexander and Christopher.

He graduated from the Saint Louis Priory School in 1965. In 1997, the school named its new auditorium the Kevin Kline Theater. At its dedication, he performed selections from Shakespeare as a benefit. He attended Indiana University, Bloomington, where he was a classmate of actor Jonathan Banks. He began studying composing and conducting music, but switched to a theater and speech major for his last two years, and graduated in 1970. He said: &quot;When I switched to the Theater Department, all I did was theater... I could barely make it to class because this was my passion.&quot; While an undergraduate, he was a co-founder of the Vest Pocket Players, an off-campus theatrical troupe.

==Acting career==
=== 1970–1981: Rise to prominence ===
In 1970, Kline won a scholarship to the newly formed drama division of the Juilliard School in New York. In 1972, he joined fellow Juilliard graduates, including Patti LuPone and David Ogden Stiers, and formed the City Center Acting Company (now The Acting Company), under the aegis of John Houseman. The Company traveled across the U.S. performing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, other classical works, and the musical &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot;, founding one of the most widely praised groups in American repertory theatre. At Juilliard, he studied singing with Beverley Peck Johnson.

In 1976, Kline left The Acting Company and settled in New York City, doing a brief appearance as Woody Reed in the now-defunct soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. He returned to the stage in 1977 to play Clym Yeobright opposite Donna Theodore as Eustacia Vye in The Hudson Guild Theater production of &quot;Dance on a Country Grave&quot;, Kelly Hamilton&#x27;s musical version of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the Native&quot;. In 1978, he played Bruce Granit, a matinée idol caricature, in Harold Prince&#x27;s &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;, for which he won his first Tony Award.

In 1981, he appeared with multi-genre renowned singer Linda Ronstadt and singer Rex Smith in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s Central Park production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, which moved to Broadway and won Kline another Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for his comically dashing portrayal of the Pirate King. In 1983 he played the role in a film version of the musical, also with Ronstadt, Smith and Angela Lansbury, which had a limited theatrical release.

In the ensuing years, Kline appeared many times in New York Shakespeare Festival productions of Shakespeare plays, including starring roles in &quot;Richard III&quot; (1983), &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1988), &quot;Henry V&quot; (1984), and two productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in 1986 and 1990 (which he also directed). A videotape of the 1990 production has aired on PBS. Kline was dubbed &quot;the American Olivier&quot; by &quot;New York Times&quot; theater critic Frank Rich for his stage acting.

===1982–1999: Breakthrough and stardom ===

Kline finally ventured into film in 1982 in &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;. He won the coveted role of the tormented and moody Nathan opposite Meryl Streep. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Janet Maslin wrote of Kline&#x27;s performance, &quot;Mr. Kline, whose Nathan convincingly demonstrates the greatest of tenderness toward Sophie, is also called upon to rail at her mercilessly. In the tender scenes Mr. Kline makes himself very appealing; in the cruel ones, he does the best he can to affect a viciousness that, even on the page, seemed less than fully convincing.&quot; Streep won an Academy Award for her performance, and Kline was nominated for a 1983 Golden Globe award (New Star of the Year) and BAFTA Award for Most Outstanding Newcomer To Film.

During the 1980s and early to mid-1990s, Kline made several films with director Lawrence Kasdan starting with &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983). The film revolves around friends from college reuniting after the death of a friend. Kline co-stars alongside Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, and William Hurt. The film was a critical and commercial success. He reunited with Kasdan with the western film &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985) where he starred with Kevin Costner, Rosanna Arquette, and John Cleese. He then portrayed Donald Woods in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987) opposite Denzel Washington about the friendship between activist Stephen Biko and editor Donald Woods.

&quot;Newsday&quot; critic Lynn Darling wrote on July 13, 1988, that Kline &quot;has proved himself to be one of the most talented and versatile American actors of his generation.&quot; In 1989, Kline won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the British comedy &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, where he played a painfully inept American ex-CIA thug opposite John Cleese&#x27;s genteel British barrister and Jamie Lee Curtis&#x27; femme fatale/con woman. In 2000, the American Film Institute ranked the film 21st on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs. Kline continued to take comedic roles in &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; (1990), &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991), &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; (1991), and &quot;French Kiss&quot; (1995).

In 1993, Kline had his first voice-acting role in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, and starred in &quot;Dave&quot;, a political comedy directed by Ivan Reitman and co-starring Charles Grodin, Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley. In 1996, he played the voice role of Captain Phoebus in the 1996 Disney animated film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. He portrayed an English literature teacher who is publicly outed when his student thanks him in his Academy Award acceptance speech in the Frank Oz comedy &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (1997). The film was inspired by Tom Hanks&#x27; acceptance speech for &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993). Kline was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance. In 1998, he received a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

In 1999, Kline played opposite Will Smith in the Steampunk Western film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 38 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. The film ended its theatrical run on October 10, 1999 after five months, having grossed $113,804,681 domestically and $108,300,000 overseas for a worldwide total of $222,104,681 against a production budget of $170 million.

=== 2000–2016: Established actor ===

Kline voiced Tulio in the DreamWorks animated film &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000) opposite Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s Miguel. The film is an adventure comedy featuring original songs with by Elton John. The film received mixed reviews but has since become a cult classic. The following year he starred in the Irwin Winkler drama &quot;Life as a House&quot; (2001) starring Kristin Scott Thomas, Hayden Christensen, and Mary Steenburgen. He reprised his role as Captain Phoebus in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot; (2002). That same year he portrayed a prep school teacher in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Club&quot; (2002). The film was compared to that of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1934) and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989). He then portrayed Cole Porter in the musical biopic &quot;De-Lovely&quot; (2004) for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

During this period Kline appeared in numerous comedy films such as &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006) opposite Steve Martin as well as the romantic comedy films &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot; starring Ryan Reynolds and &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2011) with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. He also played Guy Noir in Robert Altman&#x27;s final film &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (2006). Kline starred alongside Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Tommy Lee Jones, and Woody Harrelson.

He was inducted in the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 2003. He also appeared in a Lincoln Center production that combined the two parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot; on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 2003 as Falstaff, and was nominated for the 2004 Tony Award for Actor in a Play. In December 2004, Kline became the 2,272nd recipient of a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame, for his contributions to the motion picture industry, located at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.

Kline played the title role in &quot;King Lear&quot; at the Public Theater and took the lead role in a Broadway production of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; opposite Jennifer Garner. It was forced to temporarily close after only 11 performances as a result of the Broadway stagehands&#x27; strike, but subsequently reopened. &quot;Cyrano&quot; was filmed in 2008 and aired as part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; series. In January 2008, Kline won a Screen Actors Guild award for his portrayal of Jaques in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s film &quot;As You Like It&quot;, adapted from Shakespeare&#x27;s play. It premiered theatrically in 2006 in Europe, and was sent straight to HBO in the United States. Kline&#x27;s film &quot;The Conspirator&quot; premiered during the Toronto International Film Festival in 2010 and was described as an &quot;old-fashioned historical thriller&quot;. It was well received by most critics. Kline starred in the 2012 comedy &quot;Darling Companion&quot; with Diane Keaton.

=== 2017–present ===
In 2017, Kline returned to Broadway in a revival of the play &quot;Present Laughter&quot;. He received rave reviews with Marilyn Stasio writing, &quot;Whatever would we do without Kevin Kline? In an age of lesser stars, he&#x27;s a bona fide matinee idol of the ideal age and with the urbane sensibility to do justice to sophisticated scribes like Noël Coward.&quot; He received his third Tony Award, this time for Best Actor in a Play.

That year, he also played Maurice in the musical live-action adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, directed by Bill Condon and co-starring with Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. The film received positive reviews and grossed $1.2billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film, the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and the 17th highest-grossing film of all time. He also voiced Calvin Fischoeder in the animated comedy series &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; (2011–present), for which he earned a Primetime Emmy nomination. He has reprised his role in the latter&#x27;s theatrical feature &quot;The Bob&#x27;s Burgers Movie&quot; (2022).

In 2021, it was announced that Kline would star with Cate Blanchett on Alfonso Cuaron&#x27;s Apple TV+ series &quot;Disclaimer&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kline met actress Phoebe Cates in 1983. They began dating in 1985 and married on March 5, 1989 in a private New York wedding. They live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York.

<text>Jousting is a medieval and renaissance martial game or hastilude between two combatants either on horse or on foot. The joust became an iconic characteristic of the knight in Romantic medievalism.

The term is derived from Old French , ultimately from Latin &quot;to approach, to meet&quot;. The word was loaned into Middle English around 1300, when jousting was a very popular sport among the Anglo-Norman knighthood. The synonym tilt (as in tilting at windmills) dates .

Jousting on horse is based on the military use of the lance by heavy cavalry. It transformed into a specialized sport during the Late Middle Ages, and remained popular with the nobility in England and Wales, Germany and other parts of Europe throughout the whole of the 16th century (while in France, it was discontinued after the death of King Henry II in an accident in 1559). In England, jousting was the highlight of the Accession Day tilts of Elizabeth I and of James VI and I, and also was part of the festivities at the marriage of Charles I.

Jousting was discontinued in favour of other equestrian sports in the 17th century, although non-contact forms of &quot;equestrian skill-at-arms&quot; disciplines survived. There has been a limited revival of theatrical jousting re-enactment since the 1970s.

==History==
===Medieval joust===

The medieval joust has its origins in the military tactics of heavy cavalry during the High Middle Ages. By the 14th century, many members of the nobility, including kings, had taken up jousting to showcase their own courage, skill and talents, and the sport proved just as dangerous for a king as a knight, and from the 15th century on, jousting became a sport (hastilude) without direct relevance to warfare.

====High Middle Ages====
From the 11th to 14th centuries when medieval jousting was still practised in connection with the use of the lance in warfare, armour evolved from mail (with a solid, heavy helmet, called a &quot;great helm&quot;, and shield) to plate armour. By 1400, knights wore full suits of plate armour, called a &quot;harness&quot; (Clephan 28–29).

In this early period, a &quot;joust&quot; was still a (martial) &quot;meeting&quot;, i.e. a duel in general and not limited to the lance.
Combatants would begin riding on one another with the lance, but might continue with shorter range weapons after the distance was closed or after one or both parties had been unhorsed.
Tournaments in the High Medieval period were much rougher and less &quot;gentlemanly&quot; affairs than in the late medieval era of chivalry. The rival parties would fight in groups, with the aim of incapacitating their adversaries for the sake of gaining their horses, arms and ransoms.

====Late Middle Ages====

With the development of the courtly ideals of chivalry in the late medieval period, the joust became more regulated. This tendency is also reflected in the pas d&#x27;armes in general. It was now considered dishonourable to exploit an opponent&#x27;s disadvantage, and knights would pay close attention to avoid being in a position of advantage, seeking to gain honour by fighting against the odds. This romanticised &quot;chivalric revival&quot; was based on the chivalric romances of the high medieval period, which noblemen tried to &quot;reenact&quot; in real life, sometimes blurring the lines of reality and fiction.

The development of the term &quot;knight&quot; (&quot;chevalier&quot;) dates to this period. Before the 12th century, &quot;cniht&quot; was a term for a servant. In the 12th century, it became used of a military follower in particular. Also in the 12th century, a special class of noblemen serving in cavalry developed, known as &quot;milites nobiles&quot;. By the end of the 13th century, &quot;chivalry&quot; (&quot;chyualerye&quot;) was used not just in the technical sense of &quot;cavalry&quot;, but for martial virtue in general. It was only after 1300 that &quot;knighthood&quot; (&quot;kniȝthod&quot;, originally a term for &quot;boyhood, youth&quot;) came to be used as a junior rank of nobility. By the later 14th century, the term became romanticised for the ideal of the young nobleman seeking to prove himself in honourable exploits, the knight-errant, which among other things encompassed the pas d&#x27;armes, including the joust. By the 15th century, &quot;knightly&quot; virtues were sought by the noble classes even of ranks much senior than &quot;knight&quot;. The iconic association of the &quot;knight&quot; stock-character with the joust is thus historical, but develops only at the end of the Middle Ages.

===== Records of jousting by Froissart =====
The &quot;Chronicles of Froissart&quot;, written during the 1390s, and covering the period of 1327 to 1400, contain many details concerning jousting in this era. The combat was now expected to be non-lethal, and it was unnecessary to incapacitate the opponent, who was expected to honourably yield to the dominant fighter. The combat was divided into rounds of three encounters with various weapons, of which the joust proper was one. During this time, the joust detached itself from the reality on the battlefield and became a chivalric sport. Knights would seek opportunities to duel opponents from the hostile camp for honour off the battlefield.

As an example, Froissart records that, during a campaign in Beauce in the year 1380, a squire of the garrison of Toury castle named Gauvain Micaille (Michaille)—also mentioned in the &quot;Chronique du bon duc Loys de Bourbon&quot; as wounded in 1382 at Roosebeke, and again in 1386; in 1399 was in the service of the duke of Bourbon—yelled out to the English,
The challenge was answered by a squire named Joachim Cator, who said &quot;I will deliver him from his vow: let him make haste and come out of the castle.&quot;

Micaille came to meet his opponent with attendants carrying three lances, three battle-axes, three swords and three daggers. The duel began with a joust, described as follows:

The meeting was then adjourned, and continued on the next day.

In spite of the French squire&#x27;s injury, the duel was continued with three thrusts with the sword. After this, the encounter was stopped because of the Micaille&#x27;s loss of blood. He was given leave to rejoin his garrison with a reward of a hundred francs by Buckingham, who stated that he had acquitted himself much to his satisfaction.

Froissart describes a tournament at Cambray in 1385, held on the marriage of the Count d&#x27;Ostrevant to the daughter of Duke Philip of Burgundy. The tournament was held in the market-place of the town, and forty knights took part. The king jousted with a knight of Hainault, Sir John Destrenne, for the prize of a clasp of precious stones, taken off the bosom of the Duchess of Burgundy; it was won by Sir Destrenne, and formally presented by the Admiral of France and Sir Guy de la Trimouille.

===== Arena, procedure and armor =====
The &quot;lists&quot;, or &quot;list field&quot;, was the arena where a jousting event was held. More precisely, it was the roped-off enclosure where tournament fighting took place. In the late medieval period, castles and palaces were augmented by purpose-built tiltyards as a venue for &quot;jousting tournaments&quot;. Training for such activities included the use of special equipment, of which the best-known was the quintain.

The medieval joust took place on an open field. Indeed, the term &quot;joust&quot; meant &quot;a meeting&quot; and referred to arranged combat in general, not just the jousting with lances. At some point in the 14th century, a cloth barrier was introduced as an option to separate the contestants. This barrier was presumably known as &quot;tilt&quot; in Middle English (a term with an original meaning of &quot;a cloth covering&quot;). It became a wooden barrier or fence in the 15th century, now known as &quot;tilt barrier&quot;, and &quot;tilt&quot; came to be used as a term for the joust itself by . The purpose of the tilt barrier was to prevent collisions and to keep the combatants at an optimal angle for breaking the lance. This greatly facilitated the control of the horse and allowed the rider to concentrate on aiming the lance. The introduction of the barrier seems to have originated in the south, as it only became a standard feature of jousting in Germany in the 16th century, and was there called the Italian or &quot;&quot; mode. Dedicated tilt-yards with such barriers were built in England from the time of Henry VIII.

A knightly duel in this period usually consisted in three courses of jousting, and three blows and strokes exchanged with battle-axes, swords, and daggers. This number tended to be extended towards the end of the century, until the most common number was five, as in the duel between Sir Thomas Harpenden and Messire Jean des Barres, at Montereau sur Yonne in 1387 (&quot;cinq lances a cheval, cinq coups d&#x27;épée, cinq coups de dague et cinq coups de hache&quot;). Later it could be as high as ten or even twelve. In the 1387 encounter, the first four courses of the joust were run without decisive outcome, but in the fifth Sir Thomas was unhorsed and lost consciousness. He was revived, however, and all the strokes and blows could be duly exchanged, without any further injury.

On another instance, a meeting with sharp lances was arranged to take place near Nantes, under the auspices of the Constable of France and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter was a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers was slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance without further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir Tristram de la Jaille of Poitou advanced from the ranks and jousted three courses, without hurt. A duel followed between Edward Beauchamp, son of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and the bastard Clarius de Savoye. Clarius was much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. The bastard then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire named Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat with swords and lances was very violent, but neither of the parties was hurt.

Another encounter took place between John de Chatelmorant and Jannequin Clinton, in which the Englishman was unhorsed. Finally Chatelmorant fought with Sir William Farrington, the former receiving a dangerous wound in the thigh, for which the Englishman was greatly blamed, as being an infraction of the rules of the tourney, but an accident was pleaded just as in the case of the 1380 duel between Gauvain Micaille and Joachim Cator.
Jousting lances are modified from their original war form for sports and entertainment. For warfare, lances are made of metal, but jousting lances are made of wood and tipped with metal, which allows them to break on impact with the opponent&#x27;s shield. The lance is typically constructed from wood, depending on the progression of a joust. Instead of the sharp tip of war lances, a jousting lance has a blunt tip with a wider impact surface, putting more force into the impact on the shield rather than impaling the opponent. The tip of the lance is made of metal and is usually in the shape of a fist or three prongs flayed out from the center. The three-pronged tip allows for the lance to lock on the shield of the opponent and direct force into the impact.

Specialised jousting armour was produced in the late 15th to 16th century. It was heavier than suits of plate armour intended for combat, and could weigh as much as 50 kg (110 lb), compared to some 25 kg (55 lb) for field armour; as it did not need to permit free movement of the wearer, the only limiting factor was the maximum weight that could be carried by a warhorse of the period.

===== Horses =====

The two most common kinds of horses used for jousting were warmblood &quot;chargers&quot; and larger &quot;destriers&quot;. Chargers were medium-weight horses bred and trained for agility and stamina. Destriers were heavier, similar to today&#x27;s Andalusian horse, but not as large as the modern draft horse.

During a jousting tournament, the horses were cared for by their grooms in their respective tents. They wore caparisons, a type of ornamental cloth featuring the owner&#x27;s heraldic signs. Competing horses had their heads protected by a chanfron, an iron shield for protection from otherwise lethal lance hits.

Other forms of equipment on the horse included long-necked spurs that enabled the rider to control the horse with extended legs, a saddle with a high back to provide leverage during the charge or when hit, as well as stirrups for the necessary leverage to deliver blows with the lance.

===== 15th century =====
From 10 July to 9 August 1434, the Leonese knight Suero de Quiñones and ten of his companions encamped in a field beside a bridge and challenged each knight who wished to cross it to a joust. This road was used by pilgrims all over Europe on the way to a shrine at Santiago de Compostela, and at this time of the summer, many thousands would cross the bridge. Suero and his men swore to &quot;break 300 lances&quot; before moving on. The men fought for over a month, and after 166 battles Suero and his men were so injured they could not continue and declared the mission complete.

During the 1490s, Maximilian I invested much effort into perfecting the sport, for which he received his nickname of &quot;The Last Knight&quot;. &#x27; and &#x27; were two sportive forms of the joust developed during the 15th century and practised throughout the 16th century. The armours used for these two respective styles of the joust were known as &#x27; and &#x27;, respectively. The &#x27; in particular developed into extremely heavy armour which completely inhibited the movement of the rider, in its latest forms resembling an armour-shaped cabin integrated into the horse armour more than a functional suit of armour. Such forms of sportive equipment during the final phase of the joust in 16th-century Germany gave rise to modern misconceptions about the heaviness or clumsiness of &quot;medieval armour&quot;, as notably popularised by Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;. The extremely heavy helmets of the &#x27; are explained by the fact that the aim was to detach the crest of the opponent&#x27;s helmet, resulting in frequent full impact of the lance to the helmet.

By contrast, the &#x27; was a type of joust with lighter contact. Here, the aim was to hit the opponent&#x27;s shield. The specialised &#x27; was developed on the request of Maximilian, who desired a return to a more agile form of joust compared to the heavily armoured &quot;full contact&quot; &#x27;. In the &#x27;, the shield was attached to the armour with a mechanism of springs and would detach itself upon contact.

==== Post-medieval period ====

In France, the death of King Henry II in 1559 from wounds suffered in a tournament led to the end of jousting as a sport.

The tilt continued through the reign of Henry VIII and into that of Elizabeth I. Under her rule, tournaments were seen as more of a parade or show than an actual martial exercise.

The last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in November 1602; Elizabeth died the following spring. Tilts continued as part of festivities marking the Accession Day of James I, 24 March, until 1624, the year before his death. In the early 17th century, the joust was replaced as the equine highlight of court festivities by large &quot;horse-ballet&quot; displays called carousels, although non-combat competitions such as the ring-tilt lasted until the 18th century. Ring tournaments were introduced into North America, and jousting continues as the state sport of Maryland.

One attempt to revive the joust was the Eglinton Tournament of 1839.

==Modern revivals==
=== Modern-day jousting ===
Jousting reenactors have been active since the 1970s. A more popular modern-day jousting show took place in 1972 at the Principality of Gwrych in North Wales near Abergele. Various companies, such as Knights Limited, held organized shows with anywhere between five and fifty actors present.

Between 1980 and 1982, the Little England theme park in Orlando, Florida was planned to become a jousting stadium, ultimately being cancelled due to high interest rates. Other companies such as Medieval Times include this sport in its dinner show. Jousting shows are also held seasonally at Warwick Castle and Hever Castle in England. Groups like the Knights of Royal England travel around Britain and Europe staging medieval jousting tournaments. At the Danish museum Middelaldercentret, daily jousting tournaments are held during the season.

===Competitive jousting===
&quot;The Knights of Valour&quot; was a theatrical jousting group formed by Shane Adams in 1993. Members of this group began to practice jousting competitively, and their first tournament was held in 1997. Adams founded the World Championship Jousting Association (WCJA) as a body dedicated to jousting as a combat sport, which held its inaugural tournament in Port Elgin, Ontario on 24 July 1999. The sport is presented in the 2012 television show &quot;Full Metal Jousting&quot;, hosted by Adams. The rules are inspired by &quot;Realgestech&quot; (also &quot;Plankengestech&quot;), one of the forms of &quot;stechen&quot; practised in 16th-century Germany, where reinforcing pieces were added to the jousting armour to serve as designated target areas. Instead of using a shield, the jousters aim for such a reinforcing piece added to the armour&#x27;s left shoulder known as &quot;Brechschild&quot; (also &quot;Stechtartsche&quot;). A number of jousting events are held regularly in Europe, some organised by Arne Koets, including The Grand Tournament of Sankt Wendel and The Grand Tournament at Schaffhausen. Koets is one of a number of jousters who travel internationally to events.

<text>The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) is the permanent body of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), the national legislature of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It exercises the powers of the NPC when it is not in session.

The NPCSC is composed of a chairman, vice chairpersons, a secretary-general, and regular members, all of whom are elected by regular NPC sessions. The day-to-day operations of the Standing Committee are handled by the Council of Chairpersons, which is composed of the chairman, vice chairpersons, and the secretary-general. Although the parent NPC officially has superiority over the Standing Committee, and certain authorities are not delegated, the Standing Committee is generally viewed to have more &quot;de facto&quot; power, as the NPC convenes only once a year for two weeks, leaving its Standing Committee the only body that regularly drafts and approves decisions and laws.

== History ==
In 1954, the 1st National People&#x27;s Congress was held in Beijing, which became the statutory parliament of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Standing Committee was established as its permanent body. The 1954 Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China stipulates that &quot;the National People&#x27;s Congress is the sole organ that exercises the legislative power of the state&quot; and that the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress has only the power to &quot;interpret laws&quot; and &quot;enact decrees&quot;. However, because the number of delegates to the National People&#x27;s Congress is in the thousands and non-full-time, only one meeting is held annually, and the meeting period cannot be too long. The 2nd NPC authorized its Standing Committee the power to exercise legislative power when the NPC is not in session.

For a while after establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic, the power of the Standing Committee was limited to interpretation of its constitution and laws. At present, the NPC Standing Committee plays a key role in legislation and has the power to promulgate and amend most laws and decrees. Bills voted on by the National People&#x27;s Congress are usually submitted by the Standing Committee after its third reading.

During the political chaos of the Cultural Revolution, the NPC rarely held meetings and the Standing Committee virtually ceased to function. During this period, Chairman Zhu De and First Vice Chairman Dong Biwu had both died, which enabled Vice Chairman Soong Ching-ling, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, to exercise the functions and powers of Chairman of the NPCSC to a certain extent. With the abolition of the presidency in 1975, she effectively became the first female head of state in China by legal definition.

In 1980, after the decision of the 5th National People&#x27;s Congress, the &quot;Committee for the Amendment of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; was formally established, presided over by Ye Jianying, Soong Ching Ling and Peng Zhen, and including the main leaders of the democratic parties, social organizations and jurists. It was responsible for amending and establishing the new constitution. During the discussion on constitutional amendment, Hu Qiaomu, secretary general of the Constitution Revision Committee, proposed cutting the number of NPC deputies to 1,000 and setting up two chambers of 500 each under the NPC to make the NPC a permanent, bicameral body, in an attempt to change its image as a &quot;rubber stamp&quot;. Another committee member proposed to imitate the system used by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union with one chamber composed of representatives from different regions and the other composed of representatives from different professional sectors. Opponents, led by Deng Xiaoping and Ye Jianying, argued that &quot;if the two parties disagree, it will be very troublesome to coordinate and difficult to operate&quot;. A compromise was finally reached that greatly expanded the powers of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, making it a permanent legislature with the power to enact most laws and to review those for approval by the NPC.

== Composition ==
The NPCSC currently has 175 members, and consists of a chairman, vice chairpersons, a secretary-general, and regular members. The chairman presides over the NPCSC, and presides and convenes its work. The chairman has conventionally been one of the top members of the Chinese Communist Party, ranking as either the second-ranking or third-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee since 1998. The chairman, vice chairpersons and the secretary-general collectively make up the Council of Chairpersons, which handles the Standing Committee&#x27;s daily affairs. Members of the NPCSC must not, at the same time, hold executive, judicial, or supervisory positions. Other members of the NPC do not have this restriction.

=== Election ===
The Standing Committee is elected by and from the NPC delegates during a NPC plenary session. The candidates for the NPCSC chairperson, vice chairpersons, secretary-general, and regular members are nominally nominated by the NPC Presidium, though the nomination process is effectively controlled by the CCP. Elections for the non-regular NPCSC members, along with all other NPC elections are not competitive, with a single candidate proposed by the Presidium. In contrast, the elections for the regular NPCSC members have been the only competitive elections in the NPC since 1988; there are more nominees than available seats.

=== Administrative bodies ===
A number of administrative bodies have also been established under the Standing Committee to provide support for the day-to-day operation of the NPC. These include:

* General Office
* Legislative Affairs Commission
* Budgetary Affairs Commission
* Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law Committee
* Macao Special Administrative Region Basic Law Committee

== Functions and powers ==

=== Legislative ===
The NPC and its Standing Committee jointly exercise the power to enact laws in China. The legislative functions of the Standing Committee constitutionally include: drafting and revising laws except those to be enacted only by the full congress of the NPC; partially supplementing and amending, when the NPC is not in session, laws enacted by the NPC, provided that the basic principles of these laws are not contravened. As a result, day-to-day legislative work is conducted by the Standing Committee. Although the NPC has the power to revoke &quot;inappropriate decisions&quot; made by the Standing Committee, so far this power has never been used. As a result, the NPC Standing Committee often has a greater say in legislative deliberations.

The NPCSC has the power of judicial interpretation of the constitution and law in the PRC, including the Basic Law of Hong Kong and Macau. In contrast to common law jurisdiction in which &quot;stare decisis&quot; gives the power of both final interpretation and adjudication to a supreme court, within mainland China constitutional and legal interpretation is considered to be a legislative activity rather than a judicial one, and the functions are split so that the NPCSC provides legal interpretations while the Supreme People&#x27;s Court actually decides cases. Because an interpretation of the NPCSC is legislative in nature and not judicial, it does not affect cases which have already been decided.
=== Supervisory ===

The NPC Standing Committee has the power to supervise the enforcement of the Constitution. It supervises the work of the State Council, the Central Military Commission of the PRC, the National Supervisory Commission, the Supreme People&#x27;s Court and the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate. It has the power to annul administrative regulations, decisions and orders of the State Council that go against the Constitution and other legislative acts of the NPC and itself, and to annul local regulations or decisions of the organs of state power of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government that contravene the Constitution, other laws or administrative regulations of all levels of government, especially national.

=== Power to decide upon major state issues ===
When the NPC is not in session, the Standing Committee examines and approves partial adjustments to the plan for national economic and social development or to the state budget that prove necessary in the course of their implementation. The Standing Committee decides whether to ratify or abrogate treaties and important agreements reached with other countries. It institutes systems of titles and ranks for military and diplomatic personnel, and other specific titles and ranks, state medals and titles of honor as well as the granting of special pardons.

The NPCSC decides on general or partial mobilization, and on entering into a state of emergency throughout China or in particular provinces, autonomous regions or municipalities directly under the central government. When the NPC is not in session, the Standing Committee decides whether to proclaim a state of war in the event of an armed attack on China or in fulfillment of international treaty obligations concerning a common defense against aggression.

== Meetings and procedures ==
The term of office of a member of the NPC Standing Committee is the same as that of the current NPC, and is generally five years. It remains in power until the succeeding NPC elects its standing committee. It convenes the NPC once a year, and may do so when it finds it necessary or with a proposal from one fifth of NPC&#x27;s members.

The NPC Standing Committee usually holds a committee session once every two months, usually late in even-numbered months, with each session of the committee lasting a week. It may also hold interim sessions if there is a special need. The meetings are convened and chaired by the chairperson. The chairperson may delegate a vice chairperson to preside over a committee session on his or her behalf. Sessions of the Standing Committee may not be held unless a quorum is met of more than half of the members of the Standing Committee present. The Council of Chairpersons shall draft the session agenda of the Standing Committee for the period pertaining and refer it to a plenary session of the Standing Committee for a decision.

According to law, a bill may be proposed by the Chairperson&#x27;s Council, or submitted to the Committee by the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the Supreme People&#x27;s Court, the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate and deputies of the special committees of the National People&#x27;s Congress (or the committee chairmen of these). Ten or more deputies of the Standing Committee may also sign and introduce a bill. After the bill is introduced, the Chairman&#x27;s Council shall decide on the agenda of the ongoing session of the Standing Committee. The Chairman&#x27;s Council may refer the bill to the relevant special committee for deliberation and submit a report before deciding to put it on the agenda of the Standing Committee either for the current session or in forthcoming sessions. It also has the right to vote to reject the bill proposed by the above-mentioned body. When the Chairman&#x27;s Council rejects a bill, it shall explain the reasons to the Standing Committee and the bill sponsor.

A bill put on the agenda of a Standing Committee session shall be deliberated by the Standing Committee for three times before it is submitted to a vote by deputies. At the first reading, an explanation of the legislative bill made by its sponsor shall be heard in a plenary session of the Standing Committee and then it shall be preliminarily deliberated at group meetings by deputies in the period between sessions. At the second reading, a report of the Constitution and Law Committee on the revision of the draft law and main problems concerned shall be heard in a plenary session, and then the legislative bill shall be further deliberated at group meetings. At the third reading, a report of the aforementioned committee on the results of its deliberation over the draft law shall be heard in another plenary session, and then the revised draft of the law shall be deliberated at group meetings for any final changes. After the revised draft law has been deliberated during sessions of the Standing Committee, the Constitution and Law Committee revises it in accordance with the deliberation opinions of the Standing Committee members and prepares the final version to be voted on. The Council of Chairpersons then refers the legislative bill to the Standing Committee for a vote. If the Standing Committee fails to reach an agreement on the bill during the third reading, it shall convene joint group meetings and additional plenary sessions for further discussion, or invite relevant personages, experts and scholars to hold hearings regarding the bill before either the whole of the Committee or within groups. After reaching an agreement, it is sent for the vote in a plenary session.

For a bill that has been put on the agenda of the session of the Standing Committee, after each deliberation of the session of the Standing Committee, the draft law and the explanation of its drafting and amendment will be published on the website of the People&#x27;s Republic of China or the Chinese Government Legal Information Network for public comment.

When voting, the NPC Standing Committee session adopts the absolute majority system, that is, more than half of the committee members present in a session thus producing a quorum, and more than half of the committee members voted in favor, then the bill can be passed. When an affirmative vote and an abstention vote are equal, the chairman has no right to cast a decision vote, and the bill is vetoed.

In fact, although most of the bills deliberated by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) have been agreed upon at the third reading, there are still some bills that have been rejected at the voting stage in the history of the Standing Committee of the NPC. For example, in 1989, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress vetoed the &quot;Organic Law of the Urban Residents Committees of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (Draft) due to different opinions on the wording of the provisions of the bill. For example, in 1999, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress rejected the &quot;Highway Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (Amendment) with 77 votes in favor, 6 against, 42 abstentions and 29 people not participating in the voting, which was just 50% of the total votes.

== Cases ==

=== Regulations on Hong Kong ===
A notable use of the constitutional interpretation power occurred in 1999 over the right of abode issue in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in &quot;Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration&quot;. The NPCSC interpreted the Basic Law of Hong Kong in accordance with the position taken by the Hong Kong government with respect to the eligibility of permanent residency in Hong Kong.

In 2014, the NPCSC set rules for the election of the chief executive of Hong Kong, a decision that was widely opposed by the pro-democracy camp and led to the Umbrella Revolution.

In 2016, the NPCSC ruled that Hong Kong lawmakers who take their oath improperly could be immediately disqualified.

In June 2020, the NPCSC created and passed the Hong Kong National Security Law, legislation that was kept secret until shortly before it took effect. In November 2020, Carrie Lam sought help from the NPCSC to give authority for the Hong Kong government to disqualify 4 pro-democracy lawmakers from the Legislative Council.

In December 2020, it was reported that the NPCSC would move to diminish opposition from district councillors, by unseating those who &quot;breached the red line&quot; and also by removing the 117 seats belonging to district councillors in the chief executive election committee. Earlier in December 2019, Carrie Lam said that the opposition district councillors would be treated the same as those from the pro-Beijing camp, and that &quot;There is no question of the government&#x27;s commitment to continue to respect the roles and functions of the district council.&quot;

In March 2021, the NPCSC approved changes to Hong Kong&#x27;s electoral system, allowing only &quot;patriots&quot; to serve in the government, and also reducing democratic representation.

In December 2022, after John Lee asked the NPCSC whether Jimmy Lai could hire a foreign lawyer, the NPCSC ruled that foreign lawyers could only be hired for national security cases if approved by the chief executive or by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security.

<doc id="221567" wikidata="Q185647" url="?curid=221567" title="Alexander Scriabin">
<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin () was a Russian composer and pianist. Before 1903, Scriabin was greatly influenced by the music of Frédéric Chopin and composed in a relatively tonal, late-Romantic idiom. Later, and independently of his influential contemporary Arnold Schoenberg, Scriabin developed a much more dissonant musical language that had transcended usual tonality but was not atonal, which accorded with his personal brand of metaphysics. Scriabin found significant appeal in the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk as well as synesthesia, and associated colours with the various harmonic tones of his scale, while his colour-coded circle of fifths was also inspired by theosophy. He is often considered the main Russian symbolist composer and a major representative of the Russian Silver Age.

Scriabin was an innovator as well as one of the most controversial composer-pianists of the early 20th century. The &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; said of him, &quot;no composer has had more scorn heaped on him or greater love bestowed.&quot; Leo Tolstoy described Scriabin&#x27;s music as &quot;a sincere expression of genius.&quot; Scriabin&#x27;s oeuvre exerted a salient influence on the music world over time, and inspired composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, and Karol Szymanowski. But Scriabin&#x27;s importance in the Russian (subsequently Soviet) musical scene, and internationally, drastically declined after his death. According to his biographer Faubion Bowers, &quot;No one was more famous during their lifetime, and few were more quickly ignored after death.&quot; Nevertheless, his musical aesthetics have been reevaluated since the 1970s, and his ten published sonatas for piano and other works have been increasingly championed, garnering significant acclaim in recent years.

==Biography==

===Childhood and education (1872–1893)===

Scriabin was born in Moscow into a Russian noble family on Christmas Day, 1871, according to the Julian calendar. His father, Nikolai Aleksandrovich Scriabin, then a student at the Moscow State University, belonged to a modest noble family founded by Scriabin&#x27;s great-grandfather Ivan Alekseevich Scriabin, a soldier from Tula who had a brilliant military career and was granted hereditary nobility in 1819. Alexander&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Elizaveta Ivanovna Podchertkova, daughter of a captain lieutenant, came from a wealthy noble house of the Novgorod Governorate. His mother, Lyubov Petrovna Scriabina (née Schetinina), was a concert pianist and a former student of Theodor Leschetizky. She belonged to an ancient dynasty that traced its history back to Rurik; its founder, Semyon Feodorovich Yaroslavskiy, nicknamed Schetina (from the Russian &quot;schetina&quot; meaning &quot;stubble&quot;), was the great-grandson of Vasili, Prince of Yaroslavl. She died of tuberculosis when Alexander was only a year old.

After her death, Nikolai Scriabin completed tuition in the Turkish language in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Institute of Oriental Languages and left for Turkey. Like all his relatives, he followed a military path and served as a military attaché in the status of Active State Councillor; he was appointed an honorary consul in Lausanne during his later years. Alexander&#x27;s father left the infant Sasha (as he was known) with his grandmother, great-aunt, and aunt. Scriabin&#x27;s father later remarried, giving Scriabin a number of half-brothers and sisters. His aunt Lyubov (his father&#x27;s unmarried sister) was an amateur pianist who documented Sasha&#x27;s early life until he met his first wife. As a child, Scriabin was frequently exposed to piano playing; anecdotal references describe him demanding that his aunt play for him.

Apparently precocious, Scriabin began building pianos after becoming fascinated with piano mechanisms. He sometimes gave houseguests pianos he had built. Lyubov portrays Scriabin as very shy and unsociable with his peers, but appreciative of adult attention. According to one anecdote, Scriabin tried to conduct an orchestra composed of local children, an attempt that ended in frustration and tears. He performed his own plays and operas with puppets to willing audiences. He studied the piano from an early age, taking lessons with Nikolai Zverev, a strict disciplinarian, who was also the teacher of Sergei Rachmaninoff and other piano prodigies, though Scriabin was not a pensioner like Rachmaninoff.
In 1882, Scriabin enlisted in the Second Moscow Cadet Corps. As a student, he became friends with the actor Leonid Limontov, who in his memoirs recalls his reluctance to become friends with Scriabin, who was the smallest and weakest among all the boys and sometimes teased due to his stature. But Scriabin won his peers&#x27; approval at a concert where he performed on the piano. He ranked generally first in his class academically, but was exempt from drilling due to his physique and given time each day to practice piano.

Scriabin later studied at the Moscow Conservatory under Anton Arensky, Sergei Taneyev, and Vasily Safonov. He became a noted pianist despite his small hands, which could barely stretch to a ninth. Feeling challenged by Josef Lhévinne, he damaged his right hand while practicing Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Réminiscences de Don Juan&quot; and Mily Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Islamey&quot;. His doctor said he would never recover, and he wrote his first large-scale masterpiece, his Piano Sonata No. 1, Op. 6, as a &quot;cry against God, against fate.&quot; It was the third sonata he wrote, but the first to which he gave an opus number (his second was condensed and released as the &quot;Allegro Appassionato&quot;, Op. 4). He eventually regained the use of his hand.

In 1892 he graduated with the Little Gold Medal in piano performance, but did not complete a composition degree because of strong personality and musical differences with Arensky (whose faculty signature is the only one absent from Scriabin&#x27;s graduation certificate) and an unwillingness to compose pieces in forms that did not interest him.

===Early career (1894–1903)===
In 1894, Scriabin made his debut as a pianist in Saint Petersburg, performing his own works to positive reviews. The same year, Mitrofan Belyayev agreed to pay Scriabin to compose for his publishing company (he published works by notable composers such as Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov). In August 1897, Scriabin married the pianist Vera Ivanovna Isakovich, and then toured in Russia and abroad, culminating in a successful 1898 concert in Paris. That year he became a teacher at the Moscow Conservatory and began to establish his reputation as a composer. During this period he composed his cycle of études, Op. 8, several sets of preludes, his first three piano sonatas, and his only piano concerto, among other works, mostly for piano.

For five years, Scriabin was based in Moscow, during which time his old teacher Safonov conducted the first two of Scriabin&#x27;s symphonies.

According to later reports, between 1901 and 1903 Scriabin envisioned writing an opera. He expounded its ideas in the course of normal conversation. The work would center around a nameless hero, a philosopher-musician-poet. Among other things, he would declare: &quot;I am the apotheosis of world creation. I am the aim of aims, the end of ends.&quot; The Poem Op. 32 No. 2 and the &quot;Poème tragique&quot; Op. 34 were originally conceived as arias in the opera.

===Leaving Russia (1903–09)===
By 13 March 1904, Scriabin and his wife had relocated to Geneva, Switzerland. While living here, Scriabin separated legally from his wife, with whom he had had four children. He also began working on his Symphony No. 3 here. The work was performed in Paris during 1905, where Scriabin was accompanied by Tatiana Fyodorovna Schlözer—a former pupil and the niece of the pianist and composer Paul de Schlözer and sister of the music critic Boris de Schlözer. Tatiana would become Scriabin&#x27;s second wife, with whom Scriabin had other children.

With a wealthy sponsor&#x27;s financial assistance, Scriabin spent several years travelling in Switzerland, Italy, France, Belgium and the United States, working on more orchestral pieces, including several symphonies. He also began to compose &quot;poems&quot; for the piano, a form with which he is particularly associated. While in New York City, in 1907, he became acquainted with the Canadian composer Alfred La Liberté, who became a personal friend and disciple.

In 1907, Scriabin settled in Paris with his family and was involved with a series of concerts organized by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who was actively promoting Russian music in the West at the time. He subsequently relocated to Brussels (rue de la Réforme 45) with his family.

===Return to Russia (1909–15)===
In 1909, Scriabin permanently returned to Russia, where he continued to compose, working on increasingly grandiose projects. For some time before his death he had planned a multimedia work, to be performed in the Himalayas, that would cause a so-called &quot;armageddon&quot;, &quot;a grandiose religious synthesis of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world.&quot; Scriabin left only sketches for this piece, &quot;Mysterium&quot;, although a preliminary part, &quot;L&#x27;acte préalable&quot; (&quot;Prefatory Action&quot;), was eventually made into a performable version by . Part of that unfinished piece was performed with the title &quot;Prefatory Action&quot; by Vladimir Ashkenazy in Berlin with Alexei Lubimov at the piano. Nemtin eventually completed a second portion (&quot;Mankind&quot;) and a third (&quot;Transfiguration&quot;), and Ashkenazy recorded his entire two-and-a-half-hour completion with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin for Decca. Several late pieces published during Scriabin&#x27;s lifetime are believed to have been intended for &quot;Mysterium&quot;, such as the &quot;Two Dances&quot;, Op. 73.

===Death===
Scriabin gave his last concert on 2 April 1915 in Saint Petersburg, performing a large programme of his own works. He received rave reviews from music critics, who called his playing &quot;most inspiring and affecting&quot;, and wrote, &quot;his eyes flashed fire and his face radiated happiness&quot;. Scriabin himself wrote that during his performance of his Sonata No. 3, Op. 23, &quot;I completely forgot I was playing in a hall with people around me. This happens very rarely to me on the platform.&quot; He elaborated that he normally &quot;had to watch himself very carefully, look at himself as if from afar, to keep himself in control.&quot;

Scriabin returned triumphantly to his Moscow apartment on 4 April. He noticed a resurgence of a little pimple on his right upper lip. He had mentioned the pimple as early as 1914 while in London. His temperature rose, and he took to bed and cancelled his Moscow concert for 11 April. The pimple became a pustule, then a carbuncle and a furuncle. Scriabin&#x27;s doctor remarked that the sore looked &quot;like purple fire&quot;. His temperature shot up to and he was now bedridden. Incisions were made on 12 April, but the sore had already begun to poison his blood, and he became delirious. Bowers writes: &quot;Intractably and inexplicably, a simple spot had grown into a terminal ailment.&quot; On 14 April 1915, at age 43 and at the height of his career, Scriabin died in his Moscow apartment of sepsis.
==Music==


Rather than seeking musical versatility, Scriabin was happy to write almost exclusively for solo piano and for orchestra. His earliest piano pieces resemble Chopin&#x27;s and include music in many genres that Chopin employed, such as the étude, the prelude, the nocturne, and the mazurka. Scriabin&#x27;s music rapidly evolved over the course of his life. The mid- and late-period pieces use very unusual harmonies and textures.

The development of Scriabin&#x27;s style can be traced in his ten piano sonatas: the earliest are composed in a fairly conventional late-Romantic manner and reveal the influence of Chopin and sometimes Liszt, but the later ones are very different, the last five lacking a key signature. Many passages in them can be said to be tonally vague, though from 1903 through 1908, &quot;tonal unity was almost imperceptibly replaced by harmonic unity.&quot;

===First period (1880s–1903)===
Scriabin&#x27;s first period is usually considered to last from his earliest pieces to his Symphony No. 2, Op. 29. The works from this period adhere to the romantic tradition, employing common-practice harmonic language. But Scriabin&#x27;s voice is present from the very beginning, in this case by his fondness for the dominant function and added tone chords.

Scriabin&#x27;s early harmonic language was especially fond of the 13th dominant chord, usually with the 7th, 3rd, and 13th spelled in fourths. This voicing can also be seen in several of Chopin&#x27;s works. According to Peter Sabbagh, this voicing was the main generating source of the later mystic chord. More importantly, Scriabin was fond of simultaneously combining two or more different dominant-seventh enhancements, such as 9ths, altered 5ths, and raised 11ths. But despite these tendencies, slightly more dissonant than usual for the time, all these dominant chords were treated according to the traditional rules: the added tones resolved to the corresponding adjacent notes, and the whole chord was treated as a dominant, fitting inside tonality and diatonic, functional harmony.

===Second period (1903–07)===
This period begins with Scriabin&#x27;s Sonata No. 4, Op. 30, and ends around his Sonata No. 5, Op. 53 and the &quot;Poem of Ecstasy&quot;, Op. 54. During this period, Scriabin&#x27;s music becomes more chromatic and dissonant, yet still mostly adheres to functional tonality. As dominant chords are more and more extended, they gradually lose their tensive function. Scriabin wanted his music to have a radiant, shining feeling, and attempted this by raising the number of chord tones. During this time, complex forms like the mystic chord are hinted at, but still show their roots in Chopinesque harmony.

At first, the added dissonances resolve conventionally according to voice leading, but the focus slowly shifts to a system in which chord coloring is most important. Later on, fewer dissonances in the dominant chords are resolved. According to Sabbagh, &quot;the dissonances are frozen, solidified in a color-like effect in the chord&quot;; the added notes become part of it.

===Third period (1907–15)===
According to Samson, while the sonata form of Scriabin&#x27;s Sonata No. 5 has some meaning to the work&#x27;s tonal structure, in his Sonatas Nos. 6, Op. 62 and 7, Op. 64 formal tensions are created by the absence of harmonic contrast and &quot;between the cumulative momentum of the music, usually achieved by textural rather than harmonic means, and the formal constraints of the tripartite mould&quot;. He also argues that the &quot;Poem of Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Vers la flamme&quot; &quot;find a much happier co-operation of &#x27;form&#x27; and &#x27;content and that later sonatas, such as No. 9, Op. 68 (&quot;Black Mass&quot;), employ a more flexible sonata form.

According to Claude Herndon, in Scriabin&#x27;s late music &quot;tonality has been attenuated to the point of virtual extinction, although dominant sevenths, which are among the strongest indicators of tonality, preponderate. The progression of their roots in minor thirds or diminished fifths [...] dissipate the suggested tonality.&quot;

Varvara Dernova writes, &quot;The tonic continued to exist, and, if necessary, the composer could employ it . . . but in the great majority of cases, he preferred the concept of a tonic in distant perspective, so to speak, rather than the actually sounding tonic . . . The relationship of the tonic and dominant functions in Scriabin&#x27;s work is changed radically; for the dominant actually appears and has a varied structure, while the tonic exists only as if in the imagination of the composer, the performer, and the listener.&quot;

Most of the music of this period is built on the acoustic and octatonic scales, as well as the nine-note scale resulting from their combination.

==Philosophy==
Scriabin was interested in the philosophies and aesthetics of German authors such as Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Nietzsche, all of whom greatly influenced his musical and philosophical thought. He also showed interest in theosophy and the writings of Helena Blavatsky, making contact with theosophists such as Jean Delville. Though Scriabin has commonly been associated with theosophy, &quot;The extent to which Scriabin seriously studied Theosophy ... is debatable, but nevertheless these associations earned him significant press coverage.&quot; Even Scriabin&#x27;s brother-in-law, Boris de Schlözer, said that despite Scriabin&#x27;s general interest in theosophy, he never took it seriously and was even disappointed by certain aspects of it.

Scriabin used poetry to express his philosophical notions, and he communicated much of his philosophical thought through his music, the most prominent examples being The Poem of Ecstasy and Vers la flamme.

=== Mysticism ===
The main sources of Scriabin&#x27;s philosophy can be found in his notebooks, published posthumously. These writings are infamous for containing the declaration, &quot;I am God.&quot; This phrase, often wrongly attributed to a megalomaniac personality by those unfamiliar with mysticism, is in fact a declaration of extreme humility in both Eastern and Western mysticism. In these traditions, the individual ego is so fully eradicated that only God remains. Different traditions have used different terms (e.g., fana, samadhi) to refer to essentially the same state of consciousness. Although scholars contest Scriabin&#x27;s status as a theosophist, there is no denying that he was a mystic, especially influenced by a range of Russian mystics and spiritual thinkers, such as Solovyov and Berdyayev, both of whom Scriabin knew. The notion of , the bedrock of Russian mysticism, is another contributing factor to Scriabin&#x27;s declaration &quot;I am God&quot;: if everything is interconnected and everything is God, then I, too, am God, as much as anything else.

=== Russian cosmism ===
Recent scholarship has positioned Scriabin within the tradition of early Russian cosmism. Originating from Nikolai Fyodorov&#x27;s and Solovyov&#x27;s ideas, Russian cosmism sought to unite humanity in a cosmic evolution, integrating spirituality and technology. Such cosmist ideas were hugely popular in Russia, and as a child of his age, Scriabin &quot;demonstrates a creative adaptation of ideas typical of late imperial Russia&quot; and emphasizes &quot;concepts that corresponded to his intellectual contemporaries&#x27; preoccupation with &quot;unity&quot; and eschatological visions of life transformation.&quot; Scriabin was deeply influenced by figures like Solovyov, Berdyaev, and Bulgakov, and their spiritual ideas. Russian cosmism is an action-oriented tradition that aims to unite humanity through various means, from technology to spirituality, in a cosmic mission of active evolution and transformation. Scriabin&#x27;s unique contribution to Russian cosmism was &quot;the centrality of music’s role in his philosophy&quot;, believing in music&#x27;s transformative power to achieve cosmist goals. This contrasts with other cosmists, who focused more on religious, scientific, or technological means. Scriabin&#x27;s philosophy integrates music and spirituality, seeing them as interconnected pathways to mystical union.

Scriabin&#x27;s works reflect key cosmist themes: the importance of art, cosmos, monism, destination, and a common task for humanity. His music, embodying flight and space exploration themes, aligns with cosmist beliefs in humanity&#x27;s cosmic destiny. His philosophical ideas, particularly his declarations of being God and ideas about unity and multiplicity, should be understood within the mystical context of early Russian cosmism, emphasizing unity between man, God, and nature.

=== &quot;Mysterium&quot; ===
Apart from Scriabin&#x27;s finished works (e.g.&quot;, The Poem of Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Vers la flamme&quot;) that encapsulate his philosophical ideas, perhaps his unfinished work &quot;Mysterium&quot; represents the culmination of his mystico-philosophical worldview. Scriabin &quot;came to believe that he had a mission to regenerate mankind through art. This goal was to be achieved by means of a work which he referred to as the &quot;Mystery&quot;, which was to last seven days, would involve all means of expression and all of humanity, and would transform the world.&quot; Ideas of unity, transcendence, the synthesis of arts, and transformation pervade &quot;Mysterium&quot;.

==Influence of colour==
Though Scriabin&#x27;s late works are often considered to be influenced by synesthesia, an involuntary condition wherein one experiences sensation in one sense in response to stimulus in another, it is doubted that Scriabin actually experienced this. His colour system, unlike most synesthetic &quot;experience&quot;, accords with the circle of fifths, which tends to prove it was mostly a conceptual system based on Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot;.

Scriabin did not, for his theory, recognize a difference between major and a minor tonality with the same tonic, such as C minor and C major. Indeed, influenced by theosophy, he developed his system of synesthesia toward what would have been a pioneering multimedia performance: his unrealized magnum opus &quot;Mysterium&quot; was to be a weeklong performance including music, scent, dance, and light in the foothills of the Himalayas that was somehow to bring about the world&#x27;s dissolution in bliss.

In his autobiographical &quot;Recollections,&quot; Rachmaninoff recorded a conversation he had had with Scriabin and Rimsky-Korsakov about Scriabin&#x27;s association of colour and music. Rachmaninoff was surprised to find that Rimsky-Korsakov agreed with Scriabin about associations of musical keys with colors; himself skeptical, Rachmaninoff made the obvious objection that the two composers did not always agree on the colours involved. Both maintained that D major is golden-brown, but Scriabin linked E-flat major with red-purple, while Rimsky-Korsakov favored blue. Rimsky-Korsakov protested that a passage in Rachmaninoff&#x27;s opera &quot;The Miserly Knight&quot; accorded with their claim: the scene in which the Old Baron opens treasure chests to reveal gold and jewels glittering in torchlight is in D major. Scriabin told Rachmaninoff, &quot;your intuition has unconsciously followed the laws whose very existence you have tried to deny.&quot;

Scriabin wrote only a small number of orchestral works, but they are among his most famous, and some are performed frequently. They include a piano concerto (1896), and five symphonic works: three numbered symphonies, &quot;The Poem of Ecstasy&quot; (1908), and &quot;&quot; (1910), which includes a part for a machine known as a &quot;clavier à lumières&quot;, also known as a &quot;Luce&quot; (Italian for &quot;light&quot;), a colour organ designed specifically for the performance of Scriabin&#x27;s tone poem. It was played like a piano, but projected coloured light on a screen in the concert hall rather than sound. Most performances of the piece (including the premiere) have omitted this light element, although a performance in New York City in 1915 projected colours onto a screen. It has been erroneously claimed that this performance used the &quot;colour-organ&quot; invented by English painter A. Wallace Rimington; in fact, it was a novel construction supervised personally and built in New York specifically for the performance by Preston S. Miller, the president of the Illuminating Engineering Society.

On 22 November 1969, the work was fully realized, making use of the composer&#x27;s color score as well as newly developed laser technology on loan from Yale&#x27;s Physics Department, by John Mauceri and the Yale Symphony Orchestra and designed by Richard N. Gould, who projected the colors into the auditorium reflected by Mylar vests worn by the audience. The Yale Symphony repeated the presentation in 1971 and brought the work to Paris that year for what was perhaps its Paris premiere at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. The piece was reprised at Yale again in 2010 (, who, with Justin Townsend, wrote &quot;Scriabin and the Possible&quot;).

Scriabin&#x27;s original colour keyboard, with its associated turntable of coloured lamps, is preserved in his apartment near the Arbat in Moscow, which is now a museum dedicated to his life and works.

==Recordings and performers==
Scriabin himself made recordings of 19 of his own works, using 20 piano rolls, six for the Welte-Mignon, and 14 for Ludwig Hupfeld of Leipzig. The Welte rolls were recorded in February 1910 in Moscow, and have been replayed and published on CD. Those recorded for Hupfeld include the Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3 (Opp. 19 and 23). While this indirect evidence of Scriabin&#x27;s pianism prompted a mixed critical reception, close analysis of the recordings within the context of the limitations of the particular piano roll technology can shed light on the free style he favoured for his own works, characterized by extemporary variations in tempo, rhythm, articulation, dynamics, and sometimes even the notes.

Pianists who have performed Scriabin to particular critical acclaim include Vladimir Sofronitsky, Vladimir Horowitz and Sviatoslav Richter. Sofronitsky never met Scriabin, as his parents forbade him to attend a concert due to illness. Sofronitsky said he never forgave them, but he married Scriabin&#x27;s daughter Elena. According to Horowitz, when he played for Scriabin as an 11-year-old, Scriabin responded enthusiastically and encouraged him to pursue a full musical and artistic education. When Rachmaninoff performed Scriabin&#x27;s music, Scriabin criticized his pianism and his admirers as earthbound.

Surveys of the solo piano works have been recorded by Gordon Fergus-Thompson, , Maria Lettberg, Joseph Villa, Michael Ponti, and Elina Akselrud. The complete published sonatas have also been recorded by Dmitri Alexeev, Ashkenazy, Robert Taub, Håkon Austbø, Boris Berman, Bernd Glemser, Marc-André Hamelin, Yakov Kasman, Ruth Laredo, John Ogdon, Garrick Ohlsson, Roberto Szidon, Anatol Ugorski, Anna Malikova, Mariangela Vacatello, Mikhail Voskresensky, and Igor Zhukov, among others.

Other prominent performers of Scriabin&#x27;s piano music include Samuil Feinberg, Elena Bekman-Shcherbina, Nikolai Demidenko, Marta Deyanova, Sergio Fiorentino, Andrei Gavrilov, Emil Gilels, Glenn Gould, Andrej Hoteev, Evgeny Kissin, Anton Kuerti, Elena Kuschnerova, Piers Lane, Eric Le Van, Alexander Melnikov, Stanislav Neuhaus, Artur Pizarro, Mikhail Pletnev, Jonathan Powell, Burkard Schliessmann, Grigory Sokolov, Alexander Satz, Yevgeny Sudbin, Matthijs Verschoor, Arcadi Volodos, Roger Woodward, Evgeny Zarafiants, , Margarita Shevchenko , and Daniil Trifonov.

In 2015, German-Australian pianist Stefan Ammer, as a part of &quot;The Scriabin Project Concert Series&quot;, joined his pupils Mekhla Kumar, Konstantin Shamray, and Ashley Hribar to honour Scriabin at various venues in Australia.

==Reception and influence==
Scriabin&#x27;s funeral, on 16 April 1915, was attended by so many people that tickets had to be issued. Rachmaninoff, a pallbearer, subsequently embarked on a grand tour of Russia, performing only Scriabin&#x27;s music for the family&#x27;s benefit. It was the first time Rachmaninoff had publicly performed piano music other than his own. Prokofiev admired Scriabin, and his &quot;Visions fugitives&quot; bears great likeness to Scriabin&#x27;s tone and style. Another admirer was the English composer Kaikhosru Sorabji, who promoted Scriabin even during the years when his popularity had decreased greatly. Aaron Copland praised Scriabin&#x27;s thematic material as &quot;truly individual, truly inspired&quot;, but criticized Scriabin for putting &quot;this really new body of feeling into the strait-jacket of the old classical sonata-form, recapitulation and all&quot;, calling this &quot;one of the most extraordinary mistakes in all music.&quot;

The work of Nikolai Roslavets, unlike Prokofiev&#x27;s and Stravinsky&#x27;s, is often seen as a direct extension of Scriabin&#x27;s. But unlike Scriabin&#x27;s, Roslavets&#x27; music was not explained with mysticism and eventually was given theoretical explication by the composer. Roslavets was not alone in his innovative extension of Scriabin&#x27;s musical language, as quite a few Soviet composers and pianists, such as Feinberg, Sergei Protopopov, Nikolai Myaskovsky, and Alexander Mosolov followed this legacy until Stalinist politics quelled it in favor of Socialist Realism.

Scriabin&#x27;s music was greatly disparaged in the West during the 1930s. In the UK Sir Adrian Boult refused to play the Scriabin selections chosen by the BBC programmer Edward Clark, calling it &quot;evil music&quot;, and even banned Scriabin&#x27;s music from broadcasts in the 1930s. In 1935, Gerald Abraham called Scriabin a &quot;sad pathological case, erotic and egotistic to the point of mania&quot;. At the same time, the pianist Edward Mitchell, who compiled a catalogue of Scriabin&#x27;s piano music in 1927, was championing his music in recitals and regarded him as &quot;the greatest composer since Beethoven&quot;.

Scriabin&#x27;s music has since undergone a total rehabilitation and can be heard in major concert halls worldwide. In 2009, Roger Scruton called Scriabin &quot;one of the greatest of modern composers&quot;.

In 2020, a bust of Scriabin was placed in the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory.

==Relatives and descendants==
Scriabin was the uncle of Metropolitan Anthony Bloom of Sourozh, a renowned bishop in the Russian Orthodox Church who directed the Russian Orthodox diocese in Great Britain between 1957 and 2003. Scriabin was not a relative of Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov, whose birth name was Vyacheslav Skryabin. In his memoirs published by Felix Chuyev under the Russian title &quot;Молотов, Полудержавный властелин&quot;, Molotov explains that his brother Nikolay Skryabin, who was also a composer, had adopted the name Nikolay Nolinsky in order not to be confused with Alexander Scriabin.

Scriabin had seven children in total: from his first marriage Rimma (Rima), Elena, Marina (1901–1989), and Lev, and from his second Ariadna (1906–1944), Julian, and Marina. Rimma died of intestinal issues in 1905 at age seven. Marina became an actress at the Second Moscow Art Theatre and the wife of director Vladimir Tatarinov. Lev also died at age seven, in 1910. At this point, relations with Scriabin&#x27;s first wife had significantly deteriorated, and Scriabin did not meet her at the funeral.

Ariadna became a hero of the French Resistance, and was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de la Résistance. Her third marriage was to the poet and WWII Resistance fighter David Knut, after which she converted to Judaism and took the name Sarah. She co-founded the Zionist resistance movement Armée Juive and was responsible for communications between the command in Toulouse and the partisan forces in the Tarn district and for taking weapons to the partisans, which resulted in her death when she was ambushed by the French Militia.
Ariadna&#x27;s daughter (by her first marriage to French composer David Lazarus), Betty (Elizabeth) Knut-Lazarus, became a famous teenage heroine of the French Resistance, personally winning the Silver Star from George S. Patton, as well as the French Croix de Guerre. After the war she became an active member of the Zionist Lehi (Stern Gang), undertaking special operations for the militant group, and she was imprisoned in 1947 for launching a terrorist letter bomb campaign against British targets and planting explosives on British ships that had been trying to prevent Jewish immigrants from travelling to Mandatory Palestine. Regarded as a heroine in France, she was released prematurely but imprisoned a year later in Israel for alleged involvement in the killing of Folke Bernadotte. The charges were later dropped. After her release from prison, she settled at age 23 in Beersheba, Israel, where she had three children and founded a nightclub that became Beersheba&#x27;s cultural centre. She died at age 38.

In total, three of Ariadna&#x27;s children immigrated to Israel after the war, where her son Eli (born 1935) became a sailor in the Israeli Navy and a noted classical guitarist, while her son Joseph (Yossi, born 1943) served in the Israeli special forces, before becoming a poet, publishing many poems dedicated to his mother. One of her great-grandsons, via Betty Knut-Lazarus, Elisha Abas, is an Israeli concert pianist.

Julian, a child prodigy, was a composer and pianist, but died by drowning at age 11 (1919) in the Dnieper River in Ukraine.

<text>A basic law is either a codified constitution, or in countries with uncodified constitutions, a law designed to have the effect of a constitution. The term &quot;basic law&quot; is used in some places as an alternative to &quot;constitution&quot; and may be intended as a temporary but necessary measure, until the formal enactment of a constitution. &quot;Basic law&quot; is sometimes used to avoid it being taken to be, like a constitution, &quot;the highest law&quot;. There may be various reasons, such as religion, for this.

== Germany ==

In West Germany the term &quot;Basic Law&quot; () was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate reunification of Germany. However, when Germany finally reunified in 1990, no new constitutions were adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory.

== Hong Kong and Macau ==

The Special Administrative Regions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, namely Hong Kong and Macau, have basic laws as their constitutional documents. The basic laws are the highest authority, respectively, in the territories, while the rights of amendment and interpretation rest with the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Israel ==
The Basic Laws of Israel are fourteen quasi-constitutional laws of the State of Israel, were originally intended to be draft chapters of a future Israeli constitution, which has been indefinitely postponed since 1950.

== Saudi Arabia ==
Promulgated in 1992, the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia has nine chapters, consisting of 83 articles without a separate preamble. While the Saudi king exercises sovereign authority, the constitutional principles are explicitly tied to Islamic theology and Sharia law. Following the issuance of the basic law, an advisory consultative council was established in 1993.

== List of basic laws ==

* Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany
* Basic Law of Saudi Arabia
* Basic Law, Fundamental Law or Constitution of Hungary
* Basic Laws of Israel
* Basic Laws of Sweden
* Basic Statute of Oman
* Hong Kong Basic Law
* Macao Basic Law
* Philippine Bangsamoro Organic Law (sometimes called the Bangsamoro Basic Law)

<text>Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus (c. 229 – 160 BC) was a consul of the Roman Republic, as well as a general, who conquered the kingdom of Macedonia during the Third Macedonian War.

==Family==
Paullus&#x27; father was Lucius Aemilius Paullus, the consul defeated and killed in the Battle of Cannae. He was, in his time, the head of his branch of the Aemilii Paulii, an old and aristocratic patrician family. Their influence was immense, particularly due to their fortune and alliance with the Cornelii Scipiones. He was father to Scipio Aemilianus and another son known as Fabius, who were tutored by Paullus&#x27; friend Polybius.

==Early career==
After the fulfillment of Paullus&#x27; military service, and being elected military tribune, he was elected curule aedile in 193. The next step of his &quot;cursus honorum&quot; was his election as praetor in 191. During his term of office, he went to the Hispania provinces, where he campaigned against the Lusitanians between 191 and 189. However, he failed to be elected consul for several years. Paullus was elected consul for the first time in 182, with Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus as junior partner. His next military command, with &quot;proconsular imperium&quot;, was in 181, against the Ingauni of Liguria.

==Later career==
The Third Macedonian War broke out in 171, when King Perseus of Macedon defeated a Roman army led by the consul Publius Licinius Crassus in the Battle of Callinicus. After two years of indecisive results for either side, Paullus was elected consul again in 168 (with Gaius Licinius Crassus as his colleague). As consul, he was appointed by the Senate to deal with the Macedonian war. Shortly afterward, on 22 June, he won the decisive Battle of Pydna. Perseus of Macedonia was made prisoner and the Third Macedonian War ended.

In 167, Paullus received the Senate&#x27;s instruction to return to Rome after first pillaging Epirus, a kingdom suspected of sympathizing with the Macedonian cause. After loading the treasures in the Macedonian royal palace onto Rome-bound ships, he marched his army to Epirus, where contrary to his inclination, he ordered the plunder of seventy towns, resulting in the enslavement of 150,000 people.

Paullus&#x27; return to Rome was glorious. With the immense plunder collected in Macedonia and Epirus, he celebrated a spectacular triumph, featuring no less than the captured king of Macedonia himself, and the king&#x27;s sons, putting an end to the Antigonid dynasty. As a gesture of acknowledgement, the Senate awarded him the nickname (&quot;agnomen&quot;) &quot;Macedonicus&quot;. This was the peak of his career. In 164 he was elected censor. He fell ill, appeared to recover, but relapsed within three days and died during his term of office in 160.

==Family life and descendants==

Paullus&#x27;s father Lucius Aemilius Paullus died in the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC, when Paullus was still a boy. The Aemilii Paulli were connected by marriage and political interests to the Scipios, but their role in his subsequent upbringing is not clear.

Paullus had been married first to Papiria Masonis (or Papiria Masonia), daughter of the consul Gaius Papirius Maso (consul in 231 BC), whom he divorced, according to Plutarch, for no particular reason. From this marriage, four children were born: two sons and two daughters. He divorced his wife while his younger son was still a baby, according to Roman historians; thus the divorce probably took place around 183–182 BC. Nevertheless, he was elected consul in 182.

Paullus then married a second time (this wife&#x27;s name is unknown) and had two more sons, the elder born around 181 and the younger born around 176, and another daughter, Aemilia Tertia, who was a small girl when he was chosen consul for the second time.

Since four boys were too many for a father to support through the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, Paullus decided to give the oldest two boys up for adoption, probably between 175 and 170. The elder boy was adopted in the Fabia family and became Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, thus joining his fortunes to the house of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, a national hero. The younger boy, possibly named Lucius, was adopted by his own cousin, Publius Cornelius Scipio, elder son and heir of Scipio Africanus, and became Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, thus becoming heir to the legacy of Rome&#x27;s most influential political dynasty.

With the eldest sons safely adopted by two of the most powerful patrician houses, Paullus counted on the two younger ones to continue his own name. Both of them died young, one shortly after the other, at the same time that Paullus celebrated his triumph. The elder of the two remaining sons was 14 and the younger 9, according to Polybius. Their names are unknown to us. The successes of his political and military career were thus not accompanied by a happy family life.

At Paullus&#x27; death, his sons Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus and Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Aemilianus received his property by his will, even though they were legally no longer Aemilii Paulli; Scipio gave his share to his older brother who was less wealthy. Paullus&#x27;s second wife (whose name is unknown to us) received her dowry back from the sale of some of her late husband&#x27;s property (Livy and Polybius both claim that Paullus died relatively poor, and that he had kept little for himself from the successful Macedonian campaign).

With the death of Paullus, the Aemilii Paulli became extinct, even though he had two living sons. His elder surviving son Fabius Aemilianus eventually became consul and fathered at least one son, who in turn became consul as Fabius Allobrigicus in 121. This man, in turn, may have been the ancestor of later Fabii who tied their fortunes to Julius Caesar and Augustus. The younger surviving son was more famous as Scipio Aemilianus but died leaving no known issue.

Paullus&#x27; first and former wife Papiria Masonia survived her ex-husband and lived to enjoy her former sister-in-law&#x27;s property presented to her by her younger son (per Polybius). At her death, her property was divided between her sons, but Scipio gave it to his sisters.

Of Paullus&#x27; daughters, one of the eldest two married Quintus Aelius Tubero from a relatively poor plebeian family; she was the mother of Quintus Aelius Tubero. The youngest, Aemilia Paulla Tertia, married the eldest son of Marcus Porcius Cato and was the mother of consuls Marcus Porcius Cato and Gaius Porcius Cato.

<text>Seth Barnes Nicholson (November 12, 1891 – July 2, 1963) was an American astronomer. He worked at the Lick observatory in California, and is known for discovering several moons of Jupiter in the 20th century.

Nicholson was born in Springfield, Illinois, and was raised in rural Illinois. He was educated at Drake University, where he became interested in astronomy. On May 29, 1913, he was married to Alma Stotts, a fellow student at Drake then the University of California at Berkeley. They would have three children: Margaret, Donald, and Jean.

In 1914, at the University of California&#x27;s Lick Observatory, while observing the recently discovered Jupiter moon Pasiphaë, he discovered a new one, Sinope, whose orbit he computed for his Ph.D. thesis in 1915.

He spent his entire career at Mount Wilson Observatory, where he discovered three more Jovian moons: Lysithea and Carme in 1938, and Ananke in 1951. While at the Palomar Observatory in 1957, he discovered 1647 Menelaus, an asteroid near Jupiter. Other work included computing the orbits of several comets and also that of Pluto.

Sinope, Lysithea, Carme, and Ananke were simply designated as &quot;Jupiter IX&quot;, &quot;Jupiter X&quot;, &quot;Jupiter XI&quot;, and &quot;Jupiter XII&quot;. They were not given their present names until 1975. Nicholson himself declined to propose names.

At Mt. Wilson, his main assignment concerned solar activity and he produced for decades annual reports on sunspot activity. He also made a number of eclipse expeditions to measure the brightness and temperature of the Sun&#x27;s corona.

In the early 1920s, he and Edison Pettit made the first systematic infrared observations of celestial objects.
They used a vacuum thermocouple to measure the infrared radiation and thus the temperature of the Moon which led to the theory that the Moon was covered with a thin layer of dust acting as an insulator, and also of the planets, sunspots and stars.
Their temperatures measurements of nearby giant stars led to some of the first determinations of stellar diameters.

Nicholson, together with astronomer George Ellery Hale, lend their name to the &quot;Hale-Nicholson law&quot; concerning the magnetic polarity of sunspots.

From 1943 to 1955, he served as editor of the &quot;Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific&quot;, of which he was also twice president.

He died in Los Angeles. His final resting place is in dispute, but he was cremated and his remains were likely dispersed by his son.

==Awards and honors==
* Awarded the Bruce Medal (1963)
* The asteroid 1831 Nicholson, the lunar crater Nicholson, the Martian crater Nicholson, and the feature Nicholson Regio on Ganymede were named after him.

<text>Paul Le Mat (born September 22, 1945) is an American actor. He first came to prominence with his role in &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973); his performance was met with critical acclaim and earned him the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor.

Le Mat&#x27;s breakout performance in George Lucas&#x27; &quot;American Graffiti&quot; landed him the lead role in box office hit &quot;Aloha, Bobby and Rose&quot; (1975). He also is known for his work in the Jonathan Demme films &quot;Handle with Care&quot; (1977) and &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; (1980). He won another Golden Globe award for his performance in the TV film &quot;The Burning Bed&quot; (1984) and starred in the cult film &quot;Puppet Master&quot; (1989), which spawned a franchise.

==Early life and education==
Le Mat was born to Matthew (1914–1963) and Elizabeth LeMat (1917–2016). He graduated from Newport Harbor High School in 1963, and attended San Diego City College, Cypress Junior College, Chapman College, and eventually received an Associate of Arts degree from Los Angeles Valley College. Le Mat served in the Vietnam War with the U.S. Navy on an SP-5B Marlin seaplane in a maritime patrol squadron.

==Career==
Le Mat starred in the pilot episode of &quot;Firehouse&quot; in 1973. In the same year, he appeared in &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, a coming-of-age film about a group of friends in Modesto, California in the early 1960s. He played John Milner - a role that would earn him his first Golden Globe Award. Le Mat also starred in Floyd Mutrux&#x27;s 1975 crime spree film &quot;Aloha, Bobby and Rose&quot;, another commercial hit.

<text>Lucius Aemilius Paullus (died 2 August 216 BC), also spelled Paulus, was a consul of the Roman Republic twice, in 219 and 216 BC. He is primarily remembered for being one of the commanders of the Roman army at the Battle of Cannae, and for his death in the same battle. 

== Biography ==
Lucius Aemilius Paullus was the son of Marcus Aemilius Paullus, the consul of 255 BC. Paullus shared his first consulship with Marcus Livius Salinator. During this year, he defeated Demetrius of Pharos in the Second Illyrian War, and forced him to flee to the court of Philip V of Macedon. On his return to Rome, he was awarded a triumph. He was subsequently charged, along with his colleague, with unfairly dividing the spoils, although he was acquitted.

During the Second Punic War, Paullus was made consul a second time and served with Gaius Terentius Varro. He shared the command of the army with Varro at the Battle of Cannae. Varro led out the troops against the advice of Paullus and the battle became a crushing defeat for the Romans. Paullus died in the battle, while Varro managed to escape.

In Silius Italicus&#x27; epic poem &quot;Punica&quot;, Paullus is described as killing the Carthaginian commander Viriathus prior to his own death.

Paullus was the father of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus. His daughter, Aemilia Tertia, married Scipio Africanus, the Roman commander who defeated Hannibal. He was the grandfather of Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, the Roman commander who destroyed Carthage.

<doc id="221600" wikidata="Q1142143" url="?curid=221600" title="Cotangent bundle">
<text>In mathematics, especially differential geometry, the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold is the vector bundle of all the cotangent spaces at every point in the manifold. It may be described also as the dual bundle to the tangent bundle. This may be generalized to categories with more structure than smooth manifolds, such as complex manifolds, or (in the form of cotangent sheaf) algebraic varieties or schemes. In the smooth case, any Riemannian metric or symplectic form gives an isomorphism between the cotangent bundle and the tangent bundle, but they are not in general isomorphic in other categories.

== Formal definition via diagonal morphism ==
There are several equivalent ways to define the cotangent bundle. One way is through a diagonal mapping Δ and germs.

Let &quot;M&quot; be a smooth manifold and let &quot;M&quot;×&quot;M&quot; be the Cartesian product of &quot;M&quot; with itself. The diagonal mapping Δ sends a point &quot;p&quot; in &quot;M&quot; to the point (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;p&quot;) of &quot;M&quot;×&quot;M&quot;. The image of Δ is called the diagonal. Let formula_1 be the sheaf of germs of smooth functions on &quot;M&quot;×&quot;M&quot; which vanish on the diagonal. Then the quotient sheaf formula_2 consists of equivalence classes of functions which vanish on the diagonal modulo higher order terms. The cotangent sheaf is defined as the pullback of this sheaf to &quot;M&quot;:

:formula_3

By Taylor&#x27;s theorem, this is a locally free sheaf of modules with respect to the sheaf of germs of smooth functions of &quot;M&quot;. Thus it defines a vector bundle on &quot;M&quot;: the cotangent bundle.

Smooth sections of the cotangent bundle are called (differential) one-forms.

== Contravariance properties ==

A smooth morphism formula_4 of manifolds, induces a pullback sheaf formula_5 on &quot;M&quot;. There is an induced map of vector bundles formula_6.

== Examples ==
The tangent bundle of the vector space formula_7 is formula_8, and the cotangent bundle is formula_9, where formula_10 denotes the dual space of covectors, linear functions formula_11.

Given a smooth manifold formula_12 embedded as a hypersurface represented by the vanishing locus of a function formula_13 with the condition that formula_14 the tangent bundle is

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the directional derivative formula_17. By definition, the cotangent bundle in this case is

:formula_18
where formula_19 Since every covector formula_20 corresponds to a unique vector formula_21 for which formula_22 for an arbitrary formula_23

:formula_24

== The cotangent bundle as phase space ==

Since the cotangent bundle &quot;X&quot; = &quot;T&quot;*&quot;M&quot; is a vector bundle, it can be regarded as a manifold in its own right. Because at each point the tangent directions of &quot;M&quot; can be paired with their dual covectors in the fiber, &quot;X&quot; possesses a canonical one-form θ called the tautological one-form, discussed below. The exterior derivative of θ is a symplectic 2-form, out of which a non-degenerate volume form can be built for &quot;X&quot;. For example, as a result &quot;X&quot; is always an orientable manifold (the tangent bundle &quot;TX&quot; is an orientable vector bundle). A special set of coordinates can be defined on the cotangent bundle; these are called the canonical coordinates. Because cotangent bundles can be thought of as symplectic manifolds, any real function on the cotangent bundle can be interpreted to be a Hamiltonian; thus the cotangent bundle can be understood to be a phase space on which Hamiltonian mechanics plays out.

=== The tautological one-form ===
The cotangent bundle carries a canonical one-form θ also known as the symplectic potential, &quot;Poincaré&quot; &quot;1&quot;-form, or &quot;Liouville&quot; &quot;1&quot;-form. This means that if we regard &quot;T&quot;*&quot;M&quot; as a manifold in its own right, there is a canonical section of the vector bundle &quot;T&quot;*(&quot;T&quot;*&quot;M&quot;) over &quot;T&quot;*&quot;M&quot;.

This section can be constructed in several ways. The most elementary method uses local coordinates. Suppose that &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; are local coordinates on the base manifold &quot;M&quot;. In terms of these base coordinates, there are fibre coordinates &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; : a one-form at a particular point of &quot;T&quot;*&quot;M&quot; has the form &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; &quot;dx&quot;&quot;i&quot; (Einstein summation convention implied). So the manifold &quot;T&quot;*&quot;M&quot; itself carries local coordinates (&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;) where the &quot;x&quot;&#x27;s are coordinates on the base and the &quot;p&#x27;s&quot; are coordinates in the fibre. The canonical one-form is given in these coordinates by

:formula_25

Intrinsically, the value of the canonical one-form in each fixed point of &quot;T*M&quot; is given as a pullback. Specifically, suppose that is the projection of the bundle. Taking a point in &quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot;*&quot;M&quot; is the same as choosing of a point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot; and a one-form ω at &quot;x&quot;, and the tautological one-form θ assigns to the point (&quot;x&quot;, ω) the value

:formula_26

That is, for a vector &quot;v&quot; in the tangent bundle of the cotangent bundle, the application of the tautological one-form θ to &quot;v&quot; at (&quot;x&quot;, ω) is computed by projecting &quot;v&quot; into the tangent bundle at &quot;x&quot; using and applying ω to this projection. Note that the tautological one-form is not a pullback of a one-form on the base &quot;M&quot;.

=== Symplectic form ===

The cotangent bundle has a canonical symplectic 2-form on it, as an exterior derivative of the tautological one-form, the symplectic potential. Proving that this form is, indeed, symplectic can be done by noting that being symplectic is a local property: since the cotangent bundle is locally trivial, this definition need only be checked on formula_27. But there the one form defined is the sum of formula_28, and the differential is the canonical symplectic form, the sum of formula_29.

=== Phase space ===

If the manifold formula_30 represents the set of possible positions in a dynamical system, then the cotangent bundle 
formula_31 can be thought of as the set of possible &quot;positions&quot; and &quot;momenta&quot;. For example, this is a way to describe the phase space of a pendulum. The state of the pendulum is determined by its position (an angle) and its momentum (or equivalently, its velocity, since its mass is constant). The entire state space looks like a cylinder, which is the cotangent bundle of the circle. The above symplectic construction, along with an appropriate energy function, gives a complete determination of the physics of system. See Hamiltonian mechanics and the article on geodesic flow for an explicit construction of the Hamiltonian equations of motion.

<text>Gisborne is a city in northeastern New Zealand and the largest settlement in the Gisborne District (or Gisborne Region). It has a population of Gisborne District Council has its headquarters in the central city.

==Etymology==
The Gisborne area was known in Māori as &quot;Tūranganui-a-Kiwa&quot; (the &#x27;great standing place of Kiwa&#x27;), after Kiwa, who arrived on the waka &quot;Tākitimu&quot;, which landed at Gisborne. The original English language name for the settlement was &quot;Tūranga&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Gisborne&quot; in 1870, in honour of New Zealand Colonial Secretary William Gisborne, although he had no real connection with the area, to avoid confusion with Tauranga.

==Early history==

===First arrivals===
The Gisborne region has been settled for over 700 years. For centuries, the region has been inhabited by the tribes of Te Whānau-a-Kai, Ngaariki Kaiputahi, Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki, Rongowhakaata, Ngāi Tāmanuhiri and Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti. They descend from the voyagers of the Te Ikaroa-a-Rauru, Horouta and Tākitimu waka.

East Coast oral traditions offer differing versions of Gisborne&#x27;s establishment by Māori. One legend recounts that in the 14th century the great navigator Kiwa landed at the Tūranganui River first on the waka Tākitimu after voyaging to the region from Hawaiki and that Pāoa, captain of the waka Horouta, followed later. An alternative legend recounts that Kiwa waited so long for the Horouta canoe to arrive that he called its final landing place &quot;Tūranganui-a-Kiwa&quot; (the long waiting place of Kiwa).

A more popular version of events is that Horouta &quot;preceded&quot; Tākitimu. In 1931, Sir Āpirana Ngata stated that Horouta was the main canoe that brought the people to the East Coast and that Ngāti Porou always regarded Takitimu as &quot;an unimportant canoe&quot;. Māori historian Rongowhakaata Halbert affirmed this account, stating that Paoa&#x27;s crew on the Horouta were the first inhabitants of the East Coast after migrating from Ahuahu or Great Mercury Island. Paoa gave his name to various places across the region, most notably the Waipāoa River (Wai-o-Pāoa).

During the 14th century, Māori tribes built fishing villages close to the sea and built pā on nearby hilltops.

=== Captain Cook landing===
Gisborne&#x27;s Kaiti Beach is the place where British navigator Captain James Cook made his first landing in New Zealand upon the &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Cook had earlier set off from Plymouth, England, in August 1768 on a mission bound for Tahiti. Once he had concluded his duties in Tahiti, Cook continued south to look for a large landmass or continent, before heading west. Young Nick&#x27;s Head was thought to be the first piece of New Zealand land sighted by Cook&#x27;s party, and so named because it was first observed by cabin boy Nicholas Young on 6 October 1769.

On 9 October, Cook came ashore on the eastern bank of the Tūranganui River, accompanied by a party of men. Their arrival was marred by misunderstanding and resulted in the death and wounding of nine Māori over four days.
It was also on the banks of the Tūranganui River that first the township of Turanga, then the city of Gisborne, grew as European traders and whalers began to settle in the river and port area.

The landing site was commemorated by a monument in 1906, on the 137th anniversary of Cook&#x27;s arrival. In 1964, the Gisborne committee of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust registered the land around the monument as a historic reserve, and in 1990 it was designated a National Historic Reserve and put under the care of the Department of Conservation.

In 2019, a memorial was erected by Ngāti Oneone on Titirangi, a local hill, to honour Te Maro, who was one of the first casualties of the arrival of the ship &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

===European settlement and town growth===
Starting in the early 1830s, traders such as Captain John Harris and Captain George E. Read set up the first trading stations along the Tūranganui river and are attributed to the founding of the town. Over the next 30 years, many more European traders and missionaries migrated to the region. In 1868, the government bought 300 hectares of land for a town site. The town was laid out in 1870 and the name changed from &quot;Turanga&quot; to &quot;Gisborne&quot;, after the then colonial secretary, and to avoid confusion with Tauranga. In 1872, Gisborne&#x27;s first public school was opened and its first newspaper, the &quot;Poverty Bay Standard&quot; was established. A town council was formed in 1877.

==Geography==
Gisborne is on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, in the southern part of the Gisborne District and on the north side of Poverty Bay. The Poverty Bay flats encompass Gisborne city as well as surrounding areas Mākaraka, Matawhero and Ormond, where vineyards and farms predominate. Gisborne is flat towards the shoreline, but hilly and forested inland.

Gisborne boasts a large stretch of coastline encompassing the Waikanae and Midway, Kaiti, Sponge Bay, Wainui and Makorori white sand beaches, which are popular for swimming and surfing. Sometimes referred to as the &#x27;City of Rivers&#x27;, Gisborne sits at the convergence of the Waimata, Taruheru and Tūranganui rivers. The Tūranganui, only 1.2 kilometres long, is the shortest river in New Zealand.

Kaiti Hill (&quot;Titirangi&quot;), which sits directly above Cook&#x27;s landing site, provides expansive views over the city and wider Poverty Bay. Many archaeological sites have been identified on Titirangi, including burial grounds, terraces, and middens. Titirangi Pā sits near the summit.

In the wider area surrounding Gisborne are two arboreta, Eastwoodhill, the National Arboretum of New Zealand at Ngatapa which spans over 130 hectares, and the smaller 50 hectare Hackfalls Arboretum at Tiniroto.

Until Samoa and Tokelau&#x27;s dateline shift in December 2011, Gisborne claimed to be the first city on Earth to see the sun rise each day. However, this is now only accurate in New Zealand&#x27;s summer months. Sunrise in Gisborne ranges from 5:36 am in early December to 7:26 am in late June.

===Climate===
The region is sheltered by high country to the west. Gisborne enjoys a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb – Köppen climate classification) with warm summers and cool winters, temperatures rarely drop below 0 °C (32 °F) and occasionally rise above 30 °C (86 °F) with a yearly average of 2,200 sunshine hours. The annual rainfall varies from about near the coast to over in higher inland country. According to the NIWA dataset for 1981–2010 normals, Gisborne narrowly edged several other New Zealand cities to have the warmest summer maxima of official stations.

Winters are slightly cooler than more northerly areas, rendering that over the course of the calendar year, Gisborne is not the warmest station in the country. Even summer mean temperatures are lower than in northerly areas, despite the highs, due to the cooler nights. Despite this, yearly mean temperatures are still some way above average for New Zealand as a whole.

==Demographics==
The Gisborne urban area had a usual resident population of 34,527 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 3,294 people (10.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3,228 people (10.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 16,623 males and 17,907 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.93 males per female. Of the total population, 8,229 people (23.8%) were aged up to 15 years, 6,603 (19.1%) were 15 to 29, 14,184 (41.1%) were 30 to 64, and 5,511 (16.0%) were 65 or older.

In terms of ethnicity, 58.8% of the population identified as European (Pākehā), 51.6% as Māori, 5.3% as Pacific peoples, 3.5% as Asian, and 1.3% as other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).

Gisborne had an unemployment rate of 9.4% of people 15 years and over, compared to 7.4% nationally. The median annual income of all people 15 years and over was $24,400, compared to $28,500 nationally. Of those, 41.9% earned under $20,000, compared to 38.2% nationally, while 19.6% earned over $50,000, compared to 26.7% nationally.

Gisborne has the smallest percentage of the population born overseas at 9.7% compared to 25.2% for New Zealand as a whole. The highest of these are British, totalling 1,335 or 3.1% of the population. Furthermore, 73.0% of the population could speak in one language only, 16.2% in two languages and 1.1% in three or more languages.
==Economy==

The harbour was host to many ships in the past, and had developed as a river port to provide a more secure location for shipping compared with the open roadstead of Poverty Bay, which can be exposed to southerly swells. A meat works was sited beside the harbour and meat and wool were shipped from here. Now the harbour is the home of many smaller fishing boats as well as ships loading logs for export. In February 2018, the first grants from the Provincial Growth Fund included $2.3 million for the Gisborne port.

The city maintains a rural charm and is a popular holiday spot. Local industries include agriculture, horticulture, farming and forestry. Wine production is also valuable to the local economy.

==Transport==

===Air===
Gisborne Airport serves as the domestic airport for the Gisborne District. Regular flights between Auckland and Wellington are serviced by Air New Zealand under the Link brand, while the smaller Air Napier provides services to Napier and Wairoa. For 25 years Sunair operated from Gisborne to Hamilton, Rotorua, Napier, Whakatāne, Tauranga, Palmerston North, Paraparaumu and Wellington but those services were suspended in 2022. In 2023 Sunair announced it would give Gisborne another chance with services from Hamilton and Tauranga.

===Highways===
 State Highway 2 connects Gisborne to Tauranga via Ōpōtiki and Whakatāne to the northwest, and to Napier and the rest of Hawke&#x27;s Bay via Wairoa to the south. SH 2 travels towards Gisborne from the northwest from Te Karaka, a settlement 31 km northwest of Gisborne. SH 2 passes through Makaraka, a suburb on the outer fringes of Gisborne. It then crosses the Waipaoa River and makes its way south through Manutuke and Wharerata before it enters the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region towards Nūhaka, Wairoa, and eventually on to Napier.

 State Highway 35 (part of the Pacific Coast Highway network) begins at a junction west of Gisborne with SH 2 just before SH 2 crosses the Waipaoa River on its way south to Manutuke. SH 35 borders Gisborne Airport to the south and enters Gisborne city on the southwestern fringes. It makes its way through the city out to the east, and continues up the coast, connecting Gisborne to the East Cape.
=== Public transport ===
Public transport is poorly developed in Gisborne, with only 0.2% of trips made by bus in 2013/14. This compares with 2.3% nationally, which itself is amongst the lowest proportions in the world. Go Bus is contracted to the council to run 30 services a day on 4 routes Monday to Friday under the Gizzy Bus brand. Gizzy Bus accepts Bee Card for fares, as well as cash.

From 1913 to 1929, Gisborne had battery-powered trams. Since then, public transport has declined to about a fifth of the usage then. In 1930, the municipal buses travelled , and carried 28,531 passengers in 2 weeks. In 2012/13 the city buses carried about 78,000 passengers in 52 weeks, at a cost of about $120,000 a year, with about another $85,000 from fares.

===Rail===
Gisborne is the northern terminus of the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line railway, which opened in 1942 and mothballed (track kept in place, but all services cancelled) in 2012. The permanent way has since suffered storm damage including bridge collapses and the line is believed unlikely to re-open for economic reasons. Prior to this, an isolated section of line operated from Gisborne to Moutohora – intended to be part of a line to Auckland via Rotorua, and later part of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway line. This connection was never completed, and the Moutohora Branch line closed in 1959.

Rail passenger services were provided between Gisborne and Wellington until 1988, when the Endeavour express was cancelled north of Napier. Today, only the Gisborne City Vintage Railway operates limited heritage train rides out of Gisborne.

==Culture==
Te Poho-o-Rawiri and Te Kuri a Tuatai marae are located in the city suburbs.

The Lowe Street Museum was the first museum in Gisborne, located in the Lowe Street Municipal Offices. In 1955, the collection of Māori artefacts of William Lysner were put in his former residence, Lysner House, which was sold to the city for a nominal sum. It is now known as the Tairāwhiti Museum.

The Tairāwhiti Tamararo Regionals are an annual regional haka competition held in Gisborne in memory of Karaitiana Tamararo.

Gisborne is host to Rhythm &amp; Vines, an annual 3-day music festival held over the New Year at Waiohika Estate. In 2012 and 2013, Rhythm and Vines made skinny-dipping world record attempts.

Since 2019 the Te Tairāwhiti Arts Festival is an annual event in the region with many events taking place in Gisborne.

<doc id="221604" wikidata="Q153159" url="?curid=221604" title="Elias Lönnrot">
<text>Elias Lönnrot (; 9 April 1802 – 19 March 1884) was a Finnish polymath, physician, philosopher, poet, musician, linguist, journalist, philologist and collector of traditional Finnish oral poetry. He is best known for synthesizing the Finnish national epic, &quot;Kalevala&quot; (1835, enlarged 1849) from short ballads and lyric poems he gathered from Finnish oral tradition during several field expeditions in Finland, Russian Karelia, the Kola Peninsula and Baltic countries. In botany, he is remembered as the author of the 1860 Flora Fennica, the first scientific text written in Finnish rather than in Latin.

== Education and early life ==

Lönnrot was born in Sammatti, in the province of Uusimaa, Finland, which was then part of Sweden. From 1814 to 1815, he attended the school of Tammisaari Pedagogio. He studied at Turku Cathedral School from 5April1816 until he dropped out in the spring of 1818. After dropping out, he worked as a tailor and singer in Sammatti and nearby villages. He joined the Porvoo Gymnasium on 20March1820 but left on 9April. For the next two years, he studied as an apothecary student at Hämeenlinna. In the summer of 1822, he lived in Sammatti as he prepared for the high school examination. On 11October1822, he enrolled in the Academy of Turku to study medicine. The Great Fire of Turku coincided with his first academic year. As the university was destroyed in the fire, it was moved to Helsinki, the newly established administrative center of the Grand Duchy of Finland. Lönnrot followed and graduated in 1832.

== Career ==

=== Medicine ===

Lönnrot lived in the village of Paltaniemi, when he got a job as district doctor of Kajaani in Eastern Finland during a time of famine and pestilence in the district.

=== Literature ===

He began writing about the early Finnish language in 1827 and began collecting folk tales from rural people around the same time. In 1831, the Finnish Literature Society was founded, and Lönnrot, being one of the founders, received financial support from the society for his efforts to collect folk tales.

Lönnrot went on extended leaves of absence from his doctor&#x27;s office; he toured the countryside of Finland, Sapmi (Lapland), and nearby portions of Russian Karelia. This led to a series of books: &quot;Kantele&quot;, 1829–1831 (the &quot;kantele&quot; is a Finnish traditional instrument); &quot;Kalevala&quot;, 1835–1836 (the &quot;old&quot; Kalevala), an edited collection of epic poems collected orally and representing a mythology for Finland; &quot;Kanteletar&quot;, 1840; &quot;Sananlaskuja&quot;, 1842 (&quot;Proverbs&quot;); an expanded second edition of &quot;Kalevala&quot;, 1849 (the &quot;new&quot; Kalevala). Lönnrot was recognised for his part in preserving Finland&#x27;s oral traditions by appointment to the Chair of Finnish Literature at the University of Helsinki in 1853.

=== Lexicography ===

Lönnrot undertook the task of compiling the first Finnish-Swedish dictionary (&quot;Finsk-Svenskt lexikon&quot;, 1866–1880). The result comprised over 200,000 entries, and many of the Finnish translations were coined by Lönnrot himself. His vast knowledge of traditional Finnish poetry made him a definite authority in Finland and many of his inventions have stuck. Finnish scientific terminology was in particular influenced by Lönnrot&#x27;s work and therefore many abstract terms that have a Latin or Greek etymology in most other European languages appear as native neologisms in Finnish. Examples from linguistics and medicine include &quot;kielioppi&quot; (grammar), &quot;kirjallisuus&quot; (literature), &quot;laskimo&quot; (vein) and &quot;valtimo&quot; (artery).

=== Botany ===

Botanists remember Lönnrot for writing the first Finnish-language &quot;Flora Fennica – Suomen Kasvisto&quot; (&quot;Flora of Finland&quot;) in 1860; in its day it was famed throughout Scandinavia, as it was among the first common-language scientific texts. The second, expanded version was co-authored by Thomas Saelan and published in 1866. The &quot;Flora Fennica&quot; was the first scientific work published in Finnish (instead of Latin). In addition, it includes many notes on plant uses in between descriptions of flowers and leaves.

== Impact ==

The Kalevala, the Finnish national epic that Lönnrot compiled, was among the inspirations for J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Lönnrot was the main motif for the Finnish Elias Lönnrot and folklore commemorative coin, minted in 2002. On the reverse, a feather (as a symbol of an author) and Elias Lönnrot&#x27;s signature can be seen. The Finnish graphic artist Erik Bruun used Lönnrot as a motif for the 500 markka banknote in his banknote series.

The Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges used the name Lönnrot, possibly alluding to the Finnish author, for the diligent detective in his story &quot;Death and the Compass&quot; (&quot;La muerte y la brújula&quot;).
The main belt asteroid 2243 Lönnrot was named after Lönnrot.

<doc id="221613" wikidata="Q193813" url="?curid=221613" title="Mjölnir">
<text>Mjölnir ( , ; from Old Norse Mjǫllnir ) is the hammer of the thunder god Thor in Norse mythology, used both as a devastating weapon and as a divine instrument to provide blessings. The hammer is attested in numerous sources, including the 11th century runic Kvinneby amulet, the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, a collection of eddic poetry compiled in the 13th century, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a collection of prose and poetry compiled in the 13th century. The hammer was commonly worn as a pendant during the Viking Age in the Scandinavian cultural sphere, and Thor and his hammer occur depicted on a variety of objects from the archaeological record. Today the symbol appears in a wide variety of media and is again worn as a pendant by various groups, including adherents of modern Heathenry.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the hammer&#x27;s name, &quot;Mjǫllnir&quot;, is disputed among historical linguists. Old Norse &quot;Mjǫllnir&quot; developed from Proto-Norse *&quot;melluniaR&quot; and one proposed derivation connects this form to Old Church Slavonic &quot;mlunuji&quot; and Russian &quot;molnija&quot; meaning &#x27;lightning&#x27; (either borrowed from a Slavic source or both stemming from a common source) and subsequently yielding the meaning &#x27;lightning-maker&#x27;. Another proposal connects &quot;Mjǫllnir&quot; to Old Norse &quot;mjǫll&quot; meaning &#x27;new snow&#x27; and modern Icelandic &quot;mjalli&quot; meaning &#x27;the color white&#x27;, rendering &quot;Mjǫllnir&quot; as &#x27;shining lightning weapon&#x27;. Finally, another proposal connects Old Norse &quot;Mjǫllnir&quot; to Old Norse &quot;mala&quot; meaning &#x27;to grind&#x27; and Gothic &quot;malwjan&quot; &#x27;to grind&#x27;, yielding &quot;Mjǫllnir&quot; as meaning &#x27;the grinder&#x27;.

==Attestations==
===Kvinneby amulet===
Likely worn around the neck, the Kvinneby amulet is a small copper amulet found in Öland, Sweden that dates from the 11th century and features an Old Norse Younger futhark inscription that invokes Thor and his hammer. Runologists Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees translate the amulet as follows:
:&#x27;Here I carve for you (runes of) help, Bofi.
:Help me! Knowledge (?) is certain for you.
:And may the lightning hold all evil away from Bofi.
:May Thor protect him with his hammer which came from out of the sea.
:Flee from evil! It (?) gets nothing from Bofi.
:The gods are under him and over him.&#x27;
The amulet inscription references narratives recorded hundreds of years later in both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Prose Edda&quot; (see discussion regarding &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; and &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; below).

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Mjölnir is mentioned in the eddic poems &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, and &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;. In a stanza from &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir tells the disguised god Odin that after the events of Ragnarök, Móði and Magni, sons of Thor, will wield Mjölnir:

In &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, after gaining a tremendous cauldron that the jötunn (and personified ocean) Ægir has requested so that he may brew the gods ale, Thor battles malicious jötnar with the hammer (referred to here as &quot;whales&quot; as a poetic device):


In &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, in which the deity Loki and other gods trade insults (see flyting). In the poem, the gods threaten Loki with Mjölnir as part of a refrain repeated in all four stanzas in which he speaks.

The hammer is a focal point of the eddic poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;. In the poem, Thor wakes one day to find that his hammer is missing. Furious, the god pulls his beard, shakes his head, and searches for the absent weapon. Thor consults with Loki, informing him that only he knows that his hammer is missing.

Thor and Loki go to the goddess Freyja, and Loki asks her if he might use her feather garment. Freyja readily agrees, Loki puts on the cloak, and flies to Jötunheimr. There he finds the jötunn Þrymr sitting on a burial mound and caring for his animals.

The two speak, and Þrymr confirms to Loki that he has stolen the hammer. Þrymr says that he has buried it deep in the ground and no one will ever get it back unless they bring him Freyja to be his wife. Loki flies back to Asgard and meets with Thor. Thor asks Loki if he has any news, and Loki tells Thor Þrymr&#x27;s ultimatum.

Thor and Loki go to Freyja. One of the two asks Freyja to put on a bridal head-dress and come with them to Jötunheim. Freyja is so enraged by this request that the hall shakes, and her necklace, Brísingamen, breaks off. The goddess refuses.

The gods meet together in counsel (see Thing (assembly)) and discuss how to get the hammer back. The god Heimdallr proposes that Thor put on a bridal head-dress and wear Brísingamen as if he were Freyja. Thor initially rejects the proposal, but Loki convinces him that if he doesn&#x27;t, the jötnar in Jötunheim who stole his hammer will soon call Asgard their home. The gods dress Thor in bridal gear, Loki dresses as &quot;Freyja&#x27;s&quot; maid to accompany him, and the two drive Thor&#x27;s goat-led wagon to Jötunheimr, producing flames and splitting mountains along the way.

From the hall yard, Þrymr spots the duo arriving and tells his retinue to prepare by tossing straw on the hall benches. That night, Þrymr says that he is surprised to find his bride-to-be ferociously eating and drinking, consuming nine entrees—one ox and eight salmon—and three casks of mead. Loki responds that &quot;Freyja&quot; had neither drank nor eaten for eight nights before this one as she was so eager to come to Jötunheimr.

Þrymr lifts &quot;Freyja&quot;&#x27;s bridal veil to kiss her, only to spring back: The bride&#x27;s eyes were &quot;terrifying&quot;, as if &quot;fire is burning from them&quot;. The disguised Loki explains this was because &quot;Freyja&quot; had not slept for eight nights before this one, because she was so eager to arrive in Jötunheim (on the topic of the numbers three and nine in Norse myth, see numbers in Norse mythology).

Finally, Þrymr calls for Mjölnir to be brought forth to sanctify the bride with the assistance of the goddess Vár:

&quot;Freyja&quot; sees the hammer and laughs internally before grabbing it, killing Þrymr and another jötunn, and pummeling the gathered wedding guests. The poem ends with a prose note indicating that this is how the god got his hammer back.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Mjölnir receives mention throughout the Prose Edda books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

====&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;====
Early in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High describes the god Thor and his &quot;three special possessions&quot;: his hammer Mjölnir, his iron gloves Járngreipr, and his belt Megingjörð. High explains that Thor must wear his gloves with his hammer, and that Mjölnir is well known among the jötnar due to the skulls of many jötunn it has smashed over time.

The enthroned figure of Third reluctantly relates a tale in which Thor and Loki are riding in Thor&#x27;s chariot, pulled by his two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr. Loki and Thor stop at the home of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, skins them and puts them in a pot. When the goats are cooked, Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family to share the meal with him and they do so.

At the end of the meal, Thor places the skins of the goat on the opposing side of the fire and tells the peasants to throw the bones of the goats on to the goatskins. The peasant&#x27;s son Þjálfi takes one of the goat ham-bones and uses a knife to split it open, breaking the bone to get to the marrow. After staying the night at the peasants house, Thor wakes up and gets dressed before the break of dawn. Thor takes the hammer Mjölnir, raises it, and blesses the goat skins. Resurrected, the goats stand, but one of the two goats is lame in the hind leg. Noting this new lameness, Thor exclaims that someone has mistreated the bones of his goats; that someone broke the ham-bone during the meal the night before.

In a tale recounted by Third, the gods Loki and Thor, along with Thor&#x27;s servants Þjálfi and Röskva, encounter an enormous forest when they arrive in Jötunheimr. The group has difficulty finding lodging until they encounter a huge and peculiar building with a very wide entrance. They decide to spend the night in the structure. At midnight they experience an earthquake and decide to search the building. They find nothing. Mjölnir in hand, Thor guards the hall&#x27;s entrance until the crew hears intense groaning and rumbling.

At dawn, Thor leaves the hall and sees an enormous man asleep and loudly snoring. Thor realizes he had in fact heard the snoring of this tremendous man. The god puts on his belt, his strength increases, and the man stands. Seeing his height, Third says that &quot;and the say that Thor was for once was afraid to strike him with the hammer, and asked him for his name&quot;. The large man says that his name is Skrýmir and reveals that Thor, Loki, Þjálfi, and Röskva had slept not in a hall but rather in Skrýmir&#x27;s glove.

Skrýmir tells Thor that he doesn&#x27;t need to introduce himself because he already knows that he is Thor. Later in the trip, Thor attacks Skrýmir as he sleeps in three separate occasions: In the first instance, Skrýmir awakes and asks if a leaf has fallen on his head; in the second instance, Skrýmir awakes and asks if an acorn fell on his head; and on the third and final instance, Skrýmir asks if birds above him may have knocked twigs down on to his head.

Later Skrýmir reveals that this had all been an illusion: For example, the enormous Skrýmir was in fact the sorcerer Útgarða-Loki and the blows Thor landed terrified him: He details that had they hit him, they would have killed him, and that his blows had hammered a deep valley in the landscape.

&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; contains a retelling of the material found in &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; (discussed above). In this version, Thor throws his hammer and strikes off the head of the great serpent Jörmungandr. Third notes, however, that he does not believe that this occurred: Third says he believes that the serpent still lives in the sea, coiled around the world.

Later in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High recounts the death and ship funeral of the god Baldr. The gods are unable to move the ship on their own, and so request that the powerful jötunn Hyrrokkin comes from Jötunheim to help. Hyrrokin arrives riding a wolf with vipers as reins, and pushes the ship; though it launches from her first touch, the push also causes intense flames and earthquakes. This infuriates Thor: He desires to crush Hyyrokkin&#x27;s skull with his hammer but the other gods convince him not to attack her.

Baldr&#x27;s body is carried on to the ship. Baldr&#x27;s wife, the goddess Nanna, sees it, and she dies of sorrow. The assembled place her with Baldr on the ship&#x27;s pyre, before lighting it. Thor consecrates the boring ship with his hammer. A dwarf named Lit runs before his feet, and he kicks him into the flames, where he burns.

&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; concludes with a foretelling of the events of Ragnarök, during which the world suffers from cataclysm and disasters before returning green and beautiful. High describes the return of various gods after Ragnarök, including Thor&#x27;s sons Móði and Magni, who return to Asgard holding their father&#x27;s hammer, Mjölnir. This account quotes the &quot;Völuspá&quot; stanza above.

====&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;====
The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; contains a few mentions of the hammer, including an instance of its mention in skaldic poetry. A section dedicated to kennings used by poets to refer to the god says that Thor can be referred to as &quot;ruler and owner&quot; of Mjölnir.

The section cites a piece from 9th century skald Bragi Boddason that references the hammer:

:Oflugbardi&#x27;s terrifier [Thor] lifted his hammer in his right hand when he recognized the coal-fish that bounds all lands [the Midgard serpent].

The section also cites a piece from Gamli gnævaðarskáld who mentions the hammer:

:While Bilskirnir&#x27;s lord, who never nursed treachery in his heart, did quickly destroy the sea-bed-fish [Midgard serpent] with gorge-whales [giant&#x27;s] bane [Miollnir].

&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; provides an account of Thor&#x27;s use of Mjölnir in a fight with the jötunn Hrungnir. In it, after the gods had grown tired of Hrungnir&#x27;s obnoxious boasting in Asgard, they call on Thor, who immediately appears, his hammer raised. Thor ultimately duels Hrungnir, and to the duel Hrungnir brings a whetstone as a weapon. Thor throws the hammer at Hrungnir and Hrungnir responds by throwing the whetstone at Thor, and Mjölnir splits it in two. One part of the whetstone becomes the predecessor of all whetstones, whereas the other part lodges itself into Thor&#x27;s head. Meanwhile, Mjölnir smashes Hrungnir&#x27;s skull into fragments.

In reference to this tale, the section provides extended excerpts from &quot;Haustlöng&quot;, a piece attributed to 10th century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir. Þjóðólfr&#x27;s poem mentions Mjölnir in a few different instances, such as &quot;The rock-gentlemen [giant] did not have to wait long after that for a swift blow from the tough multitude-smashing friend [Thor] of hammer-face-troll [Miollnir]&quot; and &quot;There sank down the gully-land [mountain] prince [giant] before the tough hammer and the rock-Dane-breaker [Thor] forced back the mighty defiant one.&quot;
&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; also contains a prose account of Thor&#x27;s encounter with Geirröðr: The prose introduction notes that Thor arrived at Geirröðr&#x27;s courts without his hammer. In its place, he uses a pole given to him by his jötunn lover, Gríðr.

The final mention of the hammer in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; offers an explanation of its manufacture by the dwarf brothers Eitri and Brokkr. In this narrative, Loki cuts the goddess Sif&#x27;s hair. Upon discovering this, Thor grabs Loki and threatens to crush every bone in his body if he does not come up with a solution. Loki goes to the svartálfar, and for him the Sons of Ivaldi make three special items: Sif&#x27;s hair of gold, Freyr&#x27;s ship Skíðblaðnir, and Odin&#x27;s spear Gungnir.

Seeing this, Loki wagers his head with the dwarf Brokkr on whether his brother Eitri can make three more items of equal quality. As Eitri works on the three precious objects, a fly enters the room and bites him three times: First, the fly lands on the dwarf&#x27;s arm and bites it, but Brokkr does not react: He places a pig skin in the forge and from it pulls the golden boar Gullinbursti; second, the fly lands on and bites the back of the dwarf&#x27;s neck, but he does not react: after inserting gold, he pulls from the forge Draupnir, a golden ring that produces eight more of itself every nine nights; and third and final, the fly lands on the dwarf&#x27;s eyelid and bites him, causing blood to obscure his vision. Nonetheless, Brokkr inserts iron into the forge and pulls from it a hammer, Mjölnir.

The gods Odin, Thor, and Freyr assemble to judge the quality of these items. While reviewing items and explaining their function, Brokkr says the following about Mjölnir:

:Then he gave Thor the hammer and said he would be able to strike as heavily as he liked, whatever the target, and the hammer would not fail, and if he threw it at something, it would never miss, and never fly so far that it would not find its way back to his hand, and if he liked, it was so small that it could be kept inside his shirt. But there was this defect in it that the end of the hammer was rather short.

The three assembled gods judge the hammer to be the best of all the objects, and the tale continues without further mention of the object.

==Archaeological record==
===Hammer pendants, rings, coins, typology, taxonomy, and Eitri database===
Around 1000 pendants in distinctive shapes representing the hammer of Thor have been unearthed in what are today the Nordic countries, England, northern Germany, the Baltic countries and Russia. Most have very simple designs in iron or silver. Around 100 have more advanced designs with ornaments. The pendants have been found in a variety of contexts (including at urban sites, and in hoards) and occur in a variety of shapes. As of 2004, 10% of all finds were from graves, nearly all of which are cremations. The burials are often identified as women&#x27;s graves. In addition to pendants, the hammer has been found depicted on objects such as on two Arabic coins found at an urban dig site.

Here are four examples of Mjölnir finds, their dating, and their discovery context:
In 1999, German archaeologist Jörn Staecker proposed a typology for the hammer finds based on decorative style and material properties (such as amber, iron, or silver). In 2019, American scholar Katherine Suzanne Beard proposed an extension of the typology based on factors such as hammer shape and suspension type. In 2019, Beard also launched &quot;Eitri: The Norse Artifacts Database&quot;, an online database that lists numerous hammer finds and includes data about their composition and discovery context.

The development of the hammer pendants has been the subject of study by a variety of scholars. The hammers amulets appear to have developed from an earlier tradition of similar pendants among the north Germanic peoples. Scholars have also noted that the hammer may have developed from a pendant worn by other ancient Germanic people, the so-called club of Hercules amulet. The increase in popularity of the amulet in the Viking Age and some variants of it shape may have been a response to the use of Christian cross pendants appearing more commonly in the region during the process of Christianization.

In Viking Age cremation graves in the Mälaren area, Åland and Russia, there are finds of what archaeologists have named Thor&#x27;s hammer-rings. These are iron rings with multiple amulets attached; many but not all amulets are shaped like hammers. Found in cinerary urns, in graves for both sexes but more often in women&#x27;s graves, the amulet rings may have played a role in cremation practices, but their exact function is unknown. The earliest examples are from the Vendel Period but they appear to have become more common in the late Viking Age, which might be connected to political and religious conflicts.

===Eyrarland Statue===

The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near , Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.

===Rune stones and picture stones===
Pictorial representations of Thor&#x27;s hammer appear on several runestones, such as DR 26, DR 48 and DR 120 in Denmark and VG 113, Sö 86 and Sö 111 in Sweden. At least three stones depict Thor fishing for the serpent , and two of them feature hammers: the Altuna Runestone in , Sweden and the Gosforth depiction in Gosforth, England.

As Beard notes, Thor &quot;is the only known god to have been called on to bless or hallow runestones from the Viking Age&quot;, a fact observed by scholars since at least the 19th century.

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
===Latin sources: Adam of Bremen and Saxo Grammaticus===

Two sources describe Thor as wielding hammer-like objects, although not described as hammers. In the 11th century, chronicler Adam of Bremen records in his that a statue of Thor, who Adam describes as &quot;mightiest&quot;, sits in the Temple at Uppsala in the center of a triple throne (flanked by Woden and &quot;Fricco&quot;) located in , Sweden. Adam details that &quot;Thor, they reckon, rules the sky; he governs thunder and lightning, winds and storms, fine weather and fertility&quot; and that &quot;Thor, with his mace, looks like Jupiter&quot;. Adam details that the people of had appointed priests to each of the gods, and that the priests were to offer up sacrifices. In Thor&#x27;s case, he continues, these sacrifices were done when plague or famine threatened. Earlier in the same work, Adam relays that in 1030 an English preacher, Wulfred, was lynched by assembled Germanic pagans for &quot;profaning&quot; a representation of Thor.

12th century Danish author Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, an euhemerized version of the god depicts him as wielding a &quot;clava&quot;, a club made from oak. Saxo provides a euhemerized tale about its origins that, like the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; narrative above, describes the hammer as having a short handle, confirming a broader tradition both of the shortness of the hammer and also its role in narrative as a weapon intended for protecting the gods. This description occurs in book three of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;:

:But Thor shattered all their shield-defences with the terrific swings of his club, calling on his enemies to attack him as much as his comrades support him. There was no armour which could stand up to his strokes, nor anyone who could survive them. Shields, helmets, everything he drove at with his oak cudgel was crushed on impact, nor were bodily size or muscle any protection. Consequently victory would have gone to the gods, had not Høther, whose line of men had bent inwards, flown forward and rendered the club useless by lopping off the handle. Immediately they were denied this weapon the deities fled.

Various scholars have considered these weapons to simply be references to Mjölnir. Beard notes that &quot;the archaeological hammer finds (even those contemporary to Adam&#x27;s account) clearly do not resemble these club-like weapons at all, making it possible that their existence in the literature is more likely a result of &quot;interpretatio romana&quot; than anything else (although one should remember that the Irish Dagda also uses a club ...). Indeed, there is only a single instance of a hammer made of wood in the entirety of [the Eitri database], and this artifact is a mere half fragment that may not be a hammer at all.&quot;

===Temple instruments and ceremonial significance===
The Old Norse record mentions Thor using Mjölnir not only as a fearsome weapon but also a means of sanctifying or hallowing. For example, as detailed above, &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; mentions that the hammer was to be brought in to sanctify the bride (who in fact turns out to be Thor in disguise), in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; Thor revives his goats Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr with the hammer, and in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Thor uses his hammer to bless Baldr&#x27;s ship at his and Nana&#x27;s ship funeral. A variety of items from the archaeological record call upon Thor for healing, some explicitly representing or invoking his hammer. According to Book 13 of Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Magnus the Strong removed large hammer models from a temple dedicated to Thor (here referred to as &quot;Jupiter&quot; via &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;) in 1125:
::He took care to bring home certain hammers of unusual weight, which they call Jupiter&#x27;s, used by the island men in their unique faith. For the men of old, desiring to comprehend the causes of thunder and lightning by means of the similitude of things, took hammers great and massy of bronze, with which they believed the crashing of the sky might be made, thinking that great and violent noise might very well be imitated by the smith&#x27;s toil, as it were. But Magnus, in his zeal for Christian teaching and dislike for Paganism, determined to spoil the temple of its equipment, and Jupiter of his tokens in the place of his sanctity. And even now the Swedes consider him guilty of sacrilege and a robber of spoil belonging to the god.

According to Davidson, &quot;it would seem indeed as though the power of the thunder god, symbolized by his hammer, extended all over that had to do with the well-being of the community. It covered birth, marriage, and death, burial, and cremation ceremonies, weapons and feasting, travelling, land-taking, and the making of oath between men. The famous weapon of Thor was not only the symbol of destructive power of the storm, of fire from heaven, but also a protection against the forces of evil and violence.&quot;

===Nordic Bronze Age and potential Proto-Indo-European origins===
Nordic Bronze Age petroglyphs depict figures holding hammers and hammer-like weapons, such as axes. Some scholars have proposed these to depict precursors to Mjölnir. As scholar Rudolf Simek summarizes, &quot;as the Bronze Age rock carvings of axe or hammer-bearing god-like figures show, [Mjölnir] played a role as a consecratory instrument early on, probably in a fertility cult ... &quot;.

Thor is one of various deities associated with or personifying thunder who wields a hammer-like object associated with phenomena such as lightning or fire in a variety of myth bodies. In some cases these hammer-like objects return to the deity when thrown or result in changes in weather. Examples frequently cited by scholars include Vedic Indra, who wields a lightning spear; Jupiter, who throws lightning bolts; and the Celtic deity Dagda, who carries a club. Numerous scholars have identified the concept of Thor and his hammer, like Indra, Zeus, and the Dagda, as stemming from Proto-Indo-European mythology.

===Relationship to the swastika and Icelandic folk belief===

The swastika appears on a variety of objects produced or used by the ancient Germanic peoples. In late Icelandic folk belief, Icelandic grimoires list the swastika symbol as &#x27;Thor&#x27;s hammer&#x27;. According to runologists Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, &quot;By early modern times, the description &#x27;Thor&#x27;s hammer&#x27; had come to be applied to swastikas (&#x27;sun-wheels&#x27;), not the hammer symbols seen in medieval runic inscriptions. Similarly, terms once used for other symbols had also come to be associated with new forms, often of unclear origin.&quot; Other scholars have proposed that the swastika represented Thor&#x27;s hammer among the ancient Germanic peoples from an early date. English folklorist Hilda Ellis Davidson surveys the swastika&#x27;s use in the ancient archaeological Germanic record (up to 1964) and concludes that &quot;Thor was the sender of lightning and the god who dealt out both sunshine and rain to men, and it seems likely the swastika as well as the hammer sign was connected with him.&quot;

==Modern popular culture==

Mjölnir is depicted in a variety of media in the modern era. As noted by Rudolf Simek, in art &quot;Thor is almost always depicted with [Mjölnir]&quot;, but how the hammer appears in modern depictions varies: At times it may appear as hammer-like depictions of the club of Hercules, to a large sledge hammer, and displaying influence from the archaeological record. Examples include Henry Fuseli&#x27;s 1780 painting &quot;Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent&quot;; &#x27;s 1821–1822 statue &quot;Thor&quot;; B. E. Fogelberg&#x27;s 1844 marble statue &quot;Thor&quot;; Mårten Eskil Winge&#x27;s 1872 painting &quot;Thor&#x27;s Fight with the Giants&quot;; K. Ehrenberg&#x27;s 1883 drawing ; several illustrations by published in &#x27;s 1901 (&quot;Thor&quot;; ; ; ; ; ; ); J. C. Dollman&#x27;s 1909 drawings &quot;Thor and the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Sif and Thor&quot;; G. Poppe&#x27;s painting &quot;Thor&quot;; &#x27;s 1914 drawing ; H. Natter&#x27;s marble statue &quot;Thor&quot;; and U. Brember&#x27;s 1977 illustrations to by .

A variety of locations, organizations, and objects are named after the hammer. Examples include Mjølnerparken in Copenhagen, Denmark; the Mjølnir crater, a meteorite crater off the coast of Norway; the Hammer of Thor monument in Quebec, Canada; the Thor&#x27;s Hammer rollercoaster in the Tusenfryd theme park in Norway; the Norwegian football club FK Mjølner; and a variety of ship names, including the HNoMS Mjølner (1868) and several ships by the name of HSwMS Mjölner. Musical projects who take their name from that of the hammer include American-Norwegian metal band Thorr&#x27;s Hammer and Icelandic rock band Thor&#x27;s Hammer. Tórshavn Municipality, the capital city of the Faroe Islands, features a depiction of Mjölner on its seal and coat of arms, as does the Torsås Municipality in Sweden.

In the modern era, Mjölnir pendants are worn by a variety of people and for a variety of purposes. For example, the symbol is commonly used by adherents of Heathenry, a new religious movement. Writing in 2006, scholars Jenny Blain and Robert J. Wallis observe that &quot;the most common of heathen sacred artefacts is Thor&#x27;s hammer&quot; and add that &quot;heathen spirituality is expressed visually and publicly in a number of ways, such as the display of reproduced artefacts (for example, Thor&#x27;s hammer as a pendant … ), pilgrimages to sacred sites (and votive offerings left there), and &#x27;visits&#x27; to museum collection displays of artefacts which offer direct visual (and other resonant) links to ancient religions.&quot;

In the United States, Thor&#x27;s Hammer is offered as a religious emblem (#55, &quot;Hammer of Thor&quot;) for military veteran grave stones produced by the United States National Cemetery Administration.

The symbol has seen some use in white nationalist and neo-Nazi circles. As noted by the Anti-Defamation League symbol database entry for &quot;Thor&#x27;s Hammer&quot;, &quot;Although its traditional origins are non-racist, and although most Asatruers today are not racist, the Thor&#x27;s Hammer symbol has been appropriated by neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, especially those who practice racist or white supremacist versions of neo-Norse beliefs under the guise of Odinism or Wotanism. White supremacists will often even create racist versions of the Thor&#x27;s Hammer, incorporating swastikas or other hate symbols into the decoration.&quot; Scholar Katherine Beard notes that &quot;most people who wear hammer pendants today do so for cultural, religious, or decorative reasons and maintain absolutely no ties to any racist groups or beliefs&quot;.

<text>John Dutton Conant Little (February 1, 1928 – September 27, 2024) was an American operations researcher who was Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was best known for his result in operations research, Little&#x27;s law.

==Life and career==
Born in Boston on February 1, 1928, he earned a B. S. in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1948) and worked at General Electric (1948–50). His Ph.D. on &quot;Use of Storage Water in a Hydroelectric System&quot; used dynamic programming, and advised by Philip M. Morse, was the first ever awarded in operations research (1955).
Next, he taught at the Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve) from 1957 to 1962, before joining the faculty at MIT in 1962 where he since has worked. He was visiting professor at INSEAD (1988).

His earlier research in operations research involved traffic signal control, and gave him fame as he formed the Little&#x27;s law in 1961. It states: &quot;The average number of customers in a stable system (over some interval) is equal to their average arrival rate, multiplied by their average time in the system.&quot; A corollary has been added: &quot;The average time in the system is equal to the average time in queue plus the average time it takes to receive service.&quot; Little is considered to be a founder of marketing science, having conducted fundamental research in models of individual choice behavior, adaptive control of promotional spending, and marketing mix models for consumer packaged goods. He has also started companies such as &quot;Management Decisions Systems&quot; and &quot;Kana Software&quot;. The &quot;John D. C. Little Award&quot; is awarded annually by INFORMS. He is the father of John N. Little.

Little was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1989) for outstanding contributions to operational systems engineering including research, education, and applications in industry and leadership.

Little died on September 27, 2024, at the age of 96.

<text>Inside Out was a hardcore punk band from Orange County, California. It was fronted by Zack de la Rocha, later of Rage Against the Machine.

==Biography==
Inside Out existed from August 1988 to roughly fall of 1991, releasing a single 7-inch EP, &quot;No Spiritual Surrender&quot;, in 1990, on Revelation Records (later converted to six song CD). They played up and down the West Coast and even toured the East Coast once before their breakup in 1991. Many of their songs&#x27; themes are spiritual, but not necessarily religious. They had written material for a second record, to be titled &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; (hence the name for de la Rocha&#x27;s next band), but the band broke up shortly after their guitarist, Vic DiCara, left the band to become a Hare Krishna monk. Vic later started 108, a Krishna-themed hardcore band, and briefly joined Burn, playing guitar in both. 

Inside Out performed on California radio station KXLU, showcasing a number of new songs. The quality of the recording on the show, while adequate for a radio broadcast, is not on par with that of the band&#x27;s EP recording. Copies of their on-air radio broadcast and various live sets have circulated the tape trading underground and file sharing world for years as popular items. In early 2013, a high quality version of one of their final shows from May 1991 surfaced and was remastered and made publicly available. Lyrics to the previously unreleased songs &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; and &quot;Darkness of Greed&quot; were deciphered, and together they give new context to the early beginnings of Rage Against the Machine. Some of their songs focus on issues in society and in the USA (Redemption, Burning Fight) and some are personal to members of the band (Sacrifice, By a Thread). In October 2016, a VHS video of a 1990 Inside Out show in Reading, PA surfaced and was made available online. The Reading, PA video includes a number of [Inside Out]&#x27;s unreleased material. &quot;Burning Fight&quot;, &quot;Deathbed&quot; (which would go on to be a 108 song), Undertone (which features the &quot;wake up&quot; refrain used in Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s song &quot;Wake Up&quot;), &quot;Empty Days&quot;, &quot;Redemption&quot;, &quot;Blind Oppressor&quot;, &quot;Turn&quot; and &quot;Face&quot;.

==Remixes==
In 2006, the track &quot;No Spiritual Surrender&quot; was contributed to the mashup album &quot;Threat: Music That Inspired the Movie&quot;, where it was remixed by Oktopus from Dälek and dubbed &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;.

==Musical style and legacy==
Inside Out were a hardcore punk band, in particular, they were a part of its youth crew subculture. They cited influences including the Faith, Dag Nasty, Minor Threat, Bad Brains and Led Zeppelin. Just prior to the band&#x27;s breakup, the music being written was significantly more influenced by hip hop, particularly Run-DMC.

Songs were composed by DiCara and de la Rocha evenly, with some songs having instrumentals and lyrics written by DiCara and some by de la Rocha while others were collaborations between the two.

They have been cited as an influence by Have Heart, Stick to Your Guns, Linkin Park, Turnstile, One Step Closer, Refused, Incendiary, Coalesce and Mouthpiece.

<text>Bret Hanover (May 19, 1962 – November 21, 1992) was an outstanding American Standardbred racehorse. He was one of only nine pacers to win harness racing&#x27;s Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers and won 62 of 68 starts. He was the first horse to be voted United States Harness Horse of the Year three times and remains the only pacer to have received that honor.

==Breeding==
He was foaled at Hanover Shoe Farms in Hanover, Pennsylvania, on May 19, 1962. Bret Hanover was by the leading sire Adios and out of Brenna Hanover by Tar Heel, a Little Brown Jug winner and a leading sire. At the yearling sales of 1963 Bret Hanover sold for $50,000 the highest priced yearling that year.

==1964 season==
Trained and driven by Frank Ervin in his 1964 debut season in racing, Bret won all 24 of his starts, including the Fox Stake, Battle of Saratoga, Goshen Cup, Review-Little Pat Stake, American National, McMahon Memorial, Roosevelt Futurity, Ohio Standardbred Futurity, Meadow Lands Farm Stake, Star Pointer Stake and Lawrence Sheppard Pace. He earned $173,298 and was named USTA Horse of the Year, the first two-year-old ever to have been given that honour.

==1965 season==
As a 3yo in 1965, Bret Hanover won the Cane Pace, Commodore Pace, Matron Pace, Hanover-Hempt Stake, Battle of Saratoga, Reynolds Memorial and Arden Downs Pace remaining unbeaten. The Arden Downs was this 35th consecutive win. His next start was at Springfield at the Illinois State Fair track in the Review Futurity, where he suffered defeat for the first time — in the first heat, he was beaten into second place by Adios Vic. However, he would win the second heat in a faster time, claiming the stakes. In the Horseman Futurity at Indianapolis, &quot;Bret&quot; won the first heat in 1:55.0 to equal the fastest race mile in history, but he&#x27;d again be beaten by Adios Vic in the second heat (1:56.3), forcing a race-off, which was won by Adios Vic. In September, Bret Hanover won the Little Brown Jug setting a world record in the first heat despite rain delaying the start of the race. His time for the two heats was 1:57 and 1:, which was also a two heat world record for a race on a half mile track. He beat Tuxedo Hanover by lengths in the first heat and 2 lengths in the second before a record crowd of 41,200. Adios Vic, the only horse to have beaten Bret Hanover was fourth in both heats. Bret Hanover then won the Messenger Stakes at Roosevelt Raceway to claim the Pacers Triple Crown. 
He won 21 of 24 starts as a 3yo, earned $340,975 and took U.S. Horse of The Year honors again.

==1966 season==
In his last year of racing, as a four-year-old, Bret Hanover made 20 starts for 17 wins. He lowered the world record to 1:54 and then to 1: at The Red Mile. He was defeated by Cardigan Bay in the Pace of the Century at Yonkers Raceway but beat him in the Revenge Pace. He also won his next four races against Cardigan Bay.
During 1966, Bret Hanover won several major races, including the American National, Empire Pace and Realization Pace. He also made a start in Canada winning the Autumn Classic before a record Canadian crowd for a harness race of 24,454. In his last ever race, the American Classic at Hollywood Park, Bret Hanover set a torrid pace reaching the half mile in 56 seconds and the mile in 1: before tiring. True Duane won with Cardigan Bay finishing second and Bret Hanover third. Trainer and driver Frank Ervin, who was unwell, later admitted he would not have driven Bret Hanover had it not been his last race. Bret Hanover was then retired with a record of 68 starts for 62 wins, 5 seconds and 1 third, and $922,616 in stakes earnings. He was named U. S. Horse of the Year again for 1966.

Bret Hanover is one of only nine horses in history to win the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. He retired as the fastest and richest Standardbred pacer.

==Stud record==
Bret Hanover sold to Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for a record $1 million. He sired the winners of $64,380,702, including Little Brown Jug winners Melvin&#x27;s Woe and Strike Out. He is remembered as one of the best broodmare sires.

After his death on November 21, 1992, Bret Hanover was buried at Castleton before his grave was moved to Lexington&#x27;s Kentucky Horse Park. The bronze sculpture by Spanish sculptor Luis Sanguino that had been erected for him at Castleton Farm today stands at his gravesite.

In 1994 he was inducted into the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame.

Numerous stories have been written about the horse, including the book &quot;Big Bum, The Story of Bret Hanover&quot;. Bret Hanover bowed to the crowd after every win, his driver Frank Ervin got out of the sulky, and Bret then crossed his front legs and bent over as the crowd responded.

<doc id="221627" wikidata="Q1567550" url="?curid=221627" title="Joust (video game)">
<text>Joust is an action game developed by Williams Electronics and released in arcades in 1982. While not the first two-player cooperative video game, &quot;Joust&quot;″s success and polished implementation popularized the concept. Players assume the role of knights armed with lances and mounted on large birds (an ostrich for Player 1, a stork for Player 2), who must fly around the screen and defeat enemy knights riding buzzards. 

John Newcomer led the development team: Bill Pfutzenreuter, Janice Woldenberg-Miller ( Hendricks), Python Anghelo, Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik. Newcomer aimed to create a flying game, with cooperative two-player gameplay, while avoiding the overdone space theme.

The game was well-received by players and critics, and the mechanics influenced other games. &quot;Joust&quot; was ported to numerous home systems and was followed by a more complex and less popular arcade sequel in 1986: &quot;Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game may be played by up to two players simultaneously. Controls for each player consist of a two-position joystick and a button. The screen contains several platforms, with the left and right edges wrapping around to each other. Each press of the button flaps the mount&#x27;s wings; based on the rate at which it is pressed, the knight can ascend or descend at a desired rate or hover in midair. The joystick can be used to steer left and right in midair, or run in a chosen direction if the knight is standing on a platform.

Each wave consists of several enemy knights, in three types and armed with lances. When a player&#x27;s knight and an enemy collide, the one whose lance is at a higher vertical level unseats the other; if the lances are at the same height, the two knights rebound from the collision. Each defeated enemy turns into an egg, which the player can pick up for bonus points. After a short period of time, the egg will hatch into a knight of the next higher difficulty level than the defeated one. If this knight acquires a new mount before the player can pick it up, it returns to the game and must be defeated again. The wave ends when all enemy knights have been defeated and their eggs picked up or destroyed.

Later waves introduce further complications and difficulties, such as:
* A chance to earn a bonus for completing a wave without losing any lives
* Destruction of portions of the bottommost platform to expose pools of lava. Any knight or egg that falls in is immediately destroyed.
* The emergence of the Lava Troll, a disembodied hand that can reach up from the lava and try to drag down knights that approach too closely. The player can escape its grip with repeated, rapid flapping.
* Disappearance of some of the midair platforms.
* Waves that begin with eggs scattered all over the screen instead of enemies.
* The appearance of a pterodactyl, which flies randomly around the screen and tries to unseat the players&#x27; knights. A precisely timed and aimed lance strike is required to defeat it for bonus points. 

In a two-player game, the players may cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other as desired.

One life is lost whenever a player&#x27;s knight is unseated, or falls or is dragged into the lava. A player&#x27;s game ends when all lives are lost.

==Development==
&quot;Joust&quot; was developed by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. The development also included programmer Bill Pfutzenreuter, artists Janice Woldenberg-Miller and Python Anghelo, and audio designers Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik. The game features amplified monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, &quot;Joust&quot; was programmed in assembly language. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game&#x27;s settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. Anghelo stenciled the cabinet artwork on a wooden frame, and designed artwork for promotional materials. One such flyer features archaic English, which was also incorporated into the game&#x27;s onscreen instructions and game-over message.

===Conception===
Following the success of the 1981 game &quot;Defender&quot;, Williams searched for new creative staff. John Newcomer, believing video games to be the future of entertainment, left his job as a toy designer to work at Williams, who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included ideas for his top two games, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Joust&quot;. Technical specifications dictated the selection because his vision of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; was technologically infeasible, whereas &quot;Joust&quot; could be accomplished with hardware already available at Williams. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using &quot;Defender&quot;″s hardware. Newcomer was also inspired by the 1980s film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;.

Newcomer conceived &quot;Joust&quot; as a &quot;flying game&quot; with cooperative two-player gameplay, but he did not wish to emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games like &quot;Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot;. To that end, he made a list of things that could fly: machines, animals, and fictional characters. After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea, Newcomer chose birds for their wide appeal and his familiarity with fantasy and science fiction media featuring birds. To further increase his understanding, Newcomer went to the library to study mythology. He believed that the primary protagonist should ride a majestic bird. The first choice was an eagle, but the lack of graceful land mobility dissuaded him. Instead, he decided that a flying ostrich was more believable than a running eagle. To differentiate between the first and second player characters, the developers picked a stork, believing the proportions were similar to an ostrich while the color difference would avoid confusion among players. Newcomer chose vultures as the main enemies, believing that they would be recognizably evil. Anghelo created concept art of the characters as guidance for further design.

===Design===
The decision to use birds prompted Newcomer to deviate from the standard eight-direction joystick. He implemented a flapping mechanism to allow players to control the character&#x27;s ascent and descent. With the vertical direction controlled via the arcade cabinet&#x27;s button, a two-way joystick was added to dictate horizontal direction. Though other Williams employees were concerned about the design, Newcomer believed that a direct control scheme for flight would strengthen the connection between the player and the character. The combat was devised to allow for higher levels of strategy than traditional shooting games. Because flying became an integral gameplay element, he chose to have characters collide as a means of combat, with victory decided by onscreen elevation.

The developers created the game using 96K of ROM chip storage, which limited the data size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The ROM size limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics are hand-animated pixel art. To animate the birds, Woldenberg-Miller used Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s book &quot;Animals In Motion&quot; as a reference. Given the limited memory, she had to balance the number of frames (to minimize file size) while maintaining realistic animation. Woldenberg-Miller chose gray for the buzzards, but changed it to green to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16 colors to create the entire display. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized the look of the platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically require larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Newcomer prioritized the crucial wing-flap sound above others related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs.

In designing the levels, Newcomer added platforms to the environment after the combat was devised. A static game world was chosen, instead of a scrolling world, to focus on detailed visual textures applied to the platforms; the hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling, and the team believed that displaying the whole environment would aid players. The final game world element designed was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters too close to the bottom of the screen. Newcomer placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenreuter&#x27;s enemy artificial intelligence (AI), which was programmed for attack patterns based partly on platform placements. The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more aggressive behavior. Bounders flew around the environment randomly, occasionally reacting to the protagonist. Hunters sought the player&#x27;s character in an effort to collide. Shadow Lords flew quickly and closer to the top of the screen; Pfutzenreuter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord&#x27;s chances of victory against the player. The pterodactyl was designed to prevent players from idling, and to be difficult to defeat as it was vulnerable only in its open mouth during a specific animation frame and it quickly flies upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of a platform. The game prioritizes its graphics processing to favor the player characters over the enemies, so enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on-screen sprites increases.

While playtesting the game, the team discovered an animation bug they described as a &quot;belly flop&quot;. The flaw allowed players to force the ostrich or stork sprite through an otherwise impassable small gap between two adjacent platforms of very close elevation. Because it provided an interesting method to perform a sneak attack on an opponent below the gap, and because of limited time available, the developers decided to keep the defect as an undocumented feature rather than fix it.

A second bug, which allows the pterodactyl to be easily defeated, was discovered after the game was first distributed. Newcomer had always designed the game and its AI with each sprite&#x27;s dimension in mind, but the pterodactyl&#x27;s sprite had been altered to improve the appearance one day before the game was finished. The new sprite allowed the pterodactyl to be easily defeated an unending number of times. The player could sit on the center ledge, with a single enemy knight caught indefinitely in the hand of the Lava Troll, and kill an unlimited number of pterodactyls simply by turning to face them as they entered the screen. Using this flaw, the player could quickly accumulate a very high score, and a large cache of lives, with no significant skill required. Upon learning of the flaw, Williams shipped a new ROM for the arcade cabinets to assuage distributors&#x27; complaints.

==Ports==
Atari, Inc. published &quot;Joust&quot; for its own systems and under the Atarisoft label for others: Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, and Mac. A port for IBM PC compatibles was completed, but was never published by Atarisoft.

&quot;Joust&quot; was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by HAL Laboratory with programming by Satoru Iwata.

A port of &quot;Joust&quot; to the BBC Micro was done by Stuart Cheshire under the pseudonym &quot;Delos D. Harriman&quot; (which he also used for his networked tank game, &quot;Bolo&quot;), but since Atarisoft had reportedly ceased releasing titles for other systems, the work remained largely unavailable and was subsequently acquired by Aardvark Software, publisher of &quot;Frak&quot; and &quot;Zalaga&quot;, whereupon it received its first review. The game nevertheless remained unavailable for over a year before eventually being released as &quot;Skirmish&quot; by Godax for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.

==Reception==
Given the peculiar control scheme, Williams was concerned that the game would be unsuccessful, and arcades were hesitant to purchase the game. Williams eventually shipped 26,000 units, and &quot;Electronic Games&quot; in 1983 described it as &quot;tremendously popular&quot;. In the United States, it topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade charts in January 1983, and the &quot;RePlay&quot; upright arcade cabinet charts from January to February 1983. It was among the thirteen highest-grossing arcade games of 1983 in the United States.

A cocktail table version was later released, engineered by Leo Ludzia. It is unique among cocktail games with its side-by-side seating rather than opposing sides, allowing Williams to reuse the same ROM chip from the upright cabinets. With substantially fewer units manufactured than the upright arcade machine, the cocktail version is a rare collector&#x27;s item.

French magazine &quot;Tilt&quot; rated the arcade game four out of six stars in 1983. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; rated the Atari VCS version 83% in 1989.

===Retrospective===
In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the arcade version 26th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list. In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade version as number 83 on its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that it had original concepts, quirky designs, and playability. Video game historian Steve Kent considered &quot;Joust&quot; one of the more memorable games of its time. Author David Ellis agreed, and stated that the game remains enjoyable to this day. In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the number sixty-nine arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact. A writer for &quot;Video Gaming Illustrated&quot; called &quot;Joust&quot; exotic with lifelike animation. In 2015, &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; listed the game on their &quot;200 Best Video Games of All Time&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; called the Atari 8-bit version a &quot;unique, addictive arcade game&quot; that was &quot;almost identical&quot; to the original. The magazine concluded that &quot;Joust&quot; was &quot;Atari&#x27;s finest since &quot;Star Raiders&quot;&quot;. 

Kevin Bowen of &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Classic Gaming wrote that &quot;Joust&quot; has an &quot;incredibly stupid&quot; concept but is an appealing game with good controls and competitive gameplay. He said it is &quot;one of the first really fun multiplayer games&quot;, differentiated from other contemporary multiplayer games, and a precursor to the video game deathmatch.

&quot;Retro Gamer&quot; writer Mike Bevan called the game&#x27;s physics &quot;beautifully&quot; realized, and described &quot;Joust&quot; as one of the &quot;most remarkable and well-loved titles&quot; of the Williams library. A &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; writer called the game &quot;weird and wonderful&quot;. Author John Sellers praised the competitive two-player gameplay, and attributed the game&#x27;s appeal to the flapping mechanism. In 2004, Ellis described &quot;Joust&quot; as an example of innovative risk absent in the then-current video game industry.

In retrospect, Newcomer commended Williams&#x27;s management for taking a risk on him and the game. The game has garnered praise from industry professionals as well. Jeff Peters of GearWorks Games lauded the gameplay, describing it as unique and intuitive. Jeff Johannigman of Fusion Learning Systems praised the flapping mechanism and Kim Pallister of Microsoft enjoyed the multi-player aspect.

==Legacy==
A &quot;Joust&quot;-themed pinball table was released in 1983, designed by Barry Oursler and Constantino Mitchell. The game includes artwork and themes from the arcade version. In addition to single player gameplay, it features competitive two-player gameplay with the players on opposing sides of the machine. Fewer than 500 machines were produced.

An arcade sequel, &quot;Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest&quot;, was released in 1986. It has similar gameplay with new elements on a vertical screen.

In 2004, Midway Games also launched a website featuring the browser-based Shockwave versions. The game is in several multi-platform compilations: the 1996 &quot;Williams Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, the 2000 &quot;Midway&#x27;s Greatest Arcade Hits&quot;, and the 2003 &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;. Other compilations are the 1995 &quot;Arcade Classic 4&quot; for the Game Boy and the 2005 &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. &quot;Joust&quot; was released via digital distribution on GameTap, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network. In 2012, &quot;Joust&quot; was included in the compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot;.

Other remakes were in development, but never released. Previously unreleased Atarisoft prototypes of &quot;Joust&quot; for the ColecoVision surfaced in 2001 at the Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas. An adaptation with three-dimensional (3D) graphics (and a port of the original &quot;Joust&quot; as a bonus) was in development for the Atari Jaguar. Titled &quot;Dactyl Joust&quot;, it was eventually canceled. 

A 3D reimagining of the game was announced for the Nintendo 64, going by the tentative titles of &quot;Joust 3D&quot;, &quot;Joust X&quot;, and &quot;Joust 64&quot;. Because the arenas are in 3D, it would have used split screen for the multiplayer battles, but the game was cancelled prior to release. Newcomer pitched an updated version of the arcade game for the Game Boy Advance to Midway Games, which declined. The prototype uses multi-directional scrolling, more detailed graphics based on 3D renders, and new gameplay mechanics.

Tiger Electronics released a keychain version of &quot;Joust&quot; in 1998.

A mobile phone version was released in 2005, but omitted the flapping control scheme. It is also an included title on the Midway Legacy Edition Arcade1Up cabinet.

===Influenced games===
Several games by other developers either copy or build upon &quot;Joust&quot;″s design. The 1983 &quot;Jetpac&quot; and &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, and the 1984 &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;, have elements inspired by it. The flying mechanics in the 2000 game &quot;Messiah&quot; were inspired by &quot;Joust&quot;. The arcade game &quot;Killer Queen&quot; was heavily inspired by &quot;Joust&quot;, and mixes elements of it with RTS and MOBA games.

===Popular culture===
Midway Games optioned &quot;Joust&quot;″s movie rights to CP Productions in 2007. Michael Cerenzie of CP Productions described the script by Marc Gottlieb as &quot;&quot;Gladiator&quot; meets &quot;Mad Max&quot;&quot;, set 25 years in the future. The June 2008 release date was pushed back to 2009, then Midway filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment purchased most of Midway&#x27;s assets, including &quot;Joust&quot;, with the intent to develop film adaptations.

&quot;Joust&quot; is referenced in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Celebutard Mountain&quot;, the &quot;Code Monkeys&quot; episode &quot;Just One of the Gamers&quot;, and the video games &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (Shang Tsung turns into the character from &quot;Joust&quot; as his friendship) and &quot;World of Warcraft: Cataclysm&quot;. In the book &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, Wade Watts defeats an NPC in 2-player &quot;Joust&quot;.

<text>The genus Perisoreus is a very small genus of jays from the Boreal regions of North America and Eurasia from Scandinavia to the Asian seaboard. An isolated species also occurs in north-western Sichuan of China. They belong to the Passerine order of birds in the family Corvidae. Species of &quot;Perisoreus&quot; jays are most closely related to the genus &quot;Cyanopica&quot;.

The genus was introduced by the French zoologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1831. The type species was subsequently designated as the Canada jay. The name of the genus may come from the Ancient Greek &quot;perisōreuō&quot; &quot;to heap up&quot; or &quot;bury beneath&quot;. Alternatively it may be from the Latin &quot;peri-&quot; &quot;very&quot; or &quot;exceedingly&quot; and &quot;sorix&quot;, a bird of augury dedicated to Saturn.

==Species==
The genus contains three species.

<text>The Eskaleut ( ), Eskimo–Aleut or Inuit–Yupik–Unangan languages are a language family native to the northern portions of the North American continent, and a small part of northeastern Asia. Languages in the family are indigenous to parts of what are now the United States (Alaska); Canada (Inuit Nunangat) including Nunavut, Northwest Territories (principally in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region), northern Quebec (Nunavik), and northern Labrador (Nunatsiavut); Greenland; and the Russian Far East (Chukchi Peninsula). The language family is also known as &quot;Eskaleutian&quot;, or &quot;Eskaleutic.&quot;

The Eskaleut language family is divided into two branches: Eskimoan and Aleut. The Aleut branch consists of a single language, Aleut, spoken in the Aleutian Islands and the Pribilof Islands. Aleut is divided into several dialects. The Eskimoan languages are divided into two branches: the Yupik languages, spoken in western and southwestern Alaska and in Chukotka, and the Inuit languages, spoken in northern Alaska, Canada and Greenland. Inuit languages, which cover a huge range of territory, are divided into several varieties. Neighbouring varieties are quite similar, although those at the farthest distances from the centre in the Diomede Islands and East Greenland are quite divergent.

The proper place of one language, Sirenik, within the Eskimoan family has not been settled. While some linguists list it as a branch of Yupik, others list it as a separate branch of the Eskimoan family, alongside the Yupik and Inuit languages.

==History==

The Eskaleut languages are among the native languages of the Americas. They are not demonstrably related to the other language families of North America and are believed to represent a separate, and the last, prehistoric migration of people from Asia.
The Alaska Native Language Center believes that the ancestral Eskaleut language divided into the Eskimoan and Aleut branches at least 4,000 years ago. The Eskimoan language family split into the Yupik and Inuit branches around 1,000 years ago. More recent classifications find a third branch, Old Sirenik.

Alexander Vovin (2015) notes that northern Tungusic languages, which are spoken in eastern Siberia and northeastern China, have Eskaleut loanwords that are not found in Southern Tungusic, implying that Eskaleut was once much more widely spoken in eastern Siberia. Vovin (2015) estimates that the Eskaleut loanwords in Northern Tungusic had been borrowed no more than 2,000 years ago, which was when Tungusic was spreading northwards from its homeland in the middle reaches of the Amur River. Vovin (2015) concludes that the homeland (&quot;Urheimat&quot;) of Proto-Eskaleut was in Siberia rather than in Alaska.

== Position among the world&#x27;s language families ==

Eskaleut does not have any genetic relationship to any of the world&#x27;s other language families, this being generally accepted by linguists at the present time. There is general agreement that it is not closely related to the other language families of North America. The more credible proposals on the external relations of Eskaleut all concern one or more of the language families of northern Eurasia, such as Chukotko-Kamchatkan just across the Bering Strait. One of the first such proposals, the Eskimo–Uralic hypothesis, was suggested by the pioneering Danish linguist Rasmus Rask in 1818, upon noticing similarities between Greenlandic and Finnish. Perhaps the most fully developed proposal to date is Michael Fortescue&#x27;s Uralo–Siberian hypothesis, published in 1998 which links Eskaleut languages to Yukaghir and the Uralic languages.

More recently Joseph Greenberg (2000–2002) suggested grouping Eskaleut with all of the language families of northern Eurasia (Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Korean, Japanese, Ainu, Nivkh/Gilayak, and Chukchi–Kamchatkan), with the exception of Yeniseian, in a proposed language family called Eurasiatic. Such proposals are not generally accepted. Criticisms have been made stating that Greenberg&#x27;s hypothesis is ahistorical, meaning that it lacks and sacrifices known historical elements of language in favour of external similarities. Although the Eurasiatic hypothesis is generally disregarded by linguists, one critique by Stefan Georg and Alexander Vovin stated that they were not willing to disregard the theory immediately although ultimately agreed that Greenberg&#x27;s conclusion was dubious. Greenberg explicitly states that his developments were based on the previous macro-comparative work done by Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Bomhard and Kerns. By providing evidence of lexical comparison, Greenberg hoped that it would strengthen his hypothesis.

Despite all these efforts, the Eurasiatic language theory was overruled on the basis that mass comparison is not accurate enough an approach. In comparative linguistics, the comparative method bases its validity on highly regular changes, not occasional semantic and phonological similarities, which is what the Eurasiatic hypothesis provides.

In the 1960s Morris Swadesh suggested a connection with the Wakashan languages. This was expanded by Jan Henrik Holst (2005).

== Notable features ==
Every word must have only one root (free morpheme) always at the beginning. Eskaleut languages have a relatively small number of roots: in the case of Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik, around two thousand. Following the root are a number of &quot;postbases&quot;, which are bound morphemes that add to the basic meaning of the root. If the meaning of the postbase is to be expressed alone, a special neutral root (in the case of Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik and Inuktitut &quot;pi&quot;) is used.

The basic word schema is as follows: root-(affixes)-inflection-(enclitic). Below is an example from Central Siberian Yupik.

There are a total of three affixes internal to the word &#x27;angyagh.&#x27; The root (or free morpheme) &#x27;angyagh&#x27; and the inflection &#x27;-tuq&#x27; on the right consist of the indicative mood marker plus third person singular. The enclitic –lu ‘also’ follows the inflection.

Following the postbases are non-lexical suffixes that indicate case on nouns and person and mood on verbs. The number of cases varies, with Aleut languages having a greatly reduced case system compared to Eskimoan. The Eskimoan languages are ergative–absolutive in nouns and in Yup&#x27;ik languages, also in verbal person marking. All Eskaleut languages have obligatory verbal agreement with agent and patient in transitive clauses, and there are special suffixes used for this purpose in subordinate clauses, which makes these languages, like most in the North Pacific, highly &quot;complement deranking&quot;.

At the end of a word there can be one of a small number of clitics with meanings such as &quot;but&quot; or indicating a polar question.

Phonologically, the Eskaleut languages resemble other language families of northern North America (Na-Dene and Tsimshianic) and far-eastern Siberia (Chukotko-Kamchatkan). There are usually only three vowels—, , —though some Yup&#x27;ik dialects also have . All Eskaleut languages lack both ejectives and aspirates, in which they resemble the Siberian languages more than the North American ones. Eskaleut languages possess voiceless plosives at four positions (bilabial, coronal, velar and uvular) in all languages except Aleut, which has lost the bilabial stops (though it has retained the nasal). There are usually contrasting voiced and voiceless fricatives at the same positions, and in the Eskimoan subfamily a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is also present. A rare feature of many dialects of Yup&#x27;ik and Aleut is contrasting voiceless nasals.

== Phonology ==
=== Eskimoan ===
The following vowels and consonants were taken from Michael Fortescue et al., 2010.

====Vowels====
Eskimoan corresponds to Aleut .

==== Consonants ====

Inuit allows only a single initial consonant and no more than two successive consonants between vowels.

Yupik exhibits no consonant assimilation process so common to Inuit.

Consonants in parentheses are non-Proto-Eskimoan phonemes.

=== Aleut ===
The following vowels and consonants were taken from Knut Bergsland, (1997).

====Vowels====

The Aleut language has six vowels in total: three short vowels , , , and three long vowels , , . Orthographically, they would be spelled &quot;ii&quot;, &quot;uu&quot;, and &quot;aa&quot;. There are no diphthongs in Aleut vowels. The length of the vowel is dependent upon three characteristics: stress, surrounding consonants, and in particularly Eastern Aleut, surrounding vowels. Short vowels are in initial position if a following consonant is velar or labial. For example: the demonstratives &quot;uka&quot;, &quot;ika&quot;, and &quot;aka&quot;.

Long vowels are lower than their short counterpart vowels, but are less retracted if they make contact with a uvular consonant. For example: &quot;uuquchiing&quot; &#x27;blue fox,&#x27; &quot;qiiqix̂&quot; &#x27;storm-petrel&#x27;, and &quot;qaaqaan&quot; &#x27;eat it!&#x27;

==== Consonants ====

The Aleut consonants featured below include single Roman letters, digraphs, and one trigraph. Phonemes in parentheses are found only in Russian and English loanwords, the phoneme in italics is found only in Eastern Aleut, and the bold phonemes are a part of the standard Aleut inventory.

Aleut has no native labial stops and allows clusters of up to three consonants as well as consonant clusters in word initial position.

Cross-linguistically rare phonological features include voiceless nasals and absence of a .

== Morphology ==

===Language type===

====Polysynthetic language====

Eskaleut is polysynthetic, which features a process in which a single word is able to contain multiple post-bases or morphemes. The Eskaleut languages are exclusively suffixing (with the exception of one prefix in Inuktitut that appears in demonstratives). Suffixes are able to combine and ultimately create an unlimited number of words. Some of the morphemes that are able to attach contain features such as carrying nominal subjects and objects, adverbial information, direct objects, and spatial noun phrases. Polysynthetic languages are said to be a form of extreme agglutination, which allows single words to carry the same information that another language expresses in whole clauses. For example, in Central Alaskan Yupik, one can say:

As a polysynthetic language, Eskaleut is concerned with what &quot;each morpheme means, which categories it can attach to, whether there is any category change, etc. and what type of morphophonological effect occurs to the left as it attaches to the stem&quot;.

====Morphosyntactic alignment====

&quot;Ergative–absolutive language:&quot;
Eskaleut follows the basic word order of subject–object–verb (SOV).

Eskimoan is an ergative–absolutive language. This means subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs are marked with the absolutive case, while subjects of transitive verbs are marked with the ergative case.

Aleut is not an ergative–absolutive language. It does not matter if the verb is transitive or intransitive—subjects and objects are not marked differently.

If a transitive object or an object of possession is openly communicated, ergative case marking will not be expressed. If a transitive object or object of possession is not openly communicated, then ergative case marking will be expressed.

Example of case marking in Aleut:

== Syntax ==
The syntax of Eskaleut is concerned with the functional use of its morphological structure. The two language branches, although part of the same family, have separated and detached themselves in relation to grammatical similarities. Bergsland states that Aleut, which was once a language more similar to Proto-Eskimoan than the current Eskimoan languages themselves, has distanced itself from the ancient language.

The case inflections, &quot;relative *-m, instrumental *-mEk/meN, and locative *-mi have undergone phonological merger and led to a completely different explanation of ergative morphology in Proto-Eskimoan.

In order to further explain the profound changes that have occurred in Aleutian syntax, Bergsland proposed the Domino Effect, which is ultimately the chronological order of Aleut’s unique features. Below is a step by step list of the &#x27;domino effect&#x27;:

&quot;The Domino Effect:&quot;
# The phonological reduction of final syllables and the ensuing syncretism of locative, relative, and instrumental case markers;
# The collapse of the ergative system and of the distinction between relative and locative case in postpositional constructions;
# The development of the unusual Aleut anaphoric reference system from the debris of this collapse, going hand in hand with a strict fixation of SOV word order;
# The simple 3rd person forms when the original morphemes began to refer to any anaphoric (non-overt) referent, and;
# The spread of such a referent&#x27;s own number (including that of a possessor of some overt argument) to the final verb of the (complex) sentence, overriding agreement with the subject.

== Vocabulary comparison ==
The following is a comparison of cognates among the basic vocabulary across the Eskaleut language family (about 122 words). Note that empty cells do not imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language is formed from another stem and is not a cognate with the other words in the row. Also, there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another, and so the &quot;common meaning&quot; given is only approximate. In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language. Forms are given in native Latin orthographies unless otherwise noted.

Cognates of the Eskimoan languages can be found in Michael Fortescue et al., 2010.

Cognates of the Aleut language can be found in Knut Bergsland, 1997.

; Persons


; Pronouns

There are two types of pronouns: independent pronouns and pronominal pronouns.

;; Pronouns in relation to nouns

In Eskaleut languages, singular, dual, and plural nouns are marked by inflectional suffixes, and if they are possessed, the number marker is followed by pronominal suffixes that specify the (human) possessor. There are no genders, and this can be seen in the four persons: &quot;my, your, his/her, his/her own&quot;.

&quot;His/her own&quot; specifies ownership, in contrast with &quot;his/her&quot;, which does not. E.g., &quot;his&quot; house vs. &quot;his own&quot; house. (See Possessive determiner § Semantics.)

;; Pronouns in relation to verbs

Aleut uses independent pronouns, instead of pronominal marking on verbs. On the other hand, Eskimoan languages have four persons and three numbers marked by pronominal suffixes.

<text>The Zhuang (; ; , , Sawndip: 佈獞) are a Tai-speaking ethnic group who mostly live in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Southern China. Some also live in the Yunnan, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Hunan provinces. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. With the Bouyei, Nùng, Tày, and other Northern Tai speakers, they are sometimes known as the Rau or Rao people. Their population, estimated at 18 million people, makes them the largest minority in China.

==Etymology==
The Chinese character used for the Zhuang people has changed several times. Their autonym, &quot;Cuengh&quot; in Standard Zhuang, was originally written with the graphic pejorative , (or &quot;tóng&quot;, referring to a variety of wild dog). Chinese characters typically combine a semantic element or radical and a phonetic element. John DeFrancis recorded that was previously Tóng, , with &quot;dog radical&quot; and &quot;tóng&quot;, phonetic, a slur, but also describes how the People&#x27;s Republic of China eventually removed it. In 1949, after the Chinese civil war, the logograph was officially replaced with a different graphic pejorative, (&quot;Zhuàng&quot; or &quot;tóng&quot;, meaning &quot;child; boy servant&quot;), with the &quot;human radical&quot; with the same phonetic. Later was changed to a different character , (meaning &quot;strong; robust&quot;).

==Relationship to the Nùng and Tày==
The Zhuang, Nùng, and Tày people are a cluster of Tai peoples with very similar customs and dress known as the Rau peoples. In China, the Zhuang are today the largest non-Han Chinese minority with around 14.5 million population in Guangxi Province alone. In Vietnam, as of 1999, there were 933,653 Nùng people and 1,574,822 Tày people. Recently the Tày and Nùng have been referred to as a combined Tày-Nùng minority. However these ethnonyms are a recent phenomenon and did not exist until the modern age. According to Keith Taylor, the Vietnamese terms were &quot;categories of French colonial knowledge&quot; used to differentiate highlanders from lowlanders. The ethnic Zhuang was a product of the &quot;ethnic identification project&quot; pursued in 1950s China.

Many scholars of the Tai peoples consider the Zhuang and Nùng to be essentially the same people, a single ethnic group. During the early 11th century, ethnic identities and boundaries were more fluid than in the modern Sino-Vietnamese borderland. The Zhuang leader Nong Zhigao was defeated in 1055 by the Song dynasty. Had he won, it is possible that he might have established a state under his own clan name, Nong. Instead, his people in China continued to be referred to as Zhuang, which in their own language means &quot;cave&quot;, while in Vietnam they came to be known as Nùng. The majority ethnic group and now the largest minority, however, was and still is the same, the Zhuang/Nùng, who together number more than 15 million people. They are just recognized by different names in China and Vietnam. Nong Zhigao (V. Nùng Trí Cao) has sometimes been claimed by Vietnam as a Vietnamese native, but this is due to antagonism with modern China, while in previous times the Vietnamese sometimes saw him as primarily Chinese.

===Identity===
Some ethnologists such as George Moseley, Diana Lary, Katherine Kaup, and Jeffrey Barlow view the Zhuang ethnicity as a modern constructed ethnic identity. In the eyes of the ethnologists, the Zhuang culture was not sufficiently divergent from what the ethnologists considered &quot;Han culture&quot;, to warrant recognition as a separate ethnic identity. The Zhuang had been interacting with the Han Chinese for over 2,200 years. As early as the Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD), the Zhuang adopted Han cultural practices and technology such as settled agriculture, iron plows, triple cropping, and fertilization. They lived at lower elevations than other minority groups and competed more directly with Han farmers than slash-and-burn agriculturalists. As direct competitors, the Zhuang found it expedient to adopt Han dress and housing styles. After the defeat of the Zhuang leader, Nong Zhigao, in 1055, many Zhuang families and communities gave up their own language and names and completely assimilated into the Han majority.

In one instance, a Zhuang student said that he had previously regarded himself as Han Chinese before being taught that he was Zhuang. The Zhuang did not perceive themselves as marginalized or in need of promotion. Zhuang peasants displayed resistance to the ideal of a formal Romanized Zhuang script, noting that they had used Han script for centuries. Formal classification of the Zhuang also ignored historical similarities between northern Zhuang and the Bouyei people.

==History==
===Origins===
The Zhuang are the indigenous peoples of Guangxi, according to Huang Xianfan. The Zhuang&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the paleolithic ancient human, as demonstrated by a large amount of contemporary archaeological evidence.

===Tang-Song transition===
From 823 to 826, the Zhuang, Huang, and Nong clans, aided with raiders from Champa, attacked Yongzhou and seized 18 counties. The &quot;Nung Grottoes&quot; sought aid from Nanzhao.

During the Huang Chao rebellion (874–884), the Zhuang took part in anti-rebel efforts as irregular units in the Ningyuan Army led by Pang Zhuzhao. After the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, the Southern Han recruited Zhuang archers to outfit its riverine forces. They took part in campaigns against Ma Chu.

The Zhuang do not seem to have aspired to creating an empire after the collapse of the Tang and sought merely autonomy. In fact the opposite seemed to have occurred and the wars in the south drew more Zhuang into contact with Han Chinese as they were sought after as mercenary troops and river porters.

===Song===
====Administration====
The Song dynasty continued the Jimi system of the Tang dynasty and named the officials of those jimi prefectures &quot;zhi&quot;. So the ruler of Nandan was called &quot;Zhi Nandan&quot;. The Zhuang people were governed under this system but not the Yao people, who were far less numerous. Zhuang leaders sought Song approval to legitimate their position. After being recognized, they also received a salary and their family was guaranteed hereditary succession to the post. Song authority was bestowed through seals, which theoretically went to the hereditary leader, but in practice usually went to the claimant put forward by the locals, often after military conflicts. When there was no obvious heir, the seals often went to the wife of the deceased, whose accession to the post became customary. In theory the Song court could replace recalcitrant leaders like an ordinary official, but in practice this power was weighed against the cost to maintain tranquillity among the Zhuang and stability on the Sino-Viet border. As a result, Jimi rulers who were disobedient were usually sufficiently powerful to refuse replacement as well.

Zhuang jimi prefectures were essentially feudal. Land was held by lesser families in perpetuity and could not be sold or transferred. As a result the Zhuang habitually entered military service under the Han Chinese to seek new land, often at the expense of other minorities such as the Yao people. Han Chinese were forbidden from buying Zhuang land or to engage in commercial activity within their jimi districts. However Zhuang-Han marriages were allowed, resulting in land titles that were nominally Zhuang held but had been subsumed under Han administration. The jimi prefectures paid a tax that was usually more a customary and semi-voluntary exaction in practice, though this depended upon the power of the lord. Even when taxed, it was at a lower rate than that of regular prefectures. Many jimi prefectures did not pay taxes but &quot;tribute.&quot; The Mo clan paid 100 ounces of silver as tribute annually.

The jimi prefectures often engaged in petty squabbles that escalated to military conflict. At one point the Mo clan of Nandan pillaged each other over the ownership of an ox before Song authorities settled the matter. Such small scale conflicts were frequent and Song authorities preferred to remain uninvolved and avoided confrontation when possible.

====Military conflicts====
The Zhuang provided the Song dynasty with river transportation during the Song conquest of Southern Han (970–971). Some 20,000 Zhuang also fought for Southern Han but they were defeated. Afterwards, the Mo clan of Nandan submitted to Song authority in 974 and the Meng clan of Yizhou rebelled in 1038 but was put down.

In 980, the Zhuang participated in the Song–Đại Cồ Việt war as Song allies, however the expedition ended in defeat.

In 1000, the Zhuang attacked Yongzhou but the attack was quelled by Zhuang troops of the Song-allied Huang clan.

In 1001, Zhuang calling themselves the Troops of Chen (&quot;chenbing&quot;) rebelled in Yizhou. Their leader, Su Chengzhun, titled himself King of the Pacified South (&quot;nanping wang&quot;). The rebels took a few towns but were hampered by floods and suffered several defeats until their leader was killed three months later.

In 1004, a Nong chieftain was given a banquet at a Song prefecture. The Viets reacted to this with anger and pillaged the area.

In 1038, there was a disturbance at Rongzhou and Yizhou which took troops from three prefectures the loss of six high-ranking officials to suppress. The prefect of Yizhou blamed the unrest on bad administration and that the problem was the result of systematic neglect of the south on the throne&#x27;s part: administrators received inadequate salaries and local troops only received supplies sporadically. As a result, the temptation to raid barbarian lands was irresistible.

In 1044, Ou Xifan of the Ou clan rebelled to the northwest of Yizhou. Ou Xifan had received a jinshi degree and served as an officer but grew dissatisfied with his rewards. He declared the Great Tang and declared war on the Song. He was caught in 1045 and executed by vivisection.

====Rise of the Nong====
During the early Song period, the Huang clan was left in charge of the You and Zuo rivers. The Wei had settled on the Song-Viet boarder. However the power of the Nong clan increased and began to upset Huang supremacy. By the early Song, they ruled over an area known as Temo, which stretched from modern Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the west to Jingxi in the east and Guangyuanzhou (Quảng Nguyên, now Cao Bằng province) in the south. Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976-997) bestowed special favors on Nong leadership, acknowledging that they had succeeded the Huang in the Zuo River region.

The first member of the Nong clan to gain official recognition was Nong Minfu. It is not known when he was born, but a memorial in early 977 states that the &quot;peaceful and generous&quot; leader Nong Minfu of Guangyuanzhou had established himself over ten neighboring villages with the support of Southern Han (907-971). Minfu had supported Duan Siping (r. 937–944) of the Dali Kingdom and was rewarded with titles. Duan rewarded another leader in Temo with the title &quot;buxie&quot;. The Song bestowed the titles &quot;minister of works&quot; (&quot;sigong&quot;) and &quot;grand master of splendid happiness bearing the golden pocket with purple trimming&quot; (&quot;jinzi guanglu daifu&quot;) on Minfu. These titles were passed onto Minfu&#x27;s son, Nong Quanfu (, ). He was also granted additional authority of Dangyouzhou (modern Jingxi, Guangxi). His younger brother, Nong Quanlu, controlled Wennaizhou (modern Na Rì District). Such preferential treatment was viewed with anger in Đại Cồ Việt, which attacked a Song garrison in 1004 after it held a banquet for a Nong chieftain.

In 1005, a woman known as A Nong was born to a notable warrior chieftain who accepted titles from both the Song dynasty and the Early Lê dynasty of Đại Cồ Việt. A Nong learned to spin and weave from her mother. At some point she was separated from the other girls and learned the ways of a shaman. She married Nong Quanfu and became his primary political adviser. Her brother, Nong Dangdao, inherited Wulezhou near Guangyuanzhou. She gave birth to Nong Zhigao in 1025. A Nong induced Quanfu to kill his brother, the leader of the Cen clan, and take his lands. The Nong clan eventually controlled 14 major grottoes (&quot;dong&quot;) in comparison to only 5 for the Huang clan.

In 1035, Quanfu declared the founding of the Kingdom of Longevity (&quot;Changsheng Guo&quot; 長生國) and took for himself the exalted title &quot;Luminous and Sage Emperor&quot; (&quot;Zhaosheng Huangdi&quot; 昭聖皇帝) while A Nong became the &quot;Enlightened and Virtuous Empress&quot; (&quot;Mingde Huanghou&quot; 明德皇后). Another source says he founded the &quot;Chang Qi Guo&quot; and styled himself the first king of Dali, &quot;Tu Dan Chao&quot;. The local prefect of Tianzhou requested assistance from Yongzhou to deal with the rebellion, but officials there appear to have feared involvement and refused to offer aid. In 1039, the emperor of the Lý dynasty, Lý Thái Tông, invaded the newly found kingdom, captured Quanfu and four other male members of the Nong clan, and executed them. A Nong escaped with the 14-year old Zhigao into Song territory.

====Nong Zhigao====
In 1041, Nong Zhigao and his mother seized Dangyouzhou (modern Jingxi, Guangxi) and the Leihuo grotto settlement (modern Daxin County). A Nong married a wealthy merchant but Zhigao murdered this man. A Nong married a third time to Nong Xiaqing, expanding their territory further into Temo. In 1042, Zhigao declared the founding the Kingdom of the Great Succession (&quot;Dali Guo&quot; 大歷國, not to be confused with the Kingdom of Dali 大理). Đại Cồ Việt sent troops and captured him. He was held prisoner for a year before he was released with an honorary title and given control of Guangyuan, Leihuo, Ping&#x27;an, Pinpo, and Silang in return for a share of their natural resources, particularly gold. In 1048, Zhigao declared another state, the Kingdom of the Southern Heavens (&quot;Nantian Guo&quot;), and took a reign title, &quot;Auspicious Circumstances&quot; (&quot;Jingrui&quot;). He called the Viet court&#x27;s actions criminal and that his territory would not be annexed by China. In the fall of 1049, Zhigao&#x27;s forces pillaged Yongzhou. In 1050, Đại Cồ Việt launched an attack on Zhigao&#x27;s stronghold and evicted him, sending him fleeing into Song territory.

Nong Zhigao approached the Song at Yongzhou for assistance but was denied an audience until he staged a military demonstration beneath the walls. He then presented substantial tribute (tame elephants and lumps of gold and silver) and petitioned the emperor. The prefect of Yongzhou, Chen Gong, never passed on the petition to court. However when the tribute reached the court, the Fiscal Commissioner Xiao Gu argued to the emperor that Zhigao should be granted title. The Song court refused because it considered Zhigao&#x27;s service to be the right of Đại Cồ Việt. The military commander Yuan Yun was dispatched to attack Zhigao but instead he wanted to offer Zhigao protection, and returned to the capital with tribute, arguing for a change in policy.

Zhigao&#x27;s followers set up shop and through the mineral wealth of his holdings formed close ties with Chinese traders, including jinshi degree holders Huang Wei and Huang Shifu. He also recruited other Nong clan members such as Nong Zhizhong and Nong Jianhou. Under the influence of Huang Wei and A Nong, Zhigao decided to declare independence. In 1052, Zhigao proclaimed the establishment of the Kingdom of the Great South (&quot;Danan Guo&quot;) and granted himself the title of Benevolent and Kind Emperor (&quot;Renhui Huangdi&quot;). In the spring of 1052, Zhigao ordered the villages under his control to be burnt and led 5,000 subjects on the path to Guangzhou.

By summertime, he had taken Yongzhou and reached Guangzhou, where his 50,000 strong army became bogged down in a prolonged siege. Despite cutting off Guangzhou from water, the city was well stocked with provisions, and the defenders fought back with crossbow defenses. The district magistrate Xiao Zhu foiled a waterborne attack on Guangzhou by setting fire to their ships. After 57 days, Zhigao was forced to retreat as more Song reinforcements arrived. He held out at Yongzhou, defeating five Song commanders sent against him. The Song called in a veteran of the Song–Xia wars, Di Qing, to assume command of the anti-rebel forces. He gathered 31,000 men and 32 generals, including Fanluo tribal cavalry from the northwest that &quot;were able to ascend and descend mountains as though walking on level ground.&quot; Lý Thái Tông also offered to send 20,000 troops but the offer was refused out of fear that the troops would not leave afterwards.

One general, Chen Shu, attacked early with 8,000 men and suffered a defeat against the Zhuang forces. Di Qing executed him and 31 officers. He then marched his forces under cover of night and blocked the Kunlun Pass east of Yongzhou. Zhigao attacked the Song forces in early 1054. The Zhuang wore bright crimson uniforms and fought in units of three armed with long shields that advanced &quot;like fire.&quot; One man carried a shield while the other two hurled metal-tipped bamboo javelins. In the initial stages of battle, one Song commander was killed, and the Song army was momentarily forced to fall back. In the second engagement, the Zhuang forces could not withstand the Song infantry charges. The Song infantry hacked at the Zhuang shields with heavy swords and axes while the Fanluo cavalry attacked their wings, breaking their ranks. The Zhuang fled, suffering 5,341 casualties. Di Qing retook Yongzhou and executed the jinshi-holder Huang, two of Zhigao&#x27;s family, and 57 officials. Zhigao and his remaining family fled to seek help from the Zhuang clans, but he was not well liked, and the Huang chieftain, Huang Shouling, refused to aid him. He also requested aid from the Viet court, which sent the tribal commander Võ Nhị to assist the rebels. A Nong and her son Nong Zhiguang, as well as Zhigao&#x27;s sons Nong Jifeng and Nong Jizong, were caught at Temo in Yunnan by Zhuang forces allied with the Song. They were executed. Zhigao failed to raise more troops in Dali.

According to official accounts, Nong Zhigao was executed by the ruler of Dali and his head presented to Song authorities. However popular accounts claim he fled further south into modern northern Thailand, where his descendants thrive to this day. The Zhuang of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture identify as survivors of Zhigao&#x27;s rebel movement and other groups in Dali City, Xishuangbana, and northern Thailand claim to be descended from Zhigao. Many Zhuang songs refer to him as &quot;King Nong.&quot;

====Tuding====

The Song took full control of the Zuo and You rivers, incorporating the regions into the Song bureaucracy. When Zhigao and his fellow rebel chieftains fled, they were replaced by Song-allied clans, primarily the Huang and Cen who were given hereditary posts. Chinese schools in Zhuang areas were set up and the sons of elite Zhuang who enrolled in them later took posts in the Song bureaucracy. Chinese style dress began to influence the Zhuang, who started buttoning their clothing on the right, women wearing bodices, giving up trousers for skirts, and wearing their hair in the Chinese style. Many of the former rebels were enlisted in the Song army, which paid for more than 50,000 Zhuang troops known as &quot;Tuding&quot; (&quot;tubing&quot; or &quot;zhuangding&quot;) from 1064-1067. By 1108, more than a hundred thousand registered as soldiers from the region. The Zhuang warriors carried both a long and short double-edged sword. They were also capable of using crossbows, poisoned arrows, and elephants. A three man Zhuang unit had one man carrying a large shield while the other two hurled javelins. Although they fought for the Song, they only obeyed the orders of their Zhuang chieftains. In 1178, the vice-prefect of Guilin, Zhou Qufei, said that they &quot;live and die at the orders of their leaders.&quot;

====Militarization====
The defeat of Nong Zhigao in Quảng Nguyên (C. Guangyuan; now Cao Bằng Province) removed the tribal buffer zone between Đại Cồ Việt and the Song dynasty. Zhigao&#x27;s final defeat by the Song also had the effect of subordinating a large portion of that zone to direct Song control. The Viet court did not intervene in the matter and for 20 years after the Nong Zhigao rebellions, there was general peace along the border. However the regional power balance had been lost. Han Chinese military settlers moved in and new leaders took over the surviving communities. Several influential Nong leaders sided with the Viet court. Crucial influences for the lead up to war include the Song-court sponsored New Policies promoted by Wang Anshi and efforts by the Lý court to consolidate peripheral fiefdoms.

The Song and Đại Cồ Việt treated their frontier borderland peoples in different ways. The Chinese tried to introduce &quot;uncultured&quot; barbarians to the benefits of the &quot;civilized&quot; center in the post-Nong Zhigao period. Viet leadership on the other hand created &quot;patron-client&quot; relationships using marriage alliances and military expeditions to maintain &quot;satellite&quot; partners. Successive Viet courts saw the extraction of resources from frontier vassals as a measurement of their efficacy. However by the 11th century, both the Chinese and Viet courts saw the frontier as a source of available troops famed for their ferocity. By 1065, around 44,500 militia had been recruited from these communities by the Song.

Frontier unrest began anew in 1057 when Nong Zongdan (V. Nùng Tông Ðán), a kinsman of Nong Zhigao, entered Song territory. The frontier administrator Wang Han visited Zongdan&#x27;s camp at Leihuo to discourage him from seeking inclusion in the Song dynasty since it would upset the Viet court. Instead he proposed that he stay outside Song territory as a loyal frontier militia leader. Wang feared that a resurgence of the Nong clan would spell trouble for the frontier. The Song court ignored his apprehensions and offered the Nong and other communities &quot;Interior Dependency&quot; status. By 1061, Emperor Renzong of Song (r. 1022-63) was regretting his decision and lamented that the &quot;Nong Bandit&quot; and his kin had strayed far from their frontier duties and might never be incorporated into the Song administration. However in 1062 when Zongdan requested his territory be incorporated into the Song empire, Renzong accepted his request. According to &quot;The Draft Documents Pertaining to Song Official Matters&quot;, Zongdan was regarded by the Song as the prefect of Leihuo prefecture, renamed &quot;Pacified Prefecture&quot; (&quot;Shun&#x27;anzhou&quot;), and possessed the title &quot;Personal Guardian General of the Right.&quot; Nong Zhihui (V. Nùng Trí Hội), the brother of Nong Zhigao, received the title &quot;Personal Guardian of the Left.&quot; Other members of the Nong clan in Temo such as Nong Bing, Nong Guang, and Nong Xiaqing swore loyalty to the Song. Zhigao&#x27;s former generals Lu Bao (V. Lư Báo), Li Mao (V. Lê Mạo), and Huang Zhongqing (V. Hoàng Trọng Khanh) were also granted official titles.

In the view of the Song court, these titles were not merely honorary appointments. Local militia in the southwestern frontier zone were reorganized in 1065 under Guizhou prefect Lu Shen. The 45 grottoes along the You and Zuo rivers were assigned grotto militia leaders. A commissioner surveyed the region for able-bodied men to be organized under a guard commander selected from the area&#x27;s prominent households, who received a specific signal banner to indicate their group&#x27;s distinction. Groups of 30 men were organized into local governance units known as &quot;tithings (&quot;jia&quot;)&quot;, which were organized in groups of five under a troop commandant (&quot;dutou&quot;), groups of ten led by an aboriginal commander (&quot;zhijunshi&quot;), and in groups of 50 led by a commander-in-chief (&quot;duzhijunshi&quot;). It was perhaps this intensification of border defense that the Viet court felt threatened by, as it saw its own systems of local control eroded.

Scholars also note that there was a sharp increase in the population of the Song dynasty&#x27;s southwest frontier by the end of the 11th century. At the end of the 10th c., this region counted only 17,760 households while the same area had increased to 56,596 households in 1078-85. Guangnan West Circuit&#x27;s population in 1080 stood at 287,723 households, a 133% increase from the Tang census of 742. Some of the increase can be attributed to including indigenous populations and improved recording methods, but the trend of increased Han Chinese settlement is clear. With the increase of Han Chinese population also came more northern-oriented cultural practices.

The Lý court was also in the process of consolidating its frontier. In 1059, efforts were made to take direct control of the frontier and its manpower. The northern frontier in the Zuo-You river region was divided into new administrative units: Ngự Long, Vũ Thắng, Long Dực, Thần Ðiện, Bổng Thánh, Bảo Thắng, Hùng Lược, and Vạn Tiệp. Each of these units was assigned an official. Militia units were established among local communities conscripts had the character &quot;Army of the Son of Heaven&quot; (&quot;tianzi jun&quot;) tattooed on their foreheads. This reflected a distinctly Southeast Asian way of controlling regional manpower.

====Sino-Viet conflicts====
In the early 1060s, border conflicts began to occur along the Song-Viet frontier. In the spring of 1060, the chieftain of Lạng Châu and imperial in-law, Thàn Thiệu Tháị, crossed into Song territory to raid for cattle. Thiệu Tháị captured the Song commander Yang Baocai in the attack. In autumn of 1060, Song forces also crossed the border but were unsuccessful in recovering Yang. Fighting caused by the natives led by Thiệu Tháị claimed the lives of five military inspectors. The military commissioner Yu Jing sought aid from Champa for a joint attack on Quảng Nguyên. The Lý court caught wind of this and began directly courting local leaders.

Despite increased military tensions, the Lý court sought to defuse the situation by sending a delegation led by Bi Gia Dụ to Yongzhou. The Song authorities requested the return of Yang Baocai but was denied. Emperor Renzong was also wary of further increasing tensions and instructed the local military commissions to refrain from assembling troops. On 8 February 1063, two tributary envoys from the Lý court presented to the Song emperor nine tame elephants. On 7 April 1063, the new Song emperor Yingzong (r. 1063-67) sent calligraphic compositions by Renzong as gifts to the Lý court. On the same day the Viet envoy Lý Kế Tiên prepared to depart Kaifeng, news arrived that Thàn Thiệu Tháị had attacked settlements in Guangnan West Circuit. A Guangnan official requested immediate retaliation against the southern intruders. However the Song court tried to distance Thiệu Tháị&#x27;s actions from the Lý court. An envoy from Thăng Long arrived seeking forgiveness for the attack. Yingzong decided not to retaliate.

On 18 November 1064, the Guizhou prefect Lu Shen reported that a military delegation from Thăng Long had crossed the border seeking Nong Rixin (V. Nùng Nậht Tân), the son of Nong Zongdan. He also reported that the delegation showed interest in encroaching on Song territory, including Wenmen grotto (Hurun, a village in Jingxi, Guangxi). The Song court took no particular action but Lu was determined to expand Song military presence in the south. Lu raised 44,500 troops from 45 aboriginal leaders along the Zuo-You River region and ordered them to repair and fortify military defenses. To gain local trust, he requested special seals be made for his militia leaders and that the Zuo-You region be exempt from taxes. The Viet officials became concerned about this development and sent a tribute envoy to Kaifeng to remind the Song court of the Viet role in settling frontier matters. Meanwhile Lu proposed a special training and indoctrination program for a local chieftain each year that would see them enter the official bureaucracy after three years.

In late 1065, Zongdan switched allegiance from the Song and proposed an alliance with Lý Thánh Tông (r. 1054-72) and Quảng Nguyên chieftain Liu Ji (V. Lưu Ký). Lu Shen reported this to court, but Yingzong did not take any action other than to reassign Zongdan&#x27;s titles. To offset Zongdan&#x27;s defection, the Song bestowed titles on Nong Zhihui and acknowledged him as the sole leader of Quảng Nguyên.

Song officials on the southern frontier were training for military action. By late 1067, the Guizhou prefect Zhang Tian reported that Liu Ji was in communication with Lu Bao, who had crossed into Song territory to seek personal glory. Zhang wished to attack Lu Bao but the Song court rejected this course of action. However by 1069, Lu Bao had offered his allegiance to the Song while Liu Ji remained in Quảng Nguyên and was nominally under the control of Thăng Long. In late 1071, the Guangnan military commissioner Xiao Gu reported that Liu Ji had been spotted near Shun&#x27;anzhou (in Quảng Nguyên) at the head of more than 200 men. The Song court expressed concerns that forces were being amassed by barbarians.

In 1072, a decree ordered administrators of Zhuang regions to avoid trying to &quot;acquire merit&quot; by military actions, to keep Han Chinese (particularly criminals fleeing the law) out of the region, and to investigate problems which might lead to disorder.

On 2 February 1072, Lý Thánh Tông died. The new ruler, Lý Nhân Tông (r. 1072-1128), was only six years old. His regents, such as the defender-in-chief Lý Thường Kiệt, consolidated power by announcing a general amnesty for all outlaws in the protected prefectures. It was reported that the local chieftain of Lạng Châu, Dương Cảnh Thông, brought to court a white dear as tribute and was rewarded with the title &quot;Grand Guardian.&quot;

In 1073, a group from the &quot;Five Clans&quot; sent a large tribute embassy numbering 890 to the Song court.

====Song–Đại Việt war====

In the late 1060s, Wang Anshi&#x27;s New Policies combined with the sentiment of irredentism in Shenzong&#x27;s court to call on greater militarization and expansion of Song territory. Wang wanted to overhaul the tribute system for barbarians in the south. Lý Thường Kiệt viewed the changing economic relationship between the Song and its frontier people as an abandonment of the traditional tribute paradigm. Wang called for military action from Song imperial troops.

In early 1075, Thăng Long requested the return of an upland chieftain who had gone over to the Song with 700 followers. The Song refused. In the same year, Shenzong sent two officials, Shen Qi and Liu Yi, to govern Guizhou. They were instructed to train the locals in riverine warfare and forbid them from trading with subjects of the Viet court. Lý Thường Kiệt accused the Song of training soldiers for attacking Thăng Long. At the same time, the Quảng Nguyên (C. Guangyuan) chieftain Liu Ji launched an attack on Yongzhou and was repulsed by Nong Zhihui, the chieftain of Guihua.

Lý Thường Kiệt led an invasion of the Song dynasty with support from Zhuang leaders such as Nong Zongdan, who led a contingent of uplanders towards Yongzhou. In October 1075, Zongdan led 23,000 soldiers along the Zuo River into Song territory and captured Guwan, Taiping, Yongping, and Qianlong garrisons. The forces of Zongdan and Lý Thường Kiệt retreated after the arrival of Song reinforcements. A Song counterattack saw the capture of Quảng Nguyên and Liu Ji before being stopped at Nhu Nguyệt River (in modern Bắc Ninh Province). Liu Ji deployed elephant troops against the Song army but they were defeated using scythes that cut their trunks. Several Zhuang grotto settlements in Quảng Nguyên were razed.

Song forces lost about 50%–60% of their force before retreating, half of them dying to diseases. As a result of mounting casualties on both sides, Lý Thường Kiệt made peace overtures to the Song in 1077; the Song commander Guo Kui agreed to withdraw his troops but kept five disputed regions of Quảng Nguyên (renamed Shun&#x27;anzhou or Thuận Châu), Tư Lang Châu, Môn Châu, Tô Mậu Châu, and Quảng Lăng. These areas now comprise most of modern Vietnam&#x27;s Cao Bằng Province and Lạng Sơn Province. Đại Việt held control of the Yongzhou, Qinzhou and Lianzhou. In 1079 the Song arrested and executed the Nong leader Nong Zhichun (V. Nùng Trí Xuân) while taking his family as hostages. In 1083, Viets attacked Guihua under the pretense of pursuing Nong Zhihui, the brother of Nong Zhigao. Zhihui plead to the military commissioner Xiong Ben for fresh troops to ward of Viet advances, but was taken in for questioning instead.

In 1082, after a long period of mutual isolation, King Lý Nhân Tông of Đại Việt returned Yongzhou, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou back to Song authorities, along with prisoners of war, and in return Song relinquished its control of four prefectures and a county, including the Nong clan&#x27;s home of Quảng Nguyên, Bảo Lạc, and Susang. Further negotiations took place from July 6 to August 8, 1084 at Yongping garrison in southern Guangnan, where Đại Việt&#x27;s Director of Military Personnel Lê Văn Thịnh (fl. 1038–1096) convinced Song to fix the two countries&#x27; borders between Quảng Nguyên and Guihua prefectures.

===Ming-Qing===
The Zhuang continued to cause trouble in the Ming dynasty, which used different groups against one another. One of the bloodiest battles in Zhuang history was that at Big Rattan Gorge against the Yao in 1465, where 20,000 deaths were reported. Parts of Guangxi were ruled by the powerful Cen clan (岑). The Cen were of Zhuang ethnicity and were recognized as tusi or local ruler by the Ming and Qing. The Ming launched several campaigns to civilize the non-Han southwestern people, including the Zhuang, by setting up schools. While the Zhuang became more intimately familiar with Han culture, it did not pacify them, and they continued to cause rebellions into the Qing dynasty. Even though schools were introduced to Zhuang areas, the Zhuang chiefly lineages monopolized access to education, limiting the commoners&#x27; ability to take official examinations, thereby securing their social status and political power. The Zhuang served as mercenary troops known as wolf warriors in the Ming army.

Writing in the 19th century, a Qing dynasty official described the Zhuang thus:

===Nationalism===

Many Zhuang peasants took part in revolutionary movements such as the 1911 Revolution as part of the Tongmenghui. In the 1930s, the Kuomintang attempted to control the Zhuang people through force, causing indignation and resentment. In contrast, many Zhuang joined the communist army under the leadership of their Zhuang leader, Wei Baqun. By the 1950s, Zhuang society in Guangxi was largely organized by lineages of &quot;zhixi&quot; (branches) such as the Nong, Sha, and Tu. In September 1952, the People&#x27;s Republic of China recognized the Zhuang as a national minority and established the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Zhuang ethnic consciousness arguably developed in the period afterwards as the region became more connected with other parts of China, especially the urban areas. Public events such as the springtime festival and song festival Sanyuesan (Sam Nyied Sam) were promoted by the government, but by the 1980s they had become more tourist attractions than a symbol of ethnic solidarity for the Zhuang. Zhuang scholars who wanted to promote Zhuang culture and writing mainly lived in the urban areas of Guangxi and Beijing while residents in rural areas were more concerned with poverty and jobs.

====Worship of Nong Zhigao====
Nong Zhigao (V. Nùng Trí Cao) is revered by Tai-speaking communities in Guangxi and Cao Bằng. Many families with the Nong (V. Nùng) surname claim descent from Nong Zhigao and sponsor public displays of pride in the 11th century leader through temples and monuments. There is more evidence of the celebration of Nong Zhigao in Cao Bằng than in Guangxi, especially prior to the modern era, after which the local leader was inserted into nationalist histories as though he were a citizen of China or Vietnam.

Historically the Song general Di Qing, who defeated the rebellion, was the one who was honored. In 1053, a large stele was erected by himself in Guilin to eulogize his deeds. The &quot;suppressing the Man barbarian&quot; (&quot;pingman&quot;) stele described Nong Zhigao as a barbarian bandit who committed crimes against Chinese officials. Local communities also constructed temples to commemorate those officials who died in the rebellion. There is little to no physical evidence of Nong Zhigao&#x27;s commemoration in premodern China. However by the 18th century, certain communities in Guangxi did worship him. In 1956, a stele dating to 1706 was discovered in Tiandeng County. It commemorated the construction of the Zhongxiu Dujun Village Temple and describes how Nong Dalingshen Dianxia (His Highness Nùng the Great Spirit) became a lord, fought valiantly, and transformed into a spirit to protect the region. The primary patrons of the temple were the Huang, Lin and Zhao clans. After the defeat of Nong Zhigao, the Nong clan was forced to take the surname Zhao.

In the late 1970s, Nong Zhigao was rehabilitated as part of the government&#x27;s liberalization policies for national minorities. In the early 1980s, Huang Xianfan&#x27;s &quot;Nong Zhigao&quot; portrayed him as a Chinese leader at the center of a rich local history. After the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, Huang interpreted Nong Zhigao as local leader who fought against a corrupt Song court that refused to provide locals with protection from marauding bands from Đại Việt. The orthodox &quot;Dangdai Zhongguode Guangxi&quot; portrays Nong Zhigao as a Zhuang who rose up to protect Chinese borders from Vietnamese aggression. By the late 1980s, collections of folklore containing tales of Nong Zhigao&#x27;s heroism had been published. On 8 January 1997, a group of Nong Zhigao&#x27;s descendants in Jingxi erected a stele in honor of his birth. The site of the monument is supposedly where Nong Zhigao held his training grounds during his uprising. The Zhuang of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture identify as survivors of Nong Zhigao&#x27;s rebel movement and other groups in Dali City, Xishuangbana, and northern Thailand claim to be descended from Nong Zhigao. Many Zhuang songs refer to him as &quot;King Nong.&quot;

==Customs and culture==
===Gender===
Originally Zhuang society was more egalitarian and female shamans such as A Nong were respected. Families traced their lineage through both male and female members. Men engaged in child rearing and often moved into their wives&#x27; families rather than establish their own. Men believed that their wives regularly dosed them with an elixir called the &quot;Wugu&quot; that would kill them if they were unfaithful. Courting was carried out in a song festival where intended marriage partners responded to each other in rhyme and meter.

At some point Zhuang customs became more patrilineal as they absorbed more Han customs. Families began tracing their lineage through only men. Marriage was decided through horoscopes to match older men and younger women. The wife moved in with the husband upon marriage. Children&#x27;s names were decided by their maternal uncles, who had the role of ritual support during marriage ceremonies and their parents&#x27; funerals. There was also a preference for boys to marry their maternal cousins.

===Languages===
While Chinese scholarship continues to place the Zhuang–Dong languages among the Sino-Tibetan family, other linguists treat the Tai languages as a separate family. They have been linked with the Austronesian languages, which dispersed from Taiwan after a migration from the mainland. However, the Austro-Tai hypothesis uniting these families is now supported by only a few scholars.

The Zhuang languages are a group of mutually unintelligible languages of the Tai family, heavily influenced by nearby Sinitic languages such as Cantonese. The Standard Zhuang language is based on a northern dialect, but it is closer to the Bouyei language than Southern Zhuang, so few people learn it. Due to mutually unintelligible languages or dialects, Zhuang people from different areas use Chinese to communicate with each other and Chinese was used as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in areas of high Zhuang population such as the official Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Whilst according to some semi-official sources &quot;In Guangxi, compulsory education is bilingual in Zhuang and Chinese, with a focus on early Zhuang literacy,&quot; only a small percentage of schools teach written Zhuang. Zhuang has been written using logograms based on Chinese characters (&quot;Sawndip&quot;) for over 1,000 years. Standard Zhuang, the official alphabetical script, was introduced in 1957 and in 1982 the Cyrillic letters were changed to Latin letters. However, the traditional character-based script is more commonly used in less formal domains and in June 2017 just over one thousand of these characters were added in Unicode 10.0 .

The Zhuang have their own scriptures written in poetic form such as the &quot;Baeu Rodo&quot;.

====Sawndip literature====
The literate Zhuang had their own writing system, Sawndip (lit. &quot;uncooked script&quot;), recording folk songs, operas, poems, scriptures, letters, contracts and court documents. The works include both entirely indigenous works and translations from Chinese, fact and fiction, religious texts and secular texts.

====Names====
While most Zhuang people have adopted standard Han Chinese names, some have distinct surnames only found amongst those of Zhuang descent such as &quot;&quot; (), usually pronounced &quot;Qín&quot;.

When comes to places, some village names in China have the suffix &quot;&quot; (), which means &quot;village&quot; in Zhuang (e.g. , , , ).

===Festivals===
The Buluotuo Festival is a three-day event that occurs in April during which singing and chanting take place.

=== Genealogical fabrications and ethnic identity ===

Many Zhuang people falsely claimed their paternal ancestors were Han Chinese from Huguang (Hubei and Hunan), Jiangnan who had migrated to Guangxi and Bouyei people in Guizhou also claimed Han Chinese Jiangnan paternal ancestry from Jiangsu. Bouyei people (Zhongjia) in Guizhou and Zhuang in Guangxi tried to claim false Han paternal ancestors in order to pass as Han people, with the Bouyei making genealogies with a Han ancestors and claimed their ancestors came from Jiangnan, Hubei and Hunan (Huguang) and Shandong. The Zhuang also did this up to the 1950s and claimed their ancestors were northern Han Chinese and made fake genealogies to show it to escape marginalization and discrimination. The Communists made the Zhuang self identify as Zhuang and stop pretending to be Han. Many ethnic minority Zhuang families in southwest China including that of Tusi chieftains fabricated genealogies claiming their paternal ancestors were northern Han Chinese. Zhuang claimed fake Han ancestry in the Anping chiefdom. Zhuang adopted Han Chinese style ancestral halls, Han ideas like fang in their lineage rules and fake Han ancestors in their genealogies.

==== Cen chiefly family ====
The surname Cen is found among the Zhuang Tusi chiefly family who ruled Tusi in Guangxi during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties and they claim patrilineal Han ancestry from Song dynasty general Cen Zhongshu of Zhejiang.

==Religion==

Most Zhuang follow a traditional animist faith known as Moism or Shigongism, which include elements of veneration of forebears. The Mo have their own sutra and professional priests known as &quot;bumo&quot; or &quot;mogong&quot; (&quot;bouxmo&quot;) who traditionally use chicken bones for divination. They may have descended from specialized priestly lineages directly attached to the Zhuang leadership. After the imposition of Chinese rule, the Zhuang priesthood lost their connection to the chieftaincy and gradually assumed the role of a ritual specialist in the villages. The bumo read scriptures, perform divination, and other rituals to drive away pestilence. Their sacred scroll is the &quot;Sanqing&quot; (three pure ones). In Chinese the bumo are known as wushi, spiritual mediums. The &quot;wupo&quot;, in contrast to the bumo, are elderly women considered to be chosen by god, who sing traditional mountain songs. The role of the wupo is Zhuang religion has been minimized due to influence from Chinese religious traditions.

===Deities===
The Zhuang religion believes that the world is composed of three aspects: heaven, earth, and water. Earth is ruled by the creator god, Baeuqloxdoh (Buluotuo), water by the dragon god, Ngweg, and heaven by the thunder god, Gyaj. Baeuqloxdoh&#x27;s wife, Meh Nangz, the mother goddess, is also worshiped.

Mountains are worshiped in Zhuang culture. Between winter and spring, the Zhuang make a trip to the mountains to sing in the Zhuang style, called &quot;hun gamj gok fwen&quot;.

===Other religions===
There are also a number of Buddhists, Taoists, and Christians among the Zhuang.

===Zhuang religious terminology===
*Daoist priests - (Ch. &quot;daogong&quot; 道公, Zh. &quot;bou dao&quot;)
*Vernacular ritual practitioners - (Ch. &quot;mogong&quot; 麽公, Zh. &quot;bou mo&quot; and Ch. &quot;shigong&quot; 師公, Zh. &quot;bou slay&quot;)
*Shamans - (Ch. &quot;wu&quot; 巫, Zh. &quot;moed&quot; and &quot;gyaem&quot;)

==Genetics==
Genetic evidence points out Zhuang possesses a very high frequency of Haplogroup O2 with most of them being subclade O2a making it the most dominant marker, one that they share with Austro-Asiatic. The other portion of O2 belongs to subclade O2a1. Zhuangs have prevalent frequencies of O1 which links them with Austronesian, but O1 is at much lower rate compared to O2a and only slightly higher than O2a1. Haplogroup O2 in Taiwan aborigines is almost completely non-existent, but they exhibit very high frequencies of O1. This suggests that in the event that the Austro-Tai hypothesis is correct, Tai-Kadai speakers would have assimilated mostly Austro-Asiatic people into their population after the separation of Tai and Austronesian.

A 2022 study states that Zhuang show strong genetic affinities with Tai-Kadai-speaking groups such as the Bouyei, Miao, and Yao, as well as Hainan Han. The modern Zhuang gene pool can also be &quot;defined by the common ancestry with Hainan Han, the introgression from southern Chinese groups such as Han, Bouyei, Li, Miao, and Yao, and the long-term phylogenetic relationships with Southeast Asians&quot;.

<text>The deputy secretary of defense (acronym: DepSecDef) is a statutory office () and the second-highest-ranking official in the Department of Defense of the United States of America.

The deputy secretary is the principal civilian deputy to the secretary of defense, and is appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The deputy secretary, by statute, is designated as the DoD chief management officer and must be a civilian, at least seven years removed from service as a commissioned officer on active-duty at the date of appointment.

==History==
, April 2, 1949, originally established this position as the &quot;under secretary of defense&quot;, however August 10, 1949, a.k.a. the 1949 Amendments to the National Security Act of 1947, changed the title to deputy secretary of defense. Former assistant to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Stephen Early, became the first officer holder when he was sworn in on May 2, 1949.

, October 27, 1972, established a second deputy secretary of defense position, with both deputies performing duties as prescribed by the secretary of defense. The second deputy position was not filled until December 1975. Robert Ellsworth, serving from December 23, 1975, until January 10, 1977, was the only one to ever hold that office. , October 21, 1977, established two &quot;Under Secretaries of Defense&quot; and abolished the second deputy position.

==Responsibilities==
By delegation, the deputy secretary of defense has full power and authority to act for the secretary of defense and to exercise the powers of the secretary of defense on any and all matters for which the secretary is authorized to act pursuant to statute or executive order. The deputy secretary is first in the line of succession to the secretary of defense.

The typical role of the deputy secretary of defense is to oversee the day-to-day business and lead the internal management processes of the $500-billion-plus Department of Defense budget, that is as its &quot;chief operating officer&quot;; while the secretary of defense as the &quot;chief executive officer&quot; focuses on the big issues of the day, ongoing military operations, high-profile congressional hearings, attending meetings of the National Security Council, and directly advising the president on defense issues.

Prior to February 1, 2018, the deputy secretary of defense also served as the department&#x27;s chief management officer, to whom the deputy chief management officer reported, but those responsibilities were split into a new chief management officer of the Department of Defense position (disestablished on 1 January 2021).

The deputy secretary, among the office&#x27;s many responsibilities, chairs the &quot;Senior Level Review Group&quot; (SLRG), before 2005 known as &quot;Defense Resources Board&quot; (DRB), which provides department-wide budgetary allocation recommendations to the Secretary and the President. Traditionally, the deputy secretary has been the civilian official guiding the process of the &quot;Quadrennial Defense Review&quot; (QDR).

The deputy secretary of defense chairs the &quot;Special Access Program Oversight Committee&quot; (SAPOC), which has oversight responsibilities and provides recommendations with respect to changes in status of the Department&#x27;s Special Access Programs, for either the deputy secretary defense or the secretary of defense to make.

As James Mattis was selecting officials as Donald Trumps first Secretary of Defense, Michèle Flournoy talked with Trump-affiliated officials about joining as deputy secretary. She did not in the end do so.

<doc id="221636" wikidata="Q234792" url="?curid=221636" title="Marsupial mole">
<text>Marsupial moles, the Notoryctidae family, are two species of highly specialized marsupial mammals that are found in the Australian interior. 
They are small burrowing marsupials that anatomically converge on fossorial placental mammals, such as extant golden moles (Chrysochloridae) and extinct epoicotheres (Pholidota). The species are:

* &quot;Notoryctes typhlops&quot; (southern marsupial mole, known as the &quot;itjaritjari&quot; by the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people in Central Australia)
* &quot;Notoryctes caurinus&quot; (northern marsupial mole, also known as the &quot;kakarratul&quot;)

==Characteristics==
In an example of convergent evolution, notoryctids resemble (and fill the ecological niche of) the talpid or true moles from North America and Eurasia and the Chrysochloridae or golden moles from Southern Africa. Like chrysochlorids and epoicotheres, notoryctids use their forelimbs and enlarged central claws to dig in a parasagittal (i.e., up and down) plane, as opposed to the &quot;lateral scratch&quot; style of digging that characterizes talpid moles.

Marsupial moles spend most of their time underground, coming to the surface only occasionally, probably mostly after rains. They are functionally blind, their eyes having become reduced to vestigial lenses under the skin that lack a pupil. They have no external ears, just a pair of tiny holes hidden under thick hair. The head is cone-shaped, with a leathery shield over the muzzle, the body is tubular, and the tail is a short, bald stub encased in leathery skin. They are between long, weigh , and are uniformly covered in fairly short, very fine pale cream to white hair with an iridescent golden sheen. Their pouch is small but well developed and has evolved to face backwards so it does not fill with sand. It contains just two teats, so the animal cannot support more than two young at a time. They are the only marsupials with a true cloaca.

The limbs are very short, with reduced digits. The forefeet have two greatly enlarged, spade shaped, flat claws on the third and fourth digits, which are used to excavate soil in front of the animal. The hindfeet are flattened, and bear three small claws; these feet are used to push soil behind the animal as it digs. Epipubic bones are present but small and as in some other fossorial mammals (e.g., armadillos), the last five cervical vertebrae are fused, giving the head greater rigidity during digging. The animal swims through the soil and does not leave behind a permanent burrow.

The teeth of the marsupial moles are degenerate and bear no resemblance to polyprotodont or diprotodont teeth. Their dental formula varies, but is usually somewhere near . The upper molar teeth are triangular and zalambdodont, i.e., resembling an inverted Greek letter lambda in occlusal view, and the lower molars appear to have lost their talonid basins. Marsupial moles are the only marsupials that are testicond.

==Fossil record==
Notoryctids are represented by early Miocene fossils of &quot;Naraboryctes&quot; from Riversleigh in Queensland, Australia, which show the mosaic acquisition of dental and skeletal features of the living &quot;Notoryctes&quot; from a more surface-dwelling ancestor.
The notoryctid fossil record demonstrates that the primary cusp of the molars is the metacone, distinct from the paracone characteristic of zalambdodont tenrecs, golden moles, and &quot;Solenodon&quot;. Regarding the number of teeth in each dental quadrant (or dental formula), the fossil record demonstrates polymorphism of tooth number, both between specimens and within the same specimen. Nonetheless, older studies concluded there are four molars (typical for marsupials) in each quadrant both in living &quot;Notoryctes&quot; and the fossil notoryctid &quot;Naraboryctes&quot;.

==Evolutionary affinities==
American paleontologist William King Gregory wrote that &quot;&quot;Notoryctes&quot; is a true marsupial&quot; and this view has been repeatedly verified by phylogenetic analyses of comparative anatomy, mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, rare genomic events, and combined datasets of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and morphology and DNA. The largest phylogenetic datasets strongly support the placement of &quot;Notoryctes&quot; as the sister taxon to a dasyuromorph-peramelian clade, within the Australidelphian radiation.

<text>St. Catharines is the most populous city in Canada&#x27;s Niagara Region, the eighth largest urban area in the province of Ontario. As of 2017, St. Catharines has an area of and 140,370 residents. It lies in Southern Ontario, south of Toronto across Lake Ontario, and is inland from the international boundary with the United States along the Niagara River. It is the northern entrance of the Welland Canal. St. Catharines carries the official nickname &quot;The Garden City&quot; due to its 1,000 acres (4 km2) of parks, gardens, and trails.

St. Catharines is between the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and the Canada–U.S. border at Fort Erie. Manufacturing was the city&#x27;s dominant industry, as noted by the heraldic motto, &quot;Industry and Liberality&quot;. General Motors of Canada, Ltd., the Canadian subsidiary of General Motors, was the city&#x27;s largest employer, a distinction now held by the District School Board of Niagara. THK Rhythm Automotive, formerly TRW, operates a plant in the city, although in recent years, employment there has shifted from heavy industry and manufacturing to services.

St. Catharines lies on one of the main telecommunications backbones between Canada and the United States, and as a result a number of call centres operate in the city. It is designated an Urban Growth Centre by the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, intended to achieve a minimum density target of 150 jobs and residents combined per hectare by 2032 or earlier.

St. Catharines is also home to Brock University. 

==History==
=== Early history ===
The Iroquoian speaking Chonnonton peoples who were also known as the &quot;people of the deer&quot; lived in the region. The Chonnonton would grow vegetables like corn, beans, and squash while living in longhouses. In 1647 the Seneca conquered Chonnonton villages from east of the Niagara River. The Haudenosaunee then destroyed the villages in the 1650s. After these attacks and smallpox epidemics, the Chonnontons disappeared completely, with the last recorded appearance of them in 1671 by French explorers.

St. Catharines falls within the original territory of the Mississaugas. A treaty signed in 1782 between the Mississaugas and the British government ceded a large tract of land, which included the St. Catharines area, to the Crown for the purpose of European settlement. St. Catharines was settled by Loyalists in the 1780s. The Crown granted land in compensation for services and for losses in the United States. Early histories credit the Loyalists Serjeant Jacob Dittrick and Private John Hainer as among the first settlers to come to the area in 1790. They took their Crown Patents, where Dick&#x27;s Creek and 12 Mile Creek merge, which is now the city centre of St. Catharines. Historians have speculated that Dick&#x27;s Creek was named after Richard Pierpoint, a Black Loyalist and former American slave, from an oral history account and events that had taken place around that time that would be consistent with him being the source of the name. Secondary to water routes, indigenous trails provided transportation networks, which resulted in the nearby radial road patterns. The surrounding land was surveyed, and ownships were created between 1787 and 1789.

After the Butler&#x27;s Rangers disbanded in 1784 and settled the area, Duncan Murray, as a former quartermaster in the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants), was appointed by the Crown to distribute free government supplies (victuals) for two years to the resettled Loyalists. He did this from his mill, built on the 12 Mile Creek in Power Glen. After his death in 1786, his holdings were forfeited to the merchant Robert Hamilton of Queenston, who tried to operate for profit the well-established Murray&#x27;s Distribution Centre and Mill under the management of his cousin. Among other ventures, Hamilton became land wealthy by expropriating lands from subsistence Loyalist settlers who were incapable of settling their debts. Murray&#x27;s distribution centre, later Hamilton&#x27;s warehouse, and its location have long been a mystery. Hamilton&#x27;s major profits were derived from transhipping supplies for the military and civic establishments from his Queenston enterprise, not from charitably supplying the subsistence Loyalist settlers. Hamilton lacked interest in social development and sold his business to Jesse Thompson before the turn of the 19th century.
The Merritt family arrived after this time and was among the later Loyalists to relocate after the American Revolution. They were from the Carolinas, New York, and New Brunswick. In 1796, Thomas Merritt arrived to build on his relationship with his former Commander and Queen&#x27;s Ranger, John Graves Simcoe, who was now the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. The first Welland Canal was constructed from 1824 to 1833. William Hamilton Merritt worked to promote the ambitious venture by raising funds and enlisting government support. The canal established St. Catharines as the hub of commerce and industry for the Niagara Peninsula. Merritt played a role in making St. Catharines a centre of abolitionist activity. In 1855, the British Methodist Episcopal Church, Salem Chapel; was established at the corner of Geneva and North Streets on land granted to the congregation by Merritt in the early 1840s. The area became known to refugee slaves from the United States as a place of &quot;refuge and rest;&quot; it was a destination, one of the final stops in Canada on the Underground Railroad for African-American refugees fleeing slavery. The abolitionist Harriet Tubman then lived in St. Catharines. By the mid-1850s, the town&#x27;s population was about 6,000, of whom 800 were of African descent. St. Catharines remains an important place in Black Canadian history.

At an unknown early date, an inn was built by Thomas Adams on the east side of what is now Ontario Street. It became a community meeting place, election centre, stagecoach stop, and mail delivery deposit. That had been preceded by the church and a log school house completed before 1797, all on the east bank of the 12 Mile Creek, at the extreme west end of what was then known as Main Street. It was an extension of the old Iroquois Trail and was renamed St. Paul Street by the settlers and their descendants by the mid-19th century. Later, several mills, salt works, numerous retail outlets, a ship building yard, distillery, and various other businesses were developed.

Incorporated as a village in 1845, St. Catharines had a population of about 3,500 in 1846. The primary industry was flour milling. Other industry included ship repairs, four grist mills, a brewery, three distilleries, a tannery, a foundry, a machine, and a pump factory. There were a variety of tradesmen, three bank agencies, and eight taverns. Stage coaches offered service to other towns and villages. There were already six churches or chapels, a post office that received mail daily, a grammar school, and a weekly newspaper.

St. Catharines was incorporated as a city in 1876. The city expanded when it annexed Grantham Township, Merritton, and Port Dalhousie. There was some westward expansion, which was divided between St. Catharines and Lincoln.

=== Origin of name ===
Before it was called St. Catharines, the settlement near Twelve Mile Creek was known by various names, including Shipman&#x27;s Corners and The Twelve. The name St. Catharines was first recorded in 1796, as St. Catherines, and became a common name for the settlement by 1809, but it would often be spelled with &quot;-er-&quot; or with an apostrophe before the &quot;-s&quot;. The name and the spelling were standardized as St. Catharines when the town incorporated in 1845. The Catherine after which the city is named is unclear. Common theories include Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Catherine Butler (wife of Colonel John Butler), and Catherine Askin Hamilton (wife of Robert Hamilton). Catharine Rodman Prendergast Merritt, wife of William Hamilton Merritt, may be the source of the -ar spelling. An alternate theory to explain the spelling was that Catharine with an &quot;-ar&quot; was the typical spelling of the name for Palatine German settlers in the region.

==Geography==
===Climate===
St. Catharines&#x27; climate is humid continental (Köppen borderline &quot;Dfa&quot;/&quot;Dfb&quot;). It has a unique micro-climate because of the moderating influence of Lake Ontario/Lake Erie and the sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment to the south. This climate allows wineries to flourish. As a result, the city records numerous frost-free days and frequent thaws in the winter, although it sometimes receives heavy lake-effect snow during certain wind conditions, and micro-cooling lakeside on some spring afternoons. The summer season is predominantly warm, sometimes hot and humid, with an average high temperature of in July. Summer thunderstorms are commonplace but generally less prevalent and less severe than farther west in southern Ontario due to the diminishing effect of the surrounding lakes.

The highest temperature ever recorded in St. Catharines was on 10 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 18 February 1979.

=== Communities ===
St. Catharines&#x27; development history has resulted in a number of unique and distinct communities within the city. The historical area of St. Catharines consisted of nothing more than what is now the downtown core, with the remaining land being part of Louth Township on the west and Grantham Township on the east. St. Catharines continued to steadily grow through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, eventually annexing land to the southwest that would become Western Hill and Old Glenridge, and to the east and north that would collectively become the central part of St. Catharines. In addition to the growth of St. Catharines, the town of Merritton and the town of Port Dalhousie existed as separate municipalities to the south and north of the city, each slowly growing their own residential base.

Along with the rest of Ontario, St. Catharines experienced explosive growth after World War II. St. Catharines continued to annex Grantham Township as development continued, including the large swaths of land to the north known now as &quot;The North End&quot;. St. Catharines would also absorb Merritton and Port Dalhousie in 1961, making them part of the city. During this time, St. Catharines nearly tripled in population.

With the formation of the Regional Municipality of Niagara in 1970, the portion of Louth Township east of Fifteen Mile Creek was transferred to the City of St. Catharines. This included the eastern portion of the Hamlet of Rockway, as well as the Hamlet of Power Glen. The few remaining portions of Grantham Township in the Northeast corner of the area, including Port Weller, were also transferred to the city. With the new Louth Township lands belonging to the city, St. Catharines would begin two developments in the west end — Martindale Road in 1983, and Vansickle Road in 1987. These developments are nearing completion. There was also a push to continue further expansion to the west in the late 1990s, but this has since been halted by Ontario Greenbelt legislation.

The following distinct communities exist within St. Catharines:

* Carlton - Bunting

==== Downtown ====

Numerous efforts have been made to improve the downtown; the restructuring of manufacturing resulted in a loss of jobs and retail businesses. In the early 21st century, city, university, and private developers undertook several initiatives to revive downtown, related to urban design, clustering activities to attract people to the area as a destination from day through evening events.

In 2006, city council approved converting one-way arteries through the city centre to allow for two-way traffic, to make it easier for people to make their way around the city to explore it. In terms of urban planning and use, two-way traffic improves circulation within the area. The city wanted to improve downtown as a destination, rather than a place to pass through. The council also want to have downtown St. Catharines on the Wine Route, a driving tour of Niagara wineries and an Ontario Wine Council initiative to boost the number of visitors to the region&#x27;s many wineries. The Wine Route was modified to officially redirect winery goers through the downtown starting in 2012. The first phase of two-way traffic was completed in 2009, with St. Paul and King streets being converted. The cost of the conversion was $3.5 million and was shared with Niagara Region. In 2012, most observers concluded that the change had achieved its goals; it garnered national media attention.

In 2009, $54 million in joint federal, provincial and municipal funding was announced for the construction of a performing arts centre in the city&#x27;s core, officially opened in September 2015 as the FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre. Complementing the centre, which features concert, dance and film venues, is Brock University&#x27;s Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts. The university renovated the former Canada Hair Cloth Building to use for the school. This former industrial building is behind St. Paul Street and next to the municipal performing arts centre.

In late 2011, city council approved moving forward with the construction of a new spectator facility to replace the crumbling Garden City Arena Complex, built in 1938. Council voted to build a U-shaped facility, which will be home to the Niagara IceDogs, an Ontario Hockey League team, and be able to host other events, such as concerts. It would have room for 4,500 to 5,300 spectators. The goal is to keep the cost of the facility at or below $50 million and to build it on a swath of land known locally as the lower-level parking lot, behind St. Paul Street and abutting Highway 406. Council&#x27;s commitment to build the facility resulted in IceDogs&#x27; owner Bill Burke promising to sign a 20-year lease with the city after he threatened to move his team if the city chose not to build a new arena.

The city has made other infrastructure improvements to the downtown. In January 2012, a new edition of the Carlisle Street Parking Garage opened. It was built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards and was certified for its environmentally friendly features, including a green roof, preferred carpool and hybrid vehicle parking, greywater collection, permeable interlocking brick pavement, and several bike racks for users. A mixed-use development, the structure was planned for retail space at street level on Carlisle Street, in order to promote activity and business on the street. The project cost $27.9 million, with funding split three ways between the federal, provincial and municipal governments. Starting in 2019, certain streets located in downtown St. Catharines have been closed during weekends to vehicle traffic. These pedestrian zones have expanded over time. $214,500 (~$ in ) was allocated in the city&#x27;s budget in 2021 for these road closures. In 2023, this initiative was discontinued.

Since 1998, St. Catharines has had one of the highest obesity rates of any centre in Canada. A 2001 analysis by Statistics Canada showed that 57.3 percent of its residents were overweight. This caused the media, including CTV, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; to dub St. Catharines as Canada&#x27;s &quot;fattest&quot; city. In 2008, new statistics were released that show that the percentage of obese or obese/overweight residents of Hamilton (74.3%), Kingston (70.1%), and St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador (70%) is now higher than St. Catharines-Niagara (69.3%), though the obesity rate in St. Catharines was higher in 2008 than in 1998.

23% of children in St. Catharines were estimated to be living in poverty as of 2015, which was above Canada&#x27;s average rate of child poverty. In 2022, the municipality itself as an employer became the largest in Ontario to offer a living wage, an action praised by the Niagara Poverty Reduction Network.

== Economy ==
Tourism was considered to be an influential factor in Conference Board of Canada&#x27;s projected GDP growth for St. Catharines. Its economy is affected by the millions of tonnes of cargo shipped through the Welland Canal, as well as 140 industrial buildings based in the city. In 2023, waste management company Ssonix Products had an explosion that killed an employee. A year later, firefighters began an audit of hazardous materials contained in the city&#x27;s buildings.

St. Catharines was the location of a transmission plant for General Motors. The 20 hectare property where the factory once operated is now classified as a contaminated brownfield. In 2025, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario ordered the city to release reports regarding the extent of the environmental contamination on the site. Lead, trichloroethylene, benzene, and polychlorinated biphenyls were present beyond safe limits. The city previously refused freedom of information requests by residents due to concerns that the report could harm General Motor&#x27;s reputation.

==Arts and culture==
=== Theatre ===
St. Catharines is also home to a variety of theatre companies. These companies include Garden City Productions (formerly the Operatic Society of Grantham United Church 1956–1962), Carousel Players (in the Old Courthouse), Mirror Theatre, Essential Collectives Theatre, and the Empty Box Theatre Company. In 2015, the FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre opened. In 2016, the &quot;Film House&quot; launched within the space, featuring cinema screenings with themed or genre-specific nights.

The Grape and Wine Festival Parade is held annually each September. More than 100,000 people were anticipated for the 2022 event.

The International Chicken Chucking Championships takes place every January in the St. Catharines neighbourhood of Port Dalhousie and attracts hundreds of participants and observers. Chicken Chucking consists of pitching or sliding frozen chickens along the ice-covered Martindale Pond and is hosted by the Kilt and Clover. Animal rights groups such as Niagara Action for Animals have protested the event. Proceeds from the event are donated to Community Care, a local food bank.

St. Catharines was one of the cities that hosted the 2022 Canada Summer Games. More than 5,000 athletes and coaches arrived for the games, which took place from August 6 to August 21, 2022. The opening ceremony was held at the Meridian Centre.

An onsite petting farm (containing horses, pigs, sheep, goats and llamas, as well as a donkey named &#x27;Hoti&#x27;—&#x27;Don Quixote&#x27;) is operated by the city from Victoria Day to Thanksgiving weekend. A trail running throughout the park leads to a peaceful waterfront memorial to Canadian victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
* Ontario Jaycee Gardens: Overlooking the Henley Rowing Course, this is the city&#x27;s largest horticultural park, with more than 8 hectares (0.08 km2) of meticulously landscaped gardens and flower displays. Among the displays is a memorial site dedicated to Kristen French. The park exists on land that once featured the Third Welland Canal. The former entrance to the canal can still be seen at the north-west end of the park.
* Walker Arboretum: Located along the hillside of Rodman Hall and the Twelve Mile Creek below, the original owner of this estate was Thomas Rodman Merritt, son of William Hamilton Merritt. In the late 19th century, an English landscape designer named Samuel Richardson was hired by Merritt to tend the grounds.

== Sports ==
===Ice hockey===
St. Catharines entered into the Ontario Hockey Association Junior &#x27;A&#x27; Hockey in 1943 as the St. Catharines Falcons. In 1947, they became the Teepees and were affiliated with the American Hockey League&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons. When the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Chicago Blackhawks made the Bisons their number one farm team, they inherited the Teepees. In the 1960s, the Jr. &#x27;A&#x27; team went deeply into debt to the Chicago Black Hawks, but continued as a successful franchise and were named the St. Catharines Black Hawks. The Hamilton Fincups moved to St. Catharines in 1976 and played here for one year before moving back to Hamilton. The AHL St. Catharines Saints played in St. Catharines between 1982 and 1986, before being forced to re-locate to Newmarket due to protests from the NHL Buffalo Sabres. The St. Catharines Saints served as the farm team for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and today are known as the Toronto Marlies.

In 2007, the OHL&#x27;s Mississauga IceDogs relocated to St. Catharines and became the Niagara IceDogs. The IceDogs played out of the Jack Gatecliff Arena, which was renamed the Gatorade Garden City Complex (since renamed Garden City Arena Complex). In 2014, the IceDogs moved to the newly built Meridian Centre.
Since starting out the team has won the Emms Trophy in 2010–2011 &amp; 2018–2019. They have also won the Bobby Orr Trophy during 2011–2012 season and 2015–2016 season, qualifying for the OHL Finals. They would be beaten both times by the London Knights. The team has had numerous NHL alumni including Alex Pietrangelo, Dougie Hamilton, Vince Dunn, Ryan Strome, Akil Thomas, Jason Robertson and Alex Nedeljkovic.

The current St. Catharines Falcons team plays in the Golden Horseshoe Division of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. The team has played since 1968 and plays all home games out of the Jack Gatecliff Arena. The team were runners up for the Sutherland Cup in 1979, 1990, 1994, 1997, 2000 and 2014, but won the cup in 2012.

=== Basketball ===
In 2015, the National Basketball League of Canada announced that Niagara had been awarded a new franchise to play in the Meridian Centre. The team, named the Niagara River Lions, began play in 2015 where they reached the conference quarterfinals. The team joined the Canadian Elite Basketball League after the 2017–18 season. In 2021, the River Lions had one of their best seasons, finishing 2nd with a 10–4 record. The River Lions made it through the playoffs into the finals, where they lost 65–101 to the Edmonton Stingers. In 2024, the River Lions Captured their 1st CEBL Championship with a 97-95 win over the Vancouver Bandits. The River Lions finished 14-6 led by a perfect 11-0 Home record.

===Baseball===
The city was the home of the New York–Penn League&#x27;s St. Catharines Blue Jays, the Short-season A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, from 1986 to 1999. In 1996 the team was renamed the St. Catharines Stompers, and was subsequently sold and relocated to Queens, New York City in late 1999, where they became the Queens Kings.

===Rugby===
St. Catharines Tigers RFC was formed in 1978. Beginning in 2015, the Tigers joined the Niagara Wasps RFC and play at their field in Thorold.

===Soccer===
League1 Ontario&#x27;s St. Catharines Wolves are one of the most successful professional soccer teams in Canada, and play at Club Roma in the west-end of the city.

===Rowing===

Martindale Pond in St. Catharines&#x27; Port Dalhousie is the site of the annual Royal Canadian Henley Regatta, a world-class event that brings over 3,000 athletes from various nations to the city. The site hosted the FISA World Rowing Championships in 1970 and in 1999. More recently, the World Master&#x27;s Rowing Championship was held at the Martindale Pond in the summer of 2010, with $500,000 (~$ in ) in improvements to the facility such as: a weed harvester, new docking and a new timing system. There are currently talks to bring the Canadian Rowing Hall of Fame to St. Catharines sometime in the near future. The pond is also home to the St. Catharines rowing club, Brock University rowing club, Ridley College rowing club and to the annual CSSRA Championships, which draws hundreds of high school athletes from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. The Martindale Pond or Henley, continues to hold its world-renowned status as a major rowing venue in the world. The rowing event in the Pan American Games were held in St. Catharines in 2015. Several Olympic medallists in rowing are from St. Catharines, including Melanie Kok, Buffy Williams, and Dave Boyes. St Catharines hosted the 2024 World Rowing Championships.

===Sailing===
There are marinas at Port Dalhousie and Port Weller and a club that sails from Municipal Beach. The St. Catharines Marina is at Port Weller. The Port Dalhousie Pier Marina and the Port Dalhousie Yacht Club are at Port Dalhousie.

== Government ==
===Municipal===
St. Catharines is governed by a mayor and city council of twelve city councillors, with two councillors representing each of the six municipal wards in the city. A city councillor is also elected by the council as a whole to serve as deputy mayor, who only fills the role should the elected mayor not be available. St. Catharines City Council meets every Monday and is open to participation by the community. Matters put forward are voted on by members of city council; the mayor presides over council debate and serves very much like the speaker, and as a result only votes in the case of a tie. After 2006, municipal elections will be in November every four years rather than the previous three. Unlike most cities its size, city councillors only serve on a part-time basis and continue with their non-political careers in the community. Only the mayor is elected to a full-time position. St. Catharines City Hall is downtown on Church Street. Tim Rigby was the Mayor of St. Catharines from 1997 to 2006; Brian McMullan was elected to succeed Rigby on 13 November 2006, and was sworn in on 4 December. He was re-elected in October 2010. On 27 October 2014, Walter Sendzik was elected mayor of St. Catharines and assumed office in December 2014.

St. Catharines uses a council-manager government, and as a result a chief administrative officer (CAO) is appointed by council to oversee the day-to-day operations of the city and its departments. The CAO, in effect, is the highest ranking municipal civil servant and has authority over the spending of municipal tax dollars. The CAO advises council on policy matters and acts as liaison between the administrative staff and elected officials. Some of the CAOs duties include assisting in the creation of the municipal budget, and ensuring that municipal funds are spent in a responsible manner. Residents of St. Catharines also elect six regional councillors to the Niagara Regional Council on an at-large basis. Unlike many other regional municipalities in Ontario, regional councillors do not sit on city council and instead only represent at the regional level. Four school board trustees for the District School Board of Niagara representing St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-Lake are elected, as well as three trustees for the Niagara Catholic District School Board, two for five of St. Catharines&#x27; wards, and one for Thorold and the Merriton Ward of St. Catharines. Regional councillors and school board trustees are elected at the same time, and on the same ballot, as the mayor and city councillors. St. Catharines has one of the lowest resident/representative ratios of any large city in Ontario. There are just under 7,000 people per elected municipal representative in St. Catharines, while Oshawa (a similar-sized city in Ontario) has one representative per 13,500 people. London, Ontario, has one representative per 30,500 people and Toronto has one representative per 111,774 people. There has been discussion regarding a modification of the city/regional council arrangement, with the possibility of reducing city council to six full-time representatives and having the six regional councillors serve on city council. While there is growing support in the business community for such an arrangement, city council has been unreceptive to such ideas.

===Provincial===

At the provincial level, St. Catharines is well known for electing high-profile members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Jim Bradley was the Member of Provincial Parliament for St. Catharines from 1977 until 2018 and was Ontario&#x27;s longest serving MPP. Peter Kormos, who represented the southern portions of the city as part of the Welland riding, was a prominent Member of Provincial Parliament in the Ontario New Democratic Party caucus and served previously as Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations in the Bob Rae government. From 1999 to 2003, during the premierships of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves, St. Catharines was the only large city in Ontario to not have at least one government member representing the city, as the Progressive Conservative-held ridings of Lincoln and St. Catharines—Brock were eliminated as a cost-saving measure. Robert Welch, a long-time Deputy Premier of Ontario, represented the now-eliminated Lincoln and St. Catharines—Brock ridings throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

===Federal===
Federally, St. Catharines is one of the most bellwether of any riding in Canada, having only elected an opposition MP twice in its history. Chris Bittle is the current MP for St. Catharines and is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, which currently forms Canada&#x27;s government. The southern portion of the city is included as part of the Niagara Centre riding, and is represented by Vance Badawey, a Liberal Party of Canada MP. Most federal representatives from St. Catharines have maintained a low profile on either the government or opposition backbenches. The exception was Gilbert Parent, who served as Speaker of the House for seven years while Jean Chrétien was Prime Minister.

===Legal===
St. Catharines is the judicial seat of the Niagara North Judicial District of Ontario, Central South Region, which represents the northern half of the Niagara Region equivalent to historic Lincoln County. The Superior Court of Justice is on Church Street across from City Hall. A satellite court is in Grimsby. The city forms &quot;1 District&quot; of the Niagara Regional Police Service. The NRPS headquarters are no longer on Church Street, having moved to Niagara Falls in a finally constructed new building with administrative offices and support services on Cushman Road.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
The most defining transportation icon of St. Catharines is the Welland Canal, a ship canal that runs 43.4 kilometres (27.0 mi), passing through the city. Four of its locks are within city boundaries. The canal allows shipping vessels to traverse the 99.5-metre (326.5 ft) drop in altitude from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. The Garden City Skyway is a nearby bridge that facilitates vehicle traffic into the city.

The main access routes into and out of St. Catharines are served by two major freeways. The Queen Elizabeth Way runs east (at 15-Mile Creek) to west (at Garden City Skyway) and Highway 406 runs north (at QEW) to south (at St. David&#x27;s Road). Prior to the construction of these freeways, St. Paul Street (former Highway 8, now Regional Road 81) and Hartzel Road (former Highway 58, now a city-maintained street) provided east–west and north–south access to the city.

Public transportation is served by the St. Catharines Transit Commission, which operates bus routes throughout the city and neighbouring Thorold. All major routes converge at the St. Catharines Bus Terminal, which is downtown within the headquarters of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. The central station is also served by Coach Canada, with service to Toronto and Niagara Falls.

Though transportation by rail is becoming increasingly popular, the St. Catharines train station is largely under-utilized, with car and bus travel being the dominant forms of transportation for the city. The station is in its original building, outside the downtown core (because of issues involving the crossing of 12-Mile Creek). It is served daily by Via Rail and Amtrak trains connecting it to Toronto and New York City. The provincial and federal government recently committed $385 million each to GO Transit to aid in the development of their 10-Year Capital Expansion Plan, which includes an expansion bus line servicing the Niagara Region. Currently, regular GO Bus service exists to St. Catharines with a stop at Fairview Mall, allowing riders to travel either west toward Burlington or east toward Niagara Falls. A rail link with GO Transit operates during the summer months with plans for the city to be permanently linked via rail in the future.

St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport services general aviation as well as chartered jetliner flights. The airport is served by charter flights from FlyGTA Airlines and offers charter flights to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, Muskoka and Collingwood. It is near the city&#x27;s east-end in neighbouring Niagara-on-the-Lake. Other airports surrounding the city include Niagara Falls/Niagara South Airport and Niagara Central Dorothy Rungeling Airport. The closest airports in proximity offering long-haul and international flights are John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport, Niagara Falls International Airport and Toronto Pearson International Airport.

St. Catharines had one of the first interurban electric streetcar routes, which ran between the city and Merritton and was eventually extended to Port Dalhousie in the north and Thorold to the south. Like most streetcar routes throughout the world, it was decommissioned in the 1960s, and the right-of-way has since been converted to parks and trails.

==Education==
=== Secondary schools ===

The District School Board of Niagara (DSBN), the local public school board, manages 6 secondary schools within St. Catharines: DSBN Academy, Laura Secord Secondary School, Sir Winston Churchill, Governor Simcoe, St. Catharines Collegiate, and Eden. The opening of DSBN Academy was described as &quot;Canada&#x27;s most controversial pedagogical experiment in years&quot; by the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, as the school was specifically geared towards low-income students. This raised fears about segregation in public education and causing low-income students to feel singled out. Proponents argued that the additional academic supports offered to disadvantaged students would raise their chances of attending post-secondary education. Governor Simcoe and Winston Churchill offer French immersion programs. Eden Secondary School, although it operates through the DSBN and receives public school funding, is also a Christian school.

The Niagara Catholic District School Board (NCDSB) manages and operates 3 Catholic secondary schools within the city: Holy Cross, Denis Morris Catholic High School, and Saint Francis.

Ridley College, near the city&#x27;s downtown core in the Western Hill neighbourhood, is a private co-educational boarding and day school. It was established as a boys&#x27; school in 1889, and became co-educational in 1973.

=== Post-secondary ===
St. Catharines is home to Brock University (established 1964), a modern comprehensive university on the Niagara Escarpment. Concordia Lutheran Theological Seminary, a post graduate institution of the Lutheran Church–Canada, also operates there. A partnership between the university and the Ontario Grape and Wine Industry established the city as a centre for cool-climate grape and wine research.

The Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine is a medical school operated by McMaster University with a campus in downtown St. Catharines. Prior to 2004, it was known as the McMaster University School of Medicine.

Although not a part of St. Catharines itself, there are nearby campuses for Niagara College in Niagara on the Lake and Welland. The college used to operate a horticulture-related campus in the city on 360 Niagara Street, across from Laura Secord Secondary School from the 1970s to 1990s.

===Television===
The Niagara region has no television service of its own. Stations broadcasting from Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo are available over-the-air in the region, and the region has a local transmitter (CKVP-DT) rebroadcasting the Barrie CTV 2 station CKVR-DT. A local specialty news and information channel called Niagara News TV launched in February 2011, but ceased operations only 3 months later in April. In 2003, a local business consortium applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a licence to operate TV Niagara, a community television station in St. Catharines. The application was denied by the CRTC in 2005, citing concerns about the group&#x27;s business plan and its dependence on gaining audience share in the Toronto market.

<text>The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station is a United States scientific research station at the South Pole of the Earth. It is the southernmost point under the jurisdiction (not sovereignty) of the United States. The station is located on the high plateau of Antarctica at above sea level. It is administered by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation, specifically the United States Antarctic Program (USAP). It is named in honor of Norwegian Roald Amundsen and Briton Robert F. Scott, who led separate teams that raced to become the first to the pole in the early 1900s.

The original Amundsen–Scott Station was built by Navy Seabees for the federal government of the United States during November 1956, as part of its commitment to the scientific goals of the International Geophysical Year, an effort lasting from January 1957 to June 1958 to study, among other things, the geophysics of the polar regions of Earth.

Before November 1956, there was no permanent artificial structure at the pole, and practically no human presence in the interior of Antarctica. The few scientific stations in Antarctica were near its coast. The station has been continuously occupied since it was built and has been rebuilt, expanded, and upgraded several times.

The station is the only inhabited place on the surface of the Earth from which the Sun is continuously visible for six months; it is then continuously dark for the next six months, with approximately two days of averaged dark and light, twilight, namely the equinoxes. These are, in observational terms, called one extremely long &quot;day&quot; and one equally long &quot;night&quot;. During the six-month &quot;day&quot;, the angle of elevation of the Sun above the horizon varies incrementally. The Sun reaches a rising position throughout the September equinox, and then it is apparent highest at the December solstice which is summer solstice for the south, setting on the March equinox.

During the six-month polar night, air temperatures can drop below and blizzards are more frequent. Between these storms, and regardless of the weather for wavelengths unaffected by drifting snow, the roughly months of ample darkness and dry atmosphere make the station an excellent site for astronomical observations.

The number of scientific researchers and members of the support staff housed at the Amundsen–Scott Station has always varied seasonally, with a peak population of around 150 in the summer operational season from October to February. In recent years, the wintertime population has been around 50 people. Supplies come seasonally, during the warm season by Air or by the South Pole Traverse after it is opened; this traverse links the station to Scott Base and McMurdo Station on Ross Island since 2005 and reduces the amount of flights in. Much of the logistical support for the South Pole Station flows through McMurdo which has the farthest south port, Winter&#x27;s Bay.

==Background==

For the International Geophysical Year, the United States and many other countries embarked on an international exploration of the South Pole. This lead to the USA creating a series of stations for this project, and returning to the South Pole. After a few years the Antarctic treaty was established that provided an international framework for the exploration and study of Antartica.

In October 1956, a U.S. Navy R4D-5L named &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot; (One of the many versions of the DC-3) landed at the South Pole in Antarctica. This was the first time humans had been at the pole since 1912 (see Robert F. Scott&#x27;s British Antarctic Expedition).

South Pole station was one of seven bases that the United States built for the International Geophysical Year, which also included McMurdo, Hallett, Wilkes, Byrd Station, Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (South Pole Station), Ellsworth, and Little America. 

Operation Deep Freeze missions support the construction and operation of the South Pole station, starting with Operation Deep Freeze 1955, and succeeded by &quot;Operation Deep Freeze II&quot;, and so on. In 1960, the year of the fifth mission, codenames began to be based on the year (e.g., &quot;Operation Deep Freeze 60&quot;).

==Structures==

===Original station (1957–2010)===
The original South Pole station is now referred to as &quot;Old Pole&quot;.
The station was constructed by U.S. Navy Seabees led by LTJG Richard Bowers, the eight-man Advance Party being transported by the VX-6 Air Squadron in two R4Ds on November 20, 1956. The U.S. Eighteenth Air Force&#x27;s C-124 Globemaster IIs airdropped most of the equipment and building material. The buildings were constructed from prefabricated four-by-eight-foot modular panels. Exterior surfaces were thick, with an aluminum interior surface, and a plywood exterior surface, sandwiching fiberglass. Skylights were the only windows in flat uniform roof levels, while buildings were connected by a burlap and chicken wire covered tunnel system. The last of the construction crew departed on January 4, 1957. The first wintering-over party consisted of eight IGY scientists led by Paul Siple and eight Navy support men led by LTJG John Tuck. Key components of the camp included an astronomical observatory, a Rawin Tower, a weather balloon inflation shelter, and a snow tunnel with pits for a seismometer and magnetometer. The lowest average temperatures recorded by the group were in the range to , though as Siple points out, &quot;even at I had seen men spitting blood because the capillaries of the bronchial tract frosted&quot;.

On January 3, 1958, Sir Edmund Hillary&#x27;s team from New Zealand, part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, reached the station over land from Scott Base, followed shortly by Sir Vivian Fuchs&#x27; British scientific component.

The buildings of Old Pole were assembled from prefabricated components delivered to the South Pole by air and airdropped. They were originally built on the surface, with covered wood-framed walkways connecting the buildings. Although snow accumulation in open areas at the South Pole is approximately per year, wind-blown snow accumulates much more quickly in the vicinity of raised structures. By 1960, three years after the construction of the station, it had already been buried by of snow.

The station was abandoned in 1975 and became deeply buried, with the pressure causing the mostly wooden roof to cave in. The station was demolished in December 2010, after an equipment operator fell through the structure doing snow stability testing for the National Science Foundation (NSF). The area was being vetted for use as a campground for NGO guests.

===Dome (1975–2010)===

The station was moved in 1975 to the newly constructed Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome wide by high, with steel archways. One served as the entry to the dome and it had a transverse arch that contained modular buildings for the station&#x27;s maintenance, fuel bladders, power plant, snow melter, equipment and vehicles. Individual buildings within the dome contained the dorms, galley, recreational center, post office and labs for monitoring the upper and lower atmosphere and numerous other complex projects in astronomy and astrophysics. The station also included the Skylab, a box-shaped tower slightly taller than the dome. Skylab was connected to the Dome by a tunnel. The Skylab housed atmospheric sensor equipment and later a music room.

During the 1970–1974 summers, the Seabees constructing the dome were housed in Korean War era Jamesway huts. A hut consists of a wooden frame with a raised platform covered by canvas tarp. A double-doored vestibule was at each end. Although heated, the heat was not sufficient to keep them habitable during the winter. After several burned during the 1976–1977 summer, the construction camp was abandoned and later removed.

However, in the 1981–1982 season, extra civilian seasonal personnel were housed in a group of Jamesways known as the &quot;summer camp&quot;. Initially consisting of only two huts, the camp grew to 11 huts housing about 10 people each, plus two recreational huts with bathroom and gym facilities. In addition, a number of science and berthing structures, such as the hypertats and elevated dormitory, were added in the 1990s, particularly for astronomy and astrophysics.

During the period in which the dome served as the main station, many changes to United States South Pole operation took place. From the 1990s on, astrophysical research conducted at the South Pole took advantage of its favorable atmospheric conditions and began to produce important scientific results. Such experiments include the Python, Viper, and DASI telescopes, as well as the South Pole Telescope. The DASI telescope has since been decommissioned and its mount used for the Keck Array. The AMANDA / IceCube experiment makes use of the two-mile (3 km)-thick ice sheet to detect neutrinos which have passed through the earth. An observatory building, the Martin A. Pomerantz Observatory (MAPO), was dedicated in 1995. The importance of these projects changed the priorities in station operation, increasing the status of scientific cargo and personnel.

The 1998–1999 summer season was the last year that VXE-6 with its Lockheed LC-130s serviced the U.S. Antarctic Program. Beginning in 1999–2000, the New York Air National Guard 109th Airlift Wing took responsibility for the daily cargo and passenger flights between McMurdo Station and the South Pole during the summer.

During the winter of 1988 a loud crack was heard in the dome. Upon investigation it was discovered that the foundation base ring beams were broken due to being overstressed.

The dome was dismantled in late 2009. It was crated and given to the Seabees. As of 2025, the dome pieces are stored at Port Hueneme, California. The center oculus is suspended in a display at the Seabee Museum there.

===Elevated station (2008–present)===
In 1992, the design of a new station began for an building with two floor levels that cost US$150 million. Construction began in 1999, adjacent to the Dome. The facility was officially dedicated on January 12, 2008, with a ceremony that included the de-commissioning of the old Dome station. The ceremony was attended by a number of dignitaries flown in specifically for the day, including National Science Foundation Director Arden Bement, scientist Susan Solomon and other government officials. The entirety of building materials to complete the build of the new South Pole Station were flown in from McMurdo Station by the LC-130 Hercules aircraft and the 139th Airlift Squadron Stratton Air National Guard Base, Scotia, New York. Each plane brought of cargo each flight with the total weight of the building material being .

The new station included a modular design, to accommodate rises in population, and an adjustable elevation to prevent it from being buried in snow. Since roughly of snow accumulates every year without ever thawing, the building&#x27;s designers included rounded corners and edges around the structure to help reduce snow drifts. The building faces into the wind with a sloping lower portion of wall. The angled wall increases the wind speed as it flows under the buildings, and passes above the snow-pack, causing the snow to be scoured away. This prevents the building from being quickly buried. Wind tunnel tests show that scouring will continue to occur until the snow level reaches the second floor.

Because snow gradually settles over time under its own weight, the foundations of the building were designed to accommodate substantial differential settling over any one wing in any one line or any one column. If differential settling continues, the supported structure will need to be jacked up and re-leveled. The facility was designed with the primary support columns outboard of the exterior walls so that the entire building can be jacked up a full floor level. During this process, a new section of column will be added over the existing columns then the jacks pull the building up to the higher elevation.

==Operation==

During the summer the station population is typically around 150. Most personnel leave by the middle of February, leaving a few dozen (39 in 2021) &quot;winter-overs&quot;, mostly support staff plus a few scientists, who keep the station functional through the months of Antarctic night. The winter personnel are isolated between mid-February and late October. Wintering-over presents notorious dangers and stresses, as the station population is almost totally isolated. The station is completely self-sufficient during the winter, and powered by three generators running on JP-8 jet fuel. An annual tradition is a back-to-back-to-back viewing of &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Thing&quot; (2011) after the last flight has left for the winter.

Research at the station includes glaciology, geophysics, meteorology, upper atmosphere physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and biomedical studies. In recent years, most of the winter scientists have worked for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory or for low-frequency astronomy experiments such as the South Pole Telescope and BICEP2. The low temperature and low moisture content of the polar air, combined with the altitude of over , causes the air to be far more transparent on some frequencies than is typical elsewhere, and the months of darkness permit sensitive equipment to run constantly.

There is a small greenhouse at the station. The variety of vegetables and herbs in the greenhouse, which range from fresh eggplant to jalapeños, are all produced hydroponically, using only water and nutrients and no soil. The greenhouse is the only source of fresh fruit and vegetables during the winter.

===Transportation===

The station has a runway for aircraft , long. Between October and February, there are several flights per day of U.S. Air Force ski-equipped Lockheed LC-130 Hercules aircraft from the New York Air National Guard, 109 AW, 139AS Stratton Air National Guard via McMurdo Station to supply the station. Resupply missions are collectively termed Operation Deep Freeze.

There is a snow road over the ice sheet from McMurdo, the McMurdo-South Pole highway, which is long.

===Communication===
Data access to the station is provided by NASA&#x27;s TDRS-4 (non operational), 5 (not radio link to 90°), and 6 (not radio link to 90°) satellites: the DOD DSCS-3 satellite, and the commercial Iridium satellite constellation. For the 2007–2008 season, the TDRS relay (named South Pole TDRSS Relay or SPTR) was upgraded to support a data return rate of 50 Mbit/s, which comprises over 90% of the data return capability. The TDRS-1 satellite formerly provided services to the station, but it failed in October 2009 and was subsequently decommissioned. Marisat and LES9 were also formerly used. In July 2016, the GOES-3 satellite was decommissioned due to it nearing the end of its supply of propellant and was replaced by the use of the DSCS-3 satellite, a military communications satellite. DSCS-3 can provide a 30 MB/s data rate compared to GOES-3&#x27;s 1.5 MB/s. DSCS-3 and TDRS-4, 5, and 6 are used together to provide the main communications capability for the station. These satellites provide the data uplink for the station&#x27;s scientific data as well as provide broadband internet and telecommunications access. Only during the main satellite events is the station&#x27;s telephone system able to dial out. The commercial Iridium satellite is used when the TDRS and DSCS satellites are all out of range to give the station limited communications capability during those times. During those times, telephone calls may only be made on several Iridium satellite telephone sets owned by the station. The station&#x27;s IT system also has a limited data uplink over the Iridium network, which allows emails less than 100 KB to be sent and received at all times and small critical data files to be transmitted. This uplink works by bonding the data stream over 12 voice channels. Non-commercial and non-military communication has been provided by amateur ham radio using primarily HF SSB links today but Morse code and other modes have been used, partly in experiments and mainly in bolstering esprit de corps and hobby-type uses. The USA sector has the amateur radio call sign prefix run of KC4 and AT; whereas Soviet/Russian stations are known to use 4K1 and others. The popularity of the hobby during the 1950-80s era saw many ham exchanges between South Polar ham stations and enthusiastic ham operators contacting there from world-wide locations. Over the years, ham radio has established needed emergency communication to Polar base personnel as well as recreational uses.

==Climate==

Typical of inland Antarctica, Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station experiences an ice cap climate (&quot;EF&quot;) with BWk precipitation patterns. The peak season of summer lasts from December to mid February.

At the Amundsen–Scott the average annual precipitation is approximately 50 millimeters (2 inches), primarily falling as snow. This low level of precipitation is characteristic of the Antarctic interior, where the combination of extremely low temperatures and limited moisture in the atmosphere results in an extremely arid climate with minimal snowfall. 

==Media and events==

In 1991, Michael Palin visited the base on the eighth and final episode of his BBC Television documentary, &quot;Pole to Pole&quot;.

On January 10, 1995, NASA, PBS, and NSF collaborated for the first live television broadcast from the South Pole, titled &quot;Spaceship South Pole&quot;. During this interactive broadcast, students from several schools in the United States asked the scientists at the station questions about their work and conditions at the pole.

In 1999, CBS News correspondent Jerry Bowen reported on camera in a talkback with anchors from the Saturday edition of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;.

In 1999, the winter-over physician, Jerri Nielsen, found that she had breast cancer. She had to rely on self-administered chemotherapy, using supplies from a daring July cargo drop, then was picked up in an equally dangerous mid-October landing.

On May 11, 2000, astrophysicist Rodney Marks became ill while walking between the remote observatory and the base. He became increasingly sick over 36 hours, three times returning increasingly distressed to the station&#x27;s doctor. Advice was sought by satellite, but Marks died on May 12, 2000, with his condition undiagnosed. The National Science Foundation issued a statement that Rodney Marks had &quot;apparently died of natural causes, but the specific cause of death had yet to be determined&quot;. The exact cause of Marks&#x27; death could not be determined until his body was removed from Amundsen–Scott Station and flown off Antarctica for an autopsy. Marks&#x27; death was due to methanol poisoning, and the case received media attention as the &quot;first South Pole murder&quot;, although there is no evidence that Marks died as the result of the act of another person.

On 26 April 2001, Kenn Borek Air used a DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft to rescue Dr. Ronald Shemenski from Amundsen–Scott. This was the first ever rescue from the South Pole during polar winter. To achieve the range necessary for this flight, the Twin Otter was equipped with a special ferry tank.

In January 2007, the station was visited by a group of high-level Russian officials, including FSB chiefs Nikolai Patrushev and Vladimir Pronichev. The expedition, led by polar explorer Artur Chilingarov, started from Chile on two Mi-8 helicopters and landed at the South Pole.

On September 6, 2007, The National Geographic Channel&#x27;s television show &quot;Man Made&quot; aired an episode on the construction of their new facility.

On November 9, 2007, edition of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, show co-anchor Ann Curry made a satellite telephone call which was broadcast live from the South Pole.

On Christmas 2007, two employees at the base got into a fight and had to be evacuated.

On July 11, 2011, the winter-over communications technician fell ill and was diagnosed with appendicitis. An emergency open appendectomy was performed by the station doctors with several winter-overs assisting during the surgery.

The 2011 BBC TV programme &quot;Frozen Planet&quot; discusses the base and shows footage of the inside and outside of the elevated station in the &quot;Last Frontier Episode&quot;.

During the 2011 winter-over season, station manager Renee-Nicole Douceur experienced a stroke on August 27, resulting in loss of vision and cognitive function. Because the Amundsen–Scott base lacks diagnostic medical equipment such as an MRI or CT scan machine, station doctors were unable to fully evaluate the damage done by the stroke or the chance of recurrence. Physicians on site recommended a medevac flight as soon as possible for Douceur, but offsite doctors hired by Raytheon Polar Services (the company contracted to run the base) and the National Science Foundation disagreed with the severity of the situation. The National Science Foundation, which is the final authority on all flights and assumes all financial responsibility for the flights, denied the request for medevac, saying the weather was still too hazardous. Plans were made to evacuate Douceur on the first flight available. Douceur and her niece, believing Douceur&#x27;s condition to be grave and believing an earlier medevac flight possible, contacted Senator Jeanne Shaheen for assistance; as the NSF continued to state Douceur&#x27;s condition did not qualify for a medevac attempt and conditions at the base would not permit an earlier flight, Douceur and her supporters brought the situation to media attention. Douceur was evacuated, along with a doctor and an escort, on an October 17 cargo flight. This was the first flight available when the weather window opened up on October 16. This first flight is usually solely for supply and refueling of the station, and does not customarily accept passengers, as the plane&#x27;s cabin is unpressurized. The evacuation was successful, and Douceur arrived in Christchurch, New Zealand, at 10:55 p.m. She ultimately made a full recovery.

In March 2014, BICEP2 announced that they had detected B-modes from gravitational waves generated in the early universe, supporting the inflation theory of cosmology. Later analysis showed that BICEP only saw polarized dust signal in the galaxy and not primordial B-modes.

On 20 June 2016, there was another medical evacuation of two personnel around midwinter day, again involving Kenn Borek Air and DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft.

In December 2016, Buzz Aldrin was visiting the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica, as part of a tourist group, when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand, where he was reported to be in stable condition. Aldrin&#x27;s visit at age 86 makes him the oldest person to ever reach the South Pole.

In the summer of 2016–17, Anthony Bourdain filmed part of an episode of his television show &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot; at the station.

==In popular culture==

Science and life at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station is documented in Dr. John Bird&#x27;s award-winning book, &quot;One Day, One Night: Portraits of the South Pole&quot; which chronicles the South Pole Foucault Pendulum, the 300 Club, the first midwinter medevac, and science at the Pole including climate change and cosmology.

Science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s book &quot;Antarctica&quot; features a fictionalized account of the culture at Amundsen–Scott and McMurdo, set in the near future.

The station is featured prominently in the 1998 &quot;The X-Files&quot; film &quot;Fight the Future&quot;.

The 2009 film &quot;Whiteout&quot; is mainly set at the Amundsen–Scott base, although the building layouts are completely different.

The turn-based strategy game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, in its expansion &quot;Rise and Fall&quot;, included the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station as a Wonder.

The anime OVA &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&quot; features a large city in Antarctica called Scott City under a Geodesic dome not unlike the 1975 dome as the location of a major peace conference between the human space colonies controlled by Zeon and the Earth Federation.

The 2017 novel South Pole Station by Ashley Shelby is set at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station of 2002-2003, prior to the opening of the new facility. 

The 2019 film &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go, Bernadette&quot; features the station prominently and includes scenes of its construction at the closing credits, although the actual station depicted in the film is Halley VI British Antarctic Research Station.

==Time zone==

The South Pole sees the Sun rise and set only once a year. Due to atmospheric refraction, these do not occur exactly on the September equinox and the March equinox, respectively: the Sun is above the horizon for four days longer at each equinox. The place has no solar time; there is no daily maximum or minimum solar height above the horizon. The station uses New Zealand time (UTC+12 during standard time and UTC+13 during daylight saving time) since all flights to McMurdo station depart from Christchurch and, therefore, all official travel from the pole goes through New Zealand.

The zone identifier in the IANA time zone database was the deprecated Antarctica/South_Pole. It now uses the Pacific/Auckland timezone.

<text>Kelowna ( ) is a city on Okanagan Lake in the Okanagan Valley in the southern interior of British Columbia, Canada. It serves as the head office of the Regional District of Central Okanagan. The name Kelowna derives from the Okanagan word &quot;&quot;, referring to a grizzly bear.

Kelowna is the province&#x27;s third-largest metropolitan area (after Vancouver and Victoria). At the same time, it is the seventh-largest city overall and the largest in the Interior. It is the 20th-largest metropolitan area in Canada. The city proper encompasses , and the census metropolitan area . Kelowna&#x27;s population in 2021 was 222,162 in the metropolitan area and 144,576 in the city proper. After a period of suburban expansion into the surrounding mountain slopes, the city council adopted a long-term plan intended to increase density instead — particularly in the downtown core. This has resulted in the construction of taller buildings, including One Water Street — a 36-story building that is the tallest in Kelowna. Other high rise developments have already broken ground or been approved since then, including a 42-storey tower on Leon Avenue which will be the tallest building in the city, and among the tallest in B.C.

Nearby communities include the City of West Kelowna (also referred to as Westbank and Westside) to the west, across Okanagan Lake; Lake Country and Vernon to the north; Peachland to the southwest; and Summerland and Penticton to the south.

== History ==
The exact dates of the first settlement in the Okanagan Valley are unknown, but a northern migration led to the habitation of this area some 9,000 years ago. The Indigenous Syilx people are the first known inhabitants of the region where they continue to live today.

In 1811, David Stuart travelled to the Okanagan Valley, becoming the first European to do so. Despite this, it was not until 1859 that Father Pandosy, a French Roman Catholic Oblate missionary, became the first European to settle there. Pandosy&#x27;s settlement was located at &quot;l&#x27;Anse au Sable&quot; (Bay of Sand), which he named in reference to its sandy shoreline. Although the population remained small for the rest of the 19th century, sustenance fruit growing expanded in Kelowna during the 1870s, and by the 1890s, commercial agriculture had become firmly established.

Kelowna was officially incorporated on May 4, 1905, with a population of 600. The town&#x27;s first mayor was Henry Raymer.

Although agriculture had become an important mark of Kelowna in the surrounding region, the town relied entirely on transportation over Okanagan Lake until 1925. In 1893, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) constructed the steamer SS &quot;Aberdeen&quot; on the lake, which served as the first significant transportation link between Kelowna and Penticton, greatly increasing the speed of Kelowna&#x27;s growth. On September 11, 1925, CP was extended to Kelowna, ending the town&#x27;s reliance on Okanagan Lake for transportation and trade.

In 1911, Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen visited Kelowna for fundraising. At that time, approximately 15% of the population was ethnically Chinese.

On August 6, 1969, a sonic boom from a nearby air show broke a quarter million dollars worth of glass, injuring six people. The destruction was caused by a member of the United States Blue Angels during a practice routine for the Kelowna Regatta festival when the pilot accidentally broke the sound barrier while flying too low.

On November 25, 2005, the First Ministers and National Aboriginal Leaders signed the Kelowna Accord, which sought to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples.

Kelowna celebrated its centennial in May 2005. The same year, construction began on the five-lane William R. Bennett Bridge to replace the three-lane Okanagan Lake Bridge as part of a plan to alleviate traffic problems during the summer tourist season. The new bridge was completed in 2008.

On July 12, 2021, a crane suffered a catastrophic failure while being dismantled at a construction site located at St. Paul Street near Bernard Avenue in downtown Kelowna. Part of the crane struck a nearby office building and a seniors home. The city declared a local state of emergency, and the area&#x27;s residents were evacuated. Five people were killed in the collapse: four construction workers and one person in the office building.

=== Wildfires ===

In Kelowna, many seasonal wildfires have occurred over the years. Some significant fires warranting evacuations and/or causing damage are listed below:
* In August 2003, a nearby wildfire destroyed 239 homes and forced the temporary evacuation of about 30,000 residents. Many trestles of the historic Kettle Valley Railway were destroyed. The trestles have been rebuilt to look like the originals but using smaller dimension beams. This fire consumed of land.
* In July 2009, wildfires destroyed hundreds of hectares of forest and several buildings in West Kelowna; 17,000 residents were evacuated.
*In July 2009, a fire near Rose Valley caused the evacuation of 7,000 people. No structures were lost.
*In July 2009, a fire behind Fintry caused the evacuation of 2,500 people. No structures were lost.
*In September 2012, a late-season, fire destroyed seven buildings and caused the evacuation of 1,500 people in the community of Peachland.
*In July 2014, a fire behind the West Kelowna subdivision of Smith Creek caused the evacuation of 3,000 people.
*In July 2015, a fire near Shelter Cove caused the evacuation of 70 properties.
*In August 2015, a fire burned near Little White Mountain, just south of Kelowna.
*In August 2017, a fire in the Joe Rich area caused the evacuation of over 474 properties.
*In August 2023, a fire was burning in the McDougall Creek area on the west side of Okanagan Lake, causing the evacuation order of over 2,400 properties; winds carried embers across the lake to Kelowna, spawning fires and the loss of city structures.

== Geography ==

=== Landmarks ===
=== Vegetation ===

Kelowna&#x27;s official flower is &quot;Balsamorhiza sagittata&quot;, commonly referred to as arrowleaf balsamroot.

=== Climate ===

Kelowna is classified as a humid continental climate or an inland oceanic climate per the Köppen climate classification system due to its coldest month having an average temperature slightly above and below , with dry, hot, sunny summers and cool, cloudy winters, and four seasons. The official climate station for Kelowna is at the Kelowna International Airport, which is at a higher elevation than the city core, with slightly higher precipitation and cooler nighttime temperatures. Kelowna has the second mildest winter of any non-coastal city in Canada, after neighbouring Penticton. This is caused by the moderating effects of Okanagan Lake combined with mountains separating most of BC from the prairies; however bitter Arctic air masses can occasionally penetrate the valley during winter, usually for very short periods. The coldest recorded temperature in the city was recorded on December 30, 1968. The last time the lake completely froze over was in the winter of 1969.A partial lake freeze also took place in the winter of 1985–1986. Some winters pass without any significant surface ice.

An inversion layer of cloud created by Pacific low pressure system moving into or stalling over the southern interior give Kelowna and the Okanagan Valley near constant cloudy conditions during December and January, making it the cloudiest winter climate in Canada, outside of parts of Newfoundland. Since Okanagan Lake rarely freezes, the warmer air from the lake rises above the colder atmospheric air, leading to a temperature inversion that also contributes to the valley being enveloped by clouds. This valley cloud has a low ceiling, and often bright sunshine can be experienced by driving approximately 20 minutes up into the nearby mountains. Summer days in Kelowna are very warm with periods of hot and sunny conditions. Temperatures typically reach the high 30s °C, or above for at least a few days each summer. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Kelowna was on June 29, 2021. During summer, clear, dry air allows night-time temperatures to fall rapidly, however in the built-up city near lakeside, nights are somewhat warm on average by Canadian standards. The city averages about of precipitation per year, with about a fifth of the precipitation falling as snow, the bulk in December and January; however, June is the wettest month of the year, followed by a sharp drying trend through the remainder of summer.

While some smaller communities such as Blue River and Golden get less wind, Kelowna has the greatest percentage of &quot;calm&quot; wind observations for any major city in Canada (39% of the time). The four-year average wind measured at the airport has been less than on average 10 to 12 months of the year between 2008 and 2011. Kelowna has an average high temperature that is above freezing every month of the year, rare for an inland Canadian city. 


== Sectors and neighbourhoods ==
Kelowna consists of ten sectors with multiple neighbourhoods within the sector boundaries.

===Neighbourhoods===
=== Central City ===
Central City is a linear commercial sector along Harvey Avenue, from downtown to Highway 33. Major commercial developments include the Capri Centre Mall, the Landmark buildings, and the Orchard Park Shopping Centre. Commercial activity is mainly concentrated along or near Highway 97 (Harvey).

=== Dilworth Mountain===
Dilworth Mountain is a relatively low, isolated mountain just over 2000 feet near the city&#x27;s geographic centre. Adjoining Knox Mountain to the west, it is part of the eastern heights that form Glenmore Valley and rises about one thousand feet above the rest of the Okanagan Valley. It has been extensively developed in recent years, with scenic suburban-influenced neighbourhoods only minutes from Central City.

=== Downtown ===

Central Kelowna is a tourist district alongside Okanagan Lake. It is officially defined as all land north of Highway 97, south of Clement Avenue, east of Okanagan Lake, and west of Richter Street. There are two main routes through the downtown core, along which attractions and commerce are concentrated. These include several parks and beaches, boardwalks and other walking trails, Kelowna Marina and Yacht Club, the Delta Grand Hotel and Casino, and Prospera Place arena. The other main route through downtown is Bernard Avenue from Richter Street to the lake, with more shops and restaurants designed for locals and tourists. Although Bernard Avenue continues east well past downtown, it is not part of downtown and is zoned residential. The commercial segment lies within its downtown section between Richter and Abbott streets, the latter of which is lake-adjacent.

Kelowna has declared a downtown area a &quot;red zone&quot; of prolific drug trafficking, assaults and robberies. The red zone extends from Okanagan Lake to the west, Lake Avenue, Rowcliffe to Ethel and Ethel to Stockwell, Doyle and back to the lake. The red zone was identified in 1992 to reduce street crime. The RCMP conducts annual &quot;spring sweeps&quot; there, arresting low-level drug dealers. Kelowna was the second British Columbia city to declare a red zone.

=== Glenmore ===
Glenmore is a suburb primarily within Glenmore Valley, a subsection of the Okanagan Valley in the Kelowna area. It has been extensively developed in the past two decades, transforming from a small suburb with a rural character to large suburban neighbourhoods, including several elementary schools and a rapidly growing commercial hub. While most of its homes are on the relatively flat valley bottom, several large and more recent neighbourhoods, including the community of Wilden, are being built into the adjacent mountains.

=== Midtown ===
The Midtown area, bordered by Enterprise Way on the north and Springfield and Baron Road on the south, is a popular shopping destination for locals. Orchard Park, the shopping complex in BC&#x27;s interior, is here. Since most of Midtown consists of large, car-oriented big-box stores, it is often criticized for its plainness; its contributions to urban sprawl and the decline of the pedestrian-oriented Downtown; and its lack of green space, as the area was formerly a linear park and golf course.

=== Mission ===
Known locally as &quot;the Mission&quot; (or &quot;Okanagan Mission&quot;) to differentiate it from the Lower Mainland city of Mission, this area was a separate jurisdiction before being amalgamated with Kelowna in the mid-to-late-20th century. It features a vibrant secondary commercial centre separate from the downtown, with low- to moderate-density residential areas between them. Its northern border is K.L.O. Road. It is often differentiated as Lower Mission and Upper Mission.

The Lower Mission contains most of the aforementioned commercial areas, such as shopping malls, grocery stores, coffee shops, and boutiques, and also has extensive recreational facilities. Mission Recreation Park has six softball diamonds, soccer fields, community gardens, playgrounds, and trails while neighbouring H2O is Kelowna&#x27;s largest indoor recreation facility with a 50 m pool, water slides, diving boards, and surfing waves. Gyro Beach and Rotary Beach, two of Kelowna&#x27;s most popular beaches, are also located in the Lower Mission.

=== Rutland ===
Rutland is Kelowna&#x27;s largest neighbourhood by far. Although most of the area sits on the valley bottom and is therefore relatively flat, the fringes continue up into the hills and are thus built at higher elevations and possess more expansive views than the rest of the neighbourhood; these homes are correspondingly more expensive. This is the exception, however, as the majority of Rutland is among the most affordable of Kelowna housing. Additionally, the presence of numerous low-rise apartment buildings contributes to a higher population density compared to other areas of the town. Rutland was a town until it amalgamated with Kelowna in 1973, and this union has resulted in Rutland having a distinct commercial centre with many shops and restaurants. An improvement and gentrification effort has been ongoing for the past decade, with new parks, widened sidewalks, bike lanes, a renovated YMCA, a rebuilt high school, and many new shops and condominiums being added.

== Economy ==

The service industry employs the most people in Kelowna, the largest city in the tourist-oriented Okanagan Valley. In summer, boating, golf, hiking and biking are popular, and in winter, both skiing and snowboarding are favourite activities at the nearby Big White and Silver Star ski resorts. Tourism in the Greater Kelowna Area has now become a $1-billion a year industry, as of 2016.

Kelowna produces wines that have received international recognition. Vineyards are common around and south of the city where the climate is ideal for the many wineries. At least two major wineries were damaged or destroyed (now rebuilt) in 2003 due to the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire. Kelowna is also the home of Sun-Rype, a popular manufacturer of fruit bars and juices.

Okanagan College and University of British Columbia are the predominant centres for post-secondary education. Over 8,745 students attend Okanagan College and 8,718 students attend the University of British Columbia. In addition to vocational training and adult basic education, the college offers a highly regarded university transfer program. University of British Columbia&#x27;s Okanagan campus has a student population of over 8,000 full-time students enrolled in diverse undergraduate and graduate programs.

Kelowna is the seat of the Regional District of the Central Okanagan, the third-largest metropolitan area in British Columbia after Vancouver and Victoria and the largest in the British Columbia Interior. With scenic lake vistas and a dry, mild climate, Kelowna has become one of the fastest-growing cities in North America. The appropriate management of such rapid development (and its attendant consequences) is a source of significant debate within the community. Kelowna is the fourth least affordable housing market in Canada, currently maintaining the classification of &quot;Severely Unaffordable.&quot; Because of the Okanagan&#x27;s climate and vineyard-filled scenery, it is often compared to Napa Valley, California.

===Kelowna&#x27;s use as a film locale===
* &quot;Fido&quot;, a comedy/horror/thriller movie about zombies, was filmed in Kelowna and debuted on September 7, 2006, at the Toronto International Film Festival.
* Part of the movie &quot;Mee Shee: The Water Giant&quot; was filmed in Kelowna.
* The movies &quot;Shred&quot; and &quot;Shred 2&quot; were partially filmed at Big White, a ski hill near Kelowna.
* &quot;&quot;, released in 2012, was filmed in Kelowna at several locations, such as Mission Creek Ranch, Kelowna Secondary School, and Gemstone Equestrian Centre.

===Kelowna&#x27;s use as a market trial location===
Due to its moderate population, Kelowna is often used as a market trial area where national businesses and organizations can test a new product. Examples include:
* The Canadian Air Transport Security Authority piloted new whole body imaging technology for passenger screening at the Kelowna International Airport from 2008 to 2009.
* Telus Mobility re-launched its Clearnet discount mobile phone brand in Kelowna and Red Deer, Alberta, in 2011.
* Kelowna was the first city in Canada to have a permanent flow-rider located at the H2O indoor water park.
*Peachwave opened its first Canadian store in Kelowna in 2013.
*Overwaitea Food Group opened its first Urban Fare location outside of downtown Vancouver in Kelowna.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Kelowna CMA had a population of 222,162 living in 94,335 of its 102,097 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 194,892. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2011, 48.4% of residents were male and 51.6% were female. The predominant language spoken in Kelowna is English.

Kelowna&#x27;s population growth has been driven primarily by the movement of Canadians from BC and other provinces into this region, not by international immigration. Only 15.1% of the population is foreign-born. On February 10, 2016, Statistics Canada declared the 3.1% Kelowna census metropolitan area growth rate as being the highest in Canada.

=== Religious groups ===
According to the 2021 census, the religious makeup of Kelowna was:
*irreligious (76,215 people, or 53.8%)

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.
==== Chinese population ====
Kelowna had a historic Chinatown in the area between Harvey Avenue and Leon Avenue, east of Abbott and west of Highway 97 / Harvey Avenue. Historically, most residents of this Chinatown were males. In 1909, 15% of Kelowna&#x27;s population was ethnic Chinese. In 1911, the percentage was the same. That year, Sun Yat-sen visited Kelowna for fundraising purposes. In 1978, the remaining traditional Chinese business ceased operations. By 2010, less than 1% of Kelowna&#x27;s population was ethnic Chinese. A section of the façade of the rebuilt &quot;Chinese Store&quot; that was in Chinatown is now housed at the Kelowna Museum.

===Homelessness===
Women make up nearly half of Kelowna&#x27;s homeless. In other Canadian cities, the overwhelming majority of homeless are males.

On May 12, 2003, the Kelowna Homelessness Networking Group conducted a limited census and enumerated 198 people: 54 individuals from the street and 144 individuals in shelters.

On February 24, 2016, as part of the Government of Canada&#x27;s Homelessness Partnering Strategy, the Central Okanagan Foundation conducted a coordinated Point-in-Time (PiT) Count of Kelowna&#x27;s homeless population. The survey found at least 233 people were homeless, and another 273 were living in temporary housing.

== Transportation ==
Kelowna has experienced significant suburbanization and urban sprawl promoted by the popularity of low-density car-oriented developments. In 2007, Kelowna had the highest car dependency rate in Canada and the second highest per-capita road transportation carbon footprint in British Columbia. With a population of about 230,000, the greater Kelowna area is slightly larger in land area than that of Metro Vancouver. Road transportation accounts for more than 65% of total greenhouse gas emission in the city.

=== Roads and highways ===
The city is served by Highway 97 and Highway 33.

=== Public transport ===

Kelowna Regional Transit System is operated by FirstGroup, providing public bus transportation services in Kelowna and its surrounding areas. Funding for the transit system is shared between the City of Kelowna, Central Okanagan Regional District, District of Lake Country and BC Transit.

=== Air travel ===

Kelowna International Airport (IATA: YLW), north of the city core, is one of the busiest airports in Canada. There are regular flights to and from Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Cranbrook, Whitehorse, and Seattle, as well as seasonal service to Las Vegas, Phoenix, Montréal, Cuba and Mexico. Three major passenger airlines serve the airport; Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, and WestJet. The airport is also the main hub of cargo airline KF Cargo.

== Crime ==
In February 2009, an RCMP gang task unit was approved to help deal with gang violence.

Most crimes in Kelowna are non-violent property crimes. In 2012, Kelowna had the highest reported crime rate in Canada: 8,875 per 100,000. Police focused on crime in 2014, and Kelowna moved into the number four position across the country.

In 2015, RCMP Superintendent Nick Romanchuk stated, &quot;I am absolutely convinced that as our drug enforcement numbers increase, our overall crime rate will decrease.&quot; As of 2016, the crime rate had returned to second highest in Canada. In 2017, the property crime rate in Kelowna went up 6%, once again the highest rate in Canada, while the drug crime rate fell 2%.

In 2013, 446 victims of domestic violence were reported in Kelowna, earning the city the highest per-capita rate of domestic violence in British Columbia and the tenth-highest across Canada. This was a slight drop compared to 2011 when Kelowna reported the fourth-highest rate nationally and led the province in family violence.

In 2014, in Kelowna, there were 251 marijuana charges per 100,000 population, the highest per capita rate in Canada.

In 2012, Kelowna had the highest crime rate of any metropolitan area in Canada, mainly because of its property crime. This increase has, however, been attributed mainly to the actions of a relative few known, prolific offenders. Illicit Drug use is high in the region. Between 2012 and 2016, Kelowna led the country in cannabis, cocaine, and heroin possession. As of 2016, the crime rate has declined to second highest. In 2017, Kelowna had the highest opioid overdose rate in Canada.

<text>Thunder Bay is a city in and the seat of Thunder Bay District, Ontario, Canada. It is the most populous municipality in Northwestern Ontario and the second most populous (after Greater Sudbury) municipality in Northern Ontario. Its population is 108,843 according to the 2021 Canadian census. 
Located on Lake Superior, the census metropolitan area of Thunder Bay has a population of 123,258 and consists of the city of Thunder Bay, the municipalities of Oliver Paipoonge and Neebing, the townships of Shuniah, Conmee, O&#x27;Connor, and Gillies, and the Fort William First Nation.

European settlement in the region began in the late 17th century with a French fur trading outpost on the banks of the Kaministiquia River. It grew into an important transportation hub with its port forming an important link in the shipping of grain and other products from western Canada, through the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the east coast. Forestry and manufacturing played important roles in the city&#x27;s economy. They have declined in recent years, but have been replaced by a &quot;knowledge economy&quot; based on medical research and education. Thunder Bay is the site of the Thunder Bay Regional Health Research Institute.

On 1 January 1970, the City of Thunder Bay was formed through the merger of the cities of Fort William, Port Arthur, and the geographic townships of Neebing and McIntyre. The city takes this name from the immense Thunder Bay at the head of Lake Superior, known on 18th-century French maps as (Bay of Thunder). The city is often referred to as the &quot;Lakehead&quot;, or &quot;Canadian Lakehead&quot;, because of its location at the end of Great Lakes navigation on the Canadian side of the border.

==History==
===Before 1900===
Various Anishinaabe peoples such as the Ojibwa are indigenous to the Thunder Bay Area. European settlement at Thunder Bay began with two French fur trading posts (in 1683 and 1717) which were subsequently abandoned (see Fort William, Ontario). In 1803, the Montreal-based North West Company established Fort William as its mid-continent &quot;entrepôt&quot;.
By the 1850s, the Province of Canada began to take an interest in its western extremity. The discovery of copper in the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan had prompted a national interest in potential mining locations on the Canadian shores of Lake Superior. In 1849, French-speaking Jesuits established the (Mission of the Immaculate Conception) on the Kaministiquia to evangelize the Ojibwe. The Province of Canada negotiated the Robinson Treaty in 1850 with the Ojibwa of Lake Superior. As a result, an Indian reserve was set aside for them south of the Kaministiquia River.

Another settlement developed a few miles to the north of Fort William after construction by the federal Department of Public Works of a road connecting Lake Superior with the Red River Colony. The work was directed by Simon James Dawson (see Port Arthur, Ontario). This public works depot or construction headquarters acquired its first name in May 1870 when Colonel Garnet Wolseley named it Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing. It was renamed Port Arthur by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in May 1883.

The arrival of the CPR sparked a long rivalry between the towns, which did not end until their amalgamation in 1970. Until the 1880s, Port Arthur was a much larger community. The CPR, in collaboration with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, preferred east Fort William, located on the lower Kaministiquia River where the fur trade posts were. Provoked by a prolonged tax dispute with Port Arthur and its seizure of a locomotive in 1889, the CPR relocated all its employees and facilities to Fort William. The collapse of silver mining after 1890 undermined the economy of Port Arthur. It had an economic depression, while Fort William thrived.

===20th century===

In the era of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Thunder Bay began a period of extraordinary growth, based on improved access to markets via the transcontinental railway and development of the western wheat boom. The CPR double-tracked its Winnipeg–Thunder Bay line. The Canadian Northern Railway established facilities at Port Arthur. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway began construction of its facilities at the Fort William Mission in 1905, and the federal government began construction of the National Transcontinental Railway. Grain elevator construction boomed as the volume of grain shipped to Europe increased. Both cities incurred debt to grant bonuses to manufacturing industries.

Thunder Bay was the first city in the world to enact daylight saving time, on 1 July 1908.

By 1914, the twin cities had modern infrastructures (sewers, potable water supply, street lighting, electric light, etc.) Both Fort William and Port Arthur were proponents of municipal ownership. As early as 1892, Port Arthur built Canada&#x27;s first municipally-owned electric street railway. Both cities spurned Bell Telephone Company of Canada to establish their municipally-owned telephone systems in 1902.

The boom came to an end in 1913–1914, aggravated by the outbreak of the First World War. A wartime economy emerged with the making of munitions and shipbuilding. Men from the cities joined the 52nd, 94th, and 141st Battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force.

Railway employment was hurt when the federal government took over the National Transcontinental Railway and Lake Superior Division from the Grand Trunk in 1915, and the Canadian Northern Railway in 1918. These were amalgamated with other government-owned railways in 1923 to form the Canadian National Railways. The CNR closed many of the Canadian Northern Railway facilities in Port Arthur. It opened the Neebing yards in Neebing Township in 1922. By 1929, the population of the two cities had recovered to pre-war levels.

The forest products industry has played an important role in the Thunder Bay economy since the 1870s. In the 1880s, Herman Finger established the Pigeon River Lumber Company in the area, and also built the Gunflint and Lake Superior Railroad, but he dissolved the lumber company and moved his operations to The Pas by 1919. Logs and lumber were shipped primarily to the United States. In 1917, the first pulp and paper mill was established in Port Arthur. It was followed by a mill at Fort William, in 1920. Eventually, four mills were operating.

Manufacturing resumed in 1937 when the Canada Car and Foundry Company plant (opened for the manufacture of naval ships and railcars during the late World War I) re-opened to build British aircraft. Now run by Alstom, the plant has remained a mainstay of the post-war economy. It has produced forestry equipment and transportation equipment for urban transit systems, such as the Toronto Transit Commission and GO Transit.

===Amalgamation===
On 1 January 1970, the City of Thunder Bay was formed through the merger of the cities of Fort William, Port Arthur, and the geographic townships of Neebing and McIntyre. Its name was the result of a referendum held previously on 23 June 1969, to determine the new name of the amalgamated Fort William and Port Arthur. Officials debated over the names to be put on the ballot, taking suggestions from residents including &quot;Lakehead&quot; and &quot;The Lakehead&quot;. Because the vote split between the two similar names, &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; prevailed with a narrow plurality. The final tally was &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; with 15,870, &quot;Lakehead&quot; with 15,302, and &quot;The Lakehead&quot; with 8,377.

There was more controversy over the selection of a name for the amalgamated city than over whether to amalgamate. A vocal minority of the population preferred &quot;The Lakehead&quot;. There was much discussion about other cities in the world that use a definite article in their names. The area was often referred to as &quot;The Lakehead&quot; before and after amalgamation based on its geographic location. It was seen as the &quot;head&quot; of shipping on the Great Lakes and the &quot;rail head&quot;.

The expansion of highways, beginning with the Trans-Canada Highway and culminating with the opening of Highway 17 (linking Sault Ste Marie to Thunder Bay in 1960), has significantly diminished railway and shipping activity since the 1970s and 80s. Shipping on the Saint Lawrence Seaway was superseded by trucking on highways. Grain shipping on the Great Lakes to the East has declined substantially in favour of transport to Pacific Coast ports. As a result, many grain elevators have been closed and demolished. The Kaministiquia River was abandoned by industry and shipping.

===Today===
Thunder Bay has become the regional services centre for Northwestern Ontario with most provincial departments represented. Lakehead University, established through the lobbying of local businesspeople and professionals, has proven to be a major asset. Another post-secondary institution is Confederation College.

In the 2010s, the Marina Park was developed as a tourist destination.

==Geography==

The city has an area of , which includes the former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur, as well as the former townships of Neebing and McIntyre. The city reflects the settlement patterns of the 19th century and sprawls. Anchoring the west end of the city, the Fort William Town Plot, surveyed in 1859–60, was named West Fort William (or Westfort) in 1888 by the CPR. The land adjoining the lower Kaministiquia River became the residential and central business district of the town and city of Fort William. A large uninhabited area adjoining the Neebing and McIntyre rivers, which became known as Intercity, separated Fort William from the residential and central business district of Port Arthur. At the extreme east of the city, a part of McIntyre Township was annexed to the town of Port Arthur in 1892, forming what later became known as the Current River area.

The former Port Arthur section is more typical of the Canadian Shield, with gently sloping hills and very thin soil lying on top of bedrock with many bare outcrops. Thunder Bay, which gives the city its name, is about from the Port Arthur downtown to Thunder Cape at the tip of the Sleeping Giant. The former Fort William section occupies flat alluvial land along the Kaministiquia River. In the river delta are two large islands: Mission Island and McKellar Island. Since 1970, the central business districts of Fort William and Port Arthur have suffered a serious decline. Business and government relocated to new developments in the Intercity area. There has also been substantial residential growth in adjacent areas of the former Neebing and McIntyre townships.

===Neighbourhoods===

Thunder Bay is composed of two formerly separate cities: Port Arthur and Fort William. Both still retain much of their distinct civic identities, reinforced by the buffering effect of the Intercity area between them. Port Arthur and Fort William each have their own central business districts and suburban areas. Neighbourhoods include: Downtown Fort William and Current River among others.

===Climate===
The Thunder Bay area experiences a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) and a continental subarctic (&quot;Dfc&quot;) influence in northeastern areas of the city (including that affected by Lake Superior), but not necessarily falling in this zone. This results in cooler summer temperatures and warmer winter temperatures for an area extending inland as far as 16 km. The average daily temperatures range from in July to in January. The average daily high in July is and the average daily high in January is . On 10 January 1982, the local temperature in Thunder Bay dropped to , with a wind speed of per hour for a wind chill temperature that dipped to . As a result, it holds Ontario&#x27;s record for coldest day with wind chill. The highest temperature ever recorded in Thunder Bay was on 7 August 1983. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 31 January 1996.
Relatively recently, however, all-time records for both the latest first freeze and the longest growing season were set on October 17, 2021; the previous record of October 8, 2016, was beaten by 9 days, and the previous record for the longest growing season of 139 days (also set in 2016) was beaten by a day.

The city is quite sunny, with an average of 2,121 hours of bright sunshine each year, ranging from 268.1 hours in July to 86.2 hours in November. Winters are comparatively dry with the snowfall being somewhat limited and temperatures much colder than in Houghton, Michigan, on the U.S. side of the lake, where the climate is marked by heavy lake-effect snow. Thunder Bay has more of a continental climate in comparison.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Thunder Bay had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Thunder Bay CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the 2016 Census, 48.8% of Thunder Bay&#x27;s residents were male and 51.2% were female. Residents 19 years of age or younger accounted for approximately 19.9% of the population. People aged by 20 and 39 years accounted for 25.0%, while those between 40 and 64 made up 35.1% of the population. The average age of a Thunder Bayer in May 2016 was 43.3, compared to the average of 41.0 for Canada as a whole.

A further 13,712 people lived in Thunder Bay&#x27;s Census Metropolitan Area, which apart from Thunder Bay includes the municipalities of Neebing and Oliver Paipoonge, the townships of Conmee, Gillies, O&#x27;Connor and Shuniah, and the aboriginal community of Fort William First Nation.

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the census, Thunder Bay was home to 13,565 people of Finnish descent, the highest concentration of people of Finnish origin in Canada. Thunder Bay has a large Indigenous population, representing 14.1% of the population; visible minorities represent 7.5% of the population.
*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

=== Language ===
;Mother-tongue language (2016)
===Religion===
In the 2021 census, 56.0% of Thunder Bay residents belonged to a Christian denomination, down from 72.0% in 2011: 30.4% of the total population affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, 17.6% were Protestant, 4.9% were Christians of unspecified denomination and 3.2% followed other Christian denominations, largely Eastern Orthodox.

All other religions and/or spiritual beliefs made up 1.4% of the population.

===Crime===
From 2012 to 2014, and again from 2016 to 2019, Thunder Bay had the highest per-capita rate of homicide among Canadian cities. Winnipeg had previously held this distinction between 2007 and 2011. In 2014, the per-capita rate of homicides in Thunder Bay was more than double the 2012 rate, and was over 2.5 times higher than the city with the next highest rate, with the city having a homicide rate of 10.1 per 100,000 people. However, between 2014 and 2015, the crime rate decreased by 6%. This was the second-highest decrease in any major Canadian city, behind only Moncton, New Brunswick. In 2022, Thunder Bay set a new homicide record with 15, giving the city a homicide rate of 13.7 homicides per 100,000 people, a rate which was comparable to cities like Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, and Portland in the same year.

==Economy==
As the largest city in Northwestern Ontario, Thunder Bay is the region&#x27;s commercial, administrative and medical centre. Many of the city&#x27;s largest single employers are in the public sector. The City of Thunder Bay, the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre, the Lakehead District School Board and the Government of Ontario each employ over 1,500 people. Resolute Forest Products is the largest private employer, employing over 1,500 people.

Alstom operates a plant in Thunder Bay which manufactures mass transit vehicles and equipment, employing approximately 500 people. The plant was built by Canadian Car and Foundry to build railway box cars in 1912, began building passenger railcars and transit cars from 1963 onwards Alstom acquired the facility from Bombardier in 2021, which had acquired it from UTDC in 1992, and from Cancar in 1984.

Lack of innovation by traditional industries, such as forest products, combined with high labour costs have reduced the industrial base of Thunder Bay by close to 60%. The grain trade has declined because of the loss of grain transportation subsidies and the loss of European markets. The gradual transition from shipping by train and boat to shipping by truck, and the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement have ended Thunder Bay&#x27;s privileged position as a linchpin in Canadian east–west freight-handling trade. As a result, the city has lost its traditional as a break-bulk point. However, in recent years shipments through the port of Thunder Bay have stabilized, and it remains an important part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

To rejuvenate its economy, the city has been actively working to attract quaternary or &quot;knowledge-based&quot; industries, primarily in the fields of molecular medicine and genomics. The city is home to the western campus of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, the first medical school to open in Canada in a generation. The city also has a law school.

==Government and politics==
The city is governed by a mayor and twelve councillors. The mayor and five of the councillors are elected at large by the whole city. In addition, seven ward councillors are elected by their respective constituencies. The current mayor is Ken Boshcoff and the five councillors at large are: Mark Bentz, Shelby Ch’ng, Trevor Giertuga, Rajni Agarwal, and Kasey (Taylor) Etreni. 

Thunder Bay is represented in the Ontario Legislature by two provincial ridings, also split along the Harbour Expressway. North of the expressway, is Thunder Bay-Superior North, served by Lise Vaugeois of the Ontario New Democratic Party since 2018. On the south side of the city is Thunder Bay-Atikokan, served by Kevin Holland of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party since 2022.


Thunder Bay is represented in the Canadian Parliament with two federal ridings, split at the Harbour Expressway. South of the expressway, is the Thunder Bay-Rainy River riding, currently served by Marcus Powlowski since 2019. The north side of the city is in the Thunder Bay-Superior North riding, served by Patty Hajdu since 2015. Both incumbent member of parliament are members of the Liberal Party of Canada.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===City Wards===

Thunder Bay can be divided into seven wards, each of which has one councillor:


Currently, the city is studying a possibilities in reducing the size of city council from 13 to a smaller number. These changes, if successful, would be implemented from the 2026 Municipal election. In September 2024, two ideas were presented: 

* No wards: All wards will be abolished, eliminating the positions of all ward councillors effective the 2026 election. Five new councillor at large positions will be created for a grand total of 10 councillors at large. This system allows all members of city council to be elected by all citizens of Thunder Bay, regardless of where they live.
* 4 wards: There would be four wards instead of seven. These new wards would be designed by splitting the city along east-west corridors. Instead of names like current wards, they would have numbers 1-4, with 1 being the northernmost and 4 being the southernmost. Wards 1 and 2 would be split by Dawson Road, Red River Road, Junot Avenue, and River Street. Wards 2 and 3 would be split by Oliver Road while wards 3 and 4 would be split by Arthur Street. Each ward would have 2 councillors instead of 1, resulting in 8 ward councillors. The number of councillors at large would be reduced from 5 to 2, resulting in 10 city councillors.

===City symbols===
;Sleeping Giant
A large formation of mesas on the Sibley Peninsula in Lake Superior which resembles a reclining giant has become a symbol of the city. Sibley peninsula partially encloses the waters of Thunder Bay and dominates the view of the lake from the northern section of the city (formerly Port Arthur). The Sleeping Giant also figures on the city&#x27;s coat of arms and the city flag.

;Coat of arms
The coat of arms of Thunder Bay, Ontario, is a combination of the coats of arms of both Port Arthur and Fort William, with a unifying symbol—the Sleeping Giant—at the base of the arms.

;Corporate logo
The city logo depicts a stylized thunderbird, called Animikii, a statue of which is located at the city&#x27;s Kaministiquia River Heritage Park. The slogan, &quot;Superior by Nature&quot;, is a double play on words reflecting the city&#x27;s natural setting on Lake Superior.

;City flag
Thunder Bay&#x27;s flag was created in 1972 when mayor Saul Laskin wanted to promote the city by having a distinctive flag. The city held a contest, which Cliff Redden won. The flag has a 1:2 ratio and depicts a golden sky from the rising sun behind the Sleeping Giant, which sits in the blue waters of Lake Superior. The sun is represented by a red maple leaf, a symbol of Canada. Green and gold are Thunder Bay&#x27;s city colours.

<text>Amadeo Bordiga (13 June 1889 – 25 July 1970) was an Italian Marxist theorist. A revolutionary socialist, Bordiga was the founder of the Communist Party of Italy (PCdI), a member of the Communist International (Comintern), and later a leading figure of the Internationalist Communist Party (PCInt). He was originally associated with the PCdI but was expelled in 1930 after being accused of Trotskyism. Bordiga is viewed as one of the most notable representatives of left communism in Europe.

== Early life, family, and education ==
Bordiga was born at Resina in the province of Naples in 1889. His father, Oreste Bordiga, was an esteemed scholar of agricultural science, whose authority was especially recognized in regard to the centuries-old agricultural problems of Southern Italy. His mother, Zaira degli Amadei, was descended from an ancient Florentine family and his maternal grandfather Count Michele Amadei was a conspirator in the struggles of the Risorgimento. His paternal uncle, Giovanni Bordiga, another militant of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, was a mathematician and professor at the University of Padua.

Bordiga&#x27;s upbringing, while being thoroughly radical, was also of a highly scientific nature. An opponent of the Italo-Turkish War as an Italian colonial war in Libya, Bordiga was introduced to the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) by his high-school physics teacher in 1910. Bordiga eventually founded the Karl Marx Circle in 1912, where he would meet his first wife, Ortensia De Meo. Bordiga graduated with a degree in engineering from University of Naples Federico II in 1912. Bordiga married De Meo in 1914. They had two children, Alma and Oreste. Ortensia died in 1955, and Bordiga married Ortensia&#x27;s sister, Antonietta De Meo, ten years later in 1965.
== Political career ==
=== Italian Socialist Party ===
Within the newly founded Karl Marx Circle, Bordiga rejected a pedagogical approach to political work and developed a &quot;theory of the Party&quot;, whereby the organization was meant to display non-immediate goals as a rally of similarly minded people and not necessarily a body of the working class. Bordiga was deeply opposed to representative democracy, which he associated with bourgeois electoralism. In a 1914 issue of &quot;Il Socialista&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Thus if there is a complete negation of the theory of democratic action it is to be found in socialism.&quot; Bordiga opposed the parliamentary faction of the PSI being autonomous from central control. In common with most socialists in Latin countries, Bordiga campaigned against Freemasonry, which he identified as a non-secular group.

Following the October Revolution, Bordiga rallied to the communist movement and formed the communist abstentionist faction within the PSI, abstentionist in that it opposed participation in bourgeois elections. The group would form with the addition of the former &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot; grouping in Turin around Antonio Gramsci the backbone of the Communist Party of Italy (PCdI). This came after a long internal struggle in the PSI as it had voted as early as 1919 to affiliate with the Comintern but had refused to purge its reformist wing. In the course of the conflict, Bordiga attended the 2nd Comintern Congress in 1920, where he added two points to the Twenty-one Conditions of membership proposed by Vladimir Lenin. Nevertheless, he was criticised by Lenin in his work &quot;&quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot; (1920) over a disagreement regarding parliamentary abstentionism. Victor Serge, who witnessed the 2nd Comintern Congress, remembered Bordiga as &quot;exuberant and energetic, features blunt, hair thick, black and bristly, a man quivering under his encumbrance of ideas, experiences and dark forecasts.&quot;

=== Communist Party of Italy ===

When the PSI held its congress at Livorno in January 1921, representatives sent by Comintern, all insisted that the party must expel its reformist wing led by Filippo Turati but were divided over whether to continue to work with Giacinto Menotti Serrati, who advised delaying the split. Bordiga advocated an immediate break with both Serrati and Turati, and hence with the majority of the PSI, and prevailed against the opposition of the leading Comintern representative Paul Levi but also with the backing of others, including Matyas Rakosi, the future Stalinist dictator of Hungary.

After the congress, Bordiga emerged as leader of the newly formed Communist Party of Italy. He was one of five members of the executive but was &quot;the actual director of all party activity&quot;. For Bordiga, the party was the social brain of the proletariat whose task was not to seek majority support but to concentrate on working for an armed insurrection in the course of which it would seize power and then use it to abolish capitalism and impose a communist society by force. Bordiga identified with the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the party, and argued that establishing its own dictatorship should be the party&#x27;s immediate and direct aim. This position was accepted by the majority of the members of the PCdI but was to bring them into conflict with the Comintern when in 1921 the latter adopted a new tactic, i.e. that of the united front with reformist organisations to fight for social reforms and even to form a workers&#x27; government. Bordiga regarded this as a reversion to the failed tactics which the pre-war social democrats had adopted and which had led to them becoming reformists.

Out of a regard for discipline, Bordiga and his comrades (who became known as the Italian communist left) accepted the Comintern decision but were in an increasingly difficult position. When Bordiga was arrested in February 1923 on a trumped-up charge by the new government of Benito Mussolini, he had to give up his post as a member of the Central Committee of the PCdI. On his acquittal later that year, Bordiga decided not to reclaim it, therefore implicitly accepting that he was now an oppositionist.

At the Fifth Congress of Comintern in Moscow held in June–July 1924, Bordiga was the sole voice of the ultra-left who opposed any cooperation with socialist parties in favour of a &quot;united front from below, not from above&quot;, which received support except within the Italian delegation. He argued that the rise of Mussolini and the Italian fascists was only &quot;a change in the governing personnel of the bourgeois class.&quot; Also in 1924, the Italian communist left lost control of the PCdI to a pro-Moscow group whose leader Gramsci became the party&#x27;s General Secretary in June. In March 1925, Bordiga refused to go to Moscow to attend a plenum of Comintern&#x27;s executive, and in his absence was accused of taking up a &quot;hostile position against Comintern by declaring his complete solidarity with Trotsky&quot;.

At the Third Congress of the PCdI held in exile in Lyons in January 1926, the manoeuvre of the pro-Moscow group was completed. Without the support of the Communist International to escape from Fascist control, few members of the Italian communist left were able to arrive at the Congress, so the theses drawn up by Bordiga were rejected. Those of the Stalinist minority group accepted.

=== Under arrest ===
In December 1926, Bordiga was again arrested by Mussolini and sent to prison in Ustica, an Italian island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where he met with Gramsci and they renewed their friendship and worked alongside each other despite their political differences. Bordiga was concerned about Gramsci&#x27;s ill health but nothing came of a plan to help him escape the island. In 1928, Bordiga was moved to the Isle of Ponza, where he built several houses, returning after his detention in 1929 to finish them.

=== Opposition ===
Following his release, Bordiga did not resume his activities in the PCdI and was in fact expelled in March 1930, accused of having &quot;supported, defended and endorsed the positions of the Trotskyist opposition&quot; and been organisationally disruptive. With his expulsion, Bordiga left political activity until 1943 and he was to refuse to comment on political affairs even when asked by trusted friends; many of his former supporters in the PCdI went into exile and founded a political tendency often referred to as Italian communist left.

In 1928, its members in exile in France and Belgium formed themselves into the Left Fraction of the Communist Party of Italy, which became, in 1935, the Italian Fraction of the Communist Left. This change of name was a reflection of the Italian communist left&#x27;s view that the PCdI and the other Communist parties had now become counter-revolutionary. A faction of the party, with their theory of the party and their opposition to any form of frontism, held that the program was everything and a gate-receipt notion of numbers was nothing. Bordiga would again work with many of these comrades following the end of World War II.

According to the reports of Angelo Alliotta, a secret informant of the fascist police in Italy who visited Bordiga&#x27;s home in Formia where he holidayed with his wife, Bordiga showed support for the Axis powers. According to Alliotta, Bordiga believed Nazi Germany was weakening the &quot;English giant&quot;, which to him was &quot;the greatest exponent of capitalism&quot;, and thus the defeat of Britain would bring about revolutionary conditions in Europe. Bordiga also criticised Joseph Stalin for allying with the western Allies against the Axis in April 1943. Other sources cast doubt on the analysis that Bordiga supported Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy, citing ‘contradictory’ testimony on the issue. He supported the ‘proletarian’ partisan movements, as well as the anti-fascist Warsaw uprisings of 1943 (Warsaw ghetto) and 1944.

=== International Communist Party ===
After 1944, Bordiga first returned to political activity in the Naples-based Fraction of Socialists and Communists. When this grouping was dissolved into the Internationalist Communist Party (PCInt), Bordiga did not initially join; despite this, he contributed anonymously to its press, primarily &quot;Battaglia Comunista&quot; and &quot;Prometeo&quot;, in keeping with his conviction that revolutionary work was collective in nature and his opposition to any form of even incipient personality cult. Bordiga joined the PCInt in 1949. When the current split in two in 1951, he took the side of the grouping that took on the name International Communist Party, publishing its &quot;Il Programma Comunista&quot;. Bordiga devoted himself to the party, contributing extensively. Bordiga remained with the ICP until his death at Formia in 1970.

== Theories and beliefs ==
Bordigism is a variant of left communism espoused by Bordiga. Bordigists in the Italian Socialist Party would be the first to refuse on principle any participation in parliamentary elections.

=== On Marxism–Leninism ===
On the theoretical level, Bordiga developed an understanding of the Soviet Union as a capitalist society. Bordiga&#x27;s writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists also focused on the agrarian sector. In analyzing the agriculture in the Soviet Union, Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the kolkhoz and sovkhoz, one a cooperative farm and the other a wage-labor state farm. In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Imperial Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.

In Bordiga&#x27;s conception of Marxism–Leninism, Joseph Stalin, and later Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and so on, were great Romantic revolutionaries, i.e. bourgeois revolutionaries. He felt that the Marxist–Leninist states that came into existence after 1945 were extending the bourgeois nature of prior revolutions that degenerated as all had in common a policy of expropriation and agrarian and productive development, which he considered negations of previous conditions and not the genuine construction of socialism.

=== On democracy ===
Bordiga defined himself as anti-democratic, believing himself to be following the tradition of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Bordiga&#x27;s hostility toward democracy was unrelated to the Stalinist narrative of the single-party state, as he saw fascism and Stalinism as the culmination of bourgeois democracy. Followers of Bordiga often state that there is no functional difference between democracy and dictatorship, as one class will inevitably establish control. To Bordiga, democracy meant above all the manipulation of society as a formless mass. To this, he counterposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, to be implemented by the Communist party based on the principles and program enunciated in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; (1848). He often referred to the spirit of Engels&#x27; remark that &quot;on the eve of the revolution all the forces of reaction will be against us under the banner of &#x27;pure democracy&#x27;&quot; as every factional opponent of the Bolsheviks in 1921 from the monarchists (the White movement) to the anarchists, such as the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine, called for soviets without Bolsheviks—or soviet workers councils not dominated by Bolsheviks. As such, Bordiga opposed the idea of revolutionary theory being the product of a democratic process of pluralist views, believing that the Marxist perspective has the merit of underscoring the fact that, like all social formations, communism is above all about the expression of programmatic content. This enforces the fact that, for Marxists, communism is not an ideal to be achieved but a real movement born from the old society with a set of programmatic tasks.

=== On the united front ===

Bordiga resolutely opposed the Comintern&#x27;s turn to the right in 1921. As leader of the Communist Party of Italy, he refused to implement the united front strategy of the Third Congress. He also refused to fuse the newly formed party with the left-wing of the Italian Socialist Party from which it had just broken away. Bordiga had a completely different view of the party from the Comintern, which was adapting to the revolutionary ebb that was announced in 1921 by the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement, the Kronstadt rebellion, the implementation of the New Economic Policy, the banning of factions, and the defeat of the March Action in Germany. For Bordiga, the Western European Communist parties&#x27; strategy of fighting this ebb by absorbing a mass of left-wing social democrats through the united front was a complete capitulation to the period of counter-revolutionary ebb he saw setting in. This was the base of his critique of democracy, for it was in the name of conquering the masses that the Comintern seemed to be making all kinds of programmatic concessions to left-wing social democrats. For Bordiga, program was everything, a gate-receipt notion of numbers was nothing. The role of the party in the period of ebb was to preserve the program and to carry on the propaganda work possible until the next turn of the tide, not to dilute it while chasing ephemeral popularity.

Bordiga&#x27;s analysis provided a way of seeing a fundamental degeneration in the world communist movement in 1921 (instead of in 1927 with the defeat of Trotsky) without simply calling for more democracy. The abstract formal perspective of bureaucracy/democracy, with which the Trotskyist tradition treats this crucial period in Comintern history, became separated from any content. Bordiga throughout his life called himself a Leninist and never polemicised against Lenin directly; his totally different appreciation of the 1921 conjuncture, its consequences for the Comintern and his opposition to Lenin and Trotsky on the united front issue illuminates a turning point that is generally obscured by the heirs of the Trotskyist wing of the international left opposition of the 1920s.

=== On communism ===

Although most Leninists distinguish between socialism and communism and he did consider himself a Leninist, Bordiga did not distinguish between the two in the same way Leninists do. Bordiga did not see socialism as a separate mode of production from communism but rather just as how communism looks as it emerges from capitalism before it has &quot;developed on its own foundations&quot;. Bordiga used &quot;socialism&quot; to mean what Marx called the lower-phase communism. Sticking to Marx&#x27;s concept of communism, for Bordiga both stages of socialist or communist society—with stages referring to historical materialism—were characterised by the absence of money, capital, the market, and so on, the difference between them being that earlier in the first stage rationing would be done in a way in which &quot;a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form&quot;, with deductions being made from said labor to fund public projects, and difference in interests between the rural and urban proletariat would exist, whilst in communism &quot;bourgeoisie law&quot; would be no more, hence the equal standard applied to all peoples no longer would apply, and the alienated man &quot;will not aim to win back his person&quot; but rather become a new &quot;Social Man&quot;. Arguing against what Bordiga saw as the bourgeois idea of &quot;free producer economies&quot;, he instead declared that under communism, whether it be the lower stage or higher stage, production and consumption are both enslaved to society.

This view distinguished Bordiga from other Leninists and especially the Trotskyists, who tended and still tend to telescope the first two stages and so have money and the other exchange categories surviving into socialism; Bordiga would have none of this. For him, no society in which money, buying, and selling and the rest survived could be regarded as either socialist or communist—these exchange categories would die out before the socialist rather than the communist stage was reached. Within the Marxist movement, &quot;socialism&quot; was popularised during the Russian Revolution by Lenin. This view is consistent with and helped to inform early concepts of socialism in which the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Monetary relations in the form of exchange-value, profit, interest, and wage labour would not operate and apply to Marxist socialism.

== Legacy ==

Jacques Camatte began corresponding with Bordiga from the age of 19 in 1954, and Bordiga developed a long-standing relationship with Camatte and ideological influence over him. Camatte&#x27;s early work very much reads in line with the Bordigist current, and Bordiga frequently contributed to Camatte&#x27;s journal &quot;Invariance&quot; near the end of his life. Even after Camatte&#x27;s break with Marxism following Bordiga&#x27;s death, Camatte&#x27;s preoccupation within the subject of &quot;Gemeinwesen&quot; (community, commonwealth) within Marx&#x27;s work is consistent with Bordiga&#x27;s emphasis on the anti-individualist and collectivist aspects of Marxism. Bordiga also influenced Gilles Dauvé, and had great influence over the ultra-leftist currents of the 20th and 21st centuries.

The Amadeo Bordiga Foundation was established in 1998 in Formia, in the house where Bordiga spent the last several months of his life. The foundation organizes publications of Bordiga&#x27;s works and encourages further expansions upon his ideas. In August 2020, &quot;Historical Materialism&quot; published &quot;The Science and Passion of Communism&quot;, an anthology of English translations of Bordiga&#x27;s work.
