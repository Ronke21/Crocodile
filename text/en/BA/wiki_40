<text>Darrell Lance Abbott (August 20, 1966 – December 8, 2004), best known by his stage name Dimebag Darrell, was an American musician. He was the guitarist of the heavy metal bands Pantera and Damageplan, both of which he co-founded alongside his brother Vinnie Paul. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest metal guitarists of all time.

A son of country music producer Jerry Abbott, Abbott began playing guitar at age 12, and Pantera released its debut album, &quot;Metal Magic&quot; (1983), when he was 16. Originally a glam metal musician, Abbott went by the stage name Diamond Darrell at the time. Two further albums in the glam metal style followed with &quot;Projects in the Jungle&quot; (1984) and &quot;I Am the Night&quot; (1985), before original vocalist Terry Glaze was replaced by Phil Anselmo in 1986 and &quot;Power Metal&quot; (1988) was released. The band&#x27;s major-label debut, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; (1990), introduced a groove metal sound to which Abbott&#x27;s guitar playing was central. This sound was refined on &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; (1992), and the group&#x27;s third major-label record, &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; in 1994.

Tensions within Pantera reduced its output after the release of &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; in 1996, and &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; (2000) was the band&#x27;s final studio album before its acrimonious separation in 2003. Abbott subsequently formed Damageplan with his brother Vinnie Paul and released &quot;New Found Power&quot;, the band&#x27;s only album, in 2004. Other works by Abbott included a collaboration with David Allan Coe titled &quot;Rebel Meets Rebel&quot; (2006) and numerous guest guitar solos for bands such as Anthrax. While on tour with Damageplan, Abbott was shot and killed by a fan during a performance at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio on December 8, 2004. Three others were shot and killed before the perpetrator was killed by a police officer.

Abbott was ranked at No. 92 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2011, and No. 19 on &quot;Louder&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2018. He placed at No. 5 on Gibson&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2015, and the same year was ranked as the most influential metal guitarist of the past 25 years by VH1.

==Early life==

Darrell Lance Abbott was born in Grand Prairie, Texas, on August 20, 1966, the second son to Carolyn and Jerry Abbott, a country music producer. He had an older brother, Vincent Paul Abbott, born 1964. Abbott&#x27;s parents divorced in 1979, after seventeen years of marriage, but his family life remained happy. The brothers lived with their mother Carolyn, in a ranch-style house on Monterrey Street in Arlington. Carolyn was supportive of her sons&#x27; musical endeavors. Their father Jerry remained in the area after the divorce and Darrell would often go on a bicycle to visit him for guitar lessons &quot;pretty darned regular&quot;.

Abbott took up the guitar when he was 12 years old. His first guitar was a Les Paul-style Hondo, which he received along with a Pignose amplifier on his twelfth birthday. Influenced by Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Kiss and Van Halen, he would initially spend time in his room standing in front of a mirror holding the guitar while wearing Ace Frehley-style makeup, though he was unable to play the instrument at the time. Jerry learned Kiss songs on guitar in order to teach Darrell how to play them. Darrell also learned from country musicians who recorded at Jerry&#x27;s studio, such as Bugs Henderson.

Vinnie had begun playing the drums before Darrell received his first guitar. Darrell had previously tried to play the drums; Vinnie later said: &quot;I just got better than him and wouldn&#x27;t let him play them anymore.&quot; The Abbott brothers&#x27; first jam session consisted of six hours of &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. They took inspiration from Alex and Eddie Van Halen, and Vinnie said in a 2016 interview that he and Darrell were &quot;inseparable&quot; after they began playing music together.

At age 14, Abbott entered a guitar contest at the Agora Ballroom in Dallas, in which Dean Zelinsky, founder of Dean Guitars, was one of the judges. Abbott&#x27;s mother accompanied him to the club because he was not old enough to enter on his own. He won the competition; Zelinsky recalled that &quot;[Abbott] blew everyone away.&quot; Abbott won many other guitar contests in the area, and was eventually asked not to compete and instead judge the competitions so others could win.

==Career==
===Pantera===
====Early glam metal years====
Pantera was formed in 1981. Vinnie was asked to join a band alongside his high school classmates Terry Glaze (guitar), Tommy Bradford (bass) and Donny Hart (vocals). Vinnie accepted the invitation, but on the condition that Darrell would also join the band. Glaze later recalled that they were unsure about this request, as Darrell &quot;wasn&#x27;t very good&quot; and, two years their junior, &quot;was a little skinny, scrawny dude&quot;, but they ultimately agreed. In 1989, Darrell made the same request when Dave Mustaine asked him to join Megadeth. As Mustaine had already recruited drummer Nick Menza and would not hire Vinnie, Darrell decided to stay with Pantera.

By 1982, Hart left the band and was replaced by Glaze on vocals, while Rex Brown took Bradford&#x27;s place as bassist. Abbott originally shared lead guitar with Glaze, but soon took permanent status as lead guitarist. Glaze said: &quot;[Abbott] just morphed over a six-month period. ... When he came out, he could play, like, &#x27;Eruption&#x27; and &#x27;Crazy Train. Abbott adopted the stage name &quot;Diamond Darrell&quot;, in reference to the Kiss song &quot;Black Diamond&quot;.

Inspired by Kiss, Van Halen and Judas Priest, Pantera originally had a glam metal style and was image-conscious: the members wore spandex, makeup and hairspray when on stage. The band signed to Metal Magic Records, which was created by &quot;Jerry Eld&#x27;n&quot;, an alias of Abbott&#x27;s father Jerry. Jerry also served as the band&#x27;s manager and producer during this time. Pantera released its first album, &quot;Metal Magic&quot;, in 1983, when Abbott was 16. A review in the November 1983 issue of Texas-based music magazine &quot;Buddy&quot; said Abbott&#x27;s solos &quot;tend to be asymmetrical in that the old theory of musical thought consisting of statements alternating with appropriate responses is ignored and replaced by authoritative delivery of the player&#x27;s own concept of what should happen&quot;.

Pantera released &quot;Projects in the Jungle&quot; and &quot;I Am the Night&quot; in 1984 and 1985, respectively. Both albums followed on in the glam metal style, and were comparable to &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;-era Mötley Crüe, although &quot;I Am the Night&quot; had a slightly heavier sound than previous releases. Around this time, the Abbott brothers began listening to bands such as Metallica and Slayer. Darrell was particularly taken by Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; (1984). Glaze was unhappy with the Abbott brothers&#x27; desire to move towards a heavier sound; he later said he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to go that heavy. I didn&#x27;t like it as well if the guitar was the main thing, like the Metallica songs.&quot; This conflict, along with a contractual dispute, led to his departure in 1986.

Pantera tried several replacement vocalists unsuccessfully during 1986 before discovering Phil Anselmo late that year. This new lineup briefly signed with Gold Mountain Records, but released &quot;Power Metal&quot; (1988) on Metal Magic. Abbott said Gold Mountain &quot;wanted to change our style and make us sound like Bon Jovi, which is not quite up our alley&quot;. Anselmo did not write any of the lyrics for &quot;Power Metal&quot;, and the band was still in the process of distancing themselves from glam metal, but the album evidenced a stylistic change. A retrospective AllMusic album review by Bradley Torreano said Abbott&#x27;s &quot;speedy riffs&quot; were one of the &quot;more charming elements&quot; of the band&#x27;s sound. Brown said in a 1988 interview that &quot;Darrell has always been chunking those riffs out from the start. But now with Phil in the band we&#x27;ve got a chance to make those riffs fully happen instead of having some gay singer over the top of them!&quot;

====Development of groove metal====
After the release of &quot;Power Metal&quot;, Pantera formed a relationship with Walter O&#x27;Brien and Andy Gould of Concrete Management. As Concrete managed other bands that were signed to Metal Blade Records, Gould contacted Brian Slagel of Metal Blade and asked him to sign Pantera. The $75,000 () requested for the production of a new album was too much for Slagel, who rejected the offer. The Metal Blade rejection was one of many rejections for the band. Pantera eventually attained a major-label deal with Atco Records, after Atco&#x27;s talent scout Mark Ross was impressed by one of the band&#x27;s live performances.

&quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; was released on July 24, 1990. The album was produced by Terry Date; Max Norman was the original choice for producer but he opted to produce Lynch Mob&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Sensation&quot; instead. Date – who was hired to produce &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; on the strength of his work with Soundgarden, Metal Church and Overkill – also served as producer for Pantera&#x27;s next three albums. &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; marked the development of what would become Pantera&#x27;s familiar sound, to which Abbott&#x27;s guitar playing was central. Self-described as &quot;power groove&quot;, the album became a &quot;blueprint-defining&quot; work for groove metal, a sub-genre with the heaviness and intensity of thrash metal but played at a slower tempo. Southern rock elements were incorporated into the sound; Pantera&#x27;s &quot;groove&quot; is commonly attributed to the Abbott brothers&#x27; fondness for ZZ Top. &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; was certified gold in 1993, and platinum in 1997.

Pantera played close to 200 shows supporting &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, as it toured for nearly two years. Aside from breaks to develop new material, the band spent most of the 1990s touring; Abbott gained a reputation as a wild figure on tour and a heavy drinker. Pantera recorded its second major-label album in the space of two months. Released on February 25, 1992, &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; was a refinement of the groove metal sound. The band had sought to create a heavier album than &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, as Anselmo fully embraced a hardcore-inspired shouted vocal delivery. Abbott composed most of the riffs and song structures, and further attempted to mesh his guitar with Brown&#x27;s bass to create what Brown later described as &quot;one giant tone&quot;. &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; debuted at No. 44 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, and it stayed on the chart for 79 weeks. In 2017, it was ranked at No. 10 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, with Abbott&#x27;s &quot;serrated rhythms and squealing solos&quot; highlighted.

Abbott had transformed his appearance by the time of &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;″s release to that which he would maintain for the rest of his life. He sported a dyed goatee, a razorblade pendant (in homage to Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;British Steel&quot;), cargo shorts and sleeveless shirts. Feeling that &quot;Diamond Darrell&quot; no longer suited his image or sound, Abbott adopted the stage name &quot;Dimebag Darrell&quot; instead. The name was originally coined by Anselmo. It was in reference to Abbott&#x27;s refusal to accept more than a dime bag (slang for $10 worth) of cannabis at one time—even if offered for free—as he did not want to be caught with the drug on-hand.

All of Pantera&#x27;s albums until 1994 were recorded at Pantego Sound, the studio owned by the Abbott brothers&#x27; father Jerry. It was conveniently located a short distance from the Abbotts&#x27; home. After &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; was released, Jerry closed Pantego Sound and opened a new studio, Abtrax, in Nashville, Tennessee, as he hoped to fulfill his dream of becoming a country songwriter. Pantera&#x27;s third major-label album, &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, was recorded at Abtrax. Abbott said in a 1994 &quot;Guitar Player&quot; interview: &quot;We were fuckin&#x27; flying [to Nashville] for three weeks at a time, writing songs and cutting them.&quot; This led to the members spending most of their downtime in each other&#x27;s hotel rooms consuming drugs, rather than following their normal routines as they did when recording at Pantego Sound. They mixed the album at Dallas Sound Labs, which was close to their homes. &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; was released on March 15, 1994, on EastWest Records. It sold 186,000 copies in its first week to debut at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, and has since been described as the heaviest album ever to debut at No. 1.

Before the release, the band was expected to follow the lead of Metallica&#x27;s eponymous album by taking a more commercially-friendly approach. Instead, Pantera wanted an even heavier work than &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;. Abbott said in 1994: &quot;We&#x27;re into topping ourselves. Most bands come out with a heavy record, then it gets lighter and lighter. You&#x27;re stuck listening to the first record, wishing and dreaming. That ain&#x27;t what we&#x27;re about.&quot;

====Band tensions and separation====
The lead single from &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Broken&quot;, was inspired by Anselmo&#x27;s chronic back pain. To treat the pain during the tour supporting &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, Anselmo began heavily consuming alcohol, painkillers and ultimately heroin. He would travel on his own tour bus and isolate himself from the other band members until twenty or thirty minutes before they were due to perform. Anselmo recalled in a 2014 interview that he would drink &quot;an entire bottle of Wild Turkey every night before a show to numb the pain&quot;, and he often interrupted the performances by ranting on stage. Due to the tensions within the band, recordings for Pantera&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;, were held separately: Darrell, Vinnie and Brown recorded at Chasin&#x27; Jason Studio (a studio Darrell had constructed in a barn in his backyard) while Anselmo recorded the vocals at Trent Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Studios in New Orleans. Abbott experimented with new guitars during the recording; he stated in 1996 that he wrote &quot;Suicide Note Pt. 1&quot; the first time he used a twelve-string guitar which Washburn Guitars had sent to him. The recording also saw Abbott draw on riffs he had composed much earlier: he wrote the outro-solo to &quot;Floods&quot; in the pre-Anselmo era, and he had previously recorded a 90-minute loop of it as a lullaby for his girlfriend.

On May 7, 1996, &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; was released. It peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, staying on the chart for 13 weeks. It is considered to be Pantera&#x27;s most extreme work, and features some of the band&#x27;s lowest-tuned tracks. On July 13, Anselmo overdosed on heroin following the band&#x27;s performance at the Dallas Starplex Amphitheatre and was clinically dead for &quot;four to five minutes&quot;. He recovered quickly and performed at the band&#x27;s next show in San Antonio two days afterward, but the incident created a lasting rift within the band. Anselmo had released &quot;NOLA&quot;, the debut album of one of his side projects Down, in 1995, and supported the album with a 13-show tour. The other Pantera members were originally unperturbed by Anselmo&#x27;s side projects; Abbott explained at the time: &quot;Phil&#x27;s a musical guy and he likes to stay busy.&quot;

The touring for &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; widened the rift within the band, and the recording sessions for their next album, &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot;, were troublesome. Vinnie said in an interview after the album&#x27;s release: &quot;It was like pulling teeth to get [Anselmo] down to the studio. He didn&#x27;t like any of the material, and it was always just like this head-butting contest.&quot; Also during the recording, the Abbotts&#x27; mother, Carolyn, was diagnosed with lung cancer, and died six weeks later on September 12, 1999. This had a profound effect on the brothers, especially Darrell. &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; was released on March 21, 2000. Abbott said of it: &quot;We still play lead guitar ... Bands hardly ever play lead guitar anymore. Dude, back in the seventies, if you couldn&#x27;t play the guitar or sing, you were nobody. Now music is so easy—all you&#x27;ve got to do is tune your guitar to an open chord and jump around.&quot; Like &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;, &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;.

Pantera were in Ireland, set to begin a European tour, on September 11, 2001. Due to the September 11 attacks, the tour was canceled and the members returned to Texas, where they agreed to take a short hiatus. In March 2002, Down released its second record, &quot;Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&quot;, which featured Brown on bass. Two months later, Superjoint Ritual—another of Anselmo&#x27;s bands—released its debut album, &quot;Use Once and Destroy&quot;. The Abbotts believed that Pantera would regroup in 2003, after the tours supporting &quot;Down II&quot; and &quot;Use Once and Destroy&quot; were concluded. Instead, Anselmo recorded a second album with Superjoint Ritual, &quot;A Lethal Dose of American Hatred&quot; (2003). Also around this time, Darrell received a phone call from Brown, who indicated that he would not return to Pantera. The separation of Pantera was marked by the release of a greatest hits album, &quot;The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys&#x27; Vulgar Hits!&quot;, on September 23, 2003.

===Damageplan===
Abbott was dejected by the separation of Pantera; he felt that all he had worked for had been &quot;ripped out from under [him]&quot;. As continuing Pantera without Anselmo likely would have resulted in a lengthy and expensive legal battle regarding the ownership of the &quot;Pantera&quot; brand, the Abbott brothers decided to form a new band. They recorded demos at Darrell&#x27;s backyard studio in February 2003. Patrick Lachman of Halford joined as vocalist and Bob Kakaha was recruited on bass, and the band signed with Elektra Records later in 2003. The name of the band originally was New Found Power, but they later decided on Damageplan. &quot;New Found Power&quot; instead served as the title of the group&#x27;s debut album, which was released on February 10, 2004. It did not near the commercial success of Pantera&#x27;s major-label releases: it sold 44,000 copies in its first week to debut at No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and had sold a modest 160,000 copies by December.

Damageplan spent most of 2004 on its Devastation Across the Nation tour. To rebuild a fanbase, the band toured nightclubs across the country. The members had planned to record a follow-up album, which did not materialize due to Abbott&#x27;s murder at a show in Columbus, Ohio, on December 8, 2004.

===Other projects===
The Abbott brothers listened to country singer David Allan Coe while growing up as their parents were fans of the performer, and often used Coe&#x27;s &quot;Jack Daniels If You Please&quot; as introductory music for Pantera shows. Darrell first met Coe in 1999, at one of his performances at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas. After the performance, Darrell waited in an autograph line to introduce himself and give Coe his phone number. They subsequently formed a friendship and Coe began spending time at Darrell&#x27;s house, where the Abbott brothers and Coe played music in Darrell&#x27;s backyard studio. They recruited Brown to play bass and the group sporadically recorded from 1999 to 2003. The resulting album, &quot;Rebel Meets Rebel&quot;, was released on May 2, 2006, on Vinnie&#x27;s Big Vin Records. Megan Frye of AllMusic stated &quot;Rebel Meets Rebel&quot; is &quot;groundbreaking in that it will please fans of both country and metal because the music is simultaneously both styles – it&#x27;s never a fusion, they simply exist together&quot;.

In 1992, Abbott and the other Pantera members collaborated with Rob Halford on a track titled &quot;Light Comes Out of Black&quot;, which was released on the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; soundtrack. Abbott recorded the song &quot;Caged in a Rage&quot;, on which he performed lead vocals and guitar, under his own name. It was included on the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;Supercop&quot;. Adam Greenberg of AllMusic said Abbott sounded &quot;oddly similar to Rob Zombie&quot; on &quot;Caged in a Rage&quot;.

Abbott provided guest guitar solos for Anthrax on several occasions: &quot;King Size&quot; and &quot;Riding Shotgun&quot; from &quot;Stomp 442&quot; (1995), &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Born Again Idiot&quot; from &quot;Volume 8: The Threat Is Real&quot; (1998), and &quot;Strap It On&quot; and &quot;Cadillac Rock Box&quot; from &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; (2003). Anthrax&#x27;s Scott Ian referred to Abbott as the &quot;sixth member&quot; of the band due to his frequent appearances. Abbott also performed a guest solo on the title track of King Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo&quot; (1998) and on &quot;Eyes of the South&quot; (2004) by Premenishen, a band that featured Abbott&#x27;s cousins Heather Manly and April Adkisson on bass and guitar, respectively. After Darrell&#x27;s death, Vinnie granted Nickelback permission to use outtakes of Darrell&#x27;s solos from the &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; recordings on its tribute track &quot;Side of a Bullet&quot;. Darrell was a friend of Nickelback&#x27;s Chad Kroeger and had provided a solo for Nickelback&#x27;s cover of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot; on the soundtrack to the 2003 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;.

Darrell and Vinnie performed shows as Gasoline each New Year&#x27;s Eve. Gasoline predominantly played covers of artists such as Ted Nugent and Pat Travers, but also composed original songs such as &quot;Get Drunk Now&quot; and &quot;This Ain&#x27;t a Beer Belly, It&#x27;s a Gas Tank for My Love Machine&quot;. Gasoline once served as a support act for Drowning Pool. In 2006, &quot;Country Western Transvestite Whore&quot;, a song that Abbott recorded with local Dallas musician Throbbin&#x27; Donnie Rodd, was released. It features Abbott on lead guitar and vocals. Other works by Abbott that have been posthumously released include &quot;Dime&#x27;s Blackout Society&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Hitz&quot; (2017), a five-track EP.

==Murder and aftermath==
On December 8, 2004, Damageplan was performing at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. Nathan Gale, a deranged fan, rushed onto the stage as the band played the first song of its setlist and shot Abbott multiple times with a Beretta 92FS, a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The band&#x27;s head of security, Jeffrey &quot;Mayhem&quot; Thompson, then tackled Gale, but was fatally shot in the ensuing struggle. A fan, Nathan Bray, was also killed as he attempted to aid Abbott and Thompson, as was Erin Halk, an employee of the venue who tried to disarm Gale while he was reloading. Three others were wounded before Columbus police officer James Niggemeyer entered the club and shot Gale once in the head with a 12-gauge Remington Model 870, killing him.

Abbott was pronounced dead at the scene, aged 38. Thousands of fans attended his public memorial, and the guest list included artists such as Eddie Van Halen, Zakk Wylde, Corey Taylor, Jerry Cantrell and Dino Cazares. Abbott was buried alongside his mother Carolyn at the Moore Memorial Gardens cemetery in Arlington, Texas. Gene Simmons donated a Kiss Kasket for the burial, and Eddie Van Halen donated his original black-and-yellow-striped 1979 Charvel &quot;Bumblebee&quot; guitar, which was featured on the back cover of &quot;Van Halen II&quot;, to be included in the casket. A few weeks prior to his death, Abbott had met Van Halen and asked him for a replica of the Bumblebee. Van Halen said at the funeral: &quot;Dime was an original and only an original deserves the original.&quot;

After Vinnie Paul&#x27;s death in 2018, he was buried next to Carolyn and Darrell, also in a Kiss Kasket. In late 2020, a protective fence was installed around the Abbott burial ground in an effort to stop vandalism, as Darrell&#x27;s grave had previously been scratched and defaced by people over the years. In a 2010 interview, Vinnie called the vandalism &quot;a real disrespectful thing&quot;. The Alrosa Villa was later demolished in 2021.

==Musical style==
Originally a glam metal musician, Abbott distanced himself from the subgenre by the late 1980s, and was a driving force behind the development of groove metal in the 1990s.

===Influences===
Although his father was a country music producer and songwriter, Abbott&#x27;s primary musical influences were heavy metal acts such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Kiss and Van Halen. Ace Frehley of Kiss inspired him to play guitar. He was a member of the Kiss Army and had a portrait of Frehley tattooed on his chest in 1992. While at a photoshoot for the August 1993 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; along with Frehley, Abbott asked Frehley to sign an autograph near the tattoo. Abbott then had the signature tattooed.

No musician other than Frehley exerted more of an influence on Abbott than Eddie Van Halen. Abbott stated that his background mirrored Van Halen&#x27;s as both he and Van Halen were younger brothers who first played drums before moving on to the guitar due to competition from their elder brothers on drums. Another influence was Randy Rhoads. Abbott said in 1994: &quot;To me, Eddie Van Halen was heavy rock and roll, but Randy was heavy metal.&quot; He discovered double tracking leads through Rhoads. In numerous interviews, Abbott credited Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath for inspiring his guitar riffs. Abbott also said Def Leppard&#x27;s original guitarist Pete Willis &quot;was a great player. I was inspired by him because I was a small young dude and he was a small young dude, too—and he was out there kickin&#x27; ass. He made me want to get out there and play.&quot;

Abbott was a fan of the Southern rock band ZZ Top, and he was influenced by the band&#x27;s guitarist and lead singer Billy Gibbons. He said in 1993: &quot;I&#x27;m not a super blues player, but I was exposed to the Texas blues sound while I was growing up, and that definitely rubbed off on me.&quot; Abbott was also influenced by contemporary metal guitarists such as Kerry King of Slayer, James Hetfield of Metallica, and Zakk Wylde of Ozzy Osbourne and Black Label Society.

===Technique===

Abbott did not receive formal guitar lessons. He stated in a 1994 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview that he once received &quot;a guitar lesson off this cat. He wrote down some weird scale and tried to explain how it worked. After we finished he said, &#x27;Now go on home, practice that scale, and show me how well you can play it next week.&#x27; So I took it home, played around with it for a few minutes and said, &#x27;Fuck this, I just want to jam.&#x27; I respect people that can read tablature and all that shit, but I just don&#x27;t even have the patience to read the newspaper.&quot;

Unlike many other heavy metal guitarists, Abbott made extensive use of the major third in his riffs and leads, which added dissonance to minor key tonalities. This was a Van Halen-inspired technique, as was his employment of symmetrical fingerings. Although Abbott had exceptional picking ability, he favored legato phrasing. His love of legato gave his playing a fluid quality, and his powerful left-hand technique enabled the implementation of the symmetrical patterns in his lead licks. Abbott avoided using scales and modes in traditional fashions, and often used passing tones between scalar tones to add tension. These chromatic licks made up much of his playing. Regardless of the note or chord, Abbott played with a &quot;Texas style&quot;, meaning a variety of techniques such as sliding, bending, palm muting, and use of the whammy bar and effects pedal to produce an idiosyncratic
sound.

One of the most distinctive features of Abbott&#x27;s guitar playing was his use of harmonics to create a squealing sound, which he picked up from Gibbons. Unsatisfied with standard techniques, Abbott often used dyads in place of traditional power chords. This added texture to his riffs and, when played with distortion, created a tense sound. Abbott experimented with alternate tunings throughout his career. Early on, his guitar was tuned down more than a quarter step, similar to &quot;Van Halen I&quot; and &quot;Van Halen II&quot; tuning. On &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot; (1990), he utilized drop D tuning, and beginning with &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; (1992) he tuned his guitar down a whole step, which became his main tuning by the release of &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; (2000). He also used drop D down one step, down 1 ½ steps and drop D down 1 ½ steps tunings. Down 1 ½ steps tuning was prevalent on &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; (1996) and was Abbott&#x27;s main tuning on &quot;New Found Power&quot; (2004).

Three of Abbott&#x27;s solos were ranked in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time&quot;: &quot;Walk&quot; at No. 57; &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; at No. 35; and &quot;Floods&quot; at No. 19. Despite his virtuosity, Abbott said that while &quot;jerking off all over the neck&quot;, as he described, was suited to competing in guitar contests, it often did not benefit a song&#x27;s composition. &quot;Slaughtered&quot; from &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; originally had a slow, melodic solo, but Abbott removed it after noting that it disrupted the song&#x27;s momentum.

==Equipment==

Dimebag&#x27;s first guitar was a Hohner HG-430LP-S Les Paul, and for his junior high school talent show he removed the neck pickup and inserted a smoke bomb so he could make the guitar smoke like his biggest musical influence Ace Frehley. In 1982, Abbott won a maroon Dean ML at a guitar contest in Dallas. Unbeknownst to Abbott, his father had bought him a sunburst ML shortly before the contest. Nearing driving age and seeking to purchase a Pontiac Firebird, Abbott attempted to sell the maroon ML to his friend Buddy Blaze, a luthier and musician. Blaze felt that a guitar won as a prize should stay with its owner and refused to buy it. Abbott instead sold the guitar to one of Blaze&#x27;s bandmates. Blaze negotiated with his bandmate, and took possession of the ML in exchange for a Kramer Pacer. Blaze then replaced the standard ML hardware: he installed a custom Floyd Rose vibrato bridge and Bill Lawrence L-500XL pickups, and moved the stock DiMarzio pickup to the neck.
He also repainted the guitar, from its original maroon to blue-and-black with a lightning bolt finish. Blaze returned the ML to Abbott in 1987, who was initially unaware that it was the same guitar he won as a prize. It subsequently became Abbott&#x27;s signature guitar and was later dubbed the &quot;Dean from Hell&quot;.
After the release of &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, Abbott signed an endorsement deal with Dean Guitars. Dean went out of business in 1994 and Abbott then signed a ten-year contract with Washburn Guitars. With Washburn, he played various signature guitars modeled after the ML, such as the Dime 333, Culprit and Stealth. When his contract with Washburn expired in 2004, he became the main endorsee of the re-opened Dean. Abbott&#x27;s murder came shortly before the Dean contract was set to begin. Abbott had designed the Dean Razorback and Razorback V in the months prior to his death. Dean also posthumously released replicas of the Dean from Hell.

Abbott was praised for his instrumental tone and was included in &quot;Guitar Player&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Tones of All Time&quot;. Abbott used solid-state Randall amplifiers for most of his career; he remarked in the liner notes for &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;: &quot;Gotta have that Randall Crunch!&quot; He had won his first Randall amplifier in a guitar contest; he said in a 1993 interview it &quot;was a little nasty sounding, a little gritty, but I liked it. I knew that with time I could make it my own sound, and it came around.&quot; Abbott released a signature amplifier, the Randall Warhead, in 1999. The goal was to replicate the sound of his own rig: a Randall RG-100 head, Furman PQ-3 parametric equalizer, MXR six-band graphic equalizer and MXR 126 flanger. He set his Furman EQ to boost the highs and lows while scooping the mids, and he used both the Furman EQ and MXR EQ to increase the gain to the Randall&#x27;s front end. Abbott also used a Digitech whammy pedal, a Korg DT-7 chromatic tuner and a Rocktron Hush IIC noise gate. The noise gate allowed him to control the feedback associated with high levels of gain, and to create the distinctive holes of silence in his playing.

When Abbott&#x27;s endorsement deal with Washburn ended, his deal with Randall also ended, as Randall and Washburn both were subsidiaries of the U.S. Music Corporation. Abbott subsequently formed a partnership with Krank Amplifiers, a relatively small supplier. He used the Krank Revolution, a tube amplifier. Abbott also invested in the company and designed an amplifier named the Krankenstein; he approved the final revision of the Krankenstein just days before his murder. Abbott helped design many other products. With Dunlop Manufacturing, he designed the Dimebag Cry Baby from Hell, a wah-wah pedal, and the Dime Distortion, a distortion pedal. He also designed a signature pickup with Seymour Duncan titled the Dimebucker, which was based on the Bill Lawrence pickups that he used in most of his guitars. Dean Zelinsky of Dean said in 2010 that Abbott&#x27;s death was a &quot;bigger loss than we&#x27;ll ever know. ... I&#x27;m very proud of the work I did with him, but who knows what he would have accomplished if he was still with us.&quot;

==Personal life==

Abbott grew up in the same neighborhood as his long-time partner Rita Haney, whom he first met at the age of eight. They began dating in 1984. The couple never married. Haney said in a 2006 interview: &quot;We didn&#x27;t believe in the marriage thing. ... Why have someone you don&#x27;t know tell you it&#x27;s OK to be with someone you do know? We didn&#x27;t need the middleman! We had a one-on-one with the man upstairs ourselves.&quot; In 1995, Abbott bought a house with Haney in Dalworthington Gardens, Texas, a short distance from his hometown Arlington. Abbott kept a pet goat on the residence, and dyed its goatee like his own. He was remembered by his neighbors as approachable. One neighbor said he &quot;was a hick with an attitude, and I say that respectfully. We&#x27;d talk conservative politics. He was a big, big supporter of George Bush.&quot;

Darrell and Vinnie opened the Clubhouse, an all-nude strip club in north-west Dallas, in 1996. Vinnie&#x27;s original idea was a rock-and-roll-themed golf course, with &quot;a strip club at the nineteenth hole&quot;, but the construction of a golf course was prohibitively expensive. Under the Abbott brothers&#x27; ownership, the Clubhouse was patronized by many artists who toured in the area, such as Black Sabbath, Kiss and Metallica, as well as NASCAR drivers, professional golfers, and members of the Dallas Cowboys and the Dallas Stars (whose fight song, &quot;Puck Off&quot;, was written and produced by Pantera). After the Dallas Stars won the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals, the Abbott brothers hosted a party for the team at Vinnie&#x27;s house. Vinnie later stated that the Stanley Cup was dented during the party after Guy Carbonneau threw it out of a window into a swimming pool, but missed the pool and hit the edge. The brothers also performed on a float during the celebration of the Stars&#x27; victory.

==Legacy==


On May 17, 2007, Abbott was posthumously inducted into Hollywood&#x27;s RockWalk. Ace Frehley was among the attendees at the induction ceremony, where he spoke in honor of Abbott. Frehley also dedicated his 2009 album &quot;Anomaly&quot; to Abbott, as well as former Kiss drummer Eric Carr. A concert in memory of Abbott titled Dimebash has been held annually since 2010. All of the concert&#x27;s proceeds go towards the Ronnie James Dio Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund. Performers at Dimebash events have included artists such as Dave Grohl, Kerry King, Robb Flynn, Tom Morello, and Serj Tankian. 

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Abbott at No. 92 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2011, and described him as &quot;one of modern metal&#x27;s key figures&quot;. Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath said Abbott was &quot;one of the greatest musicians to grace our world&quot;. In 2018, Abbott ranked at No. 19 on &quot;Louder&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Sebastian Bach of Skid Row commented that Abbott &quot;reinvented heavy metal guitar&quot;. Jamie Humphries of &quot;Premier Guitar&quot; remarked in 2014: &quot;If there were ever a band and guitarist to credit for reinventing post-Metallica metal, it would have to be Pantera and the late Dimebag Darrell.&quot;

Abbott also ranked at No. 9 in a 2012 &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers&#x27; poll of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;, and was named the &quot;Greatest Metal Guitarist&quot; by &quot;Loudwire&quot; in 2013 after winning a reader-voted tournament bracket. Jonathan Davis of Korn said in a 2014 interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot; that Abbott is &quot;one of the greatest guitar players ever. I mean if there was no Dimebag Darrell, there would be no Korn.&quot; Slash stated that Abbott &quot;had a great tone and a great original style ... He was one of the best new guitar players that came out over a long period of time.&quot; Max Cavalera described Abbott as &quot;very talented, an amazing musician and a humble and cool guy – not a rock star asshole&quot;. 

In 2015, Abbott was ranked as the most influential metal guitarist of the past 25 years by VH1. Doc Coyle of God Forbid stated: &quot;[Abbott&#x27;s] sparse, low-end, bluesy chug was the blueprint for post-thrash, nu-metal, and metalcore in the subsequent years.&quot; Also in 2015, Abbott placed at No. 5 on Gibson&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Anne Erickson said Abbott &quot;proved metal guitar could shred wildly, but still groove. ... He&#x27;ll always be remembered as one of the most significant engineers of modern metal.&quot; In a 2017 interview by Ernie Ball String Theory, Avenged Sevenfold guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance praised Abbott&#x27;s guitar playing and writing, stating how he was a major influence on the pair, Gates in particular, which he has stated in numerous other interviews.

<doc id="217494" wikidata="Q336345" url="?curid=217494" title="Land of the Free (anthem)">
<text>&quot;Land of the Free&quot; is the national anthem of Belize. The words were written by Samuel Alfred Haynes in 1929 based upon Haynes poem “Land of the Gods.” The musical arrangement for “Land of the Gods,” was composed with Selwyn Walford Young in 1930. “Land of the Gods” was changed to “Land of the Free” by the George Cadle Price administration, officially adopted as the National Anthem of Belize in 1981.

== History and criticism ==
=== Samuel Haynes ===
Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Haynes enlisted in the British West Indies Regiment. After being discharged at the end of the war, Hayne returned to Belize where he joined various workers&#x27; movements in Belize and played a vital role in a riot by ex-servicemen against racial discrimination which occurred 22 July. After the riot was suppressed by the colonial government, Haynes began organising the Belizean branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and facilitated the visit of its leader, Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey to Belize. Garvey recruited Haynes to work with him in the United States, a move that rendered the UNIA chapted in Belize leaderless for much of the 1920s and that indirectly contributed to the Isaiah Emmanuel Morter controversy. Haynes most likely wrote the anthem as an answer to colonialism&#x27;s stifling of Belizeans&#x27; identity. The lofty language and uplifting lyrics referenced Belize&#x27;s former status as a slave society indebted to profits from forestry, linking it to the end of Belize&#x27;s colonial period, a process that culminated on 21 September 1981. The song was originally titled &quot;Land of the Gods&quot;, a salute to the proliferation of organised religion in Belize.

=== Exalting by the PUP ===
With the arrival of the nationalist movement led by the People&#x27;s United Party, the search was on for new symbols of Belizean identity. The PUP had defied the colonial order by singing &quot;God Bless America&quot; instead of the royal anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; (or Queen). At independence, the ruling PUP named &quot;Land of the Free&quot; Belize&#x27;s official anthem and played it at emotional independence ceremonies on 21 September. Most Belizeans agreed with the choice but lamented that it had not been put to a vote of Belizean residents.

=== Common complaints since ===
The anthem has come under fire from critics who charge that its language is archaic and does not appeal to a new generation of Belizeans who are in any case too young to remember Samuel Haynes.

Some have argued that the anthem is too male-centric. Lyrics such as &quot;Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty&quot; suggest the song was originally intended to be sung only by men. &quot;Amandala&quot; correspondent Naomi Burn suggested that &quot;manhood&quot; be replaced by &quot;honour&quot; so that the lyrics would have more relevance for women. It has also been noted that women are never mentioned in the anthem, only men. A 1998 survey of approximately 2,000 Belizean women asked how important it was to include women in the national anthem. 14.6% answered &quot;most important&quot;, 19.7% answered &quot;somewhat important&quot;, and 63.4% answered &quot;not very important&quot;.

Nationalist writers have argued that the anthem&#x27;s references to the Baymen ignore the multi-cultural diversity of Belize today and have proposed a number of replacements. The most recent complaint of this nature was leveled by Maya-Mestizo-born correspondent Clinton Luna, who suggested that the phrase &quot;sons of the Belizean soil&quot; should replace &quot;sons of the Baymen&#x27;s clan&quot; in the chorus in recent issues of the &quot;Amandala&quot; weekly newspaper. The newspaper itself has previously argued to the same effect. However, &quot;Amandala&quot; contributor Henry Gordon countered in a later issue that nothing in the anthem represents any sort of bias to any ethnic group in Belize.

Belizeans speak a wide range of languages including English, Spanish, three different Mayan languages, as well as native languages spoken by its diverse Chinese-speaking people, Garinagu, East Indian population, Mennonite community. The anthem, in formal English, has been memorised by generations of children, but not necessarily understood. Because Kriol is the language that binds all Belizeans together, regardless of the origin of their first language, Leela Vernon translated the song into Kriol in 2011 with the hope that the meaning behind the words would be better understood.

== Other uses ==
* Late former Prime Minister George Price toured the nation sometime in the early 2000s to promote the singing of the national anthem. He visited schools in rural areas and led children in singing the anthem.
* National radio stations generally play a version of the national anthem at morning sign-on. Most feature a recording of Price singing the anthem at piano in a faster tempo than usual or an instrumental version.
* In author Zee Edgell&#x27;s &quot;Beka Lamb&quot;, the title character and her friend Toycie Qualo sing the full version of the original song, &quot;Land of the Gods&quot; (of which the two opening and closing lines are mentioned in the story), while parodying the political meetings then being held by the PIP, a reference to the PUP, in Belize City. Edgell acknowledged permission to use the song at the front of the book.
* The anthem was prominently featured in demonstrations in Belize in 2005.
* Belizeans normally stand at attention facing forward, headgear off, while singing or facing someone singing the national anthem.

<doc id="217495" wikidata="Q19381" url="?curid=217495" title="English Electric Lightning">
<text>The English Electric Lightning is a British fighter aircraft that served as an interceptor during the 1960s, the 1970s and into the late 1980s. It is capable of a top speed above Mach 2. The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by English Electric. After EE merged with other aircraft manufacturers to form the British Aircraft Corporation it was marketed as the BAC Lightning. It was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Kuwait Air Force (KAF), and the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF).

A unique feature of the Lightning&#x27;s design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the airfields of the British &quot;V bomber&quot; strategic nuclear force from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the Tupolev Tu-22 &quot;Blinder&quot;, but it was subsequently also required to intercept other bomber aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-16 (&quot;Badger&quot;) and the Tupolev Tu-95 (&quot;Bear&quot;).

The Lightning has exceptional rate of climb, ceiling, and speed; pilots have described flying it as &quot;being saddled to a skyrocket&quot;. This performance and the initially limited fuel supply meant that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with aerial reconnaissance and ground-attack capability. Overwing fuel tank fittings were installed in the F6 variant and gave an extended range, but limited maximum speed to a reported .

Following retirement by the RAF on 30 April 1988, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at Thunder City in Cape Town, South Africa. In September 2008, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers conferred on the Lightning its Engineering Heritage Award at a ceremony at BAE Systems&#x27; (the successor to BAC) Warton Aerodrome.

==Development==

===Origins===
The specification for the aircraft followed the cancellation of the Air Ministry&#x27;s 1942 specification E.24/43 supersonic research aircraft which had resulted in the Miles M.52 programme. Teddy Petter, formerly chief designer at Westland Aircraft, who had been hired by English Electric in 1944 to head an office to develop aircraft rather than just make other manufacturers&#x27; designs, was a keen early proponent of Britain&#x27;s need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the Ministry of Supply (MoS) with his proposal, and in response Specification ER.103 was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at and .

Petter initiated a design proposal with Frederick Page leading the design and Ray Creasey responsible for the aerodynamics. By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane. Designed for Mach 1.5, the wing leading edge was swept back 40° to keep it clear of the Mach cone. This proposal was submitted in November 1948, and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric. On 29 March 1949 the MoS granted approval to start a detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup.

The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949 to further improve performance, taking many design cues from the CAC CA-23. To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60° with the ailerons moved to the wingtips. In late 1949, low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering the tail below the wing. Following the resignation of Petter from English Electric, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1 and the running of EE design office. In 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying airframes, as well as one static airframe, designated &quot;P.1&quot;.

The Royal Aircraft Establishment disagreed with Petter&#x27;s choice of sweep angle (60 degrees) and tailplane position (low) considering it to be dangerous. To assess the effects of wing sweep and tailplane position on the stability and control of Petter&#x27;s design Short Brothers were issued a contract by the Ministry of Supply to produce the Short SB.5 in mid-1950. This was a low-speed research aircraft that could test sweep angles from 50 to 69 degrees and high or low tailplane positions. Testing with the wings and tail set to the P.1 configuration started in January 1954 and confirmed this combination as the correct one.

===Prototypes===

From 1953 onward, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at Samlesbury Aerodrome, where all Lightnings were built. These aircraft were given the aircraft serials &quot;WG760&quot;, &quot;WG763&quot;, and &quot;WG765&quot; (the structural test airframe). The prototypes were powered by un-reheated Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojets, as the selected Rolls-Royce Avon engines had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems. Since there was no space in the fuselage for fuel the thin wings were the fuel tanks and since they also provided space for the stowed main undercarriage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited endurance, and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out if there was any crosswind component during take-off or landing. Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular air intake with no centre-body at the nose, short fin, and lack of operational equipment.

On 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft toward achieving ; these were designated &quot;P.1B&quot; while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as &quot;P.1A&quot;. P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls-Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body inlet cone, variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the ADC and AI.23 radar. Three P.1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856.

In May 1954, &quot;WG760&quot; and its support equipment were moved to RAF Boscombe Down for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, &quot;WG760&quot;, piloted by Roland Beamont, flew for the first time from Boscombe Down. One week later, &quot;WG760&quot; officially achieved supersonic flight for the first time, having exceeded the speed of sound during its third flight. During its first flight, &quot;WG760&quot; had unknowingly exceeded , but due to position error the Mach meter only showed a maximum of . The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later. While &quot;WG760&quot; had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to due to directional stability limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the &quot;Lightning&quot; name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft&#x27;s supersonic capabilities.

===OR.155 and project selection===
In 1955, the Air Ministry learned of the Tupolev Tu-22, expected to enter service in 1962. It could cruise for relatively long periods at and had a dash speed of Mach 1.5. Against a target flying at these speeds, the existing Gloster Javelin interceptors would be useless; its primary de Havilland Firestreak armament could only attack from the rear and the Tu-22 would run away from the Javelin in that approach. A faster version, the &quot;thin-wing Javelin&quot;, would offer limited supersonic performance and make it marginally useful against the Tu-22, while a new missile, &quot;Red Dean&quot; would allow head-on attacks. This combination would be somewhat useful against the Tu-22, but of marginal use if faster bombers were introduced. In January 1955, the Air Ministry issued Operational Requirement F.155 calling for a faster design to be armed with either an improved Firestreak known as &quot;Blue Vesta&quot;, or an improved Red Dean known as &quot;Red Hebe&quot;. The thin-wing Javelin was cancelled in May 1956.

In March 1957, Duncan Sandys released the 1957 Defence White Paper which outlined the changing strategic environment due to the introduction of ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. Although missiles of the era had relatively low accuracy compared to a manned bomber, any loss of effectiveness could be addressed by the ever-increasing yield of the warhead. This suggested that there was no targeting of the UK that could not be carried out by missiles, and Sandys felt it was unlikely that the Soviets would use bombers as their primary method of attack beyond the mid-to-late 1960s.

This left only a brief period, from 1957 to some time in the 1960s, in which bombers remained a threat. Sandys felt that the imminent introduction of the Bloodhound Mk. II surface-to-air missile would offer enough protection against bombers. The Air Ministry disagreed; they pointed out that the Tu-22 would enter service before Bloodhound II, leaving the UK open to sneak attack. Sandys eventually agreed this was a problem, but pointed out that F.155 would enter service after Bloodhound, as would a further improved SAM, &quot;Blue Envoy&quot;. F.155 was cancelled on 29 March 1957 and Blue Envoy in April.

To fill the immediate need for a supersonic interceptor, the Lightning was selected for production. The aircraft was already flying, and the improved P.1B was only weeks away from its first flight. Lightnings mounting Firestreak could be operational years before Bloodhound II, and the aircraft&#x27;s speed would make it a potent threat against the Tu-22 even in a tail-chase. To further improve its capability, in July 1957 the Blue Vesta program was reactivated in a slightly simplified form, allowing head-on attacks against an aircraft whose fuselage was heated through skin friction while flying supersonically. In November 1957, the missile was renamed &quot;Red Top&quot;. This would allow Lightning to attack even faster bombers through a collision-course approach. Thus, what had originally been an aircraft without a mission beyond testing was now selected as the UK&#x27;s next front-line fighter.

===Further testing===
On 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B &quot;XA847&quot;, exceeding Mach 1 during this flight. During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of were achieved daily. During this period the Fairey Delta 2 (FD2) held the world speed record of achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957. While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.

In 1958 two test pilots from the USAF Air Force Flight Test Center, Andy Anderson and Deke Slayton, were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P.1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the Mercury astronauts, commented:

In late October 1958, the plane was officially and formally named &quot;Lightning&quot;. The event was celebrated in traditional style in a hangar at RAE Farnborough, with the prototype XA847 having the name &#x27;Lightning&#x27; freshly painted on the nose in front of the RAF Roundel, which almost covered it. A bottle of champagne was put beside the nose on a special smashing rig which allowed the bottle to safely be smashed against the side of the aircraft. The honor of smashing the bottle went to the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Dermot Boyle.

On 25 November 1958 the P.1B &quot;XA847&quot;, piloted by Roland Beamont, reached Mach 2 for the first time in a British aircraft. This made it the second Western European aircraft to reach Mach 2, the first one being the French Dassault Mirage III just over a month earlier on 24 October 1958.

===Production===
The first operational Lightning, designated &quot;Lightning F.1&quot;, was designed as an interceptor to defend the V Force airfields in conjunction with the &quot;last ditch&quot; Bristol Bloodhound missiles located either at the bomber airfield, e.g. at RAF Marham, or at dedicated missile sites near to the airfield, e.g. at RAF Woodhall Spa near the 3-squadron Vulcan station RAF Coningsby. The bomber airfields along with the dispersal airfields, would be the highest priority targets in the UK for enemy nuclear weapons. To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than range – originally a radius of operation of from the V bomber airfields was specified – and endurance. It was equipped with two 30 mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 unguided air-to-air rockets, or two de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles. The Ferranti AI.23 onboard radar provided missile guidance and ranging, as well as search and track functions.

The next two Lightning variants, the &quot;Lightning F.1A&quot; and &quot;F.2&quot;, incorporated relatively minor design changes; for the next variant, the &quot;Lightning F.3&quot;, they were more extensive. The F.3 had higher thrust Rolls-Royce Avon 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened inlet cone allowing a service clearance to (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to ). The A.I.23B radar and Red Top missile offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the &quot;Lightning F.6&quot;, was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3&#x27;s shortcomings, the &quot;Interim F.Mk6&quot;.
The Interim F.Mk6 introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, ventral fuel tank, and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger leading edge fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by . The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannon would be useful in a peacetime interception for firing warning shots to encourage an aircraft to change course or to land.

The &quot;Lightning F.6&quot; was originally nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two ferry tanks on pylons over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannon mounted in the front. The addition of the cannon and their ammunition decreased the tank&#x27;s fuel capacity from .

The &quot;Lightning F.2A&quot; was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines. Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over West Germany.

===Export and further developments===
The &quot;Lightning F.53&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;Export Lightning&quot;, was developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a multirole capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties. The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for air-to-ground weaponry, including two bombs or four SNEB rocket pods each carrying eighteen 68 mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank. Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44× rockets, or a reconnaissance pod fitted with five 70 mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.

BAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as drop tanks, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB rockets and of fuel) or bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six bombs or 44 × rockets and 144 × 68 mm rockets. The &quot;Lightning T.55&quot; was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6. The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF&#x27;s own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.

In 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a variable-geometry wing, based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the variable-sweep wing, which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the Royal Navy&#x27;s existing aircraft carriers&#x27; carrier-based aircraft, the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year. Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer Rolls-Royce Spey engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.

==Design==

===Overview===
The Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched delta wing, and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the drag equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations. The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance; although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed.

Production aircraft were powered by various models of the Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of . Later models of the Avon featured, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement. A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft&#x27;s structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of . Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility took four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks. The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring fire hazard. The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development. For removal, the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.

The fuselage was tightly packed, leaving no room for fuel tankage or main landing gear. While the notched delta wing lacked the volume of a standard delta wing, each wing contained a fairly conventional three-section main fuel tank and leading-edge tank, holding ; the wing flaps also each contained a fuel tank and an additional was contained in a fuel recuperator, bringing the aircraft&#x27;s total internal fuel capacity to . The main landing gear was sandwiched outboard of the main tanks and aft of the leading edge tanks, with the flap fuel tanks behind. The long main gear legs retracted toward the wingtip, necessitating an exceptionally thin main tyre inflated to the high pressure of . On landing the No. 1 engine was usually shut down when taxiing to save brake wear, as keeping both engines running at idle power was still sufficient to propel the Lightning to 80 mph if brakes were not used. Dunlop Maxaret anti-lock brakes were fitted.

The Lightning fuel capacity was increased with a conformal ventral fuel tank. A rocket engine pack containing a Napier Double Scorpion engine and of high-test peroxide (HTP) to drive the rocket turbopump, and act as an oxidiser, was planned to be located in place of the ventral tank and would boost performance if non-afterburning engines were fitted. Fuel for the rocket would come from the aircraft fuel supply. The rocket engine option was cancelled in 1958 when it was established that performance with afterburning Avon engines was acceptable. The ventral store was routinely used as an extra fuel tank, holding of usable fuel. On later variants of the Lightning, a ventral weapons pack could be installed to equip the aircraft alternatively with different armaments, including missiles, rockets, and cannons.

===Avionics and systems===

Early versions of the Lightning were equipped with the Ferranti-developed AI.23 monopulse radar, which was contained right at the front of the fuselage within an inlet cone at the centre of the engine intake. Radar information was displayed on an early head-up display and managed by onboard computers. The AI.23 supported several operational modes, which included autonomous search, automatic target tracking, and ranging for all weapons; the pilot attack sight provided gyroscopically-derived lead angle and backup stadiametric ranging for gun firing. The radar and gunsight were collectively designated the AIRPASS, for &quot;Airborne Interception Radar and Pilot Attack Sight System&quot;. The radar was successively upgraded with the introduction of more capable Lightning variants, such as to provide guidance for the Red Top missile.
The cockpit of the Lightning was designed to meet the RAF&#x27;s &quot;OR946&quot; specification for tactical air navigation technology, and thus featured an integrated flight instrument display arrangement, an Elliott Bros (London) Ltd auto-pilot, a master reference gyroscopic reader, an auto-attack system, and an instrument landing system. Despite initial scepticism of the aircraft&#x27;s centralised detection and warning system, the system proved its merits during the development program and was redeveloped for greater reliability. Communications included UHF and VHF radios and a datalink. Unlike the previous generation of aircraft which used gaseous oxygen for lifesupport, the Lightning employed liquid oxygen-based apparatus for the pilot; cockpit pressurisation and conditioning was maintained through tappings from the engine compressors.

Electricity was provided via a bleed air-driven turbine housed in the rear fuselage, which drove an AC alternator and DC generator. This approach was unusual, since most aircraft used driveshaft-driven generators/alternators for electrical energy. A 28V DC battery provided emergency backup power. Aviation author Kev Darling stated of the Lightning: &quot;Never before had a fighter been so dependent upon electronics&quot;. Each engine was equipped with a pair of hydraulic pumps, one of which powered the flight-control systems and the other power for the undercarriage, flaps, and airbrakes. Switchable hydraulic circuits were used for redundancy in the event of a leak or other failure. A combination of Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes on the main wheels and an Irvin Air Chute braking parachute slowed the aircraft during landing. A tailhook was also fitted. Accumulators on the wheel brakes performed as backups to the hydraulics, providing minimal braking. Above a certain airspeed a stopped engine would &#x27;windmill&#x27;, that is, continue to be rotated by air flowing through it in a similar manner to a ram air turbine, sufficient to generate adequate hydraulic power for the powered controls during flight.
Toward the end of its service, the Lightning was increasingly outclassed by newer fighters, mainly due to avionics and armament obsolescence. The radar had a limited range and no track while scanning capability, and it could detect targets only in a narrow (40°) arc. While an automatic collision course attack system was developed and successfully demonstrated by English Electric, it was not adopted due to cost concerns. Plans were mooted to supplement or replace the obsolete Red Top and Firestreak missiles with modern AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles to help rectify some of the obsolescence, but these ambitions were not realised due to lack of funding. An alternative to the modernisation of existing aircraft would have been the development of more advanced variants; a proposed variable-sweep wing Lightning would have likely involved the adoption of a new powerplant and radar and was believed by BAC to significantly increase performance, but ultimately was not pursued.

===Climb performance===
Lightning, was designed...as an intercepter fighter. As such, it has probably the fastest rate-of-climb of any combat aircraft – &quot;Flight International&quot;, 21 March 1968
The Lightning possessed a remarkable climb rate. It was famous for its ability to rapidly rotate from takeoff to climb almost vertically from the runway, though this did not yield the best time-to-altitude. The Lightning&#x27;s trademark tail-stand manoeuvre exchanged airspeed for altitude; it could slow to near-stall speeds before commencing level flight. The Lightning&#x27;s optimum climb profile required the use of afterburners during takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, the nose would be lowered for rapid acceleration to IAS before initiating a climb, stabilising at . This would yield a constant climb rate of approximately . Around the Lightning would reach and maintain this speed until reaching the tropopause, on a standard day. If climbing further, pilots would accelerate to supersonic speed at the tropopause before resuming the climb. A Lightning flying at optimum climb profile would reach in under three minutes.
The official ceiling of the Lightning was kept secret. Low security RAF documents often stated &quot;in excess of &quot;. In September 1962, RAF Fighter Command organised interception trials on Lockheed U-2As at heights of around , which were temporarily based at RAF Upper Heyford to monitor Soviet nuclear tests. Climb techniques and flight profiles were developed to put the Lightning into a suitable attack position. To avoid risking the U-2, the Lightning was not permitted any closer than and could not fly in front of the U-2. For the intercepts, four Lightning F1As conducted 18 solo sorties. The sorties proved that, under GCI, successful intercepts could be made at up to . Due to sensitivity, details of these flights were deliberately avoided in the pilot log books.

In 1984, during a NATO exercise, Flight lieutenant Mike Hale intercepted a U-2 at a height which they had previously considered safe (thought to be ). Records show that Hale also climbed to in his Lightning F.3 &quot;XR749&quot;. This was not sustained level flight but a ballistic climb, in which the pilot takes the aircraft to top speed and then puts the aircraft into a climb, exchanging speed for altitude. Hale also participated in time-to-height and acceleration trials against Lockheed F-104 Starfighters from Aalborg. He reports that the Lightnings won all races easily with the exception of the low-level supersonic acceleration, which was a &quot;dead heat&quot;. Lightning pilot and Chief Examiner Brian Carroll reported taking a Lightning F.53 up to over Saudi Arabia at which level &quot;Earth curvature was visible and the sky was quite dark&quot;, noting that the engines were &quot;touchy&quot; in terms of staying lit in the thin air, and &quot;getting down to a more reasonable and sane altitude needed delicate handling.&quot;

Carroll compared the Lightning and the McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagle, having flown both aircraft, stating that: &quot;Acceleration in both was impressive, you have all seen the Lightning leap away once brakes are released, the Eagle was almost as good, and climb speed was rapidly achieved. Takeoff roll is between , depending upon military or maximum afterburner-powered takeoff. The Lightning was quicker off the ground, reaching height in a horizontal distance of &quot;. Chief test pilot for the Lightning Roland Beamont, who also flew most of the &quot;Century Series&quot; US aircraft, stated his opinion that nothing at that time had the inherent stability, control, and docile handling characteristics of the Lightning throughout the full flight envelope. The turn performance and buffet boundaries of the Lightning were well in advance of anything known to him.

===Aircraft performance===
Early Lightning models, the F.1, F.1A, and F.2, had a maximum speed of at in an ICAO standard atmosphere, and IAS at lower altitudes. Later models, the F.2A, F.3, F.3A, F.6, and F.53, had a maximum speed of at , and speeds up to indicated air speed for &quot;operational necessity only&quot;. A Lightning fitted with Avon 200-series engines, a ventral tank, and two Firestreak missiles had a maximum speed of on a standard day; while a Lightning powered by the Avon 300-series engines, a ventral tank and two Red Top missiles had a maximum speed of Mach 2.0. Directional stability decreased as speed increased, with vertical fin failure likely if yaw was not correctly counteracted with rudder deflections. Imposed Mach limits during missile launches ensured adequate directional stability; later Lightning variants had a larger vertical fin, giving a greater stability margin at high speed.

It was not known whether the fixed centre-body intake, with a design point of Mach 1.7, would encounter intake buzz, a vibration caused by oscillation of the shock positions at different combinations of Mach number and engine air flow/rpm. A Lightning prototype was taken to to check for this instability but none was found. Service trials with the F.6 found intake buzz when engine speed was rapidly reduced at speeds above as well as when manoeuvring (increased &#x27;g&#x27;) at other supersonic speeds and engine thrust settings. The buzz caused no damage.

Thermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have blocked the AI 23&#x27;s radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At and , the heating conditions on the shock cone were similar to those at sea level and indicated airspeed, but if the speed was increased to at , the shock cone was exposed to higher temperatures than those at Mach 1.7. The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operation at up to Mach 2.0.

The small-fin variants could exceed Mach 1.7, but the stability limits and shock cone thermal and strength limits made such speeds risky. The large-fin variants, especially those equipped with Avon 300-series engines could safely reach Mach 2 and, given the right atmospheric conditions, might even achieve a few more tenths of a Mach. All Lightning variants had the excess thrust to slightly exceed indicated airspeed under certain conditions, and the service limit of was occasionally ignored. With the strengthened shock cone, the Lightning could safely approach its thrust limit, but fuel consumption at very high airspeeds was excessive and became a major limiting factor.

===Handling characteristics===
The Lightning was fully aerobatic.

==Operational history==
===Royal Air Force===

The first aircraft to enter service with the RAF, three pre-production P.1Bs, arrived at RAF Coltishall in Norfolk on 23 December 1959, joining the Air Fighting Development Squadron (AFDS) of the Central Fighter Establishment, where they were used to clear the Lightning for entry into service. The production Lightning F.1 entered service with the AFDS in May 1960, allowing the unit to take part in the air defence exercise &quot;Yeoman&quot; later that month. The Lightning F.1 entered frontline squadron service with 74 Squadron under the command of Squadron Leader John &quot;Johnny&quot; Howe at Coltishall from 11 July 1960. This made the Lightning the second Western European-built combat aircraft with true supersonic capability to enter service and the second fully supersonic aircraft to be deployed in Western Europe, the first one in both categories being the Swedish Saab 35 Draken on 8 March 1960 four months earlier.

The aircraft&#x27;s radar and missiles proved to be effective and pilots reported that the Lightning was easy to fly. However, in the first few months of operation the aircraft&#x27;s serviceability was extremely poor. This was due to the complexity of the aircraft systems and shortages of spares and ground support equipment. Even when the Lightning was not grounded by technical faults, the RAF initially struggled to get more than 20 flying hours per aircraft per month compared with the 40 flying hours that English Electric believed could be achieved with proper support. In spite of these concerns, within six months of the Lightning entering service, 74 Squadron was able to achieve 100 flying hours per aircraft.

In addition to its training and operational roles, 74 Squadron was appointed as the official Fighter Command aerobatic team for 1961, flying at air shows throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. Deliveries of the slightly improved Lightning F.1A, with improved avionics and provision for an air-to-air refuelling probe, allowed two more squadrons, 56 and 111 Squadron, both based at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk to convert to the Lightning in 1960–1961. The Lightning F.1 would only be ordered in limited numbers and serve for a short time; nonetheless, it was viewed as a significant step forward in Britain&#x27;s air defence capabilities. Following their replacement from frontline duties by the introduction of successively improved variants of the Lightning, the remaining F.1 aircraft were employed by the Lightning Conversion Squadron.
An improved variant, the F.2 first flew on 11 July 1961 and entered service with 19 Squadron at the end of 1962 and 92 Squadron in early 1963. Conversion of these two squadrons was aided by the use of the two seat T.4 trainer, which entered service with the Lightning Conversion Squadron (later renamed 226 Operational Conversion Unit) in June 1962. While the OCU was the major user of the two-seater, small numbers were also allocated to the front-line fighter squadrons. More F.2s were produced than there were available squadron slots so later production aircraft were stored for years before being used operationally; some Lightning F.2s were converted to F.2a&#x27;s. They had some of the improvements added to the F.6.

The F.3, with more powerful engines and the new Red Top missile (but no cannon) was expected to be the definitive Lightning, and at one time it was planned to equip ten squadrons, with the remaining two squadrons retaining the F.2. On 16 June 1962, the F.3 flew for the first time. It had a short operational life and was withdrawn from service early due to defence cutbacks and the introduction of the F.6, some of which were converted F.3s.

The Lightning F.6 was a more capable and longer-range version of the F.3. It initially had no cannon, but installable gun packs were made available later. A few F.3s were upgraded to F.6s. Author Kev Darling suggests that decreasing British overseas defence commitments had led to those aircraft instead being prematurely withdrawn. The introduction of the F.3 and F.6 allowed the RAF to progressively reequip squadrons operating aircraft such as the Gloster Javelin and retire these types during the mid-1960s.

A Lightning was tasked with shooting down a pilot-less Hawker Siddley Harrier over West Germany in 1972. The pilot had abandoned the Harrier which continued flying toward the East German border; it was shot down to avoid a diplomatic incident. During British Airways trials in April 1985, Concorde was offered as a target to NATO fighters including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, Grumman F-14 Tomcats, Dassault Mirages, and F-104 Starfighters – but only Lightning &quot;XR749&quot;, flown by Mike Hale and described by him as &quot;a very hot ship, even for a Lightning&quot;, managed to overtake Concorde on a stern conversion intercept.

During the 1960s, as strategic awareness increased and a multitude of alternative fighter designs were developed by Warsaw Pact and NATO members, the Lightning&#x27;s range and firepower shortcomings became increasingly apparent. The transfer of McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs from Royal Navy service enabled these much longer-ranged aircraft to be added to the RAF&#x27;s interceptor force alongside those withdrawn from Germany as they were replaced by SEPECAT Jaguars in the ground attack role. The Lightning&#x27;s direct replacement was the Panavia Tornado F3, an interceptor variant of the Panavia Tornado multi-role aircraft. The Tornado featured several advantages over the Lightning, including a far larger weapons load and considerably more advanced avionics. Lightnings were slowly phased out of service between 1974 and 1988. In their final years the airframes required considerable maintenance to keep them airworthy due to the sheer number of accumulated flight hours. The last flight by RAF Lightnings was on 30 June 1988 with 2 aircraft flying to Cranfield Airport from RAF Binbrook.

====Fighter Command and Strike Command====
The main Lightning role was the air defence of the United Kingdom and was operated at first as part of Fighter Command and then from 1968 with No. 11 Group of Strike Command. At the formation of Strike Command nine Lightning squadrons were operational in the United Kingdom.

====Far East Air Force====
In 1967 No. 74 Squadron was moved to RAF Tengah, Singapore to take over the air defence role from the Gloster Javelin equipped 60 Squadron. The squadron was disbanded in 1971 following the withdrawal of British forces from Singapore.

====Near East Air Force====
The Royal Air Force had detached Lightnings to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus to support the Near East Air Force and in 1967 No. 56 Squadron RAF moved from RAF Wattisham with the Lightning F.3 to provide a permanent air defence force, it converted to the F.6 in 1971 and returned to the United Kingdom in 1975.

====Royal Air Force Germany====
In the early 1960s No. 19 Squadron and No. 92 Squadron with Lightning F.2s, moved from RAF Leconfield to RAF Gütersloh in West Germany as part of Royal Air Force Germany and operated in the low-level air defence role until disbanded in 1977 when the role was taken over by the Phantom FGR2.

===Saudi Arabia and Kuwait===

On 21 December 1965, Saudi Arabia, keen to improve its air defences owing to the Saudi involvement in the North Yemen Civil War and the resultant air incursions into Saudi airspace by Egyptian forces supporting the Yemeni Republicans, placed a series of orders with Britain and the US to build a new integrated air defence system. BAC received orders for 34 multirole single-seat Lightning F.53s that could still retain very high performance and reasonable endurance, and six two-seat T.55 trainers, together with 25 BAC Strikemaster trainers, while the contract also included new radar systems, American Hawk surface-to-air missiles and training and support services.

To provide an urgent counter to air incursions, with Saudi towns near the border being bombed by Egyptian aircraft, an additional interim contract, called &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, was placed in March 1966 for the supply of six ex-RAF Lightnings (four F.2s and two T.4 trainers, redesignated F.52 and T.54 respectively), six Hawker Hunters, two air defence radars and a number of Thunderbird surface-to-air missiles. The &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; Lightnings were delivered to Saudi Arabia in July 1966. One lost in an accident was later replaced in May 1967. The Lightnings and Hunters, flown by mercenary pilots, were deployed to Khamis Mushait airfield near the Yemeni border, resulting in the curtailing of operations by the Egyptian Air Force over the Yemeni-Saudi border.
During the Al-Wadiah War, RSAF Lightnings flown by Saudi and Pakistan Air Force pilots participated in the airstrikes on Yemeni militias after they captured a town in Saudi Arabia in 1969.

Kuwait ordered 14 Lightnings in December 1966; 12 F.53Ks and two T.55Ks. The first Kuwait aircraft, a T.55K first flew on 24 May 1968 and deliveries to Kuwait started in December 1968. The Kuwaitis somewhat overestimated their ability to maintain such a complex aircraft, not adopting the extensive support from BAC and Airwork Services that the Saudis used to keep their Lightnings operational, so serviceability was poor.
Saudi Arabia officially received F.53 Lightnings in December 1967, although they were kept at Warton while trials and development continued and the first Saudi Lightnings to leave Warton were four T.55s delivered in early 1968 to the Royal Air Force 226 Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Coltishall, the four T.55s were used to train Saudi aircrew for the next 18 months. The new-build Lightnings were delivered under Operation &quot;Magic Palm&quot; between July 1968 and August 1969. Two Lightnings, a F.53 and a T.55 were destroyed in accidents prior to delivery, and were replaced by two additional aircraft, the last of which was delivered in June 1972. The multirole F.53s served in the ground-attack and reconnaissance roles as well as an air defence fighter, with Lightnings of No 6 Squadron RSAF carrying out ground-attack missions using rockets and bombs during a border dispute with South Yemen between December 1969 and May 1970. One F.53 (53–697) was shot down by Yemeni ground fire on 3 May 1970 during a reconnaissance mission, with the pilot ejecting successfully and being rescued by Saudi forces. Saudi Arabia received Northrop F-5E fighters from 1971, which resulted in the Lightnings relinquishing the ground-attack mission, concentrating on air defence, and to a lesser extent, reconnaissance.

Kuwait&#x27;s Lightnings did not have a long service career. After an unsuccessful attempt by the regime to sell them to Egypt in 1973, the last Lightnings were replaced by Dassault Mirage F1s in 1977. The remaining aircraft were stored at Kuwait International Airport, and many were destroyed during the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990.

Until 1982, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Lightnings were mainly operated by 2 and 6 Squadron RSAF (although a few were also used by 13 Squadron RSAF), but when 6 Squadron re-equipped with the F-15 Eagle all the remaining aircraft were operated by 2 Squadron at Tabuk. In 1985 as part of the agreement to sell the Panavia Tornado to the RSAF, the 22 flyable Lightnings were traded in to British Aerospace and returned to Warton in January 1986. While BAe offered the ex-Saudi Lightnings to Austria and Nigeria, no sales were made, and the aircraft were eventually disposed of to museums.

===Civil operators===
Thunder City, a private company based at Cape Town International Airport, South Africa operated one Lightning T.5 and two single-seat F.6es. The T.5 XS452, (civil registration ZU-BBD) flew again on 14 January 2014 after restoration and is currently the only airworthy example.
A Lightning T.5, XS451 (civil registration ZU-BEX) belonging to Thunder City crashed after developing mechanical problems during its display at the biennial South African Air Force Overberg Airshow held at AFB Overberg near Bredasdorp on 14 November 2009. The Silver Falcons, the South African Air Force&#x27;s official aerobatic team, flew a missing man formation after it was announced that the pilot had died in the crash.
*British Aerospace operated four ex-RAF F.6s as radar targets to aid development of the Panavia Tornado ADV&#x27;s AI.24 Foxhunter radar from 1988 to 1992.
*The Anglo-American Lightning Organisation, a group based at Stennis Airport, Kiln, Mississippi, is returning EE Lightning T.5, XS422 to airworthy status. As of March 2021, the aircraft was capable of fast taxiing down a runway. The aircraft was formerly with the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School (ETPS) at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire, UK.

==Notable appearances==

* The 1965 period comedy film &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; set in 1910 ends with a flyover of six English Electric Lightnings.
* British journalist and TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson borrowed a Lightning (serial &quot;XM172&quot;) which was temporarily placed in his garden and documented on Clarkson&#x27;s 2001 television series &quot;Speed&quot;.
* In a 2010 episode of the BBC TV programme &quot;Wonders of the Solar System&quot;, Professor Brian Cox had a Lightning (&quot;XS451&quot;) with civil registration in South Africa climb to a very high altitude, allowing Cox to show the curvature of the Earth and the relative dimensions of the atmosphere. This aircraft crashed in November 2009, a month after the episode was filmed, when it developed mechanical problems during an air show at South Africa&#x27;s AFB Overberg.

<doc id="217496" wikidata="Q2267264" url="?curid=217496" title="Age of Liberty">
<text>In Swedish history, the Age of Liberty () was a period that saw parliamentary governance, increasing civil rights, and the decline of the Swedish Empire that began with the adoption of the Instrument of Government in 1719 and ended with Gustav III&#x27;s self-coup in 1772. This shift of power from the monarch to parliament was a direct effect of the Great Northern War.

Suffrage under the parliamentary government was not universal. Although the taxed peasantry was represented in the Parliament, its influence was disproportionately small, and commoners without taxed property had no suffrage at all.

== Great Northern War ==
Following the death of Charles XI of Sweden, his young son Charles XII became king, and in 1697, when he was only 15 years old, he was proclaimed to be of age and took over the rule from the provisional government. The states in which Sweden&#x27;s expansion into a great power had primarily been at the expense of Denmark and Russia, formed a coalition with Saxony two years later with the aim of partitioning Sweden. After initial successes, Sweden&#x27;s army was eventually reduced while the list of enemies grew. In a Swedish siege of Fredriksten Fortress in Norway in 1718, Charles XII was killed, after which most hostilities in the West ended. At the beginning of 1719, peace overtures were made to Britain, Hanover, Prussia, and Denmark.

By the Treaties of Stockholm on 20 February 1719 and 1 February 1720, Hanover obtained the Duchies of Bremen and Verden for herself and Southern Swedish Pomerania with Stettin for the confederate Brandenburg-Prussia. Northern Swedish Pomerania with Rügen, which had come under Danish rule during the war, was retained by Sweden. By the Treaty of Frederiksborg on 3 July 1720, peace was also signed between Denmark and Sweden. Denmark returned Rügen, Further Pomerania as far as the Peene, and Wismar to Sweden in exchange for an indemnity of 600,000 Riksdaler; in return, Sweden would pay the Sound tolls and give up her protectorate over Holstein-Gottorp. Peace with Russia was achieved in 1721. By the Treaty of Nystad, Sweden ceded Livonia, the Finnish province of Kexholm, and Viborg Castle to Russia, Ingria, and Estonia. Finland west of Viborg and north of Käkisalmi was restored to Sweden. Sweden also received an indemnity of two million Riksdaler and a solemn undertaking of non-interference in her domestic affairs.

== Age of Liberty ==
Early in 1720, Charles XII&#x27;s sister, Ulrika Eleonora, who had been elected queen of Sweden immediately after his death, was permitted to abdicate in favor of her husband Frederick, the prince of Hesse, who was elected king 1720 under the title of Frederick I of Sweden. Sweden also converted into the most limited of monarchies. All power was vested in the people as represented by the Riksdag, consisting, as before, of four distinct estates: nobles, priests, burgesses, and peasants. The conflicting interests of these four independent assemblies, who sat and deliberated apart and with their mutual jealousies, made the work of legislation exceptionally difficult. No measure could now become law until it had obtained the assent of at least three of the four estates.

Each estate was ruled by its &quot;talman&quot;, or speaker, who was now elected at the beginning of each Diet, but the archbishop was, ex officio, the talman of the clergy. The lantmarskalk, or speaker of the House of Nobles, presided when the estates met in congress and also, by virtue of his office, in the secret committee. This famous body, which consisted of 50 nobles, 25 priests, 25 burgesses, and, very exceptionally, 25 peasants, possessed during the session of the Riksdag not only the supreme executive but also the supreme judicial and legislative functions. It prepared all bills for the Riksdag, created and deposed all ministries, controlled the foreign policy of the nation, and claimed and often exercised the right of superseding the ordinary courts of justice. During the parliamentary recess, however, the executive remained in the hands of the Privy Council, which was responsible to the Riksdag alone.

== Hats and Caps ==
The policy of the Hats party was a return to the traditional alliance between France and Sweden. Chancery President, and member of the rival Caps party, Count Arvid Horn acted with the recognition of Sweden&#x27;s unequal status in this alliance. The Hats, however, aimed to restore Sweden to its former position as a great power. France supported the efforts of their ally to become a stronger military power and thus provided financial support to the Hats.

The Hats initiated war with Russia. The unstable European political situation due to the almost simultaneous deaths of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Empress Anne of Russia seemed to favor the Hats&#x27; schemes. Despite the protests of the Caps, a project for the invasion of Russian Finland was rushed through the premature Riksdag of 1740. On 20 July 1741, war was formally declared against Russia; a month later, the Diet was dissolved, and the &quot;lantmarskalk&quot; set off to Finland to take command of the army. The first major battle occurred six months after the declaration of war when the Russians routed the Swedes in Finland at Lappeenranta and captured the fortress. Neither side had major offensive achievements in the following six months, during which time the Swedish generals made a &quot;tacit truce&quot; with the Russians through the mediation of the French ambassador at Saint Petersburg. By the time that the &quot;tacit truce&quot; had come to an end the Swedish forces were so demoralized that the mere rumor of a hostile attack prompted a retreat to Helsinki. By the end of the year, the majority of Finland was held by Russia. The Swedish fleet was struck by an epidemic, and thus contributed little to the war.

The Hats avoided a motion for an inquiry into the conduct of the war by shifting the focus of the Riksdag to the issue of succession. Queen Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden had lately died childless and King Frederick was old. Negotiations were thus opened with the new Russian empress, Elizabeth of Russia, who agreed to restore the greater part of Finland if her cousin, Adolph Frederick of Holstein, were elected successor to the Swedish crown. The Hats took the opportunity to recover the lost lands, as well as a bit of their own prestige. By the Treaty of Åbo on 7 May 1743 the terms of the empress were accepted and only the small part of Finland which lay beyond the Kymi River was retained by Russia.

=== Arvid Horn ===

Since 1719, when the influence of the few great territorial families had been merged in a multitude of needy gentlemen, the first estate had become the nursery and afterwards the stronghold of an opposition at once noble and democratic which found its natural leaders in such men as Count Carl Gyllenborg and Count Carl Gustaf Tessin. These men and their followers were never weary of ridiculing the timid caution of the aged statesman who sacrificed everything to perpetuate an inglorious peace and derisively nicknamed his adherents &quot;Night-caps&quot; (a term subsequently softened into &quot;Caps&quot;), themselves adopting the sobriquet &quot;Hats&quot; from the three-cornered hat worn by officers and gentlemen, which was a display of the manly self-assertion of this opposition.

These epithets instantly caught the public fancy and had already become party badges when the estates met in 1738. This Riksdag was to mark another turning-point in Swedish history.
In the War of the Polish Succession between 1733–1738 Sweden supported Stanislaus Leszczyński against August III of Poland. The Hats carried everything before them, and the aged Horn, who had served thirty-three years, was finally compelled to retire from the scene.

== Pomeranian War ==
Encouraged by Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, Frederick the Great&#x27;s sister, King Adolf Frederick of Sweden (reigned 1751–1771) supported a rebellion to restore the privileges of the monarchy. The attempted monarchical revolution, planned by the queen and a few devoted young nobles in 1756, was easily crushed, with Adolf Frederick nearly losing the throne in response.

That same year, the Hats saw a blow to their foreign policy. At the instigation of France, Sweden entered into the Seven Years&#x27; War, which proved disastrous. The French subsidies, which might have sufficed for a shorter, six weeks campaign (it was generally assumed that the king of Prussia would give little trouble to a European coalition), proved inadequate. After five unsuccessful campaigns, the Hats were forced to make peace, with Sweden having lost approximately 40,000 men. When the Riksdag met in 1760, Hat leaders managed to avoid impeachment after a session lasting twenty months, and the Hat government was bolstered for an additional four years. However, the Caps soon seized power in a meeting of the estates in 1765. The Cap leader, Ture Rudbeck, was elected marshal of the Diet over Frederick Axel von Fersen, the Hat candidate, by a large majority; and, out of the hundred seats in the secret committee, the Hats succeeded in getting only ten.

The Caps quickly ordered a budget report to be made, finding fraud on the part of the Hat government resulting in a large increase in the national debt and a depreciation of the note circulation to one-third of its face value. This report led to an all-round retrenchment, earning the parliament the nickname &quot;Reduction Riksdag&quot;. The Caps succeeded in reducing the national debt, reducing wealth of the nobility in order to replenish the empty exchequer, and establishing an equilibrium between revenue and expenditure. The Caps also introduced additional reforms, the most remarkable of which was the liberty of the press in 1766. In foreign policy, the parliament also allied Sweden with Russia to counter the influence of France.

Although no longer a great power, Sweden still took on many of the responsibilities of a great power, and, despite losing value, the prospect of a Swedish alliance still held weight. Sweden&#x27;s particular geographical position made it virtually invulnerable for six months out of the twelve, and its Pomeranian possessions provided easy access to the Holy Roman Empire. Additionally, to the east, its Finnish frontier was close to the Russian capital at Saint Petersburg.

Neutrality, a relative commitment to defensive alliances, and commercial treaties with the maritime powers, became the basis of the older Caps&#x27; foreign policy. However, the Hats&#x27; relationship with France in the north drove the younger Caps to seek an alliance with Russia. This policy backfired, as France&#x27;s distance to Sweden had left Sweden outside the territorial ambitions of France. Russia, on the other hand, saw Swedish land as a potential area of expansion. The 1772 Partition of Poland included a secret clause requiring the contracting powers to uphold the existing Swedish constitution as the swiftest means of subverting Swedish independence; and an alliance with the credulous Caps, or &quot;the Patriots&quot; as they were known in Russia, guaranteeing their constitution, was a corollary to this agreement.

The domination of the Caps was short-lived. The general distress caused by their drastic reforms had found expression in pamphlets criticizing the Cap government, which were protected under the new press laws. The senate retaliated with an order, which the king refused to sign, declaring that all complaints against the austerity measures of the last Riksdag should be punished with fine and imprisonment. The king, at the suggestion of the crown prince, urged the senate to quickly summon a Riksdag in order to relive the national distress, but was refused, leading the king to abdicate. This resulted in the December Crisis (1768), leaving Sweden without a regular government between December 15–21, 1768. Eventually, the Cap senate yielded and the estates were called for 19 April 1769.

On the eve of the contest there was a general assembly of the Hats at the French embassy, where the Comte de Modêne furnished them with 6,000,000 livres in return for a promise to reform the Swedish constitution to increase the powers of the monarchy. On the other hand, a Russian minister became kingdom&#x27;s treasurer and a counsellor for the Caps. In return, the Caps openly threatened to use Russian force to punish their detractors, and designated Norrköping, instead of Stockholm, as the place of meeting for the Riksdag due to the city being more accessible to the Russian fleet. It quickly became evident that the Caps had misstepped, and when the Riksdag met at Norrköping on 19 April, they found themselves in a minority in all four estates. In the contest for speaker of the Riksdag (Lantmarskalk), the leaders of the two parties were again pitted against each other. The results of the previous Diet were exactly reversed, with von Fersen defeating Rudbeck by 234 votes, despite Russia spending at least 90,000 Riksdaler to secure the election of the latter.

A joint note presented to the estates by the Russian, Prussian and Danish ministers protested the result, in menacing terms, against any &quot;reprisals&quot; on the part of the triumphant faction, hastened the fall of the government. The Cap senate resigned en masse to escape impeachment, and an exclusively Hat ministry took its place. On 1 June, the &quot;Reaction Riksdag&quot;, as it was generally called, withdrew to the capital; and the French ambassador and the crown prince Gustav called upon the new Privy Councillors to redeem their promise to reform the constitution. When, at the end of the session, they half-heartedly brought the matter forward, but it did not proceed, with the Reaction Riksdag disbanding on 30 January 1770.

== Economy ==
The Great Northern War left Sweden in a state of economic and demographic ruin at the start of the Age of Liberty. This period brought economic and social upheaval as well as industrial development. However, by the time the Age of Liberty ended in 1772, Sweden was by all objective measures a weaker nation than it was during its &quot;Era of Great Power.&quot; Its land was diminished, its monopoly over the bar iron trade was gone, and it was lagging behind in the race towards early industrialisation. The decline can be attributed both to fiscal, monetary and executive policy errors by the various Riksdag parties in power, as well as to technological and economic shifts which allowed Sweden&#x27;s rivals and neighbours get ahead on the global stage. However, the agricultural reforms, the early industrial developments and the gradual change from mercantilism to free trade which occurred during this period and pioneered the path for Sweden&#x27;s agricultural revolution in the 1790s and eventual large scale industrialization in the mid to late 19th century.

<text>The history of Sweden from 1772 to 1809 is better known as the Gustavian era of kings Gustav III and Gustav IV Adolf, as well as the reign of King Charles XIII.

== Gustav III ==
Adolf Frederick of Sweden died on 12 February 1771. The elections afterward resulted in a partial victory for the Caps party, especially among the lower orders; but in the estate of the peasantry the Caps majority was merely nominal, while the mass of the nobility was dead against them. Nothing could be done, however, till the return of the new king, Gustav III, from Paris.

===Coronation oath===
The new coronation oath contained three revolutionary clauses:
#The first aimed at making abdications in the future impossible by binding the king to reign uninterruptedly.
#The second obliged him to abide, not by the decision of all the estates together, as heretofore, but by that of the majority only, with the view of enabling the actually dominant lower estates (in which there was a large Cap majority) to rule without the nobility.
#The third clause required him, in all cases of preferment, to be guided not &quot;principally&quot; as heretofore, but &quot;solely&quot; by merit.

All through 1771 the estates wrangled over the clauses. An attempt of the king to mediate foundered on the suspicions of the estate of burgesses, and on 24 February 1772. the nobility yielded.

===Constitution===
The non-noble Cap majority now proceeded to attack the Privy Council. the &quot;Riksrådet&quot;, the last stronghold of the Hats, and, on 25 April of that year, it succeeded in ousting them. It was now, for the first time, that Gustav began to consider the possibility of a revolution.

The new constitution of 20 August 1772 which Gustav III imposed upon the Riksdag of the Estates, converted a weak and disunited republic into a strong but limited monarchy. The estates could assemble only when summoned by him; he could dismiss them whenever he thought fit; and their deliberations were to be confined exclusively to the propositions which he laid before them. But these extensive powers were subjected to important checks. Thus, without the previous consent of the estates, no new law could be imposed, no old law abolished, no offensive war undertaken, no extraordinary war subsidy levied. The estates alone could tax themselves; they had the absolute control of the Riksbank – the Bank of Sweden, and the right of controlling the national expenditure.

In Sweden, the change was most popular. But Gustav&#x27;s first Riksdag, that of 1778, opened the eyes of the deputies to the fact that their political supremacy had departed. The king was now their sovereign lord; and, for all his courtesy and gentleness, the jealousy with which he guarded and the vigour with which he enforced the prerogative plainly showed that he meant to remain so. But it was not till after eight years more had elapsed that actual trouble began. The Riksdag of 1778 had been obsequious; the Riksdag of 1786 was mutinous. It rejected nearly all the royal measures outright, or so modified them that Gustav himself withdrew them. When he dismissed the estates, the speech from the throne held out no prospect of their speedy revocation.

Nevertheless, within three years, the king was obliged to summon another Riksdag, which met at Stockholm on 26 January 1789. His attempt in the interval to rule without a parliament had been disastrous. It was only by a breach of his own constitution that he had been able to declare war against Russia in April 1788; the Conspiracy of Anjala (July) had paralysed all military operations at the very opening of the campaign; and the sudden invasion of his western provinces by the Danes, almost simultaneously (September), seemed to bring him to the verge of ruin. But the contrast, at this crisis, between his self-sacrificing patriotism and the treachery of the Russophil aristocracy was so striking that, when the Riksdag assembled, Gustav found that the three lower estates were ultra-royalist, and with their aid he succeeded, not without running great risks in crushing the opposition of the nobility by a second coup d&#x27;état on 16 February 1789 and passing the famous Act of Union and Security which gave the king an absolutely free hand as regards foreign affairs and the command of the army, and made further treason impossible. The nobility never forgave him.

===Foreign affairs===
Abroad, the Swedish revolution made a great sensation. Catherine II of Russia concluded a secret alliance with Denmark, in which the Swedish revolution was described as &quot;an act of violence&quot; justifying both powers in seizing the first favourable opportunity for intervention to restore the Swedish constitution of 1720.

Unknown to party leaders, Gustav had renewed the Swedish alliance with France and had received solemn assurances of assistance from Louis XV of France if Gustav were to reestablish monarchical rule in Sweden. Moreover, France agreed to pay its outstanding subsidies to Sweden, amounting to 1.5 million livres annually, beginning from January 1772. What&#x27;s more, Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, was to be sent to Stockholm to circumvent the designs of Russia just as he had previously done in the Sublime Porte at Constantinople.

==Gustav IV Adolf==


=== Reuterholm ===
The new king Gustav IV Adolf, still a minor, was brought up among Jacobins. During the king&#x27;s minority, Gustaf Reuterholm virtually ruled Sweden. After the execution of Louis XVI on 21 January 1793, Sweden recognized the new French republic, and secret negotiations for contracting an alliance were begun in May of the same year until the protests of Catherine of Russia, supported by all the other European powers, finally induced Sweden to suspend them.

The negotiations with the French Jacobins exacerbated the hatred which Gustav&#x27;s supporters felt for the Jacobin counselors of Charles, the duke-regent, later Charles XIII. They formed a conspiracy to overthrow the government, led by Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, which was to have been supported by a Russian fleet and a rising of the Dalecarlians. The conspiracy was discovered and vigorously suppressed.

===Rapprochement===
A rapprochement took place between the Scandinavian kingdoms during the revolutionary wars. Thus, on 27 March 1794, a neutrality compact was formed between with Denmark and Sweden; and their united squadrons patrolled the North Sea to protect their merchantmen from the British cruisers. The French republic was officially recognized by the Swedish government on 23 April 1795. In return, Sweden received a subsidy and a treaty between the two powers was signed on 14 September 1795. But an attempt to regain the friendship of Russia, which had broken off diplomatic relations with Sweden, was frustrated by the refusal of the king to accept as his bride the Russian grand duchess Alexandra, whom Reuterholm had provided. This was Reuterholm&#x27;s last official act. On 1 November 1796, Gustav Adolf at age 18 took the government into his own hands.

===Gustavian government===
The government of Gustav IV Adolf was almost a pure autocracy. At his very first Riksdag, held at Norrköping in March 1800, the nobility were compelled to ratify Gustav III&#x27;s Act of Union and Security.

A notable change took place in Sweden&#x27;s foreign policy in December 1800 when Denmark, Sweden and Russia acceded to a second League of Armed Neutrality, directed against Great Britain. Hitherto Sweden had kept aloof from continental complications, but the arrest and execution of the Duc d&#x27;Enghien in 1804 inspired Gustav Adolf with such a hatred of Napoleon that when a general coalition was formed against the French emperor he was one of the first to join it (3 December 1804), pledging himself to send an army corps to cooperate with the English and Russians in driving the enemy out of the Netherlands and Hanover. But his quarrel with Frederick William III of Prussia detained him in Pomerania, and when at last in December 1805 he led his 6,000 men towards the Elbe district, the third coalition had already been dissipated by the victories of Ulm and Austerlitz.

In 1806, a rupture between Sweden and Prussia was prevented only by Napoleon&#x27;s assault upon the latter power. After Jena Napoleon attempted to win over Sweden, but Gustav rejected every overture. The result was the total loss of Swedish Pomerania, and the Swedish army was saved from destruction only by the ingenuity of Johan Christopher Toll. At Tilsit the emperor Alexander I of Russia had undertaken to compel &quot;Russia&#x27;s geographical enemy&quot;, as Napoleon designated Sweden, to accede to the newly established &quot;Continental Russian System&quot;. Gustav Adolf rejected all the proposals of Alexander to close the Baltic against the English, but he took no measures to defend Finland against Russia. On 21 February 1808, a Russian army crossed the Finnish border. On 2 April, the king ordered a general levy of 30,000 men.

== Charles XIII ==
The immediate consequence of the Russian invasion was the deposition of Gustav Adolf by the Coup of 1809 on 13 March 1809, and the exclusion of his whole family from the succession. On 5 June 1809, the duke regent was proclaimed king, under the title of Charles XIII, after accepting the new liberal constitution, which was ratified by the Riksdag of the Estates the same day. Peace negotiations had been opened at Fredrikshamn, but the war carried on. Defeats at the Battle of Sävar and Battle of Ratan on 19 and 20 August 1809, broke the spirit of the Swedish Army; and peace was obtained by the surrender of all Finland, the Åland islands, &quot;the fore-posts of Stockholm&quot;, as Napoleon described them, and Västerbotten and Lappland as far as the rivers of Torneå and Muonio at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, on 17 September 1809.

<text>In computing, a dialog box (also simply dialog) is a graphical control element in the form of a small window that communicates information to the user and prompts them for a response.

Dialog boxes are classified as &quot;modal&quot; or &quot;modeless&quot;, depending on whether they block interaction with the software that initiated the dialog. The type of dialog box displayed is dependent upon the desired user interaction.

The simplest type of dialog box is the alert, which displays a message and may require an acknowledgment that the message has been read, usually by clicking &quot;OK&quot;, or a decision as to whether or not an action should proceed, by clicking &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;. Alerts are also used to display a &quot;termination notice&quot;—sometimes requesting confirmation that the notice has been read—in the event of either an intentional closing or unintentional closing (&quot;crash&quot;) of an application or the operating system. (, &quot;Gedit has encountered an error and must close.&quot;) Although this is a frequent interaction pattern for modal dialogs, it is also criticized by usability experts as being ineffective for its intended use, which is to protect against errors caused by destructive actions, and for which better alternatives exist.

An example of a dialog box is the about box found in many software programs, which usually displays the name of the program, its version number, and may also include copyright information.

== Modeless ==
&quot;Non-modal&quot; or &quot;modeless&quot; dialog boxes are used when the requested information is not essential to continue, and so the window can be left open while work continues elsewhere. A type of modeless dialog box is a toolbar which is either separate from the main application, or may be detached from the main application, and items in the toolbar can be used to select certain features or functions of the application.

In general, good software design calls for dialogs to be of this type where possible, since they do not force the user into a particular mode of operation. An example might be a dialog of settings for the current document, e.g. the background and text colors. The user can continue adding text to the main window whatever color it is, but can change it at any time using the dialog. (This isn&#x27;t meant to be an example of the &quot;best&quot; possible interface for this; often the same functionality may be accomplished by toolbar buttons on the application&#x27;s main window.)

== System modal ==
System modal dialog boxes prevent interaction with any other window onscreen and prevent users from switching to another application or performing any other action until the issue presented in the dialog box is addressed. System modal dialogs were more commonly used in the past on single tasking systems where only one application could be running at any time. One current example is the shutdown screen of current Windows versions. 

== Application modal ==
Modal dialog boxes temporarily halt the program: the user cannot continue without closing the dialog; the program may require some additional information before it can continue, or may simply wish to confirm that the user wants to proceed with a potentially dangerous course of action (confirmation dialog box). Usability practitioners generally regard modal dialogs as bad design-solutions, since they are prone to produce mode errors. Dangerous actions should be undoable wherever possible; a modal alert dialog that appears unexpectedly or which is dismissed automatically (because the user has developed a habit) will not protect from the dangerous action.

A modal dialog interrupts the main workflow. This effect has either been sought by the developer because it focuses on the completion of the task at hand or rejected because it prevents the user from changing to a different task when needed.

== Document modal ==
The concept of a &quot;document modal&quot; dialog has recently been used, most notably in macOS and Opera Browser. These dialogs block only that window until the user dismisses the dialog, permitting work in other windows to continue, even within the same application.
In macOS, prior to macOS Big Sur, dialogs appear to emanate from a slot in their parent window, and are shown with a reinforcing animation. This helps to let the user understand that the dialog is attached to the parent window, not just shown in front of it. In Big Sur and later, the parent window is greyed out, and the dialog appears on top of the middle of the parent window. No work can be done in the underlying document itself while the dialog is displayed, but the parent window can still be moved, re-sized, and minimized, and other windows can be brought in front so the user can work with them:

The same type of dialog box can be compared with the &quot;standard&quot; modal dialog boxes used in Windows and other operating systems.

Similarities include:
* the parent window is frozen when the dialog box opens, and one cannot continue to work with the underlying document in that window
* no work can be done with the underlying document in that window.
The differences are that
* the dialog box may open anywhere in the parent window
* depending on where the parent window is located, the dialog box may open virtually anywhere on screen
* the dialog box may be moved (in almost all cases), in some cases may be resizable, but usually cannot be minimized, and
* no changes to the parent window are possible (cannot be resized, moved or minimized) while the dialog box is open.

Both mechanisms have shortcomings:
* The Windows dialog box locks the parent window which can hide other windows the user may need to refer to while interacting with the dialog, though this may be mitigated since other windows are available through the task bar.
* The macOS dialog box blocks the parent window, preventing the user from referring to it while interacting with the dialog. This may require the user to close the dialog to access the necessary information, then re-open the dialog box to continue.

<text>Said Wilbert Musa (, born 19 March 1944) is a Belizean lawyer and politician. He was the third prime minister of Belize from 28 August 1998 to 8 February 2008.

==Early life and education==

Said Wilbert Musa was born in 1944 in San Ignacio in the Cayo District of what was then British Honduras. He was the fourth of eight children by Aurora Musa, née Gibbs, and Hamid Musa, a Palestinian immigrant from Al-Bireh. Hamid Musa was also involved in politics, running for the British Honduras Legislative Assembly as a National Party candidate in the 1957 general elections.

As a boy, Musa attended Saint Andrew&#x27;s Primary School in San Ignacio. He then attended high school at St Michael&#x27;s College in Belize City and later St John&#x27;s College Sixth Form. While living in Belize City, Said Musa aided his parents by selling tamales and other Belizean delicacies. After completing secondary school he then studied law at the University of Manchester in England, receiving an Honours Degree in Law in 1966, and then qualified as a barrister at Gray&#x27;s Inn. He returned to Belize the following year, serving as crown counsel and then going into private practice. Said Musa has significantly contributed to law in Belize by representing thousands of underprivileged and poor individuals who come into contact with the law.

==Political career==
Musa first came to notoriety in the late 1960s when he co-founded the Ad Hoc Committee for the Truth About Vietnam with Assad Shoman to protest the Vietnam War in British Honduras. On 1 January 1969 the group protested a showing of the American film &quot;The Green Berets&quot; in Belize City, which it characterized as pro-war propaganda.

Musa joined the People&#x27;s United Party (PUP) under George Cadle Price in 1970. He soon became a leader of the party&#x27;s socialist wing in 1974. He ran for the Belize House of Representatives for the first time in 1974 in the eastern Belize City-based Fort George constituency, but was narrowly defeated by United Democratic Party and Opposition Leader Dean Lindo by 46 votes. Musa was appointed to the Belize Senate for the ensuing term, until 1979.

Musa was successful in the next general election, held in 1979, winning the Fort George seat and defeating Lindo by a margin of 71 votes. Musa served as Attorney General and Minister for Economic Development in the 1979–1984 Price-led government. Musa also served on the committee that wrote the 1981 Constitution of Belize.

Musa defended Belize&#x27;s large national debt, mostly incurred in the 1980s, by saying Keynesian economics was being used: &quot;The economy was in a deep recession, the country was broke (due to hurricanes) therefore it had to get the private sector moving again. The country started a major expansionary program ... to pay for the program we took on a lot of debt.&quot;

In the 1984 election, Musa was defeated for re-election by Lindo, losing by a margin of 57 votes this time. He regained the Fort George seat in the 1989 election, defeating Lindo again by 449 votes. He has won the Fort George constituency in every election since. Under Price, Musa was Minister of Foreign Affairs and Education from 1989 to 1993.

As of July 2016 Musa has contested 10 consecutive general elections in Fort George and has continuously served as his party&#x27;s standard bearer in the same constituency for over 40 years, longer than anyone else in Belizean history. (Price was a standard bearer for 49 years, but in three different constituencies). He also trails only Price and Philip Goldson in total time served in the Belize House. Musa is the only current Area Representative to serve in the Belize House before the country&#x27;s full independence from Great Britain in September 1981.

===Leader of the People&#x27;s United Party and Prime Minister of Belize===

Musa was elected and took over leadership of the PUP upon Price&#x27;s retirement from party leadership in 1996, defeating Price&#x27;s longtime lieutenant Florencio Marin in the leadership election in 1996. Musa then led the PUP to landslide election victories in 1998 and 2003.

Musa led Belize to significant growth over his near-decade long term in office, but his popularity declined during his last years in office due in part to increasing public perception of corruption among his Cabinet and within his party. He was also accused of abandoning his previous socialist stances in favour of neoliberal policies as prime minister.

Outside of Belize Musa chaired several regional organisations, including CARICOM and the Central American Integration System (SICA).

Musa again led the PUP in the election held on 7 February 2008, but the PUP suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the UDP, led by Dean Barrow winning only six out of 31 seats. Musa himself was re-elected in the Fort George constituency. UDP leader Dean Barrow succeeded Musa and was sworn in as 4th prime minister of Belize by Governor-General of Belize, Colville Young on 8 February 2008.

===Post-leadership===

On the day of the 2008 election, Musa stated it would be his last election as PUP leader. After the PUP&#x27;s defeat, he congratulated Barrow. He considered the opposition&#x27;s focus on allegations of corruption and negativity from the media to be primary factors in the defeat.

On 13 February 2008, Musa announced that he was stepping down as party leader so that the PUP could &quot;renew itself from the top.&quot; The PUP held a convention on 30 March 2008 to select his successor, and Johnny Briceño was elected as PUP leader against Francis Fonseca.

A leadership election was held in October 2011 again where, Francis Fonseca defeated Briceno. Briceño was replaced by Francis Fonseca in October 2011. Five months later the Fonseca-led PUP suffered a narrow defeat to the UDP, winning 14 of 31 seats in the Belize House of Representatives. Musa was comfortably re-elected in his Fort George constituency and remains the senior member and shadow Senior Minister of the PUP caucus and in the Shadow Cabinet which was formed first in 2012 and then again in 2015. The current Shadow Cabinet of Francis Fonseca will be dissolved before the Next Belizean general election which is scheduled for 13 February 2020.

===2015 and beyond===

In 2015 the 71-year-old Musa was the subject of rumours of possible retirement from public life due to health concerns and a perceived negative impact on future PUP electoral prospects nationwide. However, Musa dismissed the rumours and stated his retirement from the Belize House was not imminent. In March 2015 Musa told Tropical Vision Limited that he would &quot;more than likely&quot; run for an eighth and final term in the 2015 election, which he won.

Although eligible to stand in an 11th consecutive general election, Musa stood down at the 2020 Belizean general election. The PUP nominated his son Henry Charles Usher to stand in his place in Fort George Constituency. He won the seat in the election.

== Family ==
Musa is married to Joan Musa. His son, Yasser Musa, is an artist, teacher, poet and entertainer in Belize and headed its arts council, the National Institute of Culture and History (NICH) under the PUP administration in addition to serving as chief of public relations for the PUP. Another son, Kareem, recently returned to Belize with a law degree and has taken on a number of prominent cases recently.

In what was considered an upset, Kareem Musa defeated Belize City mayor and UDP nominee Darrell Bradley for the House seat in the Caribbean Shores constituency in the November 2015 election, becoming the first Belizean area representative to simultaneously serve with his father.

Musa and his wife Joan also have three other sons, Mark Musa (a doctor), Said Musa Jr and David Musa. He also has seven children outside his marriage.

<doc id="217509" wikidata="Q152441" url="?curid=217509" title="Janusz Korczak">
<text>Janusz Korczak, the pen name of Henryk Goldszmit (22 July 1878 or 1879 – 7 August 1942), was a Polish Jewish pediatrician, educator, children&#x27;s author and pedagogue known as &quot;Pan Doktor&quot; (&quot;Mr. Doctor&quot;) or &quot;Stary Doktor&quot; (&quot;Old Doctor&quot;). He was an early children&#x27;s rights advocate, in 1919 drafting a children&#x27;s constitution.

After spending many years working as a principal of an orphanage in Warsaw, he moved in with his orphans when the orphanage was forced to move to the ghetto, despite pleas from friends to flee the country. He was executed when the entire population of the institution was sent to the Treblinka extermination camp during the Grossaktion Warschau of 1942.
==Early life and education==
Korczak was born in Warsaw in 1878. He was unsure of his birth date, which he attributed to his father&#x27;s failure to promptly acquire a birth certificate for him. His parents were Józef Goldszmit, a respected lawyer from a family of proponents of the haskalah, and Cecylia &quot;née&quot; Gębicka, daughter of a prominent Kalisz family. Born to a Jewish family, he was an agnostic in his later life. He did not believe in forcing religion on children. His father fell ill around 1890 and was admitted to a mental hospital, where he died six years later on 25 April 1896. Spacious apartments were given up on Miodowa street, then Świętojerska. As his family&#x27;s financial situation worsened, Henryk, while still attending the gymnasium (the current ), began to work as a tutor for other pupils. In 1896 he debuted on the literary scene with a satirical text on raising children, &quot;Węzeł gordyjski&quot; (&quot;The Gordian Knot&quot;).

In 1898, he used &quot;Janusz Korczak&quot; as a pen name in the Ignacy Jan Paderewski Literary Contest. The name originated from the book &quot;O Janaszu Korczaku i pięknej Miecznikównie&quot; by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski. In the 1890s he studied in the Flying University. During the years 1898–1904 Korczak studied medicine at the University of Warsaw and also wrote for several Polish language newspapers. After graduation, he became a pediatrician. In 1905−1912 Korczak worked at Bersohns and Baumans Children&#x27;s Hospital in Warsaw. During the Russo-Japanese War, in 1905–06 he served as a military doctor. Meanwhile, his book &quot;Child of the Drawing Room&quot; (&quot;Dziecko salonu&quot;) gained him some literary recognition. 


In 1907–08, Korczak went to study in Berlin. While working for the Orphans&#x27; Society in 1909, he met Stefania Wilczyńska, his future closest associate.

==Career==
In 1911–1912, he became a director of &quot;Dom Sierot&quot; in Warsaw, an orphanage of his own design for Jewish children. He hired Wilczyńska as his assistant. There he formed a kind of republic for children with its own small parliament, court, and a newspaper. He reduced his other duties as a doctor. Some of his descriptions of the summer camp for Jewish children in this period and subsequently were later published in his &quot;Fragmenty Utworów&quot; and have been translated into English.

During World War I, in 1914 Korczak became a military doctor in the Russian Army with the rank of lieutenant. He served again as a military doctor in the Polish Army with the rank of major during the Polish-Soviet War, but after a brief stint in Łódź was assigned to Warsaw. 
After the war, he continued his practice in Warsaw. In his 1919 book &quot;How to Love a Child&quot; he defined three basic rights of the child: the right of today, the right of the child over its own death, and the right of the child to be what it wants to be.

===Sovereign Poland===
In 1926, Korczak arranged for the children of the &quot;Dom Sierot&quot; (Orphan House) to begin their own newspaper, the &quot;Mały Przegląd&quot; (&quot;Little Review&quot;), as a weekly attachment to the daily Polish-Jewish newspaper &quot;Nasz Przegląd&quot; (&quot;Our Review&quot;). In these years, his secretary was the noted Polish novelist Igor Newerly. His orphanage was supported by the CENTOS Polish-Jewish charity.
During the 1930s, he had his own radio program, where he promoted and popularized the rights of children. In 1933, he was awarded the Silver Cross of the Polonia Restituta. Between 1934 and 1936, Korczak travelled every year to Mandate Palestine and visited its kibbutzim. Additionally, it spurred his estrangement with the non-Jewish orphanage for which he had also been working. A letter he wrote indicates that he had some intentions to move to Palestine, but in the end, he felt he could not leave his children behind. He stayed in Poland and continued his role as headmaster.

===The Holocaust===


In 1939, when World War II erupted, Korczak volunteered for duty in the Polish Army but was refused due to his age. He witnessed the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; takeover of Warsaw. When the Germans created the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940, his orphanage was forced to move from its building, &quot;Dom Sierot&quot; at Krochmalna 92, to the ghetto (first to Chłodna 33 and later to Sienna 16 / Śliska 9). Korczak moved in with them. In July, Janusz Korczak decided that the children in the orphanage should put on Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s play &quot;The Post Office&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
On 5 or 6 August 1942, German soldiers came to collect the 192 orphans (there is some debate about the actual number: it may have been 196) and about one dozen staff members to transport them to the Treblinka extermination camp. Korczak had been offered sanctuary on the &quot;Aryan side&quot; by the Polish underground organization Żegota, but turned it down repeatedly, saying that he could not abandon his children. On 5 August, he again refused offers of sanctuary, insisting that he would go with the children, asserting his belief: &quot;You do not leave a sick child in the night, and you do not leave children at a time like this&quot;.

The children were dressed in their best clothes, and each carried a blue knapsack and a favorite book or toy. Joshua Perle, an eyewitness whose wartime writings were saved in the Ringelblum Archive, described the procession of Korczak and the children through the ghetto to the &quot;Umschlagplatz&quot; (deportation point to the death camps):

According to eyewitnesses, when the group of orphans finally reached the &quot;Umschlagplatz&quot;, an SS officer recognized Korczak as the author of one of his favorite children&#x27;s books and offered to help him escape. In another version, the officer was acting officially, as the Nazi authorities had in mind some kind of &quot;special treatment&quot; for Korczak (some prominent Jews with international reputations were sent to Theresienstadt). Whatever the offer, Korczak once again refused. He boarded the trains with the children, around 200 of them, and some 12 staff including Stefania Wilczyńska, and was never heard from again. Korczak&#x27;s evacuation from the ghetto is also mentioned in Władysław Szpilman&#x27;s book &quot;The Pianist&quot;:

Korczak was a lifelong bachelor and had no biological children of his own.

==Posthumous==
Sometime after, there were rumours that the trains had been diverted and that Korczak and the children had survived. There was, however, no basis to these stories. Most likely, Korczak, along with Wilczyńska and most of the children, was murdered in a gas chamber after arriving at Treblinka. 

A separate account of Korczak&#x27;s departure is given in Mary Berg&#x27;s Warsaw Ghetto diary:

==Writings==
Korczak&#x27;s best known writing is his fiction and pedagogy, and his most popular works have been widely translated. His main pedagogical texts have been translated into English, but of his fiction, , only two of his novels have been translated into English: &quot;King Matt the First&quot; and &quot;Kaytek the Wizard.&quot;

As the date of Korczak&#x27;s death was not officially established, his date of death for legal purposes was established in 1954 by a Polish court as 9 May 1946, a standard ruling for people whose death date was not documented but in all likelihood occurred during World War II. The copyright to all works by Korczak was subsequently acquired by The Polish Book Institute (Instytut Książki), a cultural institution and publishing house affiliated with the Polish government. In 2012 the institute&#x27;s rights were challenged by the Modern Poland Foundation, whose goal was to establish by court trial that Korczak died in 1942 so that Korczak&#x27;s works would be available in the public domain as of 1 January 2013. The foundation won the case in 2015 and subsequently started to digitise Korczak&#x27;s works and release them as public domain e-books.

Korczak&#x27;s overall literary oeuvre covers the period 1896 to 8 August 1942. It comprises works for both children and adults and includes literary pieces, social journalism, articles and pedagogical essays, together with some scraps of unpublished work, totalling over twenty books, over 1,400 texts published in around 100 publications, and around 300 texts in manuscript or typescript form. A complete edition of his works is planned for 2012.

===Children&#x27;s books===
Korczak often employed the form of a fairy tale in order to prepare his young readers for the dilemmas and difficulties of real adult life, and the need to make responsible decisions.

In the 1923 &quot;King Matt the First&quot; (&quot;Król Maciuś Pierwszy&quot;) and its sequel &quot;King Matt on the Desert Island&quot; (&quot;Król Maciuś na wyspie bezludnej&quot;) Korczak depicted a child prince who is catapulted to the throne by the sudden death of his father, and who must learn from various mistakes:

He tries to read and answer all his mail by himself and finds that the volume is too much and he needs to rely on secretaries; he is exasperated with his ministers and has them arrested, but soon realises that he does not know enough to govern by himself, and is forced to release the ministers and institute constitutional monarchy; when a war breaks out he does not accept being shut up in his palace, but slips away and joins up, pretending to be a peasant boy - and narrowly avoids becoming a POW; he takes the offer of a friendly journalist to publish for him a &quot;royal paper&quot; -and finds much later that he gets carefully edited news and that the journalist is covering up the gross corruption of the young king&#x27;s best friend; he tries to organise the children of all the world to hold processions and demand their rights – and ends up antagonising other kings; he falls in love with a black African princess and outrages racist opinion (by modern standards, however, Korczak&#x27;s depiction of black people is itself not completely free of stereotypes which were current at the time of writing); finally, he is overthrown by the invasion of three foreign armies and exiled to a desert island, where he must come to terms with reality – and finally does.

In 2012, another book by Korczak was translated into English. &quot;Kajtuś the Wizard&quot; (&quot;Kajtuś czarodziej&quot;) (1933) anticipated Harry Potter in depicting a schoolboy who gains magic powers, and it was very popular during the 1930s, both in Polish and in translation to several other languages. Kajtuś has, however, a far more difficult path than Harry Potter: he has no Hogwarts-type School of Magic where he could be taught by expert mages, but must learn to use and control his powers all by himself - and most importantly, to learn his limitations.

Korczak&#x27;s &quot;The Persistent Boy&quot; was a biography of the French scientist Louis Pasteur, adapted for children - as stated in the preface - from a 685-page French biography that Korczak read. The book clearly aims to portray Pasteur as a role model for the child reader. A considerable part of the book is devoted to Pasteur&#x27;s childhood and boyhood, and his relations with parents, teachers and schoolmates. It is emphasised that Pasteur, destined for world-wide fame, started from inauspicious beginnings - born to poor working-class parents in an obscure French provincial town and attending a far from high-quality school. There, he was far from a star pupil, his marks often falling below average. As repeatedly emphasised by Korczak, Pasteur&#x27;s achievements, both in childhood and in later academic and scientific career, were mainly due to persistence (as hinted in the title), a relentless and eventually successful effort to overcome his limitations and early failures.

===Pedagogical books===
In his pedagogical works, Korczak shares much of his experience of dealing with difficult children. Korczak&#x27;s ideas were further developed by many other pedagogues such as Simon Soloveychik and Erich Dauzenroth.

===Thoughts on corporal punishment===
Korczak spoke against corporal punishment of children at a time when such treatment was considered a parental entitlement or even a duty. In &quot;The Child&#x27;s Right to Respect&quot; (1929), he wrote,

== Legacy==
Korczak is commemorated in a number of monuments and plaques in Poland, mainly in Warsaw. The best known of them is the cenotaph located at the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery, which serves as his symbolic grave. It is a monumental sculpture of Korczak leading his children to the trains. Created originally by Mieczysław Smorczewski in 1982, the monument was recast in bronze in 2002. The original was re-erected at the boarding school for children with special needs in Borzęciczki, which is named after Janusz Korczak.

However, the Janusz Korczak Monument in Warsaw set up in the Świętokrzyski Park in 2006 is not only the largest but also, due to its very convenient location, the most frequently visited by school trips and tourists monument commemorating Korczak. Every year, around June 1, on Children&#x27;s Day, trips from Warsaw schools go to the monument.

Due to decommunization policies, the Nikolay Bauman street in Kyiv, Ukraine was renamed after Korczak in 2016.

A minor planet, 2163 Korczak, is named after him.

In 2023, the Janusz Korczak hospitalization unit in the Department of General Pediatrics and Pediatric Infectious Diseases of the Necker-Enfants Malades hospital at the Assistance-Publique Hôpitaux de Paris in France was created.

==Cultural references==

In addition to theater, opera, TV, and film adaptations of his works, such as &quot;King Matt the First&quot; and &quot;Kaytek the Wizard,&quot; there have been a number of works about Korczak, inspired by him, or featuring him as a character.

<text>In the fictional universe of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, the Space Marines, also known as the Adeptus Astartes, are superhuman warrior-monks who fight for the Imperium of Man. They wear mechanised suits of armour and have modified genomes that grant them superhuman strength and endurance. Some Space Marines have betrayed the Imperium and serve the Gods of Chaos, and are thus known as Chaos Space Marines or Heretic Astartes.

&quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; is a miniature wargame, where Space Marines are one of the playable factions that can be used. They are the most well-known and popular characters in &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, always featuring in the artwork and starter set of each edition of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; and other spin-off games such as &quot;Space Hulk&quot; and &quot;Epic&quot; (excluding the 2nd edition &quot;Titan Legions&quot;), and simpler derivative games such as &quot;Space Crusade&quot;. Likewise, they are the most popular protagonists in spin-off fiction such as novels and video games.

==Publication history==
Space Marines were first introduced in &quot;War hammer 40,000: Rogue Trader&quot; (1987) by Rick Priestley, which was the first edition of the tabletop game.

The book &quot;Realm of Chaos: The Lost and the Damned&quot; (Rick Priestley and Bryan Ansell, 1990) was the first book from Games Workshop to give a backstory for the Space Marines. It introduced the original 20 Space Marine Legions as well as their Primarchs. It also first described the Horus Heresy, the civil war of the 30th millennium in which nine of the Legions converted to the worship of the Chaos Gods and rebelled against the Emperor.

Two of the original 20 Legions and their respective Primarchs are not named and are described as &quot;redacted&quot; from the records of the Imperium. Rick Priestley explained that this was to illustrate the Imperium&#x27;s practice of erasing embarrassing or incriminating events and figures from Imperial records (&quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;).

==Tabletop games==
The following tabletop games from Games Workshop use miniature models of Space Marines:

*&quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;
*&quot;Kill Team&quot;
*&quot;The Horus Heresy&quot;
*&quot;Space Hulk&quot; (discontinued)
*&quot;Space Crusade&quot; (discontinued)
*&quot;Epic: Armageddon&quot; (discontinued)
*&quot;Legions Imperialis&quot;

===&quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;===
As far as non-hero infantry go, Space Marines are rather powerful and have a high point cost. A Space Marine Intercessor is worth 20 points, whereas a normal human soldier is worth only 4 points. Consequently, an army based on Space Marines will be relatively small compared to, say, a Tyranid army of equal strength. This means that a player can assemble a functional army for relatively little money and effort. In terms of playing style, a Space Marine army neither excels nor fails at any particular tactic, though certain Chapters do have variant rules (e.g. the Salamanders specialise in flamethrowers). Individual units are typically not strongly specialised and can roughly substitute in other roles, meaning most mistakes and setbacks are easy to compensate for. Their tough armour and generally unspecialised weaponry means that they do not have to be maneuvered as carefully as units of other armies (such as the powerful but frail Aeldari). These qualities make them ideal for beginners, and may help them succeed more often in their early gameplay stages.

===&quot;Kill Team&quot;===
Much like in &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, Space Marine teams in &quot;Kill Team&quot; tend to be small teams of powerful warriors. For instance, a Space Marine team will consist of six warriors, whereas an Imperial Guard team will consist of 10 to 14 warriors.

===&quot;The Horus Heresy&quot;===

Space Marines in The Horus Heresy are the most widely-featured faction, with the original 18 Space Marine Legions represented in a great variety of standard Legion units (accessible to virtually everyone), supplemented by unique specialty Legion rules and units. In comparison to Warhammer 40,000, Horus Heresy-era units tend to be larger, to represent the epic extent of the conflict. Players are also required to declare their allegiance, whether they are loyal to the Emperor of Mankind (Loyalist), to the Warmaster Horus (Traitor), or occasionally, something else (Blackshields + Shattered Legions). 

Each Space Marine unit&#x27;s combat capabilities and resiliency vary widely in The Horus Heresy. Basic Tactical Marines tend to be more expendable, with a very low cost and modest weapons and armour, while Elite units, such as the Emperor&#x27;s Children Palatine Blades, Ultramarines&#x27; Invictarus Suzerains, or Sons of Horus Justaerin tend to be very resilient and powerful (but consequently more expensive) compared to their more mundane counterparts. Horus Heresy Space Marine units also tend to be less general in tactical function, with units such as Tactical Support Squads and Recon Squads dedicated to virtually a single purpose on the battlefield, compared to the more mixed units of the Warhammer 40,000 era.

===&quot;Space Hulk&quot;===
In &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, Space Marines in Terminator armour move through narrow corridors fending off attacks by alien monsters known as &quot;genestealers&quot;. Genestealers are faster and stronger than Space Marines but limited to melee attacks only, whereas the Space Marines possess both ranged and melee weapons.

===&quot;Legions Imperialis&quot;===
In &quot;Legions Imperialis&quot;, Space Marines are one of two factions you can play as. you can paint them as either loyalist or traitor. This is at a 28 milimeter scale. You can supplement this force with titan legios.

==Miniature design==
The archetypal Space Marines in game lore and miniature variety don protective exosuits known as Power Armour. Bob Naismith created the initial design of these Space Marines for the first edition, with the helmet having a gas mask with an airtube connected to the snout, and this was used for a 1991 limited release model. However designers at Games Workshop felt that this concept was too banal and derivative, and they made a conscious decision to give the Space Marine, and &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; in general, a &quot;medieval-in-space&quot; aesthetic, so the exosuit was redesigned to resemble medieval plate armour. The helmet was modified to resemble a medieval &quot;hounskull&quot; helmet with prominent conical snouts, popularly known as the &quot;beaky&quot; helmet (in-universe it is called Mark VI Corvus Power Armour). Jes Goodwin redesigned the Power Armour for the second edition (1993), where the helmet&#x27;s beak was replaced by a flat grill, and the chestplate features a winged skull (known in lore as Mark VII Aquila Power Armour); this armour design would be continue to be used for the third through to the seventh editions. The differences in the various Marks of Power Armour are cosmetic and have the same attributes for in-game purposes, and Space Marines with these types of armour are collectively known as the &#x27;Firstborn&#x27; since the eighth edition onward. 

With the eighth edition (2017), Games Workshop introduced the Primaris Space Marine models with a new type of Power Armour (known in lore as Mark X Power Armour). The Primaris Marines are taller and have a new helmet design compared to existing Marines in earlier types of Power Armour (retroactively known as the &#x27;Firstborn&#x27;). In-game, Primaris Marines are distinct units with different attributes compared to Firstborn Marines (all Firstborn marines are considered equivalent units regardless of the edition of their Power Armour design); also Primaris Marines have their own accompanying vehicles as they are not compatible with those of the Firstborn. Firstborn and Primaris miniatures were sold alongside each other between 2017 and 2023 for the eighth and ninth editions, however many Firstborn sets have been discontinued coinciding with the release of the tenth edition. This decision by Games Workshop to retire Firstborn miniatures via planned obsolescence is controversial, as Primaris Marine units have better in-game abilities than their Firstborn counterparts for a given points cost, and longtime players who have collected large Firstborn armies have complained that they are being forced to purchase Primaris miniatures in order to remain competitive at official Games Workshop tournaments.

Space Marine Terminators first appeared in 1989 for the spin-off board game &quot;Space Hulk&quot; and were eventually included in army lists for the battlefield &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; game. Compared to regular Marines in Power Armour, Terminators don a bulkier kind of armour that provides heavier protection and carry stronger weapons (some of which are incorporated as part of the Terminator suit), making Terminators particularly suited to close quarter battle environments such as boarding enemy spaceships. The Terminators included in the &quot;Space Hulk&quot; sets have always been plastic, however for &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; 2nd edition only metal Terminator miniatures were initially offered, until a plastic Terminators set (same as included for the &quot;Space Hulk&quot; 2nd edition box set) was made available for sale in July 1997. For subsequent editions of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, all Terminator miniatures have been offered in plastic as Games Workshop transitioned away from metal miniatures. The 3rd edition featured unique plastic Terminators designed specifically for Space Hulk, instead of being shared with the sets for the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000. The current style of the Terminator (known in-game as Indomitus Pattern Terminator Armour) debuted in 1989 and has been retained through successive editions of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, although the latest iteration of Terminators for the 10th edition &quot;Leviathan&quot; have been enlarged to keep pace with the Primaris Marines.

Space Marine Scouts initially appeared in 1989, and then received a significant overhaul in 1997 which was one year before the release of the third edition, and the latter design has continued through to the seventh edition. Marine Scouts wear Scout Armour, which is not a full exosuit and provides lesser protection compared to the Marines&#x27; Power Armour and Terminator Armour, however that facilitates the Scouts&#x27; role of infiltration and skirmishing.

Simplified miniatures of Space Marines in Power Armour, Space Marine Scouts, and Space Marine Terminators are found in the board games &quot;Space Crusade&quot; and &quot;Tyranid Attack&quot;.

The Space Marine Dreadnought, often confused as an extra-large fighting suit or robot, is actually a powerful cyborg battle walker with a mortally wounded Marine entombed permanently inside the sarcophagus. The second iteration of the Dreadnought (known in lore as the Castraferrum Pattern Mark V Dreadnought) has been produced since 1993, initially in metal for the 2nd edition and plastic for subsequent editions of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, but has been discontinued as of 2023 as part of the winding down of the Firstborn Marine miniatures. The third iteration of Dreadnought (Redemptor Dreadnought) made its debut in the 8th edition as part of the Primaris Marine model range.

The Space Marine&#x27;s iconic main battle tank and transport, the Land Raider, is based upon the British Mark series of tanks in World War One with its rhomboidal hull and sponson armament. For &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; all variants been produced as plastic kits, the first iteration (Mark I) appeared in an 1987 Rogue Trader book, while the second iternation (Mark III) was released in 1998 and this design continues to be available as of 2023.

==Fictional characteristics==
A Space Marine is stronger, tougher, heavier and taller than a normal human due to genetic augmentation. Space Marines are relatively few in number, because their production cannot be scaled up, and so make up only a small minority of the Imperium&#x27;s armed forces. A Space Marine is created by implanting &quot;gene-seed&quot; in a human recruit, which transforms them into superhuman soldiers by severely altering their organism. Gene-seed cannot be mass-produced in factories. New gene-seed grows within the bodies of the Space Marines themselves and is periodically harvested by surgery to implant in new recruits. Fully developed Space Marines have two functioning hearts, three lungs and an additional kidney in order to sustain their improved metabolism, together with a series of other genetically-engineered organs that serve various purposes. Most chapters prefer to recruit boys in early adolescence, as younger recruits suffer fewer complications in the transformation process; but adults can be recruited up to middle age. Space Marines also cannot procreate sexually as humans normally do as their genetic modifications make them sterile. 

Space Marines wear suits of mechanised armour, which has a medieval aesthetic where heraldry is often brightly painted and ornately decorated (camouflage, while still useful in warfare of the far future, offers little to no benefit for Astartes who are best used as shock troops and in direct assaults), with several types depending on their rank/experience and combat roles. New recruits start with Scout Armour (known as &quot;Space Marine Scouts&quot;) to prove themselves in infiltration/skirmish roles. Those that successfully pass all tests become full-fledged Marines, earning the right to wear a suit of Power Armour which is environmentally sealed and cybernetically enhanced, and which provides a balance of resistance against most anti-infantry firepower while retaining quick reflexes making them flexible for numerous frontline situations. The typical weapon of the Space Marine is the boltgun, a form of gyrojet weapon but with a recoil strong enough that normal humans cannot normally wield one, while squad leaders and heroes have access to rare weapons such as the power sword which are treasured as relics. The most experienced veterans who are named to their Chapter&#x27;s First Company may don the powerful but rare Terminator Armour (these are known as &quot;Terminators&quot;), which is nearly impervious to all but the strongest attacks from enemy troops. Terminators also carry more powerful weaponry (some of which are incorporated as part of the Terminator suit), such as the power fist (or power glove) which is an oversized gauntlet that is very powerful in melee (although slow to strike), which making them suited to close quarter battle environments such as boarding enemy spaceships. However, Terminators are slower and there are limited means to deploy them upon the battlefield (either being transported in the Land Raider main battle tank/infantry fighting vehicle, or being teleported). The Dreadnought, often confused as an extra-large fighting suit or robot, is actually a powerful cyborg battle walker with a mortally wounded Marine entombed permanently inside the sarcophagus. Space Marines can live for centuries and thereby develop vast combat experience, with veterans (Terminators and Dreadnoughts) being the most highly-honoured among their peers.

Those Space Marines who are loyal to the Imperium are organised into &quot;Chapters&quot;, each usually containing about a thousand Space Marines, led by a Chapter Master. Each Chapter is an autonomous organization and controls a fiefdom from which it raises funds and recruits. Each Space Marine Chapter is a fully integrated military force, with space-faring vessels emphasizing planetary landing/assault (as opposed to Imperial Navy warships for space combat), while Marine vehicles emphasis rapid mobility for rapid deployment (as opposed to the Imperial Guards&#x27; equivalents which are typically designed with heavy firepower and/or thick armour at the cost of speed). The Space Marines themselves are dedicated shock troops, while ordinary human serfs serve in support roles such as crewing their ships and maintaining their equipment. A Chapter&#x27;s headquarters is called the &quot;fortress-monastery&quot;. Each Chapter bears a name, such as &quot;the Iron Hands&quot; and &quot;the Dark Angels&quot;, and a distinctive paint scheme for their armour (e.g. the White Scars paint their armour white). A Space Marine&#x27;s commitment to his Chapter is lifelong and they rarely have any kind of personal life outside the Chapter (with the exception of the Salamanders chapter). Space Marines are conditioned to have a fanatical reverence for the Emperor of Mankind.

In the 8th edition of Warhammer 40,000, which was released in 2017, a new type of Space Marine was introduced called Primaris Space Marines. These Space Marines don a new set of Power Armour while also being larger and more resilient than their predecessors (known retroactively as Firstborn Space Marines). The creator of the Codex Astartes, Roboute Guilliman, who was also the Primarch (genetic &quot;father&quot;) of the original Ultramarines Legion, had allowed the creation of a new generation of Space Marines after the events of the Horus Heresy. When Guilliman was resurrected ten thousand years later, Legions of Primaris were introduced into the Imperial forces to augment the existing Chapters and create new ones. Primaris Marines are more resilient to the unique gene defects possessed by their Chapters, but not immune to them. As of the 10th edition, recently select Primaris Space Marine chapters has fallen to Chaos. Additionally, Firstborn Space Marines can undergo the procedure (called the Rubicon Primaris) to be transformed into Primaris Marines.

===Chaos Space Marines===
The Emperor of Mankind created the Space Marines around the time he founded the Imperium and used them to spearhead his conquest of the galaxy. A few centuries into this campaign, fully half of the Space Marine Legions converted to the worship of Chaos and rebelled against the Emperor. The insurrection was eventually defeated and the Traitor Legions fled Imperial space, but only after catastrophic damage was done to the Imperium. Because Space Marines age at a much slower rate than normal humans, and most of the rebels dwell in realms of Chaos that exist outside the normal flow of time, many of the Chaos Space Marines that fled after the Heresy are alive and continue to wage war against the Imperium over ten thousand years later. Not all Chaos Space Marines worship the forces of Chaos, but all desire to overthrow the Imperium, led by whom they call the “False Emperor.”

Chaos Space Marines are organised into large &quot;Legions&quot; and smaller warbands that likewise have colourful names (e.g. &quot;the World Eaters&quot; and &quot;the Night Lords&quot;). Some Chaos Space Marines dedicate themselves to a specific Chaos God, which affects their personalities and physiologies in specific and extreme ways. For instance, Chaos Space Marines devoted to Nurgle have grotesque, bloated bodies riddled with disease, yet are paradoxically very resilient in battle; whereas Chaos Space Marines devoted to Slaanesh are obsessed with pleasure and beauty, but are hideously deformed and push physical and mental sensation to limits that a normal human would consider to be sheer torture. Chaos Space Marines are far more brutal and cruel than their Loyalist counterparts, often killing and torturing people for the mere sake of it, much to the delight of their Chaos masters. A few of the Chaos Space Marines do not engage in Chaos worship, and instead engage in selfish pursuits such as piracy or establishing their own petty kingdoms.

Although Chaos Space Marines are just as likely to fight amongst themselves as they are against loyalist forces, on occasion they will unite and form a “Black Crusade,” with the explicit purpose of defeating the Imperium and slaying the &quot;False Emperor&quot; once and for all. None of these Black Crusades have yet achieved their main goal, but have managed to cause great damage in Imperial space and allowed Chaos forces to steal valuable technology and information from the Imperium.

== Organization ==

=== Rank structure ===
The Space Marines have a Rank system, like many modern and past Militaries. There are a total of six ranks. They are: Battle Brother, a rank similar to the real-world Private or Private First Class ranks. These are the rank-and-file soldiers of the Space Marines. Above Battle Brothers are Sergeants in command of a Squad; they are the lowest Command rank. Third is the veteran rank, followed by the Veteran Sergeant rank. These officers are in command of a veteran squad. Fifth is the Lieutenant rank, serving as second-in-command of a Company. The penultimate rank is Captain, who are the Commanding Officers of Companies. Finally, there is the rank of Chapter Master, similar to a General in the real-world US Armed Forces ranks. They command a whole Chapter.
Space Marines are featured in &quot;&quot; (2010).

=== Unit structure ===
The Space Marines, like present-day militaries, have a unit structure. The highest level is the Chapter, commanded by the Chapter Master. While individual chapters vary, a standard Chapter has one thousand Space Marines at maximum strength. Inside the Chapter are ten Companies, each one hundred strong. The Company is led by a Captain. Inside a Company, there are ten Squads. These are commanded by a Sergeant, and have nine Marines plus the Sergeant.

==Books==

Space Marines are featured in numerous Science-fantasy novels, predominantly published by Black Library, a division of Games Workshop.

==Trademark controversy==

In December 2012, Games Workshop claimed that any use of the phrase &quot;Space Marine&quot; on content other than their own infringed on their trademark of the term and requested that online retailer Amazon remove the e-book &quot;Spots the Space Marine&quot; by M.C.A. Hogarth. The row received a lot of publicity during February 2013, with authors such as Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross, and John Scalzi supporting Hogarth. Amazon restored the e-book for sale.

<text>Sukarno (6 June 1901 – 21 June 1970) was an Indonesian statesman, orator, revolutionary, and nationalist who was the first president of Indonesia, serving from 1945 to 1967.

Sukarno was the leader of the Indonesian struggle for independence from the Dutch colonialists. He was a prominent leader of Indonesia&#x27;s nationalist movement during the colonial period and spent over a decade under Dutch detention until released by the invading Japanese forces in World War II. Sukarno and his fellow nationalists collaborated to garner support for the Japanese war effort from the population, in exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas. Upon Japanese surrender, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, and Sukarno was appointed president. He led the Indonesian resistance to Dutch re-colonisation efforts via diplomatic and military means until the Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence in 1949. As a result, he was given the title &quot;Father of Proclamation.&quot;

After a chaotic period of parliamentary democracy, Sukarno established an autocratic system called &quot;Guided Democracy&quot; in 1959 that successfully ended the instability and rebellions in the country. In the early 1960s Sukarno embarked on a series of aggressive foreign policies under the rubric of anti-imperialism and personally championed the Non-Aligned Movement. These developments led to increasing friction with the West and closer relations with the USSR. After the events surrounding the 30 September Movement of 1965, the military general Suharto largely took control of the country in a Western-backed military overthrow of the Sukarno-led government. This was followed by repression of real and perceived leftists, including executions of Communist party members and suspected sympathisers in several massacres with support from the CIA and British intelligence services, resulting in an estimated 500,000 to over 1,000,000 deaths. In 1967, Suharto officially assumed the presidency, replacing Sukarno, who remained under house arrest until his death in 1970.

His eldest daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri, who was born during her father&#x27;s rule in 1947, later served as the fifth president of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004.

==Name==
The name &quot;Sukarno&quot; comes from the mythological chief hero of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Karna. The spelling &quot;Soekarno&quot;, based on Dutch orthography, is still in frequent use, mainly because he signed his name in the old spelling. Sukarno himself insisted on a &quot;u&quot; in writing, not &quot;oe,&quot; but said that he had been told in school to use the Dutch style, and that after 50 years, it was too difficult to change his signature, so he still signed with an &quot;oe.&quot; Official Indonesian presidential decrees from the period 1947–1968, however, printed his name using the 1947 spelling. The Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, which serves the area near Indonesia&#x27;s capital, Jakarta, still uses the Dutch spelling.

Indonesians also remember him as Bung Karno (Brother/Comrade Karno) or Pak Karno (&quot;Mr. Karno&quot;). Like many Javanese people, he had only one name.

He is sometimes referred to in foreign accounts as Achmed Sukarno, or some variation thereof. A source from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed that &quot;Achmed&quot; (later, written as &quot;Ahmad&quot; or &quot;Ahmed&quot; by Arab states and other foreign state press) was coined by M. Zein Hassan, an Indonesian student at Al-Azhar University and later a member of the staff at the Ministry, to establish Sukarno&#x27;s identity as a Muslim to the Egyptian press after a brief controversy at that time in Egypt alleging Sukarno&#x27;s name was &quot;not Muslim enough.&quot; After the use of the name &quot;Achmed&quot; began, Muslim and Arab states freely supported Sukarno. Thus, in correspondence with the Middle East, Sukarno always signed his name as &quot;Achmed Sukarno.&quot;

==Early life and family==

The son of a Muslim Javanese primary school teacher, an aristocrat named who hailed from Grobogan, Central Java, and his Hindu Balinese wife from the Brahmin caste named from Buleleng, Bali, Sukarno was born in Surabaya, East Java, in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), where his father had been sent following an application for a transfer to Java. He was originally named Kusno Sosrodihardjo. Following Javanese custom, he was renamed after surviving a childhood illness.

==Education==
After graduating from a native primary school in 1912, he was sent to the &quot;Europeesche Lagere School&quot; (a Dutch primary school) in Mojokerto. Subsequently, in 1916, Sukarno went to a &quot;Hogere Burgerschool&quot; (a Dutch-type higher-level secondary school) in Surabaya, where he met Tjokroaminoto, a nationalist and founder of Sarekat Islam. In 1920, Sukarno married Tjokroaminoto&#x27;s daughter Siti Oetari. In 1921, he began to study civil engineering (with a focus on architecture) at the &quot;Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng&quot; (Bandoeng Institute of Technology), where he obtained an Ingenieur degree (abbreviated as &quot;Ir.&quot;, a Dutch-type engineer&#x27;s degree) in 1926. During his study in Bandung, Sukarno became romantically involved with , the wife of Sanoesi, the owner of the boarding house where he lived as a student. Inggit was 13 years older than Sukarno. In March 1923, Sukarno divorced Siti Oetari to marry Inggit (who also divorced her husband Sanoesi). Sukarno later divorced Inggit and married Fatmawati.

Atypically even among the country&#x27;s small educated elite, Sukarno was fluent in several languages. In addition to the Javanese language of his childhood, he was a master of Sundanese, Balinese and Indonesian, and was especially strong in Dutch. He was also quite comfortable in German, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, all of which were taught at his HBS. He was helped by his photographic memory and precocious mind.

In his studies, Sukarno was &quot;intensely modern&quot;, both in architecture and in politics. He despised both the traditional Javanese feudalism, which he considered &quot;backward&quot; and to blame for the fall of the country under Dutch occupation and exploitation, and the imperialism practised by Western countries, which he termed as &quot;exploitation of humans by other humans&quot; (). He blamed this for the deep poverty and low levels of education of Indonesian people under the Dutch. To promote nationalistic pride amongst Indonesians, Sukarno interpreted these ideas in his dress, in his urban planning for the capital (eventually Jakarta), and in his socialist politics, though he did not extend his taste for modern art to pop music; he had the Indonesian musical group Koes Bersaudara imprisoned for their allegedly decadent lyrics despite his reputation for womanising. For Sukarno, modernity was blind to race, neat and elegant in style, and anti-imperialist.

==Architectural career==
After graduation in 1926, Sukarno and his university friend Anwari established the architectural firm Soekarno &amp; Anwari in Bandung, which provided planning and contractor services. Among Sukarno&#x27;s architectural works are the renovated building of the Preanger Hotel (1929), where he acted as assistant to famous Dutch architect Charles Prosper Wolff Schoemaker. Sukarno also designed many private houses on today&#x27;s Jalan Gatot Subroto, Jalan Palasari, and Jalan Dewi Sartika in Bandung.

Later on, as president, Sukarno remained engaged in architecture, designing the Proclamation Monument and adjacent &quot;Gedung Pola&quot; in Jakarta; the Youth Monument (&quot;Tugu Muda&quot;) in Semarang; the Alun-alun Monument in Malang; the Heroes&#x27; Monument in Surabaya; and also the new city of Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan. Sukarno was also deeply involved in building the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex which includes him proposing the design for the roof of its main stadium.

==Early struggle==

Sukarno was first exposed to nationalist ideas while living under Tjokroaminoto. Later, while a student in Bandung, he immersed himself in European, American, nationalist, communist, and religious political philosophy, eventually developing his own political ideology of Indonesian-style socialist self-sufficiency. He began styling his ideas as Marhaenism, named after Marhaen, an Indonesian peasant he met in the southern Bandung area, who owned his little plot of land and worked on it himself, producing sufficient income to support his family. In university, Sukarno began organizing a study club for Indonesian students, the &quot;Algemeene Studieclub&quot;, in opposition to the established student clubs dominated by Dutch students.

===Involvement in the Indonesian National Party===

On 4 July 1927, Sukarno with his friends from the &quot;Algemeene Studieclub&quot; established a pro-independence party, the Indonesian National Party (PNI), of which Sukarno was elected the first leader. The party advocated independence for Indonesia, and opposed imperialism and capitalism because it opined that both systems worsened the life of Indonesian people. The party also advocated secularism and unity amongst the many different ethnicities in the Dutch East Indies, to establish a united Indonesia. Sukarno also hoped that Japan would commence a war against the western powers and that Indonesia could then gain its independence with Japan&#x27;s aid. Coming soon after the disintegration of Sarekat Islam in the early 1920s and the crushing of the Indonesian Communist Party after its failed rebellion of 1926, the PNI began to attract a large number of followers, particularly among the new university-educated youths eager for broader freedoms and opportunities denied to them in the racist and constrictive political system of Dutch colonialism.

===Arrest, trial, and imprisonment===
====Arrest and trial====

PNI activities came to the attention of the colonial government, and Sukarno&#x27;s speeches and meetings were often infiltrated and disrupted by agents of the colonial secret police (&quot;Politieke Inlichtingendienst&quot;). Eventually, Sukarno and other key PNI leaders were arrested on 29 December 1929 by Dutch colonial authorities in a series of raids throughout Java. Sukarno himself was arrested while on a visit to Yogyakarta. During his trial at the Bandung &quot;Landraad&quot; courthouse from August to December 1930, Sukarno made a series of long political speeches attacking colonialism and imperialism, titled &quot;Indonesia Menggoegat&quot; (&quot;Indonesia Accuses&quot;).

====Imprisonment====
In December 1930, Sukarno was sentenced to four years in prison, which were served in Sukamiskin prison in Bandung. His speech, however, received extensive coverage by the press, and due to strong pressure from the liberal elements in both the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies, Sukarno was released early on 31 December 1931. By this time, he had become a popular hero widely known throughout Indonesia.

However, during his imprisonment, the PNI had been splintered by the oppression of colonial authorities and internal dissension. The original PNI was disbanded by the Dutch, and its former members formed two different parties; the Indonesia Party (Partindo) under Sukarno&#x27;s associate Sartono who were promoting mass agitation, and the Indonesian Nationalist Education (New PNI) under Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir, two nationalists who recently returned from studies in the Netherlands, and who were promoting a long-term strategy of providing modern education to the uneducated Indonesian populace to develop an intellectual elite able to offer effective resistance to Dutch rule. After attempting to reconcile the two parties to establish one united nationalist front, Sukarno chose to become the head of Partindo on 28 July 1932. Partindo had maintained its alignment with Sukarno&#x27;s own strategy of immediate mass agitation, and Sukarno disagreed with Hatta&#x27;s long-term cadre-based struggle. Hatta himself believed Indonesian independence would not occur within his lifetime, while Sukarno believed Hatta&#x27;s strategy ignored the fact that politics can only make real changes through formation and utilisation of force (&quot;machtsvorming en machtsaanwending&quot;).

During this period, to support himself and the party financially, Sukarno returned to architecture, opening the bureau of Soekarno &amp; Roosseno with his university junior Roosseno. He also wrote articles for the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Fikiran Ra&#x27;jat (People&#x27;s Mind)&quot;. While based in Bandung, Sukarno travelled extensively throughout Java to establish contacts with other nationalists. His activities attracted further attention by the Dutch PID. In mid-1933, Sukarno published a series of writings titled &quot;Mentjapai Indonesia Merdeka&quot; (&quot;To Attain Independent Indonesia&quot;). For this writing, he was arrested by Dutch police while visiting fellow nationalist Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin in Jakarta on 1 August 1933.

===Exile to Flores and Bengkulu===
This time, to prevent providing Sukarno with a platform to make political speeches, the hardline governor-general Jonkheer Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge utilised his emergency powers to send Sukarno to internal exile without trial. In 1934, Sukarno was shipped, along with his family (including Inggit Garnasih), to the remote town of Ende, on the island of Flores. During his time in Flores, he utilised his limited freedom of movement to establish a children&#x27;s theatre. Among its members was future politician Frans Seda. Due to an outbreak of malaria in Flores, the Dutch authorities decided to move Sukarno and his family to Bencoolen (now Bengkulu) on the western coast of Sumatra, in February 1938.

In Bengkulu, Sukarno became acquainted with Hassan Din, the local head of Muhammadiyah organization, and he was allowed to teach religious teachings at a local school owned by the Muhammadiyah. One of his students was 15-year-old Fatmawati, daughter of Hassan Din. He became romantically involved with Fatmawati, which he justified by stating the inability of Inggit Garnasih to produce children during their almost 20-year marriage. Sukarno was still in Bengkulu exile when the Japanese invaded the archipelago in 1942.

==World War II and the Japanese occupation==
===Background and invasion===

In early 1929, during the Indonesian National Revival, Sukarno and fellow Indonesian nationalist leader Hatta (later Vice President), first foresaw a Pacific War and the opportunity that a Japanese advance on Indonesia might present for the Indonesian independence cause. On 10 January 1942, Imperial Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies quickly defeating Dutch forces who marched, bussed and trucked Sukarno and his entourage three hundred kilometres from Bengkulu to Padang, Sumatra. They intended keeping him prisoner and shipping him to Australia but abruptly abandoned him to save themselves upon the impending approach of Japanese forces on Padang.

===Cooperation with the Japanese===
The Japanese had their own files on Sukarno, and the Japanese commander in Sumatra approached him with respect, wanting to use him to organize and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno, on the other hand, wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia: &quot;The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time in all my life, I saw myself in the mirror of Asia.&quot; In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Hatta. There, he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura, who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid the Japanese war effort.

Sukarno was willing to support the Japanese, in exchange for a platform for himself to spread nationalist ideas to the mass population. The Japanese, on the other hand, needed Indonesia&#x27;s workforce and natural resources to help its war effort. The Japanese recruited millions of people, mainly from Java, to be forced labour called &quot;romusha&quot; in Japanese. They were forced to build railways, airfields, and other facilities for the Japanese within Indonesia and as far away as Burma. Additionally, the Japanese requisitioned rice and other food produced by Indonesian peasants to supply their troops, while forcing the peasantry to cultivate castor oil plants to be used as aviation fuel and lubricants.

To gain cooperation from Indonesian population and to prevent resistance to these measures, the Japanese put Sukarno as head of 3A Japanese propaganda movement or the &quot;Tiga-A&quot; mass organization movement. In March 1943, the Japanese formed a new organization called &quot;Poesat Tenaga Rakjat&quot; (POETERA/Center of People&#x27;s Power) under Sukarno, Hatta, Ki Hadjar Dewantara, and KH Mas Mansjoer. These organizations aimed to galvanise popular support for recruitment of &quot;romusha&quot;, to requisition of food products, and to promote pro-Japanese and anti-Western sentiments amongst Indonesians. Sukarno coined the term &quot;Amerika kita setrika, Inggris kita linggis&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s iron America, and bludgeon the British&quot;) to promote anti-Allied sentiments. In later years, Sukarno was lastingly ashamed of his role with the &quot;romusha&quot;. Additionally, food requisitioning by the Japanese caused widespread famine in Java, which killed more than one million people in 1944–1945. In his view, these were necessary sacrifices to be made to allow for the future independence of Indonesia. He also was involved with the formation of &quot;Defenders of the Homeland&quot; (&quot;Pembela Tanah Air; PETA&quot;) and &quot;Heiho&quot; (Indonesian volunteer army troops) via speeches broadcast on the Japanese radio and loudspeaker networks across Java and Sumatra. By mid-1945 these units numbered around two million and were preparing to defeat any Allied forces sent to re-take Java.
In the meantime, Sukarno eventually divorced Inggit, who refused to accept her husband&#x27;s wish for polygamy. She was provided with a house in Bandung and a pension for the rest of her life. In 1943, he married Fatmawati. They lived in a house in Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56, confiscated from its previous Dutch owners and presented to Sukarno by the Japanese. This house would later be the venue of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945.

On 10 November 1943, Sukarno and Hatta were sent on a 17-day tour of Japan, where they were decorated by Emperor Hirohito and wined and dined in the house of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo in Tokyo. On 7 September 1944, with the war going badly for the Japanese, Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso promised independence for Indonesia, although no date was set. This announcement was seen, according to the US official history, as immense vindication for Sukarno&#x27;s apparent collaboration with the Japanese. The USA at the time considered Sukarno one of the &quot;foremost collaborationist leaders&quot;.

===Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence===

On 29 April 1945, when the Philippines were liberated by American forces, the Japanese allowed for the establishment of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (, BPUPK), a quasi-legislature consisting of 67 representatives from most ethnic groups in Indonesia. Sukarno was appointed as head of the BPUPK and was tasked to lead discussions to prepare the basis of a future Indonesian state. To provide a common and acceptable platform to unite the various squabbling factions in the BPUPK, Sukarno formulated his ideological thinking developed over the previous twenty years into five principles. On 1 June 1945, he introduced a set of five principles, known as &quot;pancasila&quot;, during the joint session of the BPUPK held in the former Volksraad Building (now called the Pancasila Building).

&quot;Pancasila&quot;, as presented by Sukarno during the BPUPK speech, consisted of five principles which Sukarno saw as commonly shared by all Indonesians:
# Nationalism, whereby a united Indonesian state would stretch from Sabang to Merauke, encompassing all former Dutch East Indies
# Internationalism, meaning Indonesia is to appreciate human rights and contribute to world peace, and should not fall into chauvinistic fascism such as displayed by Nazis with their belief in the racial superiority of Aryans
# Democracy, which Sukarno believed has always been in the blood of Indonesians through the practice of consensus-seeking (), an Indonesian-style democracy different from Western-style liberalism
# Social justice, a form of populist socialism in economics with Marxist-style opposition to free capitalism. Social justice also intended to provide an equal share of the economy to all Indonesians, as opposed to the complete economic domination by the Dutch and Chinese during the colonial period
# Belief in God, whereby all religions are treated equally and have religious freedom. Sukarno saw Indonesians as spiritual and religious people, but in essence tolerant towards different religious beliefs

On 22 June, the Islamic and nationalist elements of the BPUPK created a small committee of nine (), which formulated Sukarno&#x27;s ideas into the five-point Pancasila, in a document known as the Jakarta Charter:
# Belief in one and only Almighty God with obligation for Muslims to adhere to Islamic law ()
# Just and civilised humanity () 
# Unity of Indonesia ()
# Democracy through inner wisdom and representative consensus-building ()
# Social justice for all Indonesians ()

Due to pressure from the Islamic element, the first principle mentioned the obligation for Muslims to practice Islamic law (sharia). However, the final Sila as contained in the 1945 Constitution which was put into effect on 18 August 1945, excluded the reference to Islamic law for the sake of national unity. The elimination of sharia was done by Hatta based upon a request by Christian representative Alexander Andries Maramis, and after consultation with moderate Islamic representatives Teuku Mohammad Hassan, Kasman Singodimedjo, and Ki Bagoes Hadikoesoemo.

===Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence===
On 7 August 1945, the Japanese allowed the formation of a smaller Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (, PPKI), a 21-person committee tasked with creating the specific governmental structure of the future Indonesian state. On 9 August, the top leaders of PPKI (Sukarno, Hatta and KRT Radjiman Wediodiningrat), were summoned by the commander-in-chief of Japan&#x27;s Southern Expeditionary Forces, Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi, to Da Lat, 100 km from Saigon. Terauchi gave Sukarno the freedom to proceed with preparation for Indonesian independence, free of Japanese interference. After much wining and dining, Sukarno&#x27;s entourage was flown back to Jakarta on 14 August. Unbeknownst to the guests, atomic bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese were preparing for surrender.

===Japanese surrender===
The following day, on 15 August, the Japanese declared their acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration terms and unconditionally surrendered to the Allies. On the afternoon of that day, Sukarno received this information from leaders of youth groups and members of PETA Chairul Saleh, Soekarni, and Wikana, who had been listening to Western radio broadcasts. They urged Sukarno to declare Indonesian independence immediately, while the Japanese were in confusion and before the arrival of Allied forces. Faced with this quick turn of events, Sukarno procrastinated. He feared bloodbath due to hostile response from the Japanese to such a move and was concerned with prospects of future Allied retribution.

===Kidnapping incident===

On the early morning on 16 August, the three youth leaders, impatient with Sukarno&#x27;s indecision, kidnapped him from his house and brought him to a small house in Rengasdengklok, Karawang, owned by a Chinese family and occupied by PETA. There they gained Sukarno&#x27;s commitment to declare independence the next day. That night, the youths drove Sukarno back to the house of Admiral Tadashi Maeda, the Japanese naval liaison officer in the Menteng area of Jakarta, who sympathised with Indonesian independence. There, he and his assistant Sajoeti Melik prepared the text of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence.

==Indonesian National Revolution==
===Proclamation of Indonesian Independence===

In the early morning of 17 August 1945, Sukarno returned to his house at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur No. 56, where Hatta joined him. Throughout the morning, impromptu leaflets printed by PETA and youth elements informed the population of the impending proclamation. Finally, at 10 am, Sukarno and Hatta stepped to the front porch, where Sukarno declared the independence of the Republic of Indonesia in front of a crowd of 500 people. This most historic of buildings was later ordered to be demolished by Sukarno himself, without any apparent reason.

On the following day, 18 August, the PPKI declared the basic governmental structure of the new Republic of Indonesia:
# Electing Sukarno and Hatta as president and vice-president, respectively.
# Putting into effect the 1945 Indonesian constitution, which by this time excluded any reference to Islamic law.
# Establishing a Central Indonesian National Committee (, KNIP) to assist the president before an election of a parliament.

Sukarno&#x27;s vision for the 1945 Indonesian constitution comprised the Pancasila (&quot;five principles&quot;). Sukarno&#x27;s political philosophy was mainly a fusion of elements of Marxism, nationalism and Islam. This is reflected in a proposition of his version of Pancasila he proposed to the BPUPK in a speech on 1 June 1945.

Sukarno argued that all of the principles of the nation could be summarised in the phrase &quot;gotong royong.&quot; The Indonesian parliament, founded on the basis of this original (and subsequently revised) constitution, proved all but ungovernable. This was due to irreconcilable differences between various social, political, religious and ethnic factions.

===Revolution and &quot;Bersiap&quot;===
In the days following the proclamation, the news of Indonesian independence was spread by radio, newspaper, leaflets, and word of mouth despite attempts by the Japanese soldiers to suppress the news. On 19 September, Sukarno addressed a crowd of one million people at the Ikada Field of Jakarta (now part of Merdeka Square) to commemorate one month of independence, indicating the strong level of popular support for the new Republic, at least on Java and Sumatra. In these two islands, the Sukarno government quickly established governmental control while the remaining Japanese mostly retreated to their barracks awaiting the arrival of Allied forces. This period was marked by constant attacks by armed groups on anyone who was perceived to oppose Indonesian independence. The most serious cases were the Social Revolutions in Aceh and North Sumatera, where large numbers of Acehnese and Malay aristocrats were killed, and the &quot;Three Regions Affair&quot; in northwestern coast of Central Java. These bloody incidents continued until late 1945 to early 1946, and began to peter out as republican authorities began to exert and consolidate control.

Sukarno&#x27;s government initially postponed the formation of a national army, for fear of antagonizing the Allied occupation forces and their doubt over whether they would have been able to form an adequate military apparatus to maintain control of seized territory. The members of various militia groups formed during Japanese occupation such as the disbanded PETA and &quot;Heiho&quot;, at that time were encouraged to join the BKR - (The People&#x27;s Security Organization), itself a subordinate of the &quot;War Victims Assistance Organization&quot;. It was only in October 1945 that the BKR was reformed into the TKR – (People&#x27;s Security Army) in response to the increasing Allied and Dutch presence in Indonesia. The TKR armed themselves mostly by attacking Japanese troops and confiscating their weapons.

Due to the sudden transfer of Java and Sumatra from General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s American-controlled Southwest Pacific Command to Lord Louis Mountbatten&#x27;s British-controlled Southeast Asian Command, the first Allied soldiers (1st Battalion of Seaforth Highlanders) did not arrive in Jakarta until late September 1945. British forces began to occupy major Indonesian cities in October 1945. The commander of the British 23rd Division, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison, set up command in the former governor-general&#x27;s palace in Jakarta. Christison stated that he intended to free all Allied prisoners-of-war and to allow the return of Indonesia to its pre-war status, as a colony of Netherlands. The republican government were willing to cooperate with the release and repatriation of Allied civilians and military POWs, setting-up the Committee for the Repatriation of Japanese and Allied Prisoners of Wars and Internees (, POPDA) for this purpose. POPDA, in cooperation with the British, repatriated more than 70,000 Japanese and Allied POWs and internees by the end of 1946. However, due to the relative weakness of the military of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno sought independence by gaining international recognition for his new country rather than engage in battle with British and Dutch military forces.

Sukarno was aware that his history as a Japanese collaborator and his leadership in the Japanese-approved during the occupation would make the Western countries distrustful of him. To help gain international recognition as well as to accommodate domestic demands for representation, Sukarno &quot;allowed&quot; the formation of a parliamentary system of government, whereby a prime minister controlled day-to-day affairs of the government, while Sukarno as president remained as a figurehead. The prime minister and his cabinet would be responsible to the Central Indonesian National Committee instead of the president. On 14 November 1945, Sukarno appointed Sutan Sjahrir, a European-educated politician who was never involved with the Japanese occupation authorities, as his first prime minister.
In late 1945 Dutch administrators who led the Dutch East Indies government-in-exile and soldiers who had fought the Japanese began to return under the name of Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA), with the protection of the British. They were led by Hubertus Johannes van Mook, a colonial administrator who had evacuated to Brisbane, Australia. Dutch soldiers who had been POWs under the Japanese were released and rearmed. Shooting between these Dutch soldiers and police supporting the new republican government soon developed. This soon escalated to armed conflict between the newly constituted republican forces aided by a myriad of pro-independence fighters and the Dutch and British forces. On 10 November, a full-scale battle broke out in Surabaya between the 49th Infantry Brigade of the British Indian Army and Indonesian nationalist militias. The British-Indian force were supported by air and naval forces. Some 300 Indian soldiers were killed (including their commander Brigadier Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby), as were thousands of nationalist militiamen and other Indonesians. Shootouts broke out with alarming regularity in Jakarta, including an attempted assassination of Prime Minister Sjahrir by Dutch gunmen. To avoid this menace, Sukarno and majority of his government left for the safety of Yogyakarta on 4 January 1946. There, the republican government received protection and full support from Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Yogyakarta would remain as the Republic&#x27;s capital until the end of the war in 1949. Sjahrir remained in Jakarta to conduct negotiations with the British.

The initial series of battles in late 1945 and early 1946 left the British in control of major port cities on Java and Sumatra. During the Japanese occupation, the Outer Islands (excluding Java and Sumatra) were occupied by the Japanese Navy (Kaigun), who did not allow for political mobilisation of the islanders. Consequently, there was little republican activity in these islands post-proclamation. Australian and Dutch forces were able to quickly take control of these islands without much fighting by the end of 1945 (excluding the resistance of I Gusti Ngurah Rai in Bali, the insurgency in South Sulawesi, and fighting in Hulu Sungai area of South Kalimantan). Meanwhile, the hinterland areas of Java and Sumatera remained under republican control.

Eager to pull its soldiers out of Indonesia, the British allowed for large-scale infusion of Dutch forces into the country throughout 1946. By November 1946, all British soldiers had been withdrawn from Indonesia. They were replaced with more than 150,000 Dutch soldiers. The British sent Lord Archibald Clark Kerr, 1st Baron Inverchapel and Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn to bring the Dutch and Indonesians to the negotiating table. The result of these negotiations was the Linggadjati Agreement signed in November 1946, where the Dutch acknowledged &quot;de facto&quot; republican sovereignty over Java, Sumatera, and Madura. In exchange, the republicans were willing to discuss a future Commonwealth-like United Kingdom of Netherlands and Indonesia.

===Linggadjati Agreement and Operation Product===
====Linggadjati Agreement====

Sukarno&#x27;s decision to negotiate with the Dutch was met with strong opposition by various Indonesian factions. Tan Malaka, a communist politician, organized these groups into a united front called the &quot;Persatoean Perdjoangan&quot; (PP). PP offered a &quot;Minimum Program&quot; which called for complete independence, nationalisation of all foreign properties, and rejection of all negotiations until all foreign troops are withdrawn. These programmes received widespread popular support, including from armed forces commander General Sudirman. On 4 July 1946, military units linked with PP kidnapped Prime Minister Sjahrir who was visiting Yogyakarta. Sjahrir was leading the negotiation with the Dutch. Sukarno, after successfully influencing Sudirman, managed to secure the release of Sjahrir and the arrest of Tan Malaka and other PP leaders. Disapproval of Linggadjati terms within the KNIP led Sukarno to issue a decree doubling KNIP membership by including many pro-agreement appointed members. As a consequence, KNIP ratified the Linggadjati Agreement in March 1947.

On 21 July 1947, the Linggadjati Agreement was broken by the Dutch, who launched Operatie Product, a massive military invasion into republican-held territories. Although the newly reconstituted TNI was unable to offer significant military resistance, the blatant violation by the Dutch of an internationally brokered agreement outraged world opinion. International pressure forced the Dutch to halt their invasion force in August 1947. Sjahrir, who had been replaced as prime minister by Amir Sjarifuddin, flew to New York City to appeal the Indonesian case in front of the United Nations. The UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and appointed a Good Offices Committee (GOC) to oversee the ceasefire. The GOC, based in Jakarta, consisted of delegations from Australia (led by Richard Kirby, chosen by Indonesia), Belgium (led by Paul van Zeeland, chosen by the Netherlands), and the United States (led by Frank Porter Graham, neutral).

The republic was now under firm Dutch military stranglehold, with the Dutch military occupying West Java, and the northern coast of Central Java and East Java, along with the key productive areas of Sumatra. Additionally, the Dutch navy blockaded republican areas from supplies of vital food, medicine, and weapons. As a consequence, Prime Minister Amir Sjarifuddin had little choice but to sign the Renville Agreement on 17 January 1948, which acknowledged Dutch control over areas taken during Operatie Product, while the republicans pledged to withdraw all forces that remained on the other side of the ceasefire line (&quot;Van Mook Line&quot;). Meanwhile, the Dutch begin to organize puppet states in the areas under their occupation, to counter republican influence utilising ethnic diversity of Indonesia.

===Renville agreement and Madiun affair===

The signing of highly disadvantageous Renville Agreement caused even greater instability within the republican political structure. In Dutch-occupied West Java, Darul Islam guerrillas under Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo maintained their anti-Dutch resistance and repealed any loyalty to the Republic; they caused a bloody insurgency in West Java and other areas in the first decades of independence. Prime Minister Sjarifuddin, who signed the agreement, was forced to resign in January 1948 and was replaced by Hatta. Hatta cabinet&#x27;s policy of rationalising the armed forces by demobilising large numbers of armed groups that proliferated the republican areas also caused severe disaffection. Leftist political elements, led by resurgent Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) under Musso took advantage of public disaffections by launching a rebellion in Madiun, East Java, on 18 September 1948. Bloody fighting continued during late-September until end of October 1948, when the last communist bands were defeated, and Musso shot dead. The communists had overestimated their potential to oppose the strong appeal of Sukarno amongst the population.

===Operation Kraai and exile===
====Invasion and exile====
On 19 December 1948, to take advantage of the republic&#x27;s weak position following the communist rebellion, the Dutch launched Operation Kraai, a second military invasion designed to crush the Republic once and for all. The invasion was initiated with an airborne assault on republican capital Yogyakarta. Sukarno ordered the armed forces under Sudirman to launch a guerrilla campaign in the countryside, while he and other key leaders such as Hatta and Sjahrir allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by the Dutch. To ensure continuity of government, Sukarno sent a telegram to Sjarifuddin, providing him with the mandate to lead an Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI), based on the unoccupied hinterlands of West Sumatra, a position he kept until Sukarno was released in June 1949. The Dutch sent Sukarno and other captured republican leaders to captivity in Parapat, in Dutch-occupied part of North Sumatra and later to the island of Bangka.

====Aftermath====

The second Dutch invasion caused even more international outrage. The United States, impressed by Indonesia&#x27;s ability to defeat the 1948 communist challenge without outside help, threatened to cut off Marshall Aid funds to the Netherlands if military operations in Indonesia continued. TNI did not disintegrate and continued to wage guerrilla resistance against the Dutch, most notably the assault on Dutch-held Yogyakarta led by Lieutenant Colonel Suharto on 1 March 1949. Consequently, the Dutch were forced to sign the Roem–Van Roijen Agreement on 7 May 1949. According to this treaty, the Dutch released the republican leadership and returned the area surrounding Yogyakarta to republican control in June 1949. This was followed by the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague which led to the complete transfer of sovereignty by the Queen Juliana of the Netherlands to Indonesia, on 27 December 1949. On that day, Sukarno flew from Yogyakarta to Jakarta, making a triumphant speech at the steps of the governor-general&#x27;s palace, immediately renamed the Merdeka Palace (&quot;Independence Palace&quot;).

==President of the United States of Indonesia==

At this time, as part of a compromise with the Dutch, Indonesia adopted a new federal constitution that made the country a federal state called the Republic of United States of Indonesia (Indonesian: &quot;Republik Indonesia Serikat, RIS&quot;), consisting of the Republic of Indonesia whose borders were determined by the &quot;Van Mook Line&quot;, along with the six states and nine autonomous territories created by the Dutch. During the first half of 1950, these states gradually dissolved themselves as the Dutch military that previously propped them up was withdrawn. In August 1950, with the last state, the State of East Indonesia dissolving itself, Sukarno declared a Unitary Republic of Indonesia based on the newly formulated provisional constitution of 1950.

==Liberal Democracy period (1950–1959)==

Both the Federal Constitution of 1949 and the Provisional Constitution of 1950 were parliamentary in nature, where executive authority laid with the prime minister, and which on paper limited presidential power. However, even with his formally reduced role, he commanded a good deal of moral authority as Father of the Nation.

===Instability and rebellions===
The first years of parliamentary democracy proved to be very unstable for Indonesia. Cabinets fell in rapid succession due to the sharp differences between the various political parties within the newly-appointed parliament (, DPR). There were severe disagreements concerning the future path of the Indonesian state, between nationalists who wanted a secular state (led by PNI, first established by Sukarno), Islamists who wanted an Islamic state (led by the Masyumi Party), and communists who wanted a communist state (led by the PKI, which only in 1951 again became allowed to operate). On the economic front, there was severe dissatisfaction with continuing economic domination by large Dutch corporations and the ethnic Chinese.

====Darul Islam rebels====
The Darul Islam rebels under Kartosuwirjo in West Java refused to acknowledge Sukarno&#x27;s authority and declared an NII (Negara Islam Indonesia - Islamic State of Indonesia) in August 1949. Rebellions in support of Darul Islam also broke out in South Sulawesi in 1951, and in Aceh in 1953. Meanwhile, pro-federalist members of the disbanded KNIL launched failed rebellions in Bandung (APRA rebellion of 1950), in Makassar in 1950, and Ambon (Republic of South Maluku revolt of 1950).

====Division in the military====

Additionally, the military was torn by hostilities between officers originating from the colonial-era KNIL, who wished for a small and elite professional military, and the overwhelming majority of soldiers who started their careers in the Japanese-formed PETA, who were afraid of being discharged and were more known for nationalist-zeal over professionalism.

On 17 October 1952, the leaders of the former-KNIL faction, Army Chief Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution and Armed Forces Chief-of-Staff Tahi Bonar Simatupang mobilised their troops in a show of force. Protesting against attempts by the DPR to interfere in military business on behalf of the former PETA faction of the military, Nasution and Simatupang had their troops surround the Merdeka Palace and point their tank turrets at the building. Their demand for Sukarno was that the current DPR be dismissed. For this cause, Nasution and Simatupang also mobilised civilian protesters. Sukarno came out of the palace and convinced both the soldiers and the civilians to go home. Nasution and Simatupang were later dismissed. Nasution, however, would be re-appointed as Army Chief after reconciling with Sukarno in 1955.

===Legislative elections===

The 1955 elections produced a new parliament and a constitutional assembly. The election results showed equal support for the antagonistic powers of the PNI, Masyumi, Nahdlatul Ulama, and PKI parties. With no faction controlling a clear majority, domestic political instability continued unabated. Talks in the Constitutional Assembly to write a new constitution met with deadlock over the issue of whether to include Islamic law.

Sukarno came to resent his figurehead position and the increasing disorder of the country&#x27;s political life. Claiming that Western-style parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Indonesia, he called for a system of &quot;guided democracy,&quot; which he claimed was based on indigenous principles of governance. Sukarno argued that at the village level, important questions were decided by lengthy deliberation designed to achieve a consensus, under the guidance of village elders. He believed it should be the model for the entire nation, with the president taking the role assumed by village elders. He proposed a government based not only on political parties but on &quot;functional groups&quot; composed of the nation&#x27;s essential elements, which would together form a National Council, through which a national consensus could express itself under presidential guidance.

Vice President Hatta was strongly opposed to Sukarno&#x27;s guided democracy concept. Citing this and other irreconcilable differences, Hatta resigned from his position in December 1956. His retirement sent a shockwave across Indonesia, particularly among the non-Javanese, who viewed Hatta as their representative in a Javanese-dominated government.

===Military takeovers and martial law===
====Regional military takeovers====
From December 1956 to January 1957, regional military commanders in the provinces of North, Central, and South Sumatra provinces took over local government control. They declared a series of military councils which were to run their respective areas and refused to accept orders from Jakarta. A similar regional military movement took control of North Sulawesi in March 1957. They demanded the elimination of communist influence in government, an equal share in government revenues, and reinstatement of the former Sukarno-Hatta duumvirate.

====Declaration of martial law====
Faced with this serious challenge to the unity of the republic, Sukarno declared martial law (&quot;Staat van Oorlog en Beleg&quot;) on 14 March 1957. He appointed a non-partisan prime minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja, while the military was in the hands of his loyal General Nasution. Nasution increasingly shared Sukarno&#x27;s views on the negative impact of western democracy on Indonesia, and he saw a more significant role for the military in political life.

As a reconciliatory move, Sukarno invited the leaders of the regional councils to Jakarta on 10–14 September 1957, to attend a National Conference (&quot;Musjawarah Nasional&quot;), which failed to bring a solution to the crisis. On 30 November 1957, an assassination attempt was made on Sukarno by way of a grenade attack while he was visiting a school function in Cikini, Central Jakarta. Six children were killed, but Sukarno did not suffer any serious wounds. The perpetrators were members of the Darul Islam group, under the order of its leader Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo.

By December 1957, Sukarno began to take serious steps to enforce his authority over the country. On that month, he nationalised 246 Dutch companies which had been dominating the Indonesian economy, most notably the Netherlands Trading Society, Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary &quot;Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij&quot;, Escomptobank, and the &quot;big five&quot; Dutch trading corporations (&quot;NV Borneo Sumatra Maatschappij / Borsumij&quot;, &quot;NV Internationale Crediet- en Handelsvereeneging &quot;Rotterdam&quot; / Internatio&quot;, &quot;NV Jacobson van den Berg &amp; Co&quot;, &quot;NV Lindeteves-Stokvis&quot;, and &quot;NV Geo Wehry &amp; Co&quot;), and expelled 40,000 Dutch citizens remaining in Indonesia while confiscating their properties, purportedly due to the failure by the Dutch government to continue negotiations on the fate of Netherlands New Guinea as was promised in the 1949 Round Table Conference. Sukarno&#x27;s policy of economic nationalism was strengthened by the issuance of Presidential Directive No. 10 of 1959, which banned commercial activities by foreign nationals in rural areas. This rule targeted ethnic Chinese, who dominated both the rural and urban retail economy, although at this time few of them had Indonesian citizenship. This policy resulted in massive relocation of the rural ethnic-Chinese population to urban areas, and approximately 100,000 chose to return to China.

To face the dissident regional commanders, Sukarno and Army Chief Nasution decided to take drastic steps following the failure of &quot;Musjawarah Nasional&quot;. By utilizing regional officers that remained loyal to Jakarta, Nasution organized a series of &quot;regional coups&quot; which ousted the dissident commanders in North Sumatra (Colonel Maludin Simbolon) and South Sumatra (Colonel Barlian) by December 1957. This returned government control over key cities of Medan and Palembang.

In February 1958, the remaining dissident commanders in Central Sumatra (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) formed the PRRI-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Jakarta government. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara who were opposed to the growing influence of communists. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received money, weapons, and manpower from the CIA in a campaign known as Archipelago. This support ended when Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958. In April 1958, the central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions on Padang and Manado, the rebel capitals. By the end of 1958, the rebels had been militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerrilla bands surrendered in August 1961.

==Guided Democracy period (1959–1966)==


The impressive military victories over the PRRI-Permesta rebels and the popular nationalisation of Dutch companies left Sukarno in a firm position. On 5 July 1959, Sukarno reinstated the 1945 constitution by presidential decree. It established a presidential system which he believed would make it easier to implement the principles of guided democracy. He called the system or , but it was actually government by decree. Sukarno envisioned an Indonesian-style socialist society, adherent to the principle of USDEK:
# (Constitution of 1945)
# (Indonesian Socialism)
# (Guided Democracy)
# (Commanded Economy).
# (Indonesia&#x27;s Identity)
After establishing guided democracy, Sukarno along with Maladi met Devi Dja, an Indonesian-born dancer who changed her citizenship to United States, in mid-1959, and convinced her to return as an Indonesian citizen, which Dja refused and credited him as an extreme nationalist person. In March 1960, Sukarno disbanded parliament and replaced it with a new parliament where half the members were appointed by the president (&quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat - Gotong Rojong&quot; / DPR-GR). In September 1960, he established a Provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (&quot;Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat Sementara&quot;/MPRS) as the highest legislative authority according to the 1945 constitution. MPRS members consisted of members of DPR-GR and members of &quot;functional groups&quot; appointed by the president.

With the backing of the military, Sukarno disbanded the Islamic party Masyumi and Sutan Sjahrir&#x27;s party PSI, accusing them of involvement with PRRI-Permesta affair. The military arrested and imprisoned many of Sukarno&#x27;s political opponents, from socialist Sjahrir to Islamic politicians Mohammad Natsir and Hamka. Using martial law powers, the government closed down newspapers who were critical of Sukarno&#x27;s policies.

During this period, there were several assassination attempts on Sukarno&#x27;s life. On 9 March 1960, Daniel Maukar, an Indonesian airforce lieutenant who sympathised with the Permesta rebellion, strafed the Merdeka Palace and Bogor Palace with his MiG-17 fighter jet, attempting to kill the president; he was not injured. In May 1962, Darul Islam agents shot at the president during Eid al-Adha prayers on the grounds of the palace. Sukarno again escaped injury.

On the security front, the military started a series of effective campaigns which ended the long-festering Darul Islam rebellion in West Java (1962), Aceh (1962), and South Sulawesi (1965). Kartosuwirjo, the leader of Darul Islam, was captured and executed in September 1962.

To counterbalance the power of the military, Sukarno started to rely on the support of the PKI. In 1960, he declared his government to be based on Nasakom, a union of the three ideological strands present in Indonesian society: &quot;nasionalisme&quot; (nationalism), &quot;agama&quot; (religions), and &quot;komunisme&quot; (communism). Accordingly, Sukarno started admitting more communists into his government, while developing a strong relationship with the PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit.

In order to increase Indonesia&#x27;s prestige, Sukarno supported and won the bid for the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta. Many sporting facilities such as the Senayan sports complex (including the 100,000-seat Bung Karno Stadium) were built to accommodate the games. There was political tension when the Indonesians refused the entry of delegations from Israel and Taiwan. After the International Olympic Committee imposed sanctions on Indonesia due to this exclusion policy, Sukarno retaliated by organizing a &quot;non-imperialist&quot; competitor event to the Olympic Games, called the &quot;Games of New Emerging Forces&quot; (GANEFO). GANEFO was successfully held in Jakarta in November 1963 and was attended by 2,700 athletes from 51 countries.

As part of his prestige-building program, Sukarno ordered the construction of large monumental buildings such as National Monument (&quot;Monumen Nasional&quot;), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, CONEFO Building (now the Parliament Building), Hotel Indonesia, and the Sarinah shopping centre to transform Jakarta from a former colonial backwater to a modern city. The modern Jakarta boulevards of Jalan Thamrin, Jalan Sudirman, and Jalan Gatot Subroto were planned and constructed under Sukarno.

===Foreign policy===
====Bandung Conference====
On the international front, Sukarno organized the Bandung Conference in 1955, with the goal of uniting the developing Asian and African countries into the Non-Aligned Movement to counter both the United States and the Soviet Union.

====Cold War====

As Sukarno&#x27;s domestic authority was secured, he began to pay more attention to the world stage. He embarked on a series of aggressive and assertive policies based on anti-imperialism to increase Indonesia&#x27;s international prestige. These anti-imperialist and anti-Western policies, often employing brinkmanship with other nations, were also designed to unite the diverse and fractious Indonesian people. In this, he was aided by his foreign minister Subandrio.

After his first visit to Beijing in 1956, Sukarno began to strengthen his ties to the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the communist bloc in general. He also began to accept increasing amounts of Soviet-bloc military aid. By the early 1960s, the Soviet bloc provided more aid to Indonesia than to any other non-communist country, while Soviet military aid to Indonesia was equalled only by its aid to Cuba. This substantial influx of communist aid prompted an increase in military aid from the Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy administrations, which worried about a leftward drift should Sukarno rely too much on Soviet-bloc aid.
Sukarno was feted during his visit to the United States in 1956, where he addressed a joint session of the United States Congress. To date, it is the only time any Indonesian president has addressed a joint session of the US Congress. Soon after his first visit to America, Sukarno visited the Soviet Union, where he received an even more lavish welcome. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev paid a return visit to Jakarta and Bali in 1960, where he awarded Sukarno with the Lenin Peace Prize. To make amends for CIA involvement in the PRRI-Permesta rebellion, Kennedy invited Sukarno to Washington, D.C., and provided Indonesia with billions of dollars in civilian and military aid.

To follow up on the successful 1955 Bandung Conference, Sukarno attempted to forge a new alliance called the &quot;New Emerging Forces&quot; (NEFO), as a counter to the Western superpowers dubbed the &quot;Old Established Forces&quot; (OLDEFO), whom he accused of spreading &quot;Neo-Colonialism and Imperialism&quot; (NEKOLIM). In 1961, Sukarno established another political alliance, called the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM, in Indonesia known as Gerakan Non-Blok, GNB) at the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade together with Egypt&#x27;s President Gamal Abdel Nasser, India&#x27;s Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia&#x27;s President Josip Broz Tito, and Ghana&#x27;s President Kwame Nkrumah, in an action called The Initiative of Five (Sukarno, Nkrumah, Nasser, Tito, and Nehru). NAM was intended to provide political unity and influence for nations who wished to maintain independence from the American and Soviet superpower blocs, which were engaged in Cold War competition. Sukarno is still fondly remembered for his role in promoting the influence of newly independent countries. His name is used as a street name in Cairo, Egypt and Rabat, Morocco, and as a major square in Peshawar, Pakistan. In 1956, the University of Belgrade awarded him an honorary doctorate.

====Papua conflict====

In 1960 Sukarno began an aggressive foreign policy to secure Indonesian territorial claims. In August of that year, he broke off diplomatic relations with the Netherlands over the continuing failure to commence talks on the future of Netherlands New Guinea, as was agreed at the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949. In April 1961, the Dutch announced the formation of a &quot;Nieuw Guinea Raad&quot;, intending to create an independent Papuan state. Sukarno declared a state of military confrontation in his &quot;Tri Komando Rakjat&quot; (TRIKORA) speech in Yogyakarta, on 19 December 1961. He then directed military incursions into the half-island, which he referred to as West Irian. By the end of 1962, 3,000 Indonesian soldiers were present throughout West Irian/West Papua.

On 28 August 1961, Elizabeth II invited Sukarno for a state visit to London which was scheduled in May 1962. But on 19 September, Juliana of the Netherlands, who heard the news, felt unhappy due to the breakdown of Indonesia&#x27;s diplomatic relations with the Netherlands after the West Irian dispute. Upon hearing the news, she stated that negotiations with Indonesia regarding West Irian would not take place and did not allow Elizabeth, who was still her distant niece, to invite Sukarno, which resulted in a worsening of Indonesia&#x27;s diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom. On 21 April 1962, Sukarno canceled the visit due to a Dutch attack on the Indonesian Navy fleet in the Arafuru Sea.

A naval battle erupted in January 1962 when four Indonesian torpedo boats were intercepted by Dutch ships and planes off the coast of Vlakke Hoek. One Indonesian boat was sunk, killing the Naval Deputy Chief-of-Staff Commodore Jos Sudarso. Meanwhile, the Kennedy Administration worried of a continuing Indonesian shift towards communism should the Dutch hold on to West Irian/West Papua. In February 1962 U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy travelled to the Netherlands and informed the government that the United States would not support the Netherlands in an armed conflict with Indonesia. With Soviet armaments and advisors, Sukarno planned a large-scale air- and sea-borne invasion of the Dutch military headquarters of Biak for August 1962, called &quot;Operasi Djajawidjaja&quot;. It was to be led by Major-General Suharto. Before these plans could be realised, Indonesia and the Netherlands signed the New York Agreement in August 1962. The two countries agreed to implement the Bunker Plan (formulated by American diplomat Ellsworth Bunker), whereby the Dutch agreed to hand over West Irian/West Papua to UNTEA on 1 October 1962. UNTEA transferred the territory to Indonesian authority in May 1963.

====&quot;Konfrontasi&quot;====
After securing control over West Irian/West Papua, Sukarno then opposed the British-supported establishment of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, claiming that it was a neo-colonial plot by the British to undermine Indonesia. Despite Sukarno&#x27;s political overtures, which found some support when leftist political elements in British Borneo territories Sarawak and Brunei opposed the Federation plan and aligned themselves with Sukarno, Malaysia was established in September 1963. This was followed by the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation (&quot;Konfrontasi&quot;), proclaimed by Sukarno in his &quot;Dwi Komando Rakjat&quot; (DWIKORA) speech in Jakarta on 3 May 1964. Sukarno&#x27;s proclaimed objective was not, as some alleged, to annex Sabah and Sarawak into Indonesia, but to establish a &quot;State of North Kalimantan&quot; under the control of the North Kalimantan Communist Party. From 1964 until early 1966, a limited number of Indonesian soldiers, civilians, and Malaysian communist guerrillas were sent into North Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. These forces fought against British and Commonwealth soldiers deployed to protect the nascent state of Malaysia. Indonesian agents also exploded several bombs in Singapore. Domestically, Sukarno fomented anti-British sentiment, and the British Embassy was burned down. In 1964, all British companies operating in the country, including Indonesian operations of the Chartered Bank and Unilever, were nationalised. The confrontation came to a climax during August 1964, when Sukarno authorised landings of Indonesian troops at Pontian and Labis on the Malaysian mainland, and all-out war seemed inevitable as tensions escalated. However, the situation calmed by mid-September at the culmination of the Sunda Straits Crisis, and after the disastrous Battle of Plaman Mapu in April 1965, Indonesian raids into Sarawak became fewer and weaker.

In 1964, Sukarno commenced an anti-American campaign, which was motivated by his shift towards the communist bloc and less friendly relations with the Lyndon Johnson administration. American interests and businesses in Indonesia were denounced by government officials and attacked by PKI-led mobs. American movies were banned, American books and Beatles albums were burned, and the Indonesian band Koes Plus was jailed for playing American-style rock and roll music. As a result, USA aid to Indonesia was halted, to which Sukarno made his famous remark &quot;Go to hell with your aid&quot;. Sukarno withdrew Indonesia from the United Nations on 7 January 1965 when, with U.S. backing, Malaysia took a seat on the UN Security Council.

====Conference of the New Emerging Forces====

As the NAM countries were splitting into different factions, and as fewer countries were willing to support his anti-Western foreign policies, Sukarno began to abandon his non-alignment rhetoric. Sukarno formed a new alliance with China, North Korea, North Vietnam, and Cambodia which he called the &quot;Beijing-Pyongyang-Hanoi-Phnom Penh-Jakarta Axis&quot;. After withdrawing Indonesia from the &quot;imperialist-dominated&quot; United Nations in January 1965, Sukarno sought to establish a competitor organisation to the UN called the Conference of the New Emerging Forces (CONEFO) with support from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which at that time was not yet a member of United Nations. With the government heavily indebted to the Soviet Union, Indonesia became increasingly dependent on China for support. Sukarno spoke increasingly of a Beijing-Jakarta axis, which would be the core of a new anti-imperialist world organization, the CONEFO.

===Domestic policy===
====President for life and personality cult====
Domestically, Sukarno continued to consolidate his control. On 18 May 1963, the MPRS elected Sukarno president for life. His ideological writings on Manipol-USDEK and Nasakom became mandatory subjects in schools and universities, while his speeches were to be memorised and discussed by all students. All newspapers, the only radio station (RRI, government-run), and the only television station (TVRI, also government-run) were made into &quot;tools of the revolution&quot; and functioned to spread Sukarno&#x27;s messages. Sukarno developed a personality cult, with the capital of newly acquired West Irian renamed to Sukarnapura and the highest peak in the country was renamed from Carstensz Pyramid to Puntjak Sukarno (Sukarno Peak).

====Rise of the PKI====

Despite these appearances of unchallenged control, Sukarno&#x27;s guided democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno&#x27;s protection. They feared an imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had three million members and were particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. The PKI had become the strongest party in Indonesia.

The military and nationalists were growing wary of Sukarno&#x27;s close alliance with communist China, which they thought compromised Indonesia&#x27;s sovereignty. Elements of the military disagreed with Sukarno&#x27;s policy of confrontation with Malaysia, which in their view only benefited communists, and sent several officers (including future armed forces Chief Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani) to spread secret peace-feelers to the Malaysian government. The Islamic clerics, who were mostly landowners, felt threatened by PKI&#x27;s land confiscation actions () in the countryside and by the communist campaign against the &quot;seven village devils&quot;, a term used for landlords or better-off farmers (similar to the anti-kulak campaign in Stalinist era). Both groups harboured deep disdain for PKI in particular due to memories of the bloody 1948 communist rebellion.

As the mediator of the three groups under the NASAKOM system, Sukarno displayed greater sympathies to the communists. The PKI had been very careful to support all of Sukarno&#x27;s policies. Meanwhile, Sukarno saw the PKI as the best-organized and ideologically solid party in Indonesia, and a useful conduit to gain more military and financial aid from Communist Bloc countries. Sukarno also sympathised with the communists&#x27; revolutionary ideals, which were similar to his own.

To weaken the influence of the military, Sukarno rescinded martial law (which gave wide-ranging powers to the military) in 1963. In September 1962, he &quot;promoted&quot; the powerful General Nasution to the less-influential position of armed forces chief, while the influential position of army chief was given to Sukarno&#x27;s loyalist Ahmad Yani. Meanwhile, the position of air force chief was given to Omar Dhani, who was an open communist sympathiser. In May 1964, Sukarno banned the activities of (Manikebu), an association of artists and writers which included prominent Indonesian writers such as Hans Bague Jassin and Wiratmo Soekito, who were also dismissed from their jobs. Manikebu was considered a rival by the communist writer&#x27;s association (Lekra), led by Pramoedya Ananta Toer. In December 1964, Sukarno disbanded the (BPS, &quot;Association for Promoting Sukarnoism&quot;), an organization that sought to oppose communism by invoking Sukarno&#x27;s own Pancasila formulation. In January 1965, Sukarno, under pressure from the PKI, banned the Murba Party. Murba was a pro-Soviet Union party whose ideology was antagonistic to the PKI&#x27;s pro-Chinese People&#x27;s Republic view of Marxism.
Tensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when PKI chairman Aidit called for the formation of a &quot;fifth armed force&quot; consisting of armed peasants and labourers. Sukarno approved this idea and publicly called for the immediate formation of such a force on 17 May 1965. However, Army Chief Ahmad Yani and Defense Minister Nasution procrastinated in implementing this idea, as this was tantamount to allowing the PKI to establish its own armed forces. Soon afterwards, on 29 May, the &quot;Gilchrist Letter&quot; appeared. The letter was supposedly written by the British ambassador Andrew Gilchrist to the Foreign Office in London, mentioning a joint American and British attempt on subversion in Indonesia with the help of &quot;local army friends.&quot; This letter, produced by Subandrio, aroused Sukarno&#x27;s fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he repeatedly mentioned during the next few months. The Czechoslovakian agent Ladislav Bittman, who defected in 1968, claimed that his agency (StB) forged the letter on request from PKI via the Soviet Union to smear anti-communist generals. On his independence day speech of 17 August 1965, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes and warned the army not to interfere. He also stated his support for the establishment of a &quot;fifth force&quot; of armed peasants and labourers.

===Economic decline===

While Sukarno devoted his energy to domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia was neglected and deteriorated rapidly. The government printed money to finance its military expenditures, resulting in hyperinflation exceeding 600% per annum in 1964–1965. Smuggling and the collapse of export plantation sectors deprived the government of much-needed foreign exchange income. Consequently, the government was unable to service massive foreign debts it had accumulated from both Western and Communist bloc countries. Most of the government budget was spent on the military, resulting in deterioration of infrastructures such as roads, railways, ports, and other public facilities. Deteriorating transportation infrastructure and poor harvests caused food shortages in many places. The small industrial sector languished and only produced at 20% capacity due to lack of investment.

Sukarno himself was contemptuous of macroeconomics and was unable and unwilling to provide practical solutions to the poor economic condition of the country. Instead, he produced more ideological conceptions such as &quot;Trisakti&quot;: political sovereignty, economic self-sufficiency, and cultural independence. He advocated Indonesians &quot;standing on their own feet&quot; (&quot;Berdikari&quot;) and achieving economic self-sufficiency, free from foreign influence.

Towards the end of his rule, Sukarno&#x27;s lack of interest in economics created a distance between himself and the Indonesian people, who were suffering economically. His face had become bloated by disease, and his flamboyance and sexual conquests , which had once endeared him to the people, caused public criticism and turned support towards the army.

==Removal from power and death==
===30 September Movement===

====Kidnappings and murders====
On the dawn of 1 October 1965, six of Indonesia&#x27;s most senior army generals were kidnapped and murdered by a movement calling themselves the &quot;30 September Movement&quot; (G30S). Among those killed was Yani, while Nasution narrowly escaped, but the movement kidnapped First Lieutenant Pierre Tendean, his adjutant, presumably mistaking him for Nasution in the darkness. The G30S consisted of members of the Presidential Guards, Brawidjaja Division, and Diponegoro Division, under the command of a Lieutenant-Colonel Untung bin Sjamsuri. The movement took control of the RRI radio station and Merdeka Square. They broadcast a statement declaring the kidnappings were meant to protect Sukarno from a coup attempt by CIA-influenced generals. Later, it broadcast news of the disbandment of Sukarno&#x27;s cabinet, to be replaced by a &quot;Revolutionary Council.&quot; In Central Java, soldiers associated with the G30S also seized control of Yogyakarta and Solo on 1–2 October, killing two colonels in the process.

====The end of the movement====
Major General Suharto, commander of the military&#x27;s strategic reserve command, took control of the army the following morning. Suharto ordered troops to take over the RRI radio station and Merdeka Square itself. On the afternoon of that day, Suharto issued an ultimatum to the Halim Air Force Base, where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno (the reasons for his presence are unclear and were subject of claim and counter-claim), Air Marshal Omar Dhani, and PKI Chairman Aidit had gathered. By the following day, it was clear that the incompetently organized and poorly coordinated coup had failed. Sukarno took up residence in the Bogor Palace, while Dhani fled to East Java and Aidit to Central Java. By 2 October, Suharto&#x27;s soldiers occupied Halim Air Force Base, after a short gunfight. Sukarno&#x27;s obedience to Suharto&#x27;s 1 October ultimatum to leave Halim is seen as changing all power relationships. Sukarno&#x27;s fragile balance of power between the military, political Islam, communists and nationalists that underlay his &quot;Guided Democracy&quot; was now collapsing. On 3 October, the corpses of the kidnapped generals were discovered near the Halim Air Force Base, and on 5 October they were buried in a public ceremony led by Suharto.

====Aftermath of the movement====
In early October 1965, a military propaganda campaign began to sweep the country, successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a communist coup, and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes since those who were shot were veteran military officers. PKI&#x27;s denials of involvement had little effect. Following the discovery and public burial of the generals&#x27; corpses on 5 October, the army along with Islamic organizations Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama led a campaign to purge Indonesian society, government and armed forces of the communist party and other leftist organizations. Leading PKI members were immediately arrested, some summarily executed. Aidit was captured and killed in November 1965. The purge spread across the country with the worst massacres in Java and Bali. In some areas, the army organized civilian groups and local militias, in other areas communal vigilante action preceded the army. The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed. It is thought that as many as 1.5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another.

As a result of the purge, one of Sukarno&#x27;s three pillars of support, the PKI, had been effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam. The killings and the failure of his tenuous &quot;revolution&quot; distressed Sukarno, and he tried unsuccessfully to protect the PKI by referring to the generals&#x27; killings as (&quot;ripple in the sea of the revolution&quot;). He tried to maintain his influence appealing in a January 1966 broadcast for the country to follow him. Subandrio sought to create a Sukarnoist column (), which was undermined by Suharto&#x27;s pledge of loyalty to Sukarno and the concurrent instruction for all those loyal to Sukarno to announce their support for the army.

===Transition to the New Order===

====Cabinet reshuffle====
On 1 October 1965, Sukarno appointed General Pranoto Reksosamudro as army chief to replace the deceased Yani, but he was forced to give this position to Suharto two weeks later. In February 1966, Sukarno reshuffled his cabinet, sacking Nasution as defense minister and abolishing his position of armed forces chief of staff, but Nasution refused to step down. Beginning in January 1966, university students started demonstrating against Sukarno, demanding the disbandment of PKI and for the government to control spiralling inflation. In February 1966, student demonstrators in front of Merdeka Palace were shot at by Presidential Guards, killing the student Arief Rachman Hakim, who was quickly turned into a martyr by student demonstrators.

====&quot;Supersemar&quot;====

A meeting of Sukarno&#x27;s full cabinet was held at the Merdeka Palace on 11 March 1966. As students were demonstrating against the administration, unidentified troops began to assemble outside. Sukarno, Subandrio and another minister immediately left the meeting and went to the Bogor Palace by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals (Basuki Rahmat, Amir Machmud, and Mohammad Jusuf) were dispatched to the Bogor Palace, and they met with Sukarno, who signed for them a Presidential Order known as &quot;Supersemar&quot;. Through the order, Sukarno assigned Suharto to &quot;take all measures considered necessary to guarantee security, calm and stability of the government and the revolution and to guarantee the personal safety and authority [of Sukarno]&quot;. The authorship of the document, and whether Sukarno was forced to sign, perhaps even at gunpoint, is a point of historical debate. The effect of the order, however, was the transfer of most presidential authority to Suharto. After obtaining the Presidential Order, Suharto had the PKI declared illegal, and the party was abolished. He also arrested many high-ranking officials that were loyal to Sukarno on the charge of being PKI members and/or sympathizers, further reducing Sukarno&#x27;s political power and influence.

===House arrest and death===

On 22 June 1966, Sukarno made his &quot;Nawaksara&quot; speech in front of the MPRS, now purged of communist and pro-Sukarno elements, in an unsuccessful last-ditch attempt to defend himself and his guided democracy system. In August 1966, over Sukarno&#x27;s objections, Indonesia ended its confrontation with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations. Following another unsuccessful accountability speech (&quot;Nawaksara&quot; Addendum) on 10 January 1967, Sukarno relinquished his executive powers to Suharto on 20 February 1967 while remaining nominally as titular president. He was finally stripped of his president for life title by the MPRS on 12 March 1967 in a session chaired by his former ally, Nasution. On the same day, the MPR named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was put under house arrest in Wisma Yaso (now the Satriamandala Museum), where his health deteriorated due to denial of adequate medical care. He died of kidney failure in Jakarta Army Hospital on 21 June 1970, 15 days after his 69th birthday. He was buried in Blitar, East Java.

==Political rehabilitation==
On 9 September 2024, the MPR officially revoked MPR Resolution No. XXXIII/MPRS/1967 that was used as an instrument to revoke Sukarno from presidency and barred him from politics. Since there was no trial to prove that Sukarno is responsible to G30S/PKI, MPR revoked the resolution and resolved to restore his reputation posthumously.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===

Sukarno was of Javanese and Balinese descent. He married Siti Oetari in 1921, and divorced her in 1923 to marry , whom he divorced in about 1943 to marry Fatmawati. In 1953, Sukarno married Hartini, a 30-year-old widow from Salatiga, whom he met during a reception. Fatmawati was outraged by this fourth marriage and left Sukarno and their children, although they never officially divorced. In 1958, Sukarno married Maharani Wisma Susana Siregar, an independence veteran from Liverpool who was 23 years his junior, and divorced in 1962. he was introduced to the then 19-year-old Japanese hostess Naoko Nemoto, whom he married in 1962 and renamed Ratna Dewi Sukarno. Sukarno also had four other spouses: Kartini Manoppo (1959–1968), Haryati (1963–1966), Yurike Sanger (1964–1968), and Heldy Djafar (1966–1969). Sukarno was known for his relationships with several women such as Gusti Nurul, Baby Huwae, Nurbani Yusuf, and Amelia De La Rama. In 1964, he married Rama in Jakarta and remained with her until his death in 1970. The marriage was kept as a secret until Rama mentioned it during an interview in 1979.

===Children===
Before his marriage to Fatmawati, Sukarno was married and had a daughter, Rukmini, who later became an opera singer in Italy. Megawati Sukarnoputri, who served as the fifth president of Indonesia, is his daughter by his wife Fatmawati. Her younger brother Guruh Sukarnoputra (born 1953) has inherited Sukarno&#x27;s artistic bent and is a choreographer and songwriter, who made a movie (&quot;For You, My Indonesia&quot;) about Indonesian culture. He is also a member of the Indonesian People&#x27;s Representative Council for Megawati&#x27;s Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle. His siblings Guntur Sukarnoputra, Rachmawati Sukarnoputri, and Sukmawati Sukarnoputri have all been active in politics. Sukarno had a daughter named Kartika by Dewi Sukarno. In 2006, Kartika Sukarno married Frits Seegers, the Netherlands-born chief executive officer of the Barclays Global Retail and Commercial Bank. Other children include Taufan and Bayu by his wife Hartini, a son named Totok Suryawan Sukarnoputra (born 1967, in Germany), by his wife Kartini Manoppo, and a daughter, Siti Aisyah Margaret Rose, by his wife Maharani Wisma Susana Siregar.

==Honours==
Sukarno was awarded twenty-six honorary doctorates from various international universities including Columbia University, the University of Michigan, the University of Berlin, the Al-Azhar University, the University of Belgrade, the Lomonosov University and many more, and also from domestic universities including Gadjah Mada University, the University of Indonesia, the Bandung Institute of Technology, Hasanuddin University, and Padjadjaran University.

<text>Suharto (8 June 1921 – 27 January 2008) was an Indonesian military officer and politician, who served as the second and longest serving president of Indonesia.

Suharto&#x27;s presidency and legacy are highly divisive. Widely regarded as a military dictator by international observers, Suharto led Indonesia as an authoritarian regime from 1967 until his resignation in 1998 following nationwide unrest. His 31-year rule over Indonesia is considered one of the most controversial in the 20th century due to allegations of corruption and his government&#x27;s central role to the perpetration of mass killings against communists early in his rule and subsequent discrimination of ethnic Chinese Indonesians, irreligious people, and trade unionists. However, he has been praised for making Indonesia into an economic success story, bringing stability to the region particularly during the Cold War period, and led Indonesia when it played a significant role in international affairs.

Suharto was born in Kemusuk, near the city of Yogyakarta, during the Dutch colonial era. He grew up in humble circumstances. His Javanese Muslim parents divorced not long after his birth, and he lived with foster parents for much of his childhood. During the Japanese occupation, Suharto served in the Japanese-organized Indonesian security forces. During Indonesia&#x27;s independence struggle, he joined the newly formed Indonesian Army and rose to the rank of major general some time after full Indonesian independence was achieved. An attempted coup on 30 September and 1 October 1965 was countered by Suharto-led troops. The army subsequently led a nationwide violent anti-communist purge. In March 1967, the MPRS appointed Suharto as acting President, and he was appointed President the following year. He then mounted a social campaign known as &quot;de-Sukarnoization&quot; to reduce the former president&#x27;s influence. Suharto ordered an invasion of East Timor in 1975, followed by a deadly 23-year occupation of the country and genocide. 

Under his &quot;New Order&quot; administration, Suharto constructed a strong, centralised, and military-dominated government. What started as an oligarchic military dictatorship evolved into a personalistic authoritarian regime centred around him. An ability to maintain stability over a sprawling and diverse Indonesia and an avowedly anti-communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic support of the West during the Cold War. For most of his presidency, Indonesia experienced significant industrialisation, economic growth, and improved levels of education. As a result, he was given the title &quot;Father of Development.&quot; By the 1990s, the New Order&#x27;s increasing authoritarianism and alleged widespread corruption were a source of discontent and, following the 1997 Asian financial crisis which led to widespread unrest, he resigned in May 1998.

Suharto died in January 2008 and received a state military funeral with full honors. The Indonesian government declared a week of national mourning with many world leaders paying tribute to him.

Suharto remains a controversial and divisive figure within the Indonesian general public. Many Indonesians have praised his 31-year regime for its economic development, rapid industrialisation, and perceived political stability, while others have denounced his dictatorial rule, extensive human rights violations and alleged corruption. In 2004,Transparency International ranked Suharto as one of the most corrupt leaders in modern history, having embezzled an alleged US$15–35 billion during his rule. 

Plans to award the status of National Hero to Suharto are being considered by the Indonesian government and have been debated vigorously.

==Name==
Like many Javanese, Suharto had only one name. Religious contexts in recent years had sometimes referred to him as Haji/Al-Haj Mohammed Suharto, but these names were neither part of his formal name nor generally used. The spelling &quot;Suharto&quot; reflects modern Indonesian orthography, although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was Soeharto, and he used the original spelling throughout his life. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling &quot;Suharto,&quot; while the Indonesian government and media use &quot;Soeharto.&quot;

==Early life and family==

Suharto was born on 8 June 1921 in a plaited-bamboo-walled house in the hamlet of Kemusuk, a part of the larger village of Godean, then part of the Dutch East Indies. The village is west of Yogyakarta, the cultural heartland of the Javanese. Born to ethnic Javanese parents, he was the only child of his father&#x27;s second marriage. His father, Kertosudiro, had two children from his previous marriage and was a village irrigation official. His mother, Sukirah, a local woman, was distantly related to Hamengkubuwono V by his first concubine. Five weeks after Suharto&#x27;s birth, his mother suffered a nervous breakdown; he was placed in the care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo as a result. Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto&#x27;s life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies. In 1929, Suharto&#x27;s father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near Wonogiri. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.

Prawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto with a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo&#x27;s son Sulardi, and later with his father&#x27;s relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquainted with Darjatmo, a (&quot;shaman&quot;) of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language. Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee Schakel Muhammadiyah (middle school) in the city of Yogyakarta until 1938. Suharto&#x27;s upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he is believed to have had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonisers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.

==Military service==

===Japanese occupation period===

Suharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes. Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in June 1940 and undertook basic training in Gombong near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese. Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at in Gombong to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in Cisarua. Following the Dutch surrender to the invading Japanese forces in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of the thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organized security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force.

In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the (PETA) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese , or &quot;way of the warrior,&quot; used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto&#x27;s own way of thinking. Suharto was posted to a PETA coastal defense battalion at Wates, south of Yogyakarta until he was admitted for training for (company commander) in Bogor from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in Surakarta, Jakarta, and Madiun. The Japanese surrender and Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of Mount Wilis) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed February 1945 PETA Revolt in Blitar, led by Supriyadi.

===Indonesian National Revolution===
Two days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence and were appointed president and vice-president respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment under orders from the Japanese command and returned to Yogyakarta. As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army. Based on his PETA experience, he was appointed deputy commander, and subsequently, a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organized in October 1945. Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around Magelang and Semarang and was subsequently appointed the head of a brigade as lieutenant-colonel, having earned respect as a field commander. In the early years of the war, he organized local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to Major and became Battalion X&#x27;s leader. The arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces.

Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T (&quot;Tiger&quot;) Brigade on 17 May 1946. It earned him the respect of Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organize and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces. The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the &quot;Diponegoro Division&quot;) stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946, the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for the defence of the west and southwest of Yogyakarta from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of opium through the territory he controlled, to generate income. In September 1948, Suharto was dispatched to meet Musso, chairman of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the communist uprising in Madiun.
In December 1948, the Dutch launched &quot;Operation Kraai,&quot; which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital Yogyakarta. Suharto was appointed to lead the &quot;Wehrkreise III&quot;, consisting of two battalions, which waged guerrilla warfare against the Dutch from the hills south of Yogyakarta. In dawn raids on 1 March 1949, Suharto&#x27;s forces and local militia recaptured the city, holding it until noon. Suharto&#x27;s later accounts had him as the lone plotter, although other sources say Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta, and the Panglima of the Third Division ordered the attack. However, General Abdul Nasution said that Suharto took great care in preparing the &quot;General Offensive&quot; (Indonesian: &quot;Serangan Umum&quot;). Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations, which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from the Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949. Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949.

During the Revolution, Suharto married Siti Hartinah (known as Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien&#x27;s death in 1996. The couple had six children: Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati Hariyadi (Titiek, born 1959), Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). It was characteristic of a military family’s life that three of their children were born when Suharto was on duty and away from his family. Their first child was born when Suharto was fighting in a guerrilla war outside of Yogyakarta. He did not see their first daughter for three months after her birth. Their second child, a son, was born while Suharto was serving in South Sulawesi. Another, their fifth child (and third son), was born when he was leading the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian.

===Post-independence career===

In the years following Indonesian independence, Suharto served in the Indonesian National Army, primarily in Java. In 1950, as a colonel, he led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing the Makassar uprising, a rebellion of former colonial soldiers who supported the Dutch-established State of East Indonesia and its federal entity, the United States of Indonesia. During his year in Makassar, Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours, the Habibie family, whose eldest son BJ Habibie was later Suharto&#x27;s vice-president, and went on to succeed him as president. In 1951–1952, Suharto led his troops in defeating the Islamic-inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in the Klaten area of Central Java. Appointed to lead four battalions in early 1953, he organized their participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in the Mount Merapi area. He also sought to stem leftist sympathies among his troops. His experience in this period left Suharto with a deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism.

Between 1956 and 1959, he served in the important position of commander of Diponegoro Division based in Semarang, responsible for Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces. His relationship with prominent businessmen Liem Sioe Liong and Bob Hasan, which extended throughout his presidency, began in Central Java, where he was involved in a series of &quot;profit-generating&quot; enterprises conducted primarily to keep the poorly funded military unit functioning. Army anti-corruption investigations implicated Suharto in a 1959 smuggling scandal. Relieved of his position, he was transferred to the army&#x27;s Staff and Command School () in the city of Bandung.
While in Bandung, he was promoted to brigadier-general, and in late 1960, promoted to army deputy chief of staff. On 6 March 1961, he was given an additional command, as head of the army&#x27;s new Strategic Reserve (, later Kostrad), a ready-reaction air-mobile force based in Jakarta. In January 1962, Suharto was promoted to the rank of major general and appointed to lead Operation Mandala, a joint army-navy-air force command based in Makassar. This formed the military side of the campaign to win western New Guinea from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia. In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno&#x27;s , against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that the would leave Java thinly covered by the army and hand control to the 2 million-strong Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, Ali Murtopo, to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.

==Rise to power==

===Background===
Tensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI&#x27;s proposal for a &quot;fifth armed force&quot; consisting of armed peasants and workers. However, this idea was rejected by the army&#x27;s leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces. In May, the &quot;Gilchrist Document&quot; aroused Sukarno&#x27;s fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he repeatedly mentioned during the next few months. On his independence day speech in August, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist countries and warned the army not to interfere.

While Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger, while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled. Sukarno&#x27;s Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno&#x27;s protection. They feared the imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had three million members and was particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. The party had become the most potent political party in Indonesia.

===Abortive coup and anti-communist purge===

Before dawn on 1 October 1965, six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard, Diponegoro Division, and Brawidjaja Division. Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre. At 7:10 am Untung bin Syamsuri announced on the radio that the &quot;30 September Movement&quot; had forestalled a coup attempt on Sukarno by &quot;CIA-backed power-mad generals,&quot; and that it was &quot;an internal army affair&quot;. The movement never made any attempt on Suharto&#x27;s life. Suharto had been in Jakarta army hospital that evening with his three-year-old son Tommy who had a scalding injury. It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief, a key member of the Movement and close family friend of Suharto. According to Latief&#x27;s later testimony, the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno-loyalist; hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals, upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality.

Upon being told of the killings, Suharto went to Kostrad headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilised Kostrad and RPKAD (now Kopassus) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00 pm that six generals had been kidnapped by &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He said he was in control of the army, and that he would crush the Movement and safeguard Sukarno. Suharto issued an ultimatum to Halim Air Force Base, where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander Omar Dhani and PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the airbase on 2 October after short fighting. With the failure of the poorly organized coup, and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto&#x27;s faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October). On 5 October, Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals&#x27; bodies.

Complicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup&#x27;s organizers and their aims. The army&#x27;s version, and subsequently that of the &quot;New Order,&quot; was that the PKI was solely responsible. A propaganda campaign by the army and Islamic and Catholic student groups convinced both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a communist coup attempt, and that the killings were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes. The army in alliance with civilian religious groups, and backed by the United States and other Western powers, led a campaign of mass killings to purge Indonesian society, government, and armed forces of the Communist Party of Indonesia and other leftist organizations. The purge spread from Jakarta to much of the rest of the country. The most widely accepted estimates are that at least 500,000 to over 1 million were killed. As many as 1.5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another. As a result of the purge, one of Sukarno&#x27;s three pillars of support, the Indonesian Communist Party, was effectively eliminated by the other two, the military and political Islam. The CIA described the purge as &quot;one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century.&quot;

===Power struggle===

Sukarno continued to command loyalty from large sections of the armed forces as well as the general population, and Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats. In January 1966, university students under the banner of KAMI, began demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of the PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection from the army. Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.

In February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full general in July 1966). The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno&#x27;s order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace (60 km away) by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals, Major General Basuki Rahmat, Brigadier General M. Jusuf, and Brigadier General Amir Machmud went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see &quot;Supersemar&quot;) that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security. Using the &quot;Supersemar&quot; letter, Suharto ordered the banning of the PKI the following day and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers.

The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint a new cabinet consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the MPRS (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each service. In June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of Marxism–Leninism, ratifying the &quot;Supersemar&quot;, and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Crucially, it also resolved that if Sukarno were unable to carry out his duties, the holder of the &quot;Supersemar&quot;—Suharto—would become acting president. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year). Suharto did not seek Sukarno&#x27;s outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among some elements of the armed forces. By January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces. After Sukarno gave his version of events, the MPRS concluded that he had been derelict in his duties and decided to hold another session to impeach him. On 20 February 1967, facing an increasingly untenable situation, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency. Later, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power on 12 March and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS elected Suharto for a full five-year term as president.

==The &quot;New Order&quot; (1967–1998)==

===Ideology===

Suharto promoted his &quot;New Order,&quot; as opposed to Sukarno&#x27;s &quot;Old Order,&quot; as a society based on the Pancasila ideology. After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organizations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as a fundamental principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto&#x27;s government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as &quot;anti-Pancasila.&quot; The New Order also implemented the &quot;Dwifungsi&quot; (&quot;Dual Function&quot;) policy which enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of the Indonesian government, economy, and society.

===Consolidation of power===
Having been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere &quot;primus inter pares&quot;, and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-communist purge. Suharto, aided by his &quot;Office of Personal Assistants&quot; () clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly Ali Murtopo, began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives. Having successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General Abdul Haris Nasution&#x27;s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals Hartono Rekso Dharsono, Kemal Idris, and Sarwo Edhie Wibowo (dubbed &quot;New Order radicals&quot;) opposed Suharto&#x27;s decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological two-party system similar to those found in many Western countries. Suharto sent Dharsono overseas as an ambassador, while Idris and Wibowo were sent to distant North Sumatra and South Sulawesi as regional commanders.

Suharto&#x27;s previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his administration. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement () were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections ( movement), the costly construction of the Taman Mini Indonesia Indah theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists (Malari Incident of 1974), and the lack of term limits of Suharto&#x27;s presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, Adnan Buyung Nasution, Hariman Siregar, and Syahrir), and even sending troops to occupy the campus of ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology) from January–March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing a decree on &quot;Normalisation of Campus Life&quot; (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.

On 15–16 January 1974, Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in Jakarta during a visit by the Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors were encouraged by General Sumitro, deputy commander of the armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto&#x27;s Aspri inner circle. Suharto learned that the riots were engineered by Sumitro to destabilise the government, resulting in Sumitro&#x27;s dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred to as the Malari incident (, Disaster of 15 January). However, Suharto also disbanded to appease popular dissent. In 1980, fifty prominent political figures signed the Petition of Fifty, which criticised Suharto&#x27;s use of Pancasila to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners&#x27; concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.

===Domestic policy and political stability===

To placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a parliament (, MPR) with the power to elect presidents, consisting of the House of Representatives (, DPR) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR would be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political organizations based on results of the general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.

To participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno&#x27;s old party, the PNI, in 1969 Suharto decided to take over control of an obscure military-run federation of NGOs called Golkar (&quot;Functional Groups&quot;) and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right-hand man Ali Murtopo. The first general election was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants; consisting of Golkar, four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of &quot;development,&quot; and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics, Golkar managed to secure 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly elected Suharto to a second-term in office, with Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX as his vice president.

On 5 January 1973, to allow better control, the government forced the four Islamic parties to merge into PPP (, United Development Party) while the five non-Islamic parties were fused into PDI (, Indonesian Democratic Party). The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership while establishing the &quot;re-call&quot; system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system, dubbed &quot;Pancasila Democracy,&quot; Suharto was re-elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998. Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election, ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition. 

Suharto took great care to make it appear that his regime appeared to observe the tenets of the constitution. On paper, the president was the &quot;mandatary of the MPR,&quot; responsible for implementing the &quot;Broad Lines of State Policy&quot; (GBHN) developed by the MPR. Near the end of each of his terms, Suharto delivered &quot;accountability speeches&quot; to the MPR that outlined the achievements of his administration and demonstrated how he had adhered to the GBHN. Additionally, the president had the power to issue regulations in lieu of law, but such regulations had to be approved by the House of People&#x27;s Representatives (DPR) to remain in effect. In practice, however, Golkar&#x27;s landslide majorities in the DPR and MPR made such approval a mere formality. Combined with the DPR&#x27;s infrequent sessions (it usually sat for only one session per year), Suharto was able to effectively rule by decree for most of his tenure.

Suharto also proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicised &quot;floating mass&quot; supportive of the national mission of &quot;development&quot;, a concept similar to corporatism. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created the KORPRI () in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organized the FBSI () as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the MUI in 1975 to control Islamic clerics.

===Internal security and social policy===
Additionally, Suharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organized by the Kopkamtib (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army&#x27;s territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the &quot;Dwifungsi&quot; (&quot;Dual Function&quot;) of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia&#x27;s provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised &quot;Operasi Trisula&quot; which destroyed PKI remnants trying to organize a guerrilla base in the Blitar area in 1968 and ordered several military operations that ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in West Kalimantan (1967–1972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of Free Aceh Movement separatists under Hasan di Tiro in 1977 led to the dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement&#x27;s members to flee abroad. Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight by Islamic extremists at Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok.

In 1968, Suharto commenced the highly successful family-planning program (&quot;Keluarga Berentjana/KB&quot;) to stem the high population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972. To promote assimilation of the influential Chinese-Indonesians, the Suharto government passed several laws as part of the so-called &quot;Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem&quot;, whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the Army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including the display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were seized and turned into Indonesian-language public schools, and the ethnic-Chinese were forced to take-up Indonesian-sounding names; creating a systematic cultural genocide. In 1978, the government began requiring a Letter of Proof of Citizenship of the Republic of Indonesia (, or SBKRI). Although the SBKRI was legally required for all citizens of foreign descent, in practice it was generally applied only to Chinese descent. This led to difficulties for Chinese Indonesians when enrolling in state universities, applying to be civil servants, or joining the military or police.

===Economic policy===

To stabilise the economy and to ensure long-term support for the New Order, Suharto&#x27;s administration enlisted a group of mostly US-educated Indonesian economists, dubbed the &quot;Berkeley Mafia&quot;, to formulate significant changes in economic policy. By cutting subsidies, decreasing government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation was lowered from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of famine was alleviated by the influx of USAID rice aid shipments from 1967 to 1968. With a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno&#x27;s economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment through the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as Astra Group and Salim Group.

From 1967, the government secured low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit. With the IGGI funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the 1973 oil crisis, the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans, dubbed REPELITA (&quot;Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun&quot;) I to VI from 1969 to 1998. Outside the formal economy, Suharto created a network of charitable organizations (&quot;yayasan&quot;) run by the military and his family members, which extracted &quot;donations&quot; from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits. While some proceeds were used for charitable purposes, much of the money was recycled as a slush fund to reward political allies and to maintain support for the New Order. In 1975, the state-owned oil company, Pertamina, defaulted on its foreign loans as a result of mismanagement and corruption under the leadership of Suharto&#x27;s close ally, Ibnu Sutowo. The government bail-out of the company nearly doubled the national debt.

===Foreign policy===
Upon assuming power, Suharto&#x27;s government adopted a policy of neutrality in the Cold War but was nevertheless quietly aligned with the Western bloc (including Japan and South Korea) to secure support for Indonesia&#x27;s economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto&#x27;s strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. Diplomatic relations with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in the 30 September Movement (diplomatic relations were only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto&#x27;s destruction of the PKI, the Soviet Union embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister Adam Malik managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with Malaysia in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organization is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing Vietnam War.

In 1974, the neighbouring colony of Portuguese Timor descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the Carnation Revolution, whereby the left-wing populist Fretilin (Portuguese: &quot;Frente Revolucionária de Timor-Leste Independente&quot;) emerged triumphant. With approval from Western countries (including from U.S. president Gerald Ford and Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene. He claimed the move was to prevent the establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups UDT and APODETI, Suharto authorised a full-scale invasion of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia&#x27;s 27th province of East Timor in July 1976. The &quot;encirclement and annihilation&quot; campaigns of 1977–1979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing guerrilla resistance caused the government to maintain a strong military force in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during Indonesian rule (1974–1999); namely, 17,600–19,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 &#x27;excess&#x27; deaths from hunger and illness; Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70% of the violent deaths.

Indonesia&#x27;s invasion and occupation of East Timor during Suharto&#x27;s presidency resulted in at least 100,000 deaths. To comply with the New York Agreement of 1962 which required a plebiscite on the integration of West Irian into Indonesia before the end of 1969, the Suharto government begin organizing for a so-called &quot;Act of Free Choice&quot; scheduled for July–August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under Sarwo Edhie Wibowo which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch-organized militia (&quot;Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps / PVK&quot;) at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963 while sending Catholic volunteers under Jusuf Wanandi to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite would be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by the United Nations General Assembly in November 1969.

===Socio-economic progress===
Real socio-economic progress sustained support for Suharto&#x27;s regime across three decades. By 1996, Indonesia&#x27;s poverty rate has dropped to around 11% compared with 45% in 1970. From 1966 to 1997, Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5.03% pa, pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US$806 to US$4,114. In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP, and 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested in massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of a series of Palapa telecommunication satellites); consequently, Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalize on such achievements to justify his presidency, and the parliament (MPR) on 9 March 1983 granted him the title of &quot;Father of Development&quot;.

Suharto government&#x27;s health-care programs (such as the &quot;Puskesmas&quot; program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60%. The government&#x27;s &quot;Inpres&quot; program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating the education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia achieving rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from the FAO in November 1985. In the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the 1980s oil glut by successfully shifting the basis of the economy to export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia&#x27;s low wages and a series of currency devaluations. Industrialisation was mostly undertaken by Chinese-Indonesian companies which evolved into large conglomerates dominating the nation&#x27;s economy.
The largest of these conglomerates were the Salim Group led by Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim), Sinar Mas Group led by Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja), Astra Group led by Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya), Lippo Group led by Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady), Barito Pacific Group led by Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu), and Nusamba Group led by Bob Hasan. Suharto decided to support the growth of a small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they would not pose a political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his experience, he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto&#x27;s patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his &quot;regime maintenance&quot; activities.

In the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing a domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the &quot;October Package of 1988&quot; (&quot;PAKTO 88&quot;) which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in the number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the &quot;TABANAS&quot; program to the populace. The Jakarta Stock Exchange, re-opened in 1977, recorded a &quot;bull run&quot;, due to a spree of domestic IPOs and an influx of foreign funds after the deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled robust economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997, which eventually lead to the end of Suharto&#x27;s presidency.

===Growing corruption===
The growth of the economy coincided with the rapid expansion of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (&quot;Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN&quot;). In the early 1980s, Suharto&#x27;s children, particularly Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (&quot;Tutut&quot;), Hutomo Mandala Putra (&quot;Tommy&quot;), and Bambang Trihatmodjo, had grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the toll-expressway market which was monopolised by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market, monopolised by 21 Cineplex (owned by Suharto&#x27;s cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000 km2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000 m2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto&#x27;s family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia&#x27;s most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto&#x27;s ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish &quot;strategic partnerships&quot; with Suharto family companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of &quot;yayasan&quot;s run by the Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in &quot;donations&quot; from the public and private sectors each year.

In 1997, Forbes magazine listed Suharto as the fourth richest person in the world with an individual net worth of $16 billion, despite drawing an annual salary in his last peak year of only $21,000. The Suharto family owned or controlled 3.6 million hectares of prime Indonesian land, an area comparable to all of Belgium, and directly owned or had controlling equity in at least 564 companies, with no Indonesian economic sector untouched. With $100,000 of seed capital, Tommy Suharto got his start in 1984 at age 22. Within ten weeks his Humpuss Group already had twenty subsidiaries, which soon ballooned to sixty. A year later he acquired Perta Oil Marketing, a subsidiary of the state oil company Pertamina, instantly making him a major crude-oil broker and transporter. Perta generated profits of $1 million per month. Most of Indonesia&#x27;s toll roads were built and operated by the stateowned firm Jasa Marga, with untold markups and opportunities for skimming and theft for oligarchs as the projects were completed. In 1989, Suharto issued a decree granting his daughter Tutut 75% of profits from all toll roads her group operated jointly with Jasa Marga, driving costs up still further. Bambang positioned his group as a partner of major foreign power companies and forced the state-run power company, PLN, to buy electricity at inflated rates. According to one estimate from the 24 May 1999 cover story in the international issue of Time magazine, the total wealth amassed by the Suharto family over three decades in power was $73.24 billion. Setting aside $9 billion earned from interest on deposits, three-fourths of this wealth was derived from grabbing the country&#x27;s oil, gas, and mining resources, or muscling in on state corporations and major government contracts. The entrepreneurial value added from these Suharto family companies was, by all accounts, almost zero.

In early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believed to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades; in order of amount allegedly stolen in USD, the highest-ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $15 billion – $35 billion.

===The 1980s and 1990s===

By the 1980s, Suharto&#x27;s grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, and use of the military&#x27;s coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organization of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hard-line approach on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto. From 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate (see &quot;Petrus killings&quot;). Suharto&#x27;s imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions.

The Tanjung Priok massacre saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of Borobudur, led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and Abu Bakar Bashir (later leader of Jemaah Islamiyah). Attacks on police by a resurgent Free Aceh Movement in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating license (&quot;Surat Izin Usaha Penerbitan Pers, SIUPP&quot;) which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.

With the end of communism and the Cold War, Suharto&#x27;s human rights record came under greater international scrutiny, particularly following the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre in East Timor. Suharto was elected as head of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1992, while Indonesia became a founding member of APEC in 1989 and host to the Bogor APEC Summit in 1994. Domestically, the business dealings of Suharto&#x27;s family created discontent among the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. The March 1988 MPR session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of Sudharmono, a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. Moerdani&#x27;s criticism of the Suharto family&#x27;s corruption saw the president dismiss him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly &quot;de-militarise&quot; his regime; he dissolved the powerful Kopkamtib in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.
In an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicised hajj pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented the dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI) in November 1990, which was led by his protégé B.J. Habibie, the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with the April 1994 riot in Medan. By the 1990s, Suharto&#x27;s government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as Habibie, Harmoko, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, and Akbar Tanjung, who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie&#x27;s growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie&#x27;s purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded East German Navy in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994. In 1993, the Purna Bhakti Pertiwi Museum was opened on the initiative of Tien Suharto. It houses and displays Suharto collections including artworks and souvenirs, received from various world leaders and Indonesian people.

In the 1990s, elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto&#x27;s economic development were becoming restless with his autocracy and the corruption of his children, fuelling demands for &quot;Reformasi&quot; (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. A significant element of the middle class had no memory of the events leading up to Suharto&#x27;s rise to power. By 1996, Sukarno&#x27;s daughter, Megawati Sukarnoputri, chairwoman of the normally compliant PDI, was becoming an opposition figure for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by Suryadi, which ousted Megawati as PDI leader. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General Sutiyoso on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped, and some killed, by army squads led by Suharto&#x27;s son-in-law, Major-General Prabowo Subianto. In 1995, Suharto released a special 1,54 troy ounce gold coin worth of 850,000 rupiah with his face on one side of the coin in the celebration of 50th anniversary of Indonesian Independence. On 5 October 1997, he awarded himself and generals Sudirman and Abdul Haris Nasution the honorary rank of five-star &quot;grand general.&quot;

==Economic crisis and downfall==

===Asian financial crisis===
Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7%, leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country.

Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country&#x27;s dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised an interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998, which further worsened the contraction of the economy. In December 1997, Suharto did not attend an ASEAN presidents&#x27; summit for the first time, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing rupiah.

However, his attempts to re-instil confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the most stringent requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership. The economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in Situbondo (1996), Tasikmalaya (1996), Banjarmasin (1997), and Makassar (1997); violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and Madurese settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997. Golkar won the rigged 1997 election, and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He nominated his protégé B. J. Habibie as vice president then stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates, including his eldest daughter Tutut as Minister of Social Affairs. The appointments and the government&#x27;s unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability, rumours, and panic; which led to a run on stores and pushed up prices. The government increased the fuel prices further by 70% in May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in Medan.

===Fall and resignation===

With Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country&#x27;s mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician Amien Rais, spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998 university students began organizing nationwide demonstrations. The crisis climaxed while Suharto was on a state visit to Egypt on 12 May 1998, when security forces killed four demonstrators from Jakarta&#x27;s Trisakti University. Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General Wiranto and Army Strategic Commander Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.

On 16 May, tens of thousands of university students demanded Suharto&#x27;s resignation, and occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building. Upon Suharto&#x27;s return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution. Documents from the United States Department of State indicate that the Clinton Administration sought to maintain close ties with the Indonesian military in the aftermath of Suharto&#x27;s fall from power.

==Post-presidency==
===Corruption charges===
After resigning from the presidency, Suharto became a recluse in his family&#x27;s compound in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto&#x27;s family spent much of their time fending off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from grave prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999. In May 1999, &quot;Time Asia&quot; estimated Suharto&#x27;s family fortune at US$15 billion in cash, shares, corporate assets, real estate, jewellery and fine art. Suharto sued the magazine seeking more than US$27 billion in damages for libel over the article. On 10 September 2007, Indonesia&#x27;s Supreme Court awarded Suharto damages against &quot;Time Asia&quot; magazine, ordering it to pay him one trillion rupiah ($128.59 million). The High Court reversed the judgment of an appellate court and Central Jakarta district court (made in 2000 and 2001).

Suharto was placed highest on Transparency International&#x27;s list of corrupt leaders with alleged misappropriation of between US$15–35 billion during his 32-year presidency. On 29 May 2000, Suharto was placed under house arrest when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to one of several foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. However, in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002, but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110 m (£55 m).

In 2002, Suharto&#x27;s son Tommy Suharto was sentenced to 15 years&#x27; jail for ordering the killing of a judge (who had previously convicted him of corruption), illegal weapons possession, and fleeing justice. In 2006, he was paroled on &quot;conditional release&quot;. In 2003, Suharto&#x27;s half-brother Probosutedjo was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the &quot;judicial mafia&quot; which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on 30 November 2005. On 9 July 2007, Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against Suharto, to recover state funds ($440 million or £219 million, which allegedly disappeared from a scholarship fund, and a further $1.1 billion in damages).

===Illness and death===
After resigning from the presidency, Suharto was hospitalised repeatedly for stroke, heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute him as his lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial. Moreover, there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him. In 2006, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto&#x27;s health and fitness for trial. One physician, Brigadier-General Dr Marjo Subiandono, stated his doubts about by noting that &quot;[Suharto] has two permanent cerebral defects.&quot; In a later &quot;Financial Times&quot; report, Attorney General Abdurrahman discussed the re-examination, and called it part of a &quot;last opportunity&quot; to prosecute Suharto criminally. Attorney General Abdurrahman left open the possibility of filing suit against the Suharto estate.

On 4 January 2008, Suharto was taken to the Pertamina Central Hospital, Jakarta with complications arising from poor health, swelling of limbs and stomach, and partial renal failure. His health fluctuated for several weeks but progressively worsened with anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart and kidney complications, internal bleeding, fluid on his lungs, and blood in his faeces and urine which caused a haemoglobin drop. On 23 January, Suharto&#x27;s health worsened further, as a sepsis infection spread through his body. His family consented to the removal of life support machines if his condition did not improve, and he died on 27 January at 1:09 pm.

Minutes after his death, then-Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a news conference declaring Suharto as one of Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;best sons&quot; and invited the country to give the highest respect and honour to the ex-president. Suharto&#x27;s body was taken from Jakarta to the Astana Giribangun mausoleum complex in Karanganyar Regency, near the Central Java city of Solo. He was buried alongside his late wife in a state military funeral with full honours, with the Kopassus elite forces and KOSTRAD commandos as the honour guard and pallbearers and Commander of Group II Kopassus Surakarta Lt. Colonel Asep Subarkah. In attendance were President Yudhoyono, who presided over the ceremony, as well as the vice-president, government ministers, and armed forces chiefs of staff. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to see the convoy. Condolences were offered by many regional heads of state. President Yudhoyono that afternoon declared a week of official mourning starting from Suharto&#x27;s day of death. During this period, all flags of Indonesia were flown at half-mast.

==Legacy &amp; political rehabilitation==
Starting in the early 2010s, the Javanese language slogan “Piye kabare, penak jamanku to?” (English: &quot;How are you doing? It was better in my time, right?&quot;) featuring pictures of Suharto was heavily distributed around Indonesia in many forms, such as stickers, t-shirts and on the internet. The slogan can also be found on political campaign billboards and affixed to public transportation, such as minibuses as well as trucks and pedicabs. 

Surveys of Indonesians done in 2011 and 2018 have found Suharto to be the most successful in carrying out his duties as president.

On 25 September 2024, in one of its last acts for the 2019–2024 period, the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly repealed Clause 4 of MPR Resolution No. XI/MPR/1998, which had accused Suharto and his cronies of acts of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (Clause 4 specifically named Suharto). The stated reason for this was because Suharto was never put on trial for these accusations before his death in 2008. This move has reignited debate as to whether Suharto should be awarded the National Hero status.

===Places and statue===
Suharto&#x27;s childhood house in Kemusuk is currently a memorial museum, called &quot;Memorial Jenderal Besar HM Soeharto&quot;. A statue of him stands in front of the museum. It was built by Probosutedjo and was inaugurated in 2013.

FELDA Soeharto, a village in Selangor, is named after him. He visited the village in 1970 as part of a momentous visit to normalize the Indonesia–Malaysia relations.

Istiklal Mosque in Sarajevo was initiated by Suharto as a gift for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to replace the hundreds of mosques destroyed during the Bosnian War. Suharto famously visited Sarajevo in 1995 to help mediate the ongoing conflict (even though a UN-owned aircraft that passed through Bosnia was shot down two days earlier). The mosque is sometimes referred by locals as the &quot;Suharto Mosque&quot;.

<text>Mary Baker (née Willcocks; 11 November 1792 , Witheridge, Devonshire, England – 24 December 1864, Bristol, England) was an English impostor. Posing as the fictional Princess Caraboo, Baker pretended to come from a far-off island kingdom and fooled a British town for some months.

==Biography==

On 3 April 1817, a cobbler in Almondsbury in Gloucestershire, England, met an apparently disoriented young woman wearing exotic clothes who was speaking an incomprehensible language. The cobbler&#x27;s wife took this stranger to the Overseer of the Poor, who placed her in the hands of the local county magistrate, Samuel Worrall, who lived in Knole Park on the estate where Tower House is located. Worrall and his American-born wife Elizabeth could not understand her either; what they did determine was that she called herself Caraboo and that she was interested in Chinese imagery. They sent her to the local inn, where she identified a drawing of a pineapple with the word , meaning pineapple in Indonesian languages, and insisted on sleeping on the floor. Samuel Worrall declared she was a beggar and should be taken to Bristol and tried for vagrancy.

During her imprisonment, a Portuguese sailor named Manuel Eynesso (or Enes) said he spoke her language and translated her story. According to Enes, she was Princess Caraboo from the island of Javasu in the Indian Ocean. She had been captured by pirates and after a long voyage she had jumped overboard in the Bristol Channel and swum ashore.

The Worralls took Caraboo to their home. For ten weeks, this representative of exotic royalty was a favourite of the local dignitaries. She used a bow and arrow, fenced, swam naked and prayed to a god, whom she named Allah-Talla (a spelling variation of , &quot;Allah the Exalted,&quot; one of the formal names for God in Islam). She acquired exotic clothing and her portrait was painted and reproduced in local newspapers. Her authenticity was attested to by a Dr. Wilkinson, who identified her language using Edmund Fry&#x27;s &quot;Pantographia&quot; (an encyclopedia of known alphabets and scripts) and stated that marks on the back of her head were the work of oriental surgeons. Newspapers published stories about Princess Caraboo&#x27;s adventures bringing her national acclaim.
Eventually the truth surfaced. A boarding-house keeper, Mrs. Neale, recognised her from the picture in the &quot;Bristol Journal&quot; and informed her hosts. This would-be princess was in truth Mary Willcocks, a cobbler&#x27;s daughter from Witheridge, Devon. She had been a servant girl around England but had found no place to stay. She invented her fictitious language from imaginary and Romani words and created an exotic character and story. The odd marks on her head were scars from a crude cupping operation in a poorhouse hospital in London. The British press made much of the hoax at the expense of the duped rustic middle-class. Mrs. Worrall took pity on her and arranged for her to travel to Philadelphia, for which she departed on 28 June 1817.

On 13 September 1817 a letter was printed in the &quot;Bristol Journal&quot;, allegedly from Sir Hudson Lowe, the official in charge of the exiled Emperor Napoleon on St Helena. It claimed that after the Philadelphia-bound ship bearing the beautiful Caraboo had been driven close to the island by a tempest, the intrepid princess impulsively cut herself adrift in a small boat, rowed ashore and so fascinated the emperor that he was applying to the Pope for a dispensation to marry her. That story is unverified and not credible, given that St Helena is an isolated rock in the South Atlantic, many thousands of miles from the USA.

In the United States, she briefly continued her role, appearing on-stage at the Washington Hall, Philadelphia, as &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot;, with little success. Her last contact with the Worralls was in a letter from New York in November 1817, in which she complained of her notoriety. She appears to have returned to Philadelphia until she left America in 1824, returning to England.

In 1824 she returned to Britain and exhibited herself for a short time in New Bond Street, London, as &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot; but her act was not successful. She may have briefly travelled to France and Spain in her guise, but soon returned to England.

===Later life and death===
In September 1828, she was living as a widow in Bedminster in Somerset under the name Mary Burgess (in reality the name of a cousin). There she married Richard Baker, and gave birth to a daughter named Mary Ann the following year around 1829. In 1839, she was selling leeches to the Bristol Infirmary Hospital. She died from a fall on 24 December 1864 and was buried in the Hebron Road cemetery in Bristol. Her daughter carried on with her business, living alone in Bedminster in a house full of cats until her death in a fire in February 1900.

==In popular culture==
===Film===
A biopic, &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot;, written by Michael Austin and John Wells and starring Phoebe Cates, was released to mixed reviews in 1994. In common with most biopics, it added fictional elements to the story.

===Literature===
&quot;The Curious Tale of Princess Caraboo&quot;, a historical novel by Catherin Johnson, was published in 2015.

===Theatre===
Several stage musical adaptations have been attempted based on the story. These include a 2004 workshop starring Laura Benanti entitled &quot;Caraboo.&quot; &quot;Princess Caraboo&quot;, a full stage musical, opened on 30 March 2016 at London&#x27;s Finborough Theatre, with a book and lyrics written by Phil Willmott and composed by Mark Collins. The limited-run production opened to positive reviews and earned the Best New Musical and Best Lighting Design nominations at the Off West End Theatre Awards.

===Comics===
&quot;Princess Caraboo&quot; was a 2016 French language bande dessinée by Antoine Ozanam and Julia Bax.

<text>George Psalmanazar ( 1679 – 3 May 1763) was a Frenchman who claimed to be the first native of Formosa (today Taiwan) to visit Europe. For some years, he convinced many in Britain, but he was eventually revealed to be of European origin. He subsequently became a theological essayist, and a friend and acquaintance of Samuel Johnson and other noted figures in 18th-century literary London.

==Early life==
Although Psalmanazar intentionally obscured many details of his early life, it is believed that he was born in southern France, perhaps in Languedoc or Provence, some time between 1679 and 1684. His birth name is unknown. According to his posthumously published autobiography, he was educated in a Franciscan school and then a Jesuit academy. In both these institutions he claimed to have been celebrated by his teachers for what he called &quot;my uncommon genius for languages&quot;. Indeed, by his own account Psalmanazar was something of a child prodigy. He claims that he attained fluency in Latin by the age of seven or eight, and excelled in competition with children twice his age. Later encounters with a sophistic philosophy tutor made him disenchanted with academicism, however, and he discontinued his education around the time he was fifteen or sixteen.

==Career as an impostor==

===Continental Europe===
In order to travel safely and affordably in France, Psalmanazar first pretended to be an Irish pilgrim on his way to Rome. After learning English, forging a passport, and stealing a pilgrim&#x27;s cloak and staff from the reliquary of a local church he set off, but he soon found that many people he met were familiar with Ireland and were able to see through his disguise.
Deciding that a more exotic disguise was needed, Psalmanazar drew upon the missionary reports about East Asia that he had heard of from his Jesuit tutors and decided to impersonate a Japanese Christian convert. At some point he further embellished this new persona by pretending to be a &quot;Japanese &quot;. Due to a lack of Western knowledge of Japanese cultures, Psalmanazar displayed fictitious customs to convince the public of the authenticity of his background. These so-called customs included eating raw meat spiced with cardamom and sleeping while sitting upright in a chair.

Having failed to reach Rome, Psalmanazar travelled through various German principalities between 1700 and 1702. In the latter year, he appeared in the Netherlands, where he served as an occasional mercenary and soldier. By this time, he had shifted his supposed homeland from Japan to the even more obscure Formosa (Taiwan), and had developed more elaborate customs, such as following a foreign calendar, worshipping the Sun and the Moon with complex propitiatory rites of his own invention, and even speaking an invented language.

In late 1702, Psalmanazar met the Scottish priest Alexander Innes, who was the chaplain of a Scottish army unit. Afterwards Innes claimed that he had converted the heathen to Christianity and christened him George Psalmanazar (after the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V, who is referenced in the Bible). In 1703, they left via Rotterdam for London, where they planned to meet Anglican clergymen.

===England===

When they reached London, news of the exotic foreigner with bizarre habits spread quickly and Psalmanazar achieved a high level of fame. His appeal not only derived from his exotic ways, which tapped into a growing domestic interest in travel narratives describing faraway locales, but also played upon the prevailing anti-Catholic and anti-Jesuit religious sentiment of early 18th-century Britain. Central to his narrative was his claim to have been abducted from Formosa by malevolent Jesuits and taken to France, where he had steadfastly refused to become a Catholic. Psalmanazar declared himself to be a reformed heathen who now practised Anglicanism. He became a favourite of the Bishop of London Henry Compton and other esteemed members of London society.

Building upon this growing interest in his life, Psalmanazar published a book in 1704, &quot;An Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa, an Island subject to the Emperor of Japan&quot;. This book purported to be a detailed description of Formosan customs, geography and political economy; it was in fact completely fabricated. The &quot;facts&quot; contained in the book are an amalgam of other travel reports, especially influenced by accounts of the Aztec and Inca civilisations in the New World, and by embellished descriptions of Japan. Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; may also have served as an inspiration. Some of his claims about Japanese religion seem to also be derived from a misinterpretation of the Chinese idea of three teachings, as he claims that there were three different forms of &quot;idolatry&quot; practiced in Japan.

According to Psalmanazar, Formosa was a prosperous country with a capital city called Xternetsa. Men walked naked except for a gold or silver plate to cover their genitals. Their main food was a serpent that they hunted with branches. Formosans were polygamous and husbands had a right to eat their wives for infidelity. They executed murderers by hanging them upside down and shooting them full of arrows. Every year they sacrificed the hearts of 18,000 young boys to gods, and their priests ate the bodies in an act of cannibalism. They used horses and camels for transport, and dwelled underground in circular houses.

===Pseudo-lexicographer===
Psalmanazar&#x27;s book also described the Formosan language, an early example of a constructed language. His efforts in this regard were so convincing that German grammarians included samples of his so-called &quot;Formosan alphabet&quot;, in books about language, well into the 19th century, even after his larger imposture had been exposed.

Psalmanazar&#x27;s book was an unqualified success. It went through two English editions, and French and German editions followed. After its publication, Psalmanazar was invited to lecture on Formosan culture and language before several learned societies, and it was even proposed that he be summoned to lecture at the University of Oxford. In the most famous of these engagements he spoke before the Royal Society, where he was challenged by Edmond Halley.

Psalmanazar was frequently challenged by sceptics, but for the most part he managed to deflect criticism of his core claims. He explained, for instance, that his pale skin was due to the fact that the upper classes of Formosa lived underground. The contradictory testimony of Jesuits who had actually worked as missionaries in Formosa was not believed, probably because of anti-Jesuit prejudice.

The Formosan constructed language has been assigned the codes and in the ConLang Code Registry.

==Later life==

===Chaplain and theological essayist===
Innes eventually went to Portugal as chaplain general to the British forces. By then, however, he had developed an opium addiction and had become involved in several misguided business ventures, including a failed effort to market decorated fans purported to be from Formosa. Psalmanazar&#x27;s claims became increasingly less credible as time went on and knowledge of Formosa from other sources began to contradict his claims. His energetic defence of his imposture began to slacken and in 1706 he confessed, first to friends and then to the general public. By then London society had largely grown tired of the &quot;Formosan craze&quot;.

In the following years Psalmanazar worked for a time as a clerk in an army regiment until some clergymen gave him money to study theology. Psalmanazar then participated in the literary milieu of Grub Street, writing pamphlets, editing books and undertaking other low-paid and unglamorous tasks. He learned Hebrew, co-authored Samuel Palmer&#x27;s &quot;A General History of Printing&quot; (1732), and contributed a number of articles to the &quot;Universal History&quot;. He even contributed to &quot;A Complete System of Geography&quot; and wrote about the real conditions in Formosa, pointedly criticising the hoax he himself had perpetrated. He appears to have become increasingly religious and disowned his youthful impostures. This newfound religiosity culminated in his anonymous publication of a book of theological essays in 1753.

===Friend of Samuel Johnson and others===
Although this last phase of Psalmanazar&#x27;s life brought him far less fame than his earlier career as a fraud, it resulted in some remarkable historical coincidences. Perhaps the most famous of these is the elderly Psalmanazar&#x27;s unlikely friendship with the young Samuel Johnson, who was also a Grub Street hack (writer for hire). In later years Johnson recalled that Psalmanazar had been well known in his neighbourhood as an eccentric but saintly figure, &quot;whereof he was so well known and esteemed, that scarce any person, even children, passed him without showing him signs of respect&quot;.

Psalmanazar also interacted with a number of other important English literary figures of his age. In the early months of 1741 he appears to have sent the novelist Samuel Richardson an unsolicited bundle of forty handwritten pages in which he attempted to continue the plotline of Richardson&#x27;s immensely popular epistolary novel &quot;Pamela&quot;. Richardson called Psalmanazar&#x27;s attempted sequel &quot;ridiculous and improbable&quot;. In &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; Jonathan Swift ridicules Psalmanazar in passing, sardonically citing &quot;the famous Salamanaazor, a Native of the island of Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty Years ago,&quot; as an eminent proponent of cannibalism. A novel by Tobias Smollett refers mockingly to &quot;Psalmanazar, who, after having drudged half a century in the literary mill in all the simplicity and abstinence of an Asiatic, subsists on the charity of a few booksellers, just sufficient to keep him from the parish&quot;.

===Death and memoirs===

George Psalmanazar died on 3 May 1763 in Ironmonger Row, London, England. In his will, completed the previous year, he styled himself a poor, sinful and worthless creature; he directed that his body should be committed to the common burying ground, in the humblest and cheapest manner; and he solemnly declared that his History of Formosa was a base and shameful imposture, a fraud on the public. He left behind him an autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of ****, Commonly Known by the Name of George Psalmanazar; a Reputed Native of Formosa,&quot; which first appeared in 1764. The book withholds his real birth name, which is still unknown, but contains a wealth of detail about his early life and the development of his impostures.

<doc id="217518" wikidata="Q1389007" url="?curid=217518" title="Guru's Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1">
<text>&quot;Jazzmatazz&quot;, Volume 1: An Experimental Fusion of Hip-Hop and Jazz, is the debut solo studio album by American hip hop recording artist Guru. It was released on May 18, 1993, by Chrysalis Records. The recording sessions took place at D&amp;D Studios, in New York. The album was produced by Guru, who also served as executive producer with Duff Marlowe and Patrick Moxey.

The album combines a live jazz band performance with hip hop production and rapping. It features contributions from singers N&#x27;Dea Davenport, Carleen Anderson, Dee C Lee, French rapper MC Solaar, and musicians Simon Law, Branford Marsalis, Courtney Pine, Donald Byrd, Gary Barnacle, Lonnie Liston Smith, Ronny Jordan, Roy Ayers and Zachary Breaux.

Guru, quoted in the album&#x27;s liner notes, talked about his natural affinity for both jazz and rap. &quot;Jazz&#x27;s mellow tracks, along with the hard rap beat, go hand-in-glove with my voice&quot;, he said.

The album made it to number 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 15 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums in the United States. In spite of the lagging American sales, &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot;, Vol. 1 was a commercial success in Europe, where jazz was much more popular in the 1990s. It peaked at No. 43 in Germany, No. 49 in Sweden, No. 58 in the UK, No. 67 in the Netherlands, and No. 139 in France. It also apeaked at No. 24 in New Zealand, Oceania. Its lead single &quot;Trust Me&quot; peaked at No. 34 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 105 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Its second single, &quot;No Time to Play&quot;, peaked at No. 25 in the UK. &quot;SPIN&quot; ranked the album at number 20 on their &#x27;The 20 Best Albums of 1993&#x27; list.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; called the album &quot;an experimental fusion of jazz and rap that articulates the ties of Black music through the ages and embodies the quintessence of Afro-American cultures.&quot; &quot;The Windsor Star&quot; noted that &quot;two cuts stand out featuring singer N&#x27;Dea Davenport, who offers a fresh voice to the project.&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; determined that &quot;the soloists conjure a variety of deep-hued moods, but Guru stops short of delivering anything more than polite editorials and bland travelogues.&quot; &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; listed &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot; as the fifth best album of 1993.

<text>In numerical analysis, the Lagrange interpolating polynomial is the unique polynomial of lowest degree that interpolates a given set of data.

Given a data set of coordinate pairs formula_1 with formula_2 the formula_3 are called &quot;nodes&quot; and the formula_4 are called &quot;values&quot;. The Lagrange polynomial formula_5 has degree formula_6 and assumes each value at the corresponding node, formula_7

Although named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who published it in 1795, the method was first discovered in 1779 by Edward Waring. It is also an easy consequence of a formula published in 1783 by Leonhard Euler.

Uses of Lagrange polynomials include the Newton–Cotes method of numerical integration, Shamir&#x27;s secret sharing scheme in cryptography, and Reed–Solomon error correction in coding theory.

For equispaced nodes, Lagrange interpolation is susceptible to Runge&#x27;s phenomenon of large oscillation.

==Definition==
Given a set of formula_8 nodes formula_9, which must all be distinct, formula_10 for indices formula_11, the Lagrange basis for polynomials of degree formula_6 for those nodes is the set of polynomials formula_13 each of degree formula_14 which take values formula_15 if formula_16 and formula_17. Using the Kronecker delta this can be written formula_18 Each basis polynomial can be explicitly described by the product:

formula_19

Notice that the numerator formula_20 has formula_14 roots at the nodes formula_22 while the denominator formula_23 scales the resulting polynomial so that formula_24

The Lagrange interpolating polynomial for those nodes through the corresponding &quot;values&quot; formula_25 is the linear combination:

formula_26

Each basis polynomial has degree formula_14, so the sum formula_28 has degree formula_6, and it interpolates the data because formula_30

The interpolating polynomial is unique. Proof: assume the polynomial formula_31 of degree formula_6 interpolates the data. Then the difference formula_33 is zero at formula_8 distinct nodes formula_35 But the only polynomial of degree formula_6 with more than formula_14 roots is the constant zero function, so formula_38 or formula_39

==Barycentric form==

Each Lagrange basis polynomial formula_40 can be rewritten as the product of three parts, a function formula_41 common to every basis polynomial, a node-specific constant formula_42 (called the &quot;barycentric weight&quot;), and a part representing the displacement from formula_43 to formula_44:

formula_45

By factoring formula_46 out from the sum, we can write the Lagrange polynomial in the so-called &quot;first barycentric form&quot;:

:formula_47

If the weights formula_48 have been pre-computed, this requires only formula_49 operations compared to formula_50 for evaluating each Lagrange basis polynomial formula_51 individually.

The barycentric interpolation formula can also easily be updated to incorporate a new node formula_52 by dividing each of the formula_48, formula_54 by formula_55 and constructing the new formula_56 as above.

For any formula_57 formula_58 because the constant function formula_59 is the unique polynomial of degree formula_60 interpolating the data formula_61 We can thus further simplify the barycentric formula by dividing formula_62

:formula_63

This is called the &quot;second form&quot; or &quot;true form&quot; of the barycentric interpolation formula.

This second form has advantages in computation cost and accuracy: it avoids evaluation of formula_64; the work to compute each term in the denominator formula_65 has already been done in computing formula_66 and so computing the sum in the denominator costs only formula_14 addition operations; for evaluation points formula_44 which are close to one of the nodes formula_43, catastrophic cancelation would ordinarily be a problem for the value formula_70, however this quantity appears in both numerator and denominator and the two cancel leaving good relative accuracy in the final result.

Using this formula to evaluate formula_5 at one of the nodes formula_3 will result in the indeterminate formula_73; computer implementations must replace such results by formula_7

Each Lagrange basis polynomial can also be written in barycentric form:

:formula_75

==A perspective from linear algebra==

Solving an interpolation problem leads to a problem in linear algebra amounting to inversion of a matrix. Using a standard monomial basis for our interpolation polynomial formula_76, we must invert the Vandermonde matrix formula_77 to solve formula_78 for the coefficients formula_79 of formula_5. By choosing a better basis, the Lagrange basis, formula_81, we merely get the identity matrix, formula_82, which is its own inverse: the Lagrange basis automatically &quot;inverts&quot; the analog of the Vandermonde matrix.

This construction is analogous to the Chinese remainder theorem. Instead of checking for remainders of integers modulo prime numbers, we are checking for remainders of polynomials when divided by linears.

Furthermore, when the order is large, Fast Fourier transformation can be used to solve for the coefficients of the interpolated polynomial.

==Example==
We wish to interpolate formula_83 over the domain formula_84 at the three nodes 

: formula_85

The node polynomial formula_86 is
:formula_87

The barycentric weights are
:formula_88

The Lagrange basis polynomials are

:formula_89

The Lagrange interpolating polynomial is:
:formula_90

In (second) barycentric form,

:formula_91

==Notes==
The Lagrange form of the interpolation polynomial shows the linear character of polynomial interpolation and the uniqueness of the interpolation polynomial. Therefore, it is preferred in proofs and theoretical arguments. Uniqueness can also be seen from the invertibility of the Vandermonde matrix, due to the non-vanishing of the Vandermonde determinant.

But, as can be seen from the construction, each time a node &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot; changes, all Lagrange basis polynomials have to be recalculated. A better form of the interpolation polynomial for practical (or computational) purposes is the barycentric form of the Lagrange interpolation (see below) or Newton polynomials. 

Lagrange and other interpolation at equally spaced points, as in the example above, yield a polynomial oscillating above and below the true function. This behaviour tends to grow with the number of points, leading to a divergence known as Runge&#x27;s phenomenon; the problem may be eliminated by choosing interpolation points at Chebyshev nodes.

The Lagrange basis polynomials can be used in numerical integration to derive the Newton–Cotes formulas.
==Remainder in Lagrange interpolation formula==
When interpolating a given function &quot;f&quot; by a polynomial of degree at the nodes formula_92 we get the remainder formula_93 which can be expressed as

:formula_94

where formula_95 is the notation for divided differences. Alternatively, the remainder can be expressed as a contour integral in complex domain as

:formula_96

The remainder can be bound as

:formula_97

=== Derivation===
Clearly, formula_98 is zero at nodes. To find formula_99 at a point formula_100, define a new function formula_101 and choose formula_102 where formula_103 is the constant we are required to determine for a given formula_104. We choose formula_103 so that formula_106 has formula_107 zeroes (at all nodes and formula_104) between formula_109 and formula_110 (including endpoints). Assuming that formula_111 is formula_112-times differentiable, since formula_5 and formula_114 are polynomials, and therefore, are infinitely differentiable, formula_106 will be formula_112-times differentiable. By Rolle&#x27;s theorem, formula_117 has formula_112 zeroes, formula_119 has formula_120 zeroes... formula_121 has 1 zero, say formula_122. Explicitly writing formula_123:

:formula_124

:formula_125 (Because the highest power of formula_126 in formula_114 is formula_112)

:formula_129

The equation can be rearranged as

:formula_130
Since formula_131 we have formula_132

==Derivatives==
The th derivative of a Lagrange interpolating polynomial can be written in terms of the derivatives of the basis polynomials,

:formula_133

Recall (see above) that each Lagrange basis polynomial is

formula_134

The first derivative can be found using the product rule:

:formula_135

The second derivative is

:formula_136

The third derivative is

:formula_137

and likewise for higher derivatives.

Note that all of these formulas for derivatives are invalid at or near a node. A method of evaluating all orders of derivatives of a Lagrange polynomial efficiently at all points of the domain, including the nodes, is converting the Lagrange polynomial to power basis form and then evaluating the derivatives.

==Finite fields==
The Lagrange polynomial can also be computed in finite fields. This has applications in cryptography, such as in Shamir&#x27;s Secret Sharing scheme.

<doc id="217524" wikidata="Q143937" url="?curid=217524" title="Neoprene">
<text>Neoprene (also polychloroprene) is a family of synthetic rubbers that are produced by polymerization of chloroprene. Neoprene exhibits good chemical stability and maintains flexibility over a wide temperature range. Neoprene is sold either as solid rubber or in latex form and is used in a wide variety of commercial applications, such as laptop sleeves, orthopaedic braces (wrist, knee, etc.), electrical insulation, medical gloves, liquid and sheet-applied elastomeric membranes or flashings, and automotive fan belts.

==Production==
Neoprene is produced by free-radical polymerization of chloroprene. In commercial production, this polymer is prepared by free radical emulsion polymerization. Polymerization is initiated using potassium persulfate. Bifunctional nucleophiles, metal oxides (e.g. zinc oxide), and thioureas are used to crosslink individual polymer strands.

==History==
Neoprene was invented by DuPont scientists on April 17, 1930, after Elmer K. Bolton of DuPont attended a lecture by Fr Julius Arthur Nieuwland, a professor of chemistry at the University of Notre Dame. Nieuwland&#x27;s research was focused on acetylene chemistry and during the course of his work he produced divinyl acetylene, a jelly that firms into an elastic compound similar to rubber when passed over sulfur dichloride. After DuPont purchased the patent rights from the university, Wallace Carothers of DuPont took over commercial development of Nieuwland&#x27;s discovery in collaboration with Nieuwland himself and DuPont chemists Arnold Collins, Ira Williams and James Kirby. Collins focused on monovinyl acetylene and allowed it to react with hydrogen chloride gas, manufacturing chloroprene.

DuPont first marketed the compound in 1931 under the trade name DuPrene, but its commercial possibilities were limited by the original manufacturing process, which left the product with a foul odor. A new process was developed, which eliminated the odor-causing byproducts and halved production costs, and the company began selling the material to manufacturers of finished end-products. To prevent shoddy manufacturers from harming the product&#x27;s reputation, the trademark DuPrene was restricted to apply only to the material sold by DuPont. Since the company itself did not manufacture any DuPrene-containing end products, the trademark was dropped in 1937 and replaced with a generic name, neoprene, in an attempt &quot;to signify that the material is an ingredient, not a finished consumer product&quot;. DuPont then worked extensively to generate demand for its product, implementing a marketing strategy that included publishing its own technical journal, which extensively publicized neoprene&#x27;s uses as well as advertising other companies&#x27; neoprene-based products. By 1939, sales of neoprene were generating profits over $300,000 for the company ().

== Mechanical properties ==
The high tensile performance of neoprene is a result of its highly regular backbone structure, which causes neoprene to undergo strain crystallization under tensile loading. A two parameter (strain rate and temperature) hyperelastic model can accurately capture much of the mechanical response of neoprene.

Exposure to acetone and heat have been shown to degrade the tensile strength and ultimate elongation of neoprene, likely due to a loss of plasticizers as well as an increase in crosslinking during heat exposure. The response of neoprene to thermal aging depends not just on the highest temperature it is exposed to, but also on the exact temperature-time profile; this is a result of the competing factors of scission of the main polymer chain and oxidative cross-linking. Chain scission leads to degradation, embrittlement, and a loss of toughness. Oxidation reactions in the presence of heating leads to increased cross-linking, which in turn causes hardening. The interplay of both these factors determines the resulting effect on material mechanical properties; cross-linking is thought to dominate for neoprene.

As neoprene is used to make electric cable jackets in nuclear power plants, the effect of gamma radiation on the mechanical properties of neoprene has also been investigated. Chain scission, possibly triggered by free radicals from irradiated oxygen, is seen to deteriorate the mechanical properties of neoprene. Likewise, the tensile strength, hardness, and ultimate elongation of neoprene can also be degraded upon exposure to microwave radiation, which is of interest in the devulcanization process Finally, ultraviolet radiation is seen to decrease the mechanical properties of neoprene, which is important for outdoors applications of neoprene. 
==Applications==

===General===
Neoprene resists degradation more than natural or synthetic rubber. This relative inertness makes neoprene well suited for demanding applications such as gaskets, hoses, and corrosion-resistant coatings. It can be used as a base for adhesives, noise isolation in power transformer installations, and as padding in external metal cases to protect the contents while allowing a snug fit. It resists burning better than exclusively hydrocarbon based rubbers, resulting in its appearance in weather stripping for fire doors and in combat related attire such as gloves and face masks. Because of its tolerance of extreme conditions, neoprene is used to line landfills. Neoprene&#x27;s burn point is around 260 °C (500 °F).

In its native state, neoprene is a very pliable rubber-like material with insulating properties similar to rubber or other solid plastics.

Neoprene foam is used in many applications and is produced in either closed-cell or open-cell form. The closed-cell form is waterproof, less compressible and more expensive. The open-cell form can be breathable. It is manufactured by foaming the rubber with nitrogen gas, where the tiny enclosed and separated gas bubbles can also serve as insulation. Nitrogen gas is most commonly used for the foaming of neoprene foam due to its inertness, flame resistance, and large range of processing temperatures.

===Civil engineering===
Neoprene is used as a component of elastomeric bridge bearings, to support heavy loads while permitting small horizontal movements.

===Aquatics===
Neoprene is a popular material in making protective clothing for aquatic activities. Foamed neoprene is commonly used to make fly fishing waders, wetsuits, and drysuits as it provides excellent insulation against cold. The foam is quite buoyant, and divers compensate for this by wearing weights. Since foam neoprene contains gas pockets, the material compresses under water pressure, getting thinner at greater depths; a 7 mm neoprene wet suit offers much less exposure protection under 100 feet of water than at the surface. A recent advance in neoprene for wet suits is the &quot;super-flex&quot; variety, which uses spandex in the knit liner fabric for greater flexibility and stretch. A drysuit is similar to a wetsuit, but uses thicker and more durable neoprene to create an entirely waterproof suit that is suitable for wear in extremely cold water or polluted water.

===Home accessories===
Recently, neoprene has become a favorite material for lifestyle and other home accessories including laptop sleeves, tablet holders, remote controls, mouse pads, and cycling chamois.

===Music===
The Rhodes piano used hammer tips made of neoprene in its electric pianos, after changing from felt hammers around 1970.

Neoprene is also used for speaker cones and drum practice pads.

===Hydroponic gardening===
Hydroponic and aerated gardening systems make use of small neoprene inserts to hold plants in place while propagating cuttings or using net cups. Inserts are relatively small, ranging in size from . Neoprene is a good choice for supporting plants because of its flexibility and softness, allowing plants to be held securely in place without the chance of causing damage to the stem. Neoprene root covers also help block out light from entering the rooting chamber of hydroponic systems, allowing for better root growth and helping to deter the growth of algae.

===Face mask===
During the COVID-19 global pandemic, neoprene was identified by some health experts as an effective material to use for home made face masks. Some commercial face mask manufacturers that use neoprene have claimed 99.9% filtration for particles as small as 0.1 microns. The size of coronavirus is identified to be on average 0.125 microns.

===Other===

Neoprene is used for Halloween masks and masks used for face protection, to make waterproof automotive seat covers, in liquid and sheet-applied elastomeric roof membranes or flashings, and in a neoprene-spandex mixture for manufacture of wheelchair positioning harnesses.

In tabletop wargames, neoprene mats printed with grassy, sandy, icy, or other natural features have become popular gaming surfaces. They are durable, firm and stable, and attractive in appearance, and also favoured for their ability to roll up in storage but lie flat when unrolled.

Because of its chemical resistance and overall durability, neoprene is sometimes used in the manufacture of dishwashing gloves, especially as an alternative to latex.

In fashion, neoprene has been used by designers such as Gareth Pugh, Balenciaga, Rick Owens, Lanvin, and Vera Wang.

Neoprene was also used as an experimental fabric to upholster a mirror by designer Flavia Brilli for her mirror brand Jazz Frames.

==Precautions==
Some people are allergic to neoprene while others can get dermatitis from thiourea residues left from its production.

The most common accelerator in the vulcanization of polychloroprene is ethylene thiourea (ETU), which has been classified as a reproductive toxin. From 2010 to 2013, the European rubber industry had a research project titled SafeRubber to develop a safer alternative to the use of ETU.

<text>Quorn is a brand of meat substitute products. Quorn originated in the UK and is sold primarily in Europe, but is available in 11 countries. The brand is owned by parent company Monde Nissin. 

Quorn is sold as both a cooking ingredient and as a meat substitute used in a range of prepackaged meals.

Though all Quorn products are vegetarian, not all are vegan. All Quorn foods contain mycoprotein as an ingredient, which is derived from the &quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot; fungus. In most Quorn products, the fungus culture is dried and mixed with egg white, which acts as a binder, and then is adjusted in texture and pressed into various forms. The vegan formulation uses potato protein as a binder instead of egg white.

==History==

Quorn was launched in 1985 by Marlow Foods, a joint venture between Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).

Microbial biomass is produced commercially as single-cell protein (SCP) for human food or animal feed and as viable yeast cells for the baking industry. The industrial production of bakers&#x27; yeast started in the early 1900s, and yeast biomass was used as human food in Germany during World War I. The development of large-scale processes for the production of microbial biomass as a source of commercial protein began in earnest in the late 1960s. 

Several of the processes investigated did not come to fruition owing to political and economic problems, but the establishment of the ICI Pruteen process for the production of bacterial SCP for animal feed was a milestone in the development of the fermentation industry. This process used continuous culture on a large scale . The economics of the production of SCP as animal feed were marginal, which eventually led to the discontinuation of the Pruteen process. 

The technical expertise gained from the Pruteen process assisted ICI in collaborating with company Rank Hovis McDougall on a process for the production of fungal biomass for human food. A continuous fermentation process for the production of &quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot; biomass (marketed as Quorn) was developed using a air-lift fermenter.

During the 1960s, it was predicted that by the 1980s there would be a shortage of protein-rich foods.

The filamentous fungus, &quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot;, was discovered in a soil sample in 1967. In 1985, RHM was given permission to sell mycoprotein for human consumption after a ten-year evaluation programme.

=== Retail history ===

The brand Quorn was first marketed in 1985 by Marlow Foods (named after Rank Hovis McDougall&#x27;s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire), a joint venture between RHM and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), which provided a fermenter left vacant from their abandoned single-cell feed programme. The two partners invested in patents for growing and processing the fungus, and other intellectual properties in the brand. The name of the product was taken from a trademark owned by RHM. This trademark was previously used for a range of instant food packets named after the Quorn Hunt, which in turn derives from the Leicestershire village of Quorn.

Quorn entered distribution in the UK in 1993, and it was introduced to other parts of Europe in the 1990s, and to North America in 2002.

==Marketing==

The initial advertising campaign for Quorn featured sports personalities, including footballer Ryan Giggs, rugby player Will Carling, and Olympic runner Sally Gunnell. In 2013, the company appointed Mo Farah as its ambassador in a marketing push for fitness.

==Products==
Quorn is sold in ready-to-cook forms, such as cubes and a form resembling minced meat. The company later introduced a range of chilled vegetarian meals, including pizzas, lasagne, cottage pie, and products resembling sliced meat, hot dogs, and burgers.
By 2005, Quorn enjoyed around 60% of the meat-replacement food market in the UK, with annual sales of around £95 million. By 2006, it was available in stores in the UK; Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland); and North America (Canada and United States). Since June 2010, it has been available in Australia.
In May 2012, Quorn Foods opened the German website quorn.de to relaunch Quorn in Germany.

After its producer switched to using free-range eggs as an ingredient, the Vegetarian Society gave the product its seal of approval.

In 2004, McDonald&#x27;s introduced a Quorn-branded burger bearing the seal of approval of the Vegetarian Society.
However, as of 2009, the Quorn burgers were no longer available at any McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in the UK, and the McPlant was made using Beyond Meat. In 2011, Quorn Foods launched a vegan burger into the United States market, using potato protein as a binder instead of egg albumen, to confer vegan status.
According to Quorn&#x27;s website, by 2020, a number of Quorn items were available in United States markets, many of which are vegan. They also have gluten-free options.

As of 2014, it was reported that most consumers of Quorn are meat eaters rather than vegetarians. As of 2018, the market for Quorn products was said to be increasing worldwide and the company expects further growth. However, six years on parent Monde Nissin is bleeding heavily on its investments on Quorn to the total tune so far of 40 Billion Philippine Pesos (~ GBP 548 million, ~USD 689.6 ) 

== Ownership history ==
Originally conceived in 1985 and owned by Marlow Foods, a joint venture between Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), RHM exited the business in 1990 by selling its shares to ICI. When ICI spun off its biological products divisions from the core chemical business in 1993, Marlow Foods became a part of the newly formed Zeneca group, later AstraZeneca.

In 2003, AstraZeneca sold Marlow Foods, including the Quorn business and associated trademarks and patents, to Montagu Private Equity for £72m. Montagu sold the business on to Premier Foods in 2005 for £172m.

In 2011, Premier Foods sold Quorn to Exponent Private Equity and Intermediate Capital Group for .
In 2015, the owners put the company up for sale via a business auction process. Attracting bidders including Danone, Kerry Group, McCain Foods and Nomad Foods, it was sold to Monde Nissin Corporation headquartered in the Philippines for £550m ($831m).

== Production ==

Quorn is made from the soil mould &quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot; strain PTA-2684 (previously misidentified as the parasitic mould &quot;Fusarium graminearum&quot;).
The fungus is grown in continually oxygenated water in large, otherwise sterile fermentation tanks. Glucose and fixed nitrogen are added as a food for the fungus, as are vitamins and minerals to improve the food value of the product. The resulting mycoprotein is then extracted and heat-treated to remove excess levels of RNA. Previous attempts to produce such fermented protein foodstuffs were thwarted by excessive levels of DNA or RNA; without the heat treatment, purines, found in nucleic acids, are metabolised by humans to produce uric acid, which can lead to gout.

The product is dried and mixed with egg albumen, which acts as a binder. It is then textured, giving it some of the grained character of meat, and pressed into a mince resembling ground beef; forms resembling chicken breasts, meatballs, and turkey roasts; or chunks resembling diced chicken breast. In these forms, Quorn has a varying colour and a mild flavour resembling the imitated meat product, and is suitable for use as a replacement for meat in many dishes, such as stews and casseroles.

The final Quorn product is high in protein and dietary fibre and is low in saturated fat. It contains less dietary iron than most meats and the manufacturers have not released much information about additives they use to make Quorn resemble meat. Quorn is considered acceptable in small amounts for babies over nine months old, but should be introduced gradually. The high fibre and low food energy content is better for adults than babies and too much fibre can cause flatulence. The salt content should be checked before giving Quorn to babies, since the salt content varies among products.

The carbon footprint of Quorn Frozen Mince in the UK is claimed to be at least 80% less than that of beef.

Quorn for the UK and European market is produced at Marlow&#x27;s headquarters in Stokesley, North Yorkshire and at nearby Billingham in Stockton-on-Tees.

== Controversy ==
After Quorn&#x27;s 2002 debut in the United States, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) disputed the original labeling of Quorn as a &quot;mushroom based&quot; product, since &quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot; is not a mushroom (rather, it is a microfungus). The sale of Quorn was opposed by the American Mushroom Institute, and rival Gardenburger, which filed complaints with advertising and trading-standards watchdogs in Europe and the US, stating Quorn&#x27;s &#x27;mushroom based&#x27; claim was deceptive.

CSPI claimed that Quorn could cause allergic reactions and should be removed from stores. CSPI claimed in 2003 that it &quot;sickens 4.5% of eaters&quot;.
The manufacturer (Marlow Foods) disputed the figure, claiming that only 0.0007% (1 in 146,000) suffer adverse reactions and that the strain of fungus it uses does not produce toxins. Leslie Bonci, professor of nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh, described CSPI&#x27;s claims as &quot;overblown&quot;.
Wendy Preiser, Gardenburger&#x27;s vice president of marketing, said the company feared that Quorn&#x27;s labels would cause suspicion about all meat-free products.

The UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority was concerned that Marlow&#x27;s marketing of Quorn as &quot;mushroom in origin&quot; was &quot;misleading consumers&quot;. Marlow Foods were asked either to delete the claim or modify it to identify its fungal origin.

Quorn formerly used battery eggs in some of its production processes, a practice opposed on ethical grounds by many vegetarians. Working with the Vegetarian Society, which initially did not approve Quorn&#x27;s products, Marlow began phasing out battery eggs in 2000,
and by 2004 all of their UK products were free of battery eggs, earning the Vegetarian Society&#x27;s seal of approval.

An asthma attack in 2003 was linked to Quorn. Tests showed Quorn to be the only food to which the patient had an allergic reaction. A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency stated that an allergy was not surprising, due to the high protein content.
Former FSA director Jon Bell responded in defence of Quorn, stating that several commonly consumed foods and food ingredients, such as soya, have a much higher intolerance level than Quorn. Adverse reactions were reported for 1 in 146,000 people who ate Quorn, compared to 1 in 35 who ate shellfish and 1 in 350 who ate soya.

== Mycoprotein patent expiration ==
In the European Union, patents expire after 20 years from their filing date. Since the first patent application was filed in 1985,
the mycoprotein patents had already expired in 2010 in all European Union countries. Now anyone can legally produce mycoprotein products using the previously patented processes. However, they would have to use other brand names as Marlow Foods maintains ownership of the Quorn brand name. On 14 March 2011, CEO Kevin Brennan said in an interview: &quot;Some patents surrounding the core technology have expired, but the product uses a peculiar fermentation method, and we have 30-plus years&#x27; experience in perfecting this on site to produce the product better and at a lower cost. Huge related costs include £30m cost for a fermentation tower and related equipment, so you can&#x27;t simply look at a patent and say &#x27;there you go&#x27;.&quot;

== Vegan products ==
In late 2011, the first vegan Quorn product was released, called the Quorn Vegan Burger,
available initially only in the United States. Following strong sales of the product and increasing demand from the UK market, Quorn began development of a line of vegan products for the UK market, as well as reducing its use of eggs overall, using 3.5 million fewer eggs since 2010. The first range of vegan Quorn in the UK included eight products and was launched in October 2015.

In January 2019, Quorn produced the filling for a vegan sausage roll sold by UK bakery chain Greggs. The product was consistently sold out, and was identified by the chain as a major contributor to increasing profits and a record share price. In January 2020, Greggs released a Quorn-based vegan &quot;steak bake&quot;.

<text>Restrepia antennifera, the antennae-carrying restrepia, is an epiphytic, miniature species of orchid found at higher altitudes in cool, moist montane forests in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.

These tiny orchids lack pseudobulbs. The erect, thick, leathery leaf is elliptic-ovate in shape. The aerial roots seem like fine hairs.

The attractive flowers are 5–6 cm long. They develop one at a time at the base of the leaf. They are borne on a slender peduncle, originating from the base of the back of the leaf. The long dorsal sepal is erect, triangular at the base and ends in a somewhat thicker club-shaped tip (= clavate). They have fused lateral sepals (synsepals) which may be quite colorful: yellow, orange or tan with contrasting maroon lengthwise stripes. The long, slender, lateral petals equally end in a thickened club-shaped tip. The long lip is ovoid and widest at its apex. It shows a reddish lengthwise stripe. In rare cases, the synsepals may split, resulting in two separate sepals. The column has four pollinia.

&quot;Restrepia antennifera&quot; is well-known to orchid growers, although many other &quot;Restrepia&quot;s are misidentified as &quot;antennifera&quot;. The flower blooms for 1 to 2 weeks. They flower again and again in sequential order from the same growth.

<doc id="217533" wikidata="Q7246586" url="?curid=217533" title="Pro-Euro Conservative Party">
<text>The Pro-Euro Conservative Party was a minor, Pro-European British political party, announced by John Stevens and Brendan Donnelly in February 1999, formed to contest the 1999 European Parliament election. The founders were Members of the European Parliament who had resigned from the UK Conservative Party in protest at its anti-euro stance. Their reported aim was to replace Eurosceptic William Hague as Conservative leader with Europhile Kenneth Clarke. Stevens later said that they had intended to push Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and other pro-Europeans in the Conservative Party into &quot;an SDP-style breakaway, in combination with the Liberal Democrats&quot;. The Pro-Euro Conservative Party disbanded in 2001.

==Policies==
The party said it was &quot;based on traditional Conservative values&quot;, and they self-defined as &quot;One Nation Conservatives&quot;. The main aim of the party was for the United Kingdom to join the euro, also known as &quot;the single currency&quot;, for economic reasons. At the time the British pound was strong against the euro, which had dropped in value to be equal to the US dollar, and the then-Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George said that it would be &quot;an act of faith&quot; for Britain to join the Eurozone.

The party manifesto, published on 17 May 1999 and titled &quot;Time to decide&quot;, argued for greater powers for the European Parliament over the European Commission and the European Central Bank, reform of the commission, reduction of countries&#x27; veto powers, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, a European defence and security policy, stronger political and economic ties to the Balkans, and faster EU enlargement in eastern Europe.

The Pro-Euro Conservative Party distributed leaflets calling William Hague &quot;Bill Duce&quot;, after Mussolini, when a group of Conservative MEPs led by Daniel Hannan were reported to be planning to leave the European People&#x27;s Party grouping and join with an Italian far-right party. John Stevens said Hague was &quot;taking the Tories into an extreme, nationalist party. This is dangerous for the country and catastrophic for the Conservative Party&quot;. The PECP&#x27;s party political broadcast showed an actor portraying Hague as &quot;a down-and-out in a baseball cap ranting about pride in being British and disliking &#x27;frogs&#x27;, the European single currency and anything else from the continent&quot;, which was called &quot;a tacky and amateurish exercise&quot; by the Conservative Party.

==Reception==
A MORI opinion poll of 1911 people, published on 16 February 1999, suggested that a new pro-EU conservative party could possibly win 11% of the vote.

The party received an endorsement in &quot;The Independent&quot; from writer A. N. Wilson, as well as support from Paul Howell, a former Conservative MEP who had been a speechwriter for Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath, and Sir Anthony Meyer, a former MP and the &quot;stalking horse&quot; candidate against Margaret Thatcher in 1989. After William Hague ruled out Britain joining the euro under a Conservative government, former cabinet minister Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar said he would vote for the PECP. Four former Conservative MPs – Sir Julian Critchley, Sir Nicholas Scott, Sir David Knox, and Sir Robert Hicks – and four former MEPs – Margaret Daly, Adam Fergusson, Madron Seligman and Anthony Simpson – wrote in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;We would have wished that William Hague&#x27;s party had put forward a manifesto more like that of the Pro Euro Conservative Party. Like many Conservatives, we shall find it very difficult to know how best to cast our vote on 10 June.&quot; The Conservative Party threatened to expel any members who supported the PECP, and did expel Critchley and Gilmour a fortnight after the election.

Although the party&#x27;s election literature featured Ken Clarke, asking voters &quot;Are you more a Clarke Conservative than a Hague Conservative?&quot;, Clarke did not approve of the party or its campaign and with Michael Heseltine met with the founders of the PECP at Heseltine&#x27;s home in May 1999 to try to persuade the party not to stand. Geoffrey Howe, Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer and Foreign Secretary under Mrs Thatcher, who became head of pro-euro group Britain in Europe during the election campaign, did not endorse the PECP but said the resignations from the Conservatives &quot;should send a clear and sombre signal to our party leadership&quot;. Andrew Lansley, then a vice-chairman of the Conservatives, called the PECP &quot;a party of the disgruntled and disaffected&quot;.

Despite the party&#x27;s name and their position as &quot;rebel Tories&quot;, some of their candidates and officials were from the European Movement and originally from parties other than the Conservatives, such as Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The chief press officer Mark Littlewood was a Liberal Democrat who had also been a spokesman for the European Movement and later rejoined the Liberal Democrats.

==Electoral performance==

The party stood 84 candidates in the European Parliament elections, receiving 138,097 votes, or 1.4% of the vote and no seats. In the same election the UK Independence Party, which campaigned for withdrawal from the European Union, received just under 7% of the vote and three seats in the European Parliament.

John Stevens received 3.8% of the vote as the PECP candidate in the 1999 Kensington &amp; Chelsea by-election against Michael Portillo. The party announced that, owing to voter hostility to the words it contained, it planned to change its name after the by-election.

In November 2001, the PECP urged Conservatives to vote for the Liberal Democrat candidate in the Ipswich by-election.

==Disbanding==
The PECP disbanded in December 2001, expressing disappointment at failing to persuade pro-European &quot;grandees&quot; to leave the Conservative Party and cooperate with the Liberal Democrats. Leader John Stevens called the Conservative Party under their then newly elected leader Iain Duncan Smith &quot;a cancer of extremism and xenophobia&quot;. He was one of approximately 20 supporters who joined the Liberal Democrats and urged the remainder of the party&#x27;s claimed 500 members to follow suit.

<text>Port-Royal-des-Champs () was an abbey of Cistercian nuns in Magny-les-Hameaux, in the Vallée de Chevreuse southwest of Paris that launched a number of culturally important institutions.

==History==
The abbey was established in 1204, but became famous when its discipline was reformed in 1609 by its abbess, Mother Marie Angelique Arnauld (1591-1661). The Arnauld family became its patrons and the abbey&#x27;s subsequent history was directed by a number of the members of that family. In 1625 most of the nuns moved to a new Port-Royal in Paris, which subsequently became &quot;Port-Royal de Paris&quot; (or, more commonly, &quot;Port-Royal&quot;) while the older one was known as &quot;Port-Royal des Champs&quot; (&quot;Port-Royal of the fields&quot;).

At the original site, several schools were founded, which became known as the &quot;Petites écoles de Port-Royal&quot; (&quot;Little Schools of Port-Royal&quot;). These schools became famous for the high quality of the education they gave. Playwright Jean Racine was educated at Port-Royal. In 1634 Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, Abbé de Saint-Cyran, became spiritual director of the abbey; he was a companion of Jansenius and the implementer of Jansenism in France. From that point forward, the abbeys and schools of Port-Royal became intimately associated with that school of theology.

&quot;La logique, ou l&#x27;art de penser&quot;, the &quot;Logique de Port-Royal&quot;, was an important textbook on logic first published anonymously in 1662 by Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, two prominent members of the Jansenist movement; Blaise Pascal likely contributed considerable portions of the text. As it was written in the vernacular, it became quite popular and was in use, as an exemplar of traditional term logic, into the twentieth century, introducing the reader to logic, and exhibiting strong Cartesian elements in its metaphysics and epistemology (Arnauld having been one of the main philosophers whose objections were published, with replies, in Descartes&#x27; &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;).

The atmosphere of serious study and Jansenist piety attracted a number of prominent cultural figures to the movement, including mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal. Pascal defended the schools publicly against the Jesuits in the Jansenist controversies which agitated the French Roman Catholic Church, in his &quot;Lettres provinciales&quot; in 1657. Perhaps even more striking, several important persons of the court were close to Jansenism, such as the Duke of Luynes or the Duke of Liancourt. Members of the Arnauld family had managed to receive important jobs such as Simon Arnauld de Pomponne, Minister of Louis XIV. The Jesuits, on the other hand, enjoyed predominance in political and theological power in France and Europe, providing a personal confessor to the King, etc.

As a result of the Jesuit attacks on Jansenism, the schools of Port-Royal were regarded as tainted with heresy. Louis XIV wanting peace in the church, the elementary schools were forcibly closed by papal bull in 1660, following the formulary controversy. In 1661, the monastery was forbidden to accept novices, heralding its eventual dissolution. The abbey itself was abolished by a bull from Pope Clement XI in 1708, the remaining nuns forcibly removed in 1709, most of the buildings themselves razed in 1711. The chapel, containing Mère Angélique&#x27;s tomb, as well as some buildings, still exist in the vast grounds of what eventually became Paris&#x27; leading maternity hospital, known as Port-Royal Hospital.

A celebrated history of Port-Royal and its influence was written by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve in 1837-1859.

==Museums==
The remains of the monastery of Port-Royal-des-Champs may still be seen at Magny-les-Hameaux, in the Chevreuse valley. Operated as Musée de Port-Royal, the 30-hectare estate includes the ruins of the abbey and its outbuildings. A 17th century building houses the Musée national de Port-Royal des Champs, which exhibits 17th and 18th century paintings and engravings.

<doc id="217535" wikidata="Q1423347" url="?curid=217535" title="Geopotential">
<text>Geopotential is the potential of the Earth&#x27;s gravity field. For convenience it is often defined as the &quot;negative&quot; of the potential energy per unit mass, so that the gravity vector is obtained as the gradient of the geopotential, without the negation. In addition to the actual potential (the geopotential), a theoretical normal potential and their difference, the disturbing potential, can also be defined.

==Concepts==
For geophysical applications, gravity is distinguished from gravitation. Gravity is defined as the resultant force of gravitation and the centrifugal force caused by the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Likewise, the respective scalar potentials can be added to form an effective potential called the geopotential, formula_1. 
The surfaces of constant geopotential or isosurfaces of the geopotential are called equigeopotential surfaces (sometimes abbreviated as geop), also known as &quot;geopotential level surfaces&quot;, &quot;equipotential surfaces&quot;, or simply &quot;level surfaces&quot;.
Global mean sea surface is close to one equigeopotential called the &quot;geoid&quot;. How the gravitational force and the centrifugal force add up to a force orthogonal to the geoid is illustrated in the figure (not to scale). At latitude 50 deg the off-set between the gravitational force (red line in the figure) and the local vertical (green line in the figure) is in fact 0.098 deg. For a mass point (atmosphere) in motion the centrifugal force no more matches the gravitational and the vector sum is not exactly orthogonal to the Earth surface. This is the cause of the coriolis effect for atmospheric motion.

The geoid is a gently undulating surface due to the irregular mass distribution inside the Earth; it may be approximated however by an ellipsoid of revolution called the reference ellipsoid. The currently most widely used reference ellipsoid, that of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80), approximates the geoid to within a little over ±100 m. One can construct a simple model geopotential formula_2 that has as one of its equipotential surfaces this reference ellipsoid, with the same model potential formula_3 as the true potential formula_4 of the geoid; this model is called a &quot;normal potential&quot;. The difference formula_5 is called the &quot;disturbing potential&quot;. Many observable quantities of the gravity field, such as gravity anomalies and deflections of the vertical (plumb-line), can be expressed in this disturbing potential.

==Background==
Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force &quot;F&quot; acting between two point masses &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 with centre of mass separation &quot;r&quot; is given by

:formula_6

where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant and r̂ is the radial unit vector. For a non-pointlike object of continuous mass distribution, each mass element &quot;dm&quot; can be treated as mass distributed over a small volume, so the volume integral over the extent of object 2 gives:

 = - Gm_1 \int\limits_V \frac{\rho_2 }{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}\,dx\,dy\,dz
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

with corresponding gravitational potential

where ρ = ρ(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) is the mass density at the volume element and of the direction from the volume element to point mass 1. formula_7 is the gravitational potential energy per unit mass.

Earth&#x27;s gravity field can be derived from a gravity potential (&quot;geopotential&quot;) field as follows:

:formula_8

which expresses the gravity acceleration vector as the gradient of formula_1, the potential of gravity. The vector triad formula_10 is the orthonormal set of base vectors in space, pointing along the formula_11 coordinate axes.
Here, formula_12, formula_13 and formula_14 are geocentric coordinates.

==Formulation==

Both gravity and its potential contain a contribution from the centrifugal pseudo-force due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation. We can write

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the potential of the &quot;gravitational field&quot;, formula_1 that of the &quot;gravity field&quot;, and formula_18 that of the &quot;centrifugal field&quot;.

===Centrifugal potential===

The centrifugal force—per unit of mass, i.e., acceleration—is given by

:formula_19

where

:formula_20

is the vector pointing to the point considered straight from the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis. 
It can be shown that this pseudo-force field, in a reference frame co-rotating with the Earth, has a potential associated with it in terms of Earth&#x27;s rotation rate, ω:

:formula_21

This can be verified by taking the gradient (formula_22) operator of this expression.

The centrifugal potential can also be expressed in terms of spherical latitude φ and geocentric radius &quot;r&quot;:
:formula_23

=== Normal potential ===
The Earth is approximately an ellipsoid.
So, it is accurate to approximate the geopotential by a field that has the Earth reference ellipsoid as one of its equipotential surfaces. 

Like the actual geopotential field &quot;W&quot;, the normal field &quot;U&quot; (not to be confused with the potential energy, also &quot;U&quot;) is constructed as a two-part sum:
:formula_24
where formula_25 is the &quot;normal gravitational potential&quot; and formula_18 is the centrifugal potential.

A closed-form exact expression exists in terms of ellipsoidal-harmonic coordinates (not to be confused with geodetic coordinates).
It can also be expressed as a series expansion in terms of spherical coordinates; truncating the series results in:
:formula_27
where &quot;a&quot; is semi-major axis and &quot;J&quot;2 is the second dynamic form factor.

The most recent Earth reference ellipsoid is GRS80, or Geodetic Reference System 1980, which the Global Positioning system uses as its reference. Its geometric parameters are: semi-major axis &quot;a&quot; = 6378137.0 m, and flattening &quot;f&quot; = 1/298.257222101.
If we also require that the enclosed mass &quot;M&quot; is equal to the known mass of the Earth (including atmosphere), as involved in the standard gravitational parameter, &quot;GM&quot; = 3986005 × 108 m3·s−2, we obtain for the &quot;potential at the reference ellipsoid:&quot;
:formula_28

Obviously, this value depends on the assumption that the potential goes asymptotically to zero at infinity (formula_29), as is common in physics. For practical purposes it makes more sense to choose the zero point of normal gravity to be that of the reference ellipsoid, and refer the potentials of other points to this.

=== Disturbing potential ===

Once a clean, smooth geopotential field formula_2 has been constructed matching the known GRS80 reference ellipsoid with an equipotential surface (we call such a field a &quot;normal potential&quot;) we can subtract it from the true (measured) potential formula_1 of the real Earth. The result is defined as &quot;T&quot;, the disturbing potential:

:formula_32

The disturbing potential &quot;T&quot; is numerically a great deal smaller than &quot;U&quot; or &quot;W&quot;, and captures the detailed, complex variations of the true gravity field of the actually existing Earth from point-to-point, as distinguished from the overall global trend captured by the smooth mathematical ellipsoid of the normal potential.

=== Geopotential number ===

In practical terrestrial work, e.g., levelling, an alternative version of the geopotential is used called geopotential number formula_33, which are reckoned from the geoid upward:
formula_34
where formula_4 is the geopotential of the geoid.

==Simple case: nonrotating symmetric sphere==

In the special case of a sphere with a spherically symmetric mass density then ρ = ρ(&quot;s&quot;); i.e., density depends only on the radial distance

:formula_36

These integrals can be evaluated analytically. This is the shell theorem saying that in this case:

with corresponding potential

where &quot;M&quot; = ∫Vρ(&quot;s&quot;)&quot;dxdydz&quot; is the total mass of the sphere.

For the purpose of satellite orbital mechanics, the geopotential is typically described by a series expansion into spherical harmonics (spectral representation). In this context the geopotential is taken as the potential of the gravitational field of the Earth, that is, leaving out the centrifugal potential.
Solving for geopotential in the simple case of a nonrotating sphere, in units of [m2/s2] or [J/kg]:
formula_37
formula_38

Integrate to get
formula_39
where:
* is the gravitational constant,
* is the mass of the earth,
* is the average radius of the earth,
* is the geometric height in meters

<doc id="217536" wikidata="Q10647" url="?curid=217536" title="UK Independence Party">
<text>The UK Independence Party (UKIP, ) is a Eurosceptic, right-wing populist political party in the United Kingdom. The party reached its greatest level of success in the mid-2010s, when it gained two members of parliament (both through defections) and was the largest party representing the UK in the European Parliament. The party is currently led by Nick Tenconi, the COO of Turning Point UK.

UKIP originated as the Anti-Federalist League, a somewhat single-issue Eurosceptic party established in London by Alan Sked in 1991. It was renamed &quot;UKIP&quot; in 1993, but its growth remained slow. It was largely eclipsed by the Eurosceptic Referendum Party until the latter&#x27;s 1997 dissolution. In 1997, Sked was ousted by a faction led by Nigel Farage, who became the party&#x27;s preeminent figure. In 2006, Farage officially became leader and, under his direction, the party adopted a wider policy platform and capitalised on concerns about rising immigration, in particular among the white British working class. This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the 2013 local elections, 2014 European parliamentary elections, and 2015 general election. After the UK voted to leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum, Farage stepped down as UKIP leader, later joining the Brexit Party (widely considered to be UKIP&#x27;s successor). UKIP subsequently saw its vote share and membership heavily decline, losing all of its elected representatives amid much internal instability and a drift toward a far-right, anti-Islam message.

Ideologically positioned on the right-wing of British politics, UKIP is characterised by political scientists as a right-wing populist party. Its primary emphasis has been on hard Euroscepticism; it was one of the first to call for the United Kingdom&#x27;s exit from the European Union (EU). It promotes a British unionist and British nationalist agenda, encouraging a unitary British identity in opposition to growing Welsh, Irish and Scottish nationalisms. UKIP has also placed emphasis on lowering immigration, rejecting multiculturalism, and opposing what is known as the Islamification of Britain. Influenced by Thatcherism and classical liberalism, it describes itself as economically libertarian and promotes liberal economic policies. On social ideals such as LGBT rights, education policy, and criminal justice, it is traditionalist. Having an ideological heritage stemming from the right-wing of the Conservative Party, it has distinguished itself from the political establishment through heavy use of populist rhetoric, for example, through Farage&#x27;s description of its supporters as the &quot;People&#x27;s Army&quot;.

Governed by its leader and national executive committee, UKIP is divided into 12 regional groups. While gaining electoral support from various sectors of British society, psephologists established that at its height, UKIP&#x27;s primary voting base consisted of older, working-class white men living in England. UKIP has faced a critical reception from mainstream political parties, much of the media, and anti-fascist groups. Its discourse on immigration and cultural identity generated accusations of racism and xenophobia, both of which it denies.

==History==
===Foundation and early years: 1991–2004===

UKIP began as the Anti-Federalist League, a Eurosceptic political party established in 1991 by the historian Alan Sked. The League opposed the recently signed Maastricht Treaty and sought to sway the governing Conservative Party towards removing the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU). A former Liberal Party candidate, member of the Bruges Group, and professor at the London School of Economics (LSE), Sked had converted to Euroscepticism while teaching the LSE&#x27;s European Studies programme. Under the Anti-Federalist League&#x27;s banner, Sked was a candidate for member of parliament (MP) for Bath at the 1992 general election, gaining 0.2% of the vote. At a party meeting held in the LSE on 3 September 1993, the group was renamed the UK Independence Party, deliberately avoiding the term &quot;British&quot; so as to avoid confusion with the far-right British National Party (BNP).

UKIP contested the 1994 European Parliament election with little financing and much infighting, securing itself as the fifth-largest party in that election with 1% of the vote. During this period, UKIP was viewed as a typical single-issue party by commentators, some of whom drew comparisons with the French Poujadist movement. Following the election, UKIP lost much support to the Referendum Party; founded by the multi-millionaire James Goldsmith in 1994, it shared UKIP&#x27;s Eurosceptic approach but was far better funded. In the 1997 general election, UKIP fielded 194 candidates and secured 0.3% of the national vote; only one of its candidates, Nigel Farage in Salisbury, secured over 5% of the vote and had his deposit returned. UKIP was beaten by the Referendum Party in 163 of the 165 seats in which they stood against each other. The Referendum Party disbanded following Goldsmith&#x27;s death later that year, and many of its candidates joined UKIP.

After the election, Sked was pressured into resigning by a party faction led by Farage, David Lott and Michael Holmes, who deemed him too intellectual and dictatorial. Sked left the party, alleging that it had been infiltrated by racist and far-right elements, including BNP spies. This connection was emphasised in the press, particularly when Farage was photographed meeting with BNP activists. Holmes took over as party leader, and in the 1999 European Parliament elections—the first British election for the European Parliament to use proportional representation—UKIP received 6.5% of the vote and three seats, in South East England (Farage), South West England (Holmes), and the East of England (Jeffrey Titford).

An internal power struggle ensued between Holmes and the party&#x27;s national executive committee (NEC), which was critical of Holmes after he called for the European Parliament to have greater powers over the European Commission. Led by Farage, the NEC removed Holmes from power, and Titford was elected leader. In the 2001 general election, UKIP secured 1.5% of the vote, and six of its 428 candidates retained their deposits. It had lost much of its support to the Conservatives, whose leader William Hague had adopted increasingly Eurosceptic rhetoric during his campaign. In 2002, the former Conservative MP Roger Knapman was elected UKIP leader, bringing with him the experience of mainstream politics that the party had lacked. Knapman hired the political campaign consultant Dick Morris to advise UKIP. The party adopted the slogan &quot;say no&quot; and launched a national billboard campaign. In 2004, UKIP reorganised itself nationally as a private company limited by guarantee.

===Growing visibility: 2004–2014===
UKIP&#x27;s support increased during the 2004 European Parliament elections, when it placed third, securing 2.6 million votes (16.1%) and winning 12 seats. This had been made possible through increased funding from major donors and the celebrity endorsement of former chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk, who stood as a candidate in the East Midlands. Kilroy-Silk then criticised Knapman&#x27;s leadership, arguing that UKIP should stand against Conservative candidates, regardless of whether they were Eurosceptic or not. This position was rejected by many party members, who were uneasy regarding Kilroy-Silk. After Farage and Lott backed Knapman, Kilroy-Silk left the party in January 2005. Two weeks later, he founded his own rival, Veritas, taking a number of UKIP members—including both of its London Assembly members—with him.

After Kilroy-Silk&#x27;s defection, UKIP&#x27;s membership declined by a third and donations dropped by over a half. UKIP continued to be widely seen as a single-issue party and in the 2005 general election—when it fielded 496 candidates—it secured only 2.2% of the vote, and 40 candidates had their deposits returned. Electoral support for the BNP grew during this period, with academics and political commentators suggesting that the parties were largely competing for the same voter base, a section of about 20% of the UK population. Given that the BNP had outperformed UKIP in most of the seats that they both contested, many UKIP members, including several figures on the NEC, favoured an electoral pact with them, a proposal that Farage strongly condemned.

In 2006, Farage was elected leader. To attract support, he cultivated an image of himself as a &quot;man of the people&quot;, openly smoking and drinking, showing disdain for the established parties, and speaking in an open manner that appeared unscripted. He sought to broaden UKIP&#x27;s image from that of a single-issue party by introducing an array of conservative policies, including reducing immigration, tax cuts, restoring grammar schools, and climate change denial. In doing so he was attempting to attract disenfranchised former Conservatives who had left the party after its leader, David Cameron, had moved in a socially liberal direction. According to Farage, Cameron was &quot;a socialist&quot; whose priorities were &quot;gay marriage, foreign aid, and wind farms&quot;. Cameron was highly critical of UKIP, referring to them as &quot;fruitcakes, loonies, and closet racists&quot;. The Conservatives&#x27; largest donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated £100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron&#x27;s stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU. After trust in the mainstream parties was damaged by the parliamentary expenses scandal, UKIP received an immediate surge in support. This helped it in the 2009 European Parliament election, in which it secured 2.5 million votes (16.5%), resulting in 13 MEPs, becoming the second largest party in the European Parliament after the Conservatives. During the election UKIP outperformed the BNP, whose electoral support base collapsed shortly afterward.

In September 2009, Farage resigned as leader. The subsequent leadership election was won by Lord (Malcolm) Pearson, who emphasised UKIP&#x27;s opposition to high immigration rates and Islamism in Britain, calling for a ban on the burqa being worn in public. Pearson was unpopular with the UKIP grassroots, who viewed him as an establishment figure too favourable to the Conservatives. In the 2010 general election, UKIP fielded 558 candidates and secured 3.1% of the vote (919,471 votes), but won no seats. Pearson stood down as leader in August, and Farage was re-elected in the leadership election with more than 60% of the vote.

Farage placed new emphasis on developing areas of local support through growth in local councils. Observing that the party had done well in areas dominated by white blue-collar workers with no educational attainment, and that conversely it had done poorly in areas with high numbers of graduates and ethnic minorities, UKIP&#x27;s campaign refocused directly at the former target vote. UKIP support would be bolstered by dissatisfaction with the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government and the perception that its austerity policies benefited the socio-economic elite while imposing hardship on most Britons. During this year, UKIP had witnessed far greater press coverage and growing support, with opinion polls placing it at around 10% support in late 2012. UKIP put up a record number of candidates for the 2013 local elections, achieving its strongest local government result, polling an average of 23% in the wards where it stood, and increasing its number of elected councillors from four to 147. This was the best result for a party outside the big three in British politics since the Second World War, with UKIP being described as &quot;the most popular political insurgency&quot; in Britain since the Social Democratic Party during the 1980s.

===Entering mainstream politics: 2014–2016===
In March 2014, Ofcom awarded UKIP &quot;major party status&quot;. In the 2014 local elections, UKIP won 163 seats, an increase of 128, but did not take control of any council. In the 2014 European Parliament elections, UKIP received the greatest number of votes (27.5%) of any British party, which elected 24 MEPs. The party won seats in every region of Britain, including its first in Scotland. It made strong gains in traditionally Labour voting areas within Wales and the North of England; it for instance came either first or second in all 72 council areas of the latter. The victory established Farage and UKIP as &quot;truly household names&quot;. It was the first time since 1906 that a party other than Labour or the Conservatives had won the most votes in a UK-wide election.

UKIP gained its first MP when Conservative defector Douglas Carswell won the seat of Clacton during an October 2014 by-election. In November fellow Conservative defector Mark Reckless became UKIP&#x27;s second MP in a Rochester and Strood by-election. In the 2015 general election, UKIP secured over 3.8 million votes (12.6% of the total), replacing the Liberal Democrats as the third most popular party, but only secured one seat, with Carswell retaining his seat and Reckless losing his. In the run-up to the election, Farage stated that he would resign as party leader if he did not win South Thanet. On failing to do so, he resigned, although was reinstated three days later when the NEC rejected his resignation. A period of &#x27;civil war&#x27; broke out among senior membership between those who favoured Farage&#x27;s leadership and those seeking a change. In the 2015 Oldham West and Royton by-election the party attacked Jeremy Corbyn as a security risk, but only gained a small increase in support at the expense of the Conservative Party. In the 2016 National Assembly for Wales election, UKIP nearly tripled their share of votes (from 4.7 per cent to 12.5 per cent) and won seven seats. UKIP had also won control of its first UK council, in Thanet, in May 2015; it took overall control from Labour and increased its seats on the council from two to 33.

=== 2016 Brexit referendum ===

To counter the loss of further votes to UKIP, the governing Conservatives, led by David Cameron, promised a referendum on the UK&#x27;s continued membership of the EU. Rather than taking part in the official Vote Leave campaign, to which various Eurosceptic Conservative and Labour politicians were linked, UKIP affiliated itself with the Leave.EU campaign group. Farage gained regular press coverage during the campaign, in which Leave.EU emphasised what it characterised as the negative impact of immigration on local communities and public services. The June 2016 referendum produced a 51.89% majority in favour of leaving the EU: the accomplishment of UKIP&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; raised questions about the party&#x27;s future. The loss of its MEPs would result in the loss of its primary institutional representation and a key source of its funding.

===Decline: 2016–present===
==== Downward turn (2016–2018) ====
After the referendum, Farage resigned as UKIP leader. Diane James was elected as his successor, but resigned after 18 days. Farage&#x27;s former deputy, Paul Nuttall, was elected leader that month. In March 2017, the party&#x27;s only MP, Carswell, left the party to sit as an independent. The following month, Reckless also left UKIP. In the 2017 local elections, UKIP lost all 145 seats it was defending, but gained one on Lancashire County Council. These results led several prominent former UKIP members to call for the party to be disbanded. In the following 2017 general election, UKIP received fewer than 600,000 votes and won no seats. The following day, Nuttall resigned and Steve Crowther took over as interim party leader. In July 2017, it lost its majority on Thanet council when Councillor Beverly Martin defected to the Conservatives; in September all three UKIP councillors on Plymouth City Council defected to the Conservatives, as did Alexandra Phillips, who had been UKIP&#x27;s head of media for three years.

In 2017, Henry Bolton, a former soldier, was elected leader. In January 2018, UKIP MEP Jonathan Arnott resigned from the party. In December 2017, former UKIP Suffolk County Council member and parliamentary candidate from the general election in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, Stephen Searle, murdered his wife Anne Searle at their home in Stowmarket. In January 2018, UKIP&#x27;s NEC delivered a vote of no confidence in Bolton; only Bolton voted against the motion. He nevertheless refused to resign. In protest, Margot Parker resigned as deputy leader, as did the party&#x27;s spokesmen for government, education, immigration, and trade and industry. A few days later, all 17 UKIP members of Thurrock Council left the party and formed Thurrock Independents. In February, UKIP members passed a vote of no confidence in Bolton, removing him as leader. He was replaced by Gerard Batten as interim leader until a new leadership election could be held. When the election occurred in April, Batten stood unopposed and was elected.

==== Move towards the far right (2018–2019) ====

In the 2018 local elections, UKIP lost 124 of the 126 seats it was defending, and gained a single seat in Derby, for a net loss of 123. MEP James Carver left UKIP to sit as an independent on 28 May 2018, becoming the sixth UKIP MEP to leave since 2014.

Under the leadership of Henry Bolton, party membership was understood to have fallen to around 18,000 by January 2018. During Batten&#x27;s interim leadership term, the party avoided insolvency after a financial appeal to members. As the new permanent leader, Batten focused the party more on opposing Islam, which he described as a &quot;death cult&quot;, sought closer relations with the right-wing activist Tommy Robinson and his followers, and made Muslim-only prisons party policy (which was criticised as &quot;the first step to Muslim concentration camps&quot;). UKIP was criticised as an &quot;explicitly far-right party&quot; after they invited Paul Joseph Watson as a spokesman. The party saw its membership rise by 15% in July 2018, following the publication of the Chequers Agreement and allowing three prominent far-right activists to join the party. Previous leader Nigel Farage stated he was &quot;really upset&quot; that Robinson could be allowed into the party and that he believed Gerard Batten was marginalising the party.

Batten&#x27;s appointment of Robinson as an adviser was followed by a wave of high-profile resignations from the party. Farage announced his decision to resign in December 2018, calling Batten &quot;obsessed&quot; with Islam and saying that &quot;UKIP wasn&#x27;t founded to be a party based on fighting a religious crusade&quot;. Former deputy chair Suzanne Evans had left earlier that week after Batten survived a vote of confidence from the party NEC. The former leader of the party in the Welsh Assembly, Caroline Jones, and the MEP William Dartmouth had also cited the party&#x27;s trajectory to the right as reasons for leaving the party. Another former leader, Paul Nuttall, also left for the same reason. By December 2018, a majority of the party&#x27;s MEPs had left. Others leaving included Peter Whittle, the party&#x27;s top vote-winner on the London Assembly.

On 9 December 2018, before an important vote on Brexit legislation, UKIP led a &quot;Brexit Betrayal&quot; rally in central London fronted by Robinson, alongside prominent far-right groups. By April 2019, of 24 UKIP MEPs elected in the 2014 European Election, only four remained members of UKIP. Ten of these MEPs would later move to Nigel&#x27;s Farage&#x27;s new Brexit Party (with the party eventually succeeding UKIP politically), whilst O&#x27;Flynn defected to the SDP. Most others continued to sit as Independent MEPs.

By April 2019, the British government had agreed an extension to EU membership with the EU until 31 October 2019, which would mean the UK would take part in the 2019 European Parliament elections. Candidates selected by UKIP to run in the election included right-wing YouTube personalities Carl Benjamin and Mark Meechan. Benjamin had caused controversy by making &quot;inappropriate&quot; comments in 2016 about the rape threats to a female Labour MP Jess Phillips, with the UKIP Swindon branch chair calling for him to be deselected. Videos made by Benjamin in which he used racist terms also caused controversy. In May, the 2019 United Kingdom local elections saw UKIP lose around 80% of the seats it was defending. The party was criticised for failing &quot;to capitalise on the collapse of the Conservatives&quot; by commentators. In the European elections later that month, UKIP received 3.3% of the vote and lost all its remaining seats.

On 2 June 2019, Batten resigned his post as party leader as he had promised if he lost his MEP position. In the 2019 UKIP leadership election, Richard Braine was elected UKIP leader and attempted to appoint Batten as deputy leader. Braine&#x27;s attempt to appoint Batten as the party&#x27;s deputy leader was blocked by its NEC. Braine was criticised in the press for comments he has made which were considered racist and offensive, including one incident in which he claimed he &quot;often confused&quot; London mayor Sadiq Khan with Mohammad Sidique Khan, one of the 7/7 terror attackers. Braine later further came under fire when he announced he planned to boycott the September 2019 UKIP Party conference in Newport, after fewer than 450 tickets were sold for the conference. The chairman of UKIP, Kirstan Herriot, told members that Braine had attempted to cancel the conference due to the low turnout and was highly critical of this attempted action.

==== Internal instability and wipeout (2019–present) ====

In October 2019, UKIP underwent a leadership crisis in the run-up to its NEC elections after it suspended Braine&#x27;s membership, and by extension, his eligibility to be party leader, over allegations of data theft from party databases. Three other members associated with Braine – Jeff Armstrong, the party&#x27;s general secretary appointed by Braine; NEC candidate Mark Dent; and Tony Sharp – were also suspended. In response, Braine accused the NEC of carrying out a purge of members. All four members were reported to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. On 30 October 2019, Braine resigned as leader of the party. He cited &quot;internal conflict&quot; and an inability to &quot;prevent a purge of good members from the party&quot;, referring to the NEC&#x27;s decision to add &quot;Integrity&quot;, an anti-Islam faction within UKIP supporting Tommy Robinson, Batten and Braine, to the party&#x27;s proscribed list of organisations.

On 7 November 2019, Welsh Assembly Member and UKIP group leader Gareth Bennett resigned from UKIP and chose to sit as an independent in the Welsh Assembly. He stated that he wanted to support Boris Johnson&#x27;s Brexit deal. As a result, the sole remaining UKIP member of the Welsh Assembly was Neil Hamilton.

In November 2019, Meechan posted a video to his YouTube channel, announcing that he had left UKIP, citing internal disputes and backstabbing within the party over their leadership as his reason for leaving.

On 16 November 2019, NEC member Patricia Mountain was appointed interim leader in preparation for the December general election and the upcoming UKIP leadership election. Only 44 UKIP candidates stood in the December 2019 general election, targeting constituencies that voted to leave the European Union in which the Brexit Party withdrew their candidates for the Conservatives or where the Conservative candidate was in favour of remaining in the EU. On 2 December 2019, Mountain appeared on Sky News for an interview with journalist Adam Boulton as a part of the launch of the election manifesto for UKIP; it lasted for eight minutes and the interview was described by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; as a &quot;car crash&quot;, and there were reports that she was mistaken for the titular character of &quot;Catherine Tate&#x27;s Nan&quot;. Mountain was unable to name a single seat her party was contending and &quot;accidentally called her party racist&quot;. UKIP failed to win any seats it contested in the election, and nationwide the party received only 22,817 votes (0.1% of the vote share). This result was the lowest the party had achieved in a general election in its history. The party also failed to retain any deposits, only received more than 1,000 votes in two seats, and, in another two seats, finished behind the satirical Official Monster Raving Loony Party.

In January 2020, David Kurten, UKIP&#x27;s last remaining London Assembly Member, left UKIP to stand as an independent candidate in the 2020 London Assembly election and the 2020 London mayoral election. Kurten described the politics of both UKIP and the Brexit Party as needing &quot;rebranding&quot; once Britain left the EU on 31 January. Kurten&#x27;s departure ended UKIP&#x27;s presence on the London Assembly.

In March 2020, according to a tweet by former leader Gerard Batten, the party was reported to be &quot;close to insolvency&quot;.

On 25 June 2020, Freddy Vachha was elected unopposed as leader. He stated that the party &quot;went astray quite a few years ago&quot; and that under his leadership it would &quot;return to our libertarian freedom-loving principles&quot;. On 12 September 2020, it was reported that Vachha had been suspended from the party following a formal complaint of bullying and harassment. Later that day, UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton was made interim leader. Vachha argued a short time later that he was still leader, and that his suspension was unconstitutional, as he claimed to have appointed Marietta King as chairman in place of Ben Walker a few days earlier. Vachha decided to take legal action, however in December a judge refused his request to fast-track the case. Vachha then dropped his legal case and was ordered to pay the party&#x27;s legal costs.

In the 2021 Senedd election, UKIP performed poorly and suffered a &quot;complete collapse&quot; of voter support, with the Conservative Party gaining a number of voters who had in previous elections voted UKIP. The party finished seventh with 1.56% of regional list votes. Neil Hamilton, Interim UKIP leader and UKIP&#x27;s sole MS in the Welsh Senedd lost his seat, ending any representation UKIP had outside of local government in England. In the Scottish Parliament election, the party received just 3,848 (0.14%) list votes across the whole country despite standing in every region in Scotland. In the 2021 local elections, UKIP lost all the seats it was defending from the previous elections in those council areas. Furthermore, in the London mayoral election, the UKIP candidate, Peter Gammons, achieved 0.6% of the total vote, finishing 13th. The party finished ninth in the London Assembly election, down from fourth in 2016.

After a period as acting leader, Hamilton was elected as leader in October 2021, receiving 498 votes of 631 cast (78.9%) against challenger John Poynton. In April 2023, the party removed a longstanding ban of current or former members of far-right groups and parties – including the British National Party (BNP) – from joining the party, and replaced it with a ban of members of several anti-fascist, left-wing, and environmentalist groups. In the May 2023 local elections, it lost all of its remaining council seats leaving the party without representation at any level.

At the start of 2024, Hamilton announced that he would retire as party leader that May, leading to a new leadership contest. Bill Etheridge, Lois Perry, and Anne Marie Waters, who had rejoined the party the previous year after having left to form the For Britain Movement, were announced as candidates for the contest, though Waters subsequently withdrew her candidacy for unspecified personal reasons. Lois Perry was elected on 13 May 2024, and announced upon the calling of the 2024 United Kingdom general election later that month that the party would be entering into an electoral alliance with the English Democrats. On 15 June, after just 34 days as leader, Perry resigned due to health issues. Deputy leader Nick Tenconi took over as leader for the duration of the campaign, which saw the party&#x27;s vote further decline from its 2019 levels, earning just 6,350 votes nationwide. Of the 26 candidates nominated, all but three of them finished with fewer than 300 votes, with 17 of them finishing in last place in their constituency. Unlike the 2019 election, however, the party did succeed in retaining one deposit by winning 6.3% of the vote in Stone, Great Wyrley and Penkridge, largely due to Reform UK (as the Brexit Party had renamed itself after the previous election) not nominating a candidate there; the 2,638 votes won by the UKIP candidate Janice Mackay single-handedly accounted for 41.5% of the party&#x27;s national vote share. On 2 August 2024, activist and commentator Calvin Robinson became the lead spokesman for the party.

==Ideology and policies==
===Right-wing populism===
UKIP is situated on the right-wing of the left–right political spectrum. More specifically, academic political scientists and commentators have described UKIP as a right-wing populist party, and as part of Europe&#x27;s wider radical right. The term &quot;populism&quot; refers to political groups which ideologically contrast &quot;the people&quot; against an elite or group of &quot;dangerous others&quot; whom the populists claim threaten the sovereignty of &quot;the people&quot;, and during its establishment in 1993, UKIP&#x27;s founders explicitly described it as a populist party. At the time, its &quot;ideological heritage&quot; lay within the right-wing of the Conservative Party, and UKIP was influenced by the &quot;Tory populism&quot; of Conservative politicians Margaret Thatcher and Enoch Powell.

The political scientists Amir Abedi and Thomas Carl Lundberg characterised UKIP as an &quot;Anti-Political Establishment&quot; party. The party&#x27;s rhetoric presents the idea that there is a fundamental divide between the British population and the elite who govern the country. UKIP claims to stand up for ordinary people against this political elite. UKIP politician Bill Etheridge for instance claimed that his party represented &quot;a democratic revolution... the people of Britain rising up and fighting to wrestle power from the elite&quot;. Contributing to this anti-establishment message, Farage describes the party&#x27;s supporters as &quot;the People&#x27;s Army&quot;, and he regularly held photo-opportunities and journalistic interviews in a pub, thus cultivating an &quot;erudite everyman&quot; image that contrasted with his past as a commodities trader.

UKIP uses recurring populist rhetoric—for instance by describing its policies as &quot;common sense&quot; and &quot;straight talking&quot;—in order to present itself as a straightforward alternative to the mainstream parties and their supposedly elusive and complex discourse. UKIP presents the UK&#x27;s three primary parties—the Conservatives, Labour, and Liberal Democrats—as being essentially interchangeable, referring to them with the portmanteau of &quot;LibLabCon&quot;. Farage accused all three parties of being social-democratic in ideology and &quot;virtually indistinguishable from one another on nearly all the key issues&quot;. Farage has also accused the Scottish National Party of being &quot;the voice of anti-Englishness&quot;, suggesting that elements of the Scottish nationalist movement are &quot;deeply racist, with a total hatred of the English&quot;.

===Nationalism and British unionism===
UKIP has always had the politics of national identity at its core. The party is nationalist, and its &quot;basic claim—that the highest priority for the British polity is to assure that it is fully governed by the national state—is a nationalist one.&quot; The party describes its position as being that of civic nationalism, and in its manifesto explicitly rejects ethnic nationalism by encouraging support from Britons of all ethnicities and religions. Rejecting claims that it is racist, both Sked and later Farage described UKIP as a &quot;non-racist, non-sectarian party&quot;. In UKIP&#x27;s literature, the party has placed an emphasis on &quot;restoring Britishness&quot; and counteracting what it sees as a &quot;serious existential crisis&quot; exhibited by the &quot;Islamification&quot; of Britain, the &quot;pseudo-nationalisms&quot; of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and the multicultural and supranational policies promoted by &quot;the cultural left&quot;, describing its own stance as being &quot;unashamedly unicultural&quot;. It has been suggested that this attitude compromises the party&#x27;s claim that its form of British nationalism is civic and inclusive.

UKIP considers itself to be a British unionist party, although its support base is centred largely in England. Farage characterised his party&#x27;s growth as &quot;a very English rebellion&quot;, and has described UKIP as &quot;unashamedly patriotic, proud to be who we are as a nation&quot;. The political scientist Richard Hayton argued that UKIP&#x27;s British unionism reflects &quot;Anglo-Britishness&quot;, a perspective that blurs the distinction between Britain and England. With Mycock, Hayton argued that in conflating Englishness with Britishness, UKIP exhibited an &quot;inherent Anglocentrism&quot; that negates the distinct culture of the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish peoples of the United Kingdom. Hayton suggests that UKIP tap into &quot;a vein of nostalgic cultural nationalism&quot; within England, and it has been noted that UKIP&#x27;s discourse frames the image of Englishness in a nostalgic manner, harking back to the years before the collapse of the British Empire.

UKIP has emphasised the need to correct what it perceives as the United Kingdom&#x27;s imbalance against England resulting from the &quot;West Lothian question&quot; and the Barnett formula. The party has mobilised English nationalist sentiment brought on by English concerns following the devolution within the UK and the rise of Welsh and Scottish nationalisms. The party initially opposed federalism in the UK, criticising the establishment of the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament. However, in September 2011 Farage and the NEC announced their support for the establishment of an English Parliament to accompany the other devolved governments. In its 2015 manifesto, it promised to make St. George&#x27;s Day and St. David&#x27;s Day bank holidays in England and Wales, respectively. Similarly, UKIP&#x27;s 2017 manifesto pledged to declare 23 June British Independence Day and observe it annually as a national holiday.

===Euroscepticism, immigration, and foreign policy===
UKIP embraces the ideology of hard Euroscepticism, also known as &quot;Eurorejectionism&quot;. Opposition to the United Kingdom&#x27;s continued membership of the European Union has been its &quot;core issue&quot; and is &quot;central to the party&#x27;s identity&quot;. UKIP characterises the EU as a fundamentally undemocratic institution and stresses the need to regain what it describes as the UK&#x27;s national sovereignty from the EU. It presents the EU as being an exemplar of non-accountability, corruption, and inefficiency, and views it as being responsible for the &quot;flooding&quot; of the UK with migrants, in particular from Eastern Europe. UKIP emphasises Euroscepticism to a far greater extent than any of Western Europe&#x27;s other main radical right parties, and it was only post-2010 that it began seriously articulating other issues. Hayton nevertheless suggested that Euroscepticism still remains &quot;the lens through which most of its other policy positions are framed and understood&quot;.
The party opposed the 2004 enlargement of the European Union into Eastern Europe. UKIP advocated leaving the European Union, stopping payments to the EU, and withdrawing from EU treaties, while maintaining trading ties with other European countries. Initially, UKIP&#x27;s policy was that, in the event of winning a general election, it would remove the UK from the EU without a referendum on the issue. The party leadership later suggested a referendum, expressing the view that in the case of an exit vote, it could negotiate favourable terms for the country&#x27;s withdrawal, for instance through ensuring a free trade agreement between the UK and EU. UKIP eventually committed to a referendum in its 2015 manifesto. In contrast to involvement in the EU, UKIP has emphasised the UK&#x27;s global connections, in particularly to member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. UKIP rejected the description that they were &quot;Europhobes&quot;, maintaining that its stance was anti-EU, not anti-European.

UKIP has placed great emphasis on the issue of immigration to the UK, and in 2013 Farage described it as &quot;the biggest single issue facing this party&quot;. UKIP attributes British membership of the EU as the core cause of immigration to the UK, citing the Union&#x27;s open-border policies as the reason why large numbers of East European migrants have moved to Britain. On their campaign billboards, UKIP have presented EU migrants as a source of crime, as well as a pressure on housing, the welfare state, and the health service. Farage has emphasised not only the economic impact of migration but also the public anxieties regarding the cultural changes brought by immigration. In its 2009 electoral manifesto, UKIP proposed a five-year ban on any migrants coming to the UK. By 2015, it had modified this to the view that the five-year ban should apply only to unskilled migrants. To regulate the arrival of skilled migrants, it called for the UK to adopt a points-based system akin to that employed by Australia. It advocated the establishment of a watchdog to help curb immigration, and bring the levels of net annual immigration down from the hundreds of thousands to between 20,000 and 50,000, which was the average level in the UK between 1950 and 2000. UKIP calls for all immigrants to require compulsory health insurance, and proposes that migrants be barred from claiming any state benefits until they had been resident in the UK for at least five years.

UKIP gained traction from the fact that post-2008, immigration had come to the forefront of many Britons&#x27; minds as a result of increased EU migration and its concomitant social changes. By the 2015 general election, the political scientists James Dennison and Matthew Goodwin argued, UKIP had secured &quot;ownership&quot; of the immigration issue among British voters, having secured it from the Conservatives. However, the party&#x27;s campaign against immigration has been accused of using racism and xenophobia to win votes. Political scientist David Art suggested that in its campaign to restrict immigration, UKIP had &quot;flirted with xenophobia&quot;, while Daniel T. Dye stated that part of the party&#x27;s appeal was its &quot;sometimes-xenophobic populism&quot;, and the journalist Daniel Trilling stated that UKIP tapped into the &quot;anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim populism&quot; that was popular in the late 2000s. The political scientist Simon Usherwood stated that UKIP&#x27;s hardening of immigration policy &quot;risked reinforcing the party&#x27;s profile as a quasi-far-right grouping&quot;, elsewhere stating that the party was only held together by its opposition to the EU and immigration, suggesting that it had &quot;no ideological coherence&quot; beyond that.

In its 2015 campaign, UKIP called for the foreign aid budget to be cut. It has also advocated a 40% increase in the UK&#x27;s national defence budget. It opposes British military involvement in conflicts that are not perceived to be in the national interest, specifically rejecting the concept of regime change wars through humanitarian interventionism. For instance, in 2014 it opposed the Cameron government&#x27;s plans to intervene militarily against the government of Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war. In 2018, UKIP pledged to work with anti-EU populist group The Movement. The party was known for its pro-Russia stance on foreign policy.

===Economic policy===
On economic policy, UKIP shares the main three parties&#x27; acceptance of the core principles of a capitalist market economy, and the party is generally at ease with the global free market. The academics Simon Winlow, Steve Hall, and James Treadwell commented that on economic issues, &quot;UKIP wants to have its cake and eat it. It wants to retain the best bits of the market economy while discarding what it considers the negative outcomes of 21st-century neoliberalism.&quot; They noted for instance that it wanted &quot;free movement of capital&quot; yet wanted to curtail &quot;the free movement of workers across borders&quot;.

On economic issues, UKIP&#x27;s original activist base was largely libertarian, supporting an economically liberal approach. Its economic libertarian views have been influenced by classical liberalism and Thatcherism, with Thatcher representing a key influence on UKIP&#x27;s thought. Farage has characterised UKIP as &quot;the true inheritors&quot; of Thatcher, claiming that the party never would have formed had Thatcher remained Prime Minister of the UK throughout the 1990s. Winlow, Hall, and Treadwell suggested that a UKIP government would pursue &quot;hard-core Thatcherism&quot; on economic policy. UKIP presents itself as a libertarian party, and the political scientists David Deacon and Dominic Wring described it as articulating &quot;a potent brand of libertarian populism&quot;. However, commentators writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; have all challenged the description of UKIP as libertarian, highlighting its socially conservative and economically protectionist policies as being contrary to a libertarian ethos.

UKIP would allow businesses to favour British workers over migrants, and would repeal &quot;much of&quot; Britain&#x27;s racial discrimination law, which was described as &quot;shocking&quot; by the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government and viewed as discriminatory by others. However, Farage insisted that his comments regarding his party&#x27;s policies on these matters had been &quot;wilfully misinterpreted&quot;. Although the party did not have an official stance on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the party&#x27;s former international trade spokesperson (Lord Dartmouth) and former health and social care spokesperson (Louise Bours) stated that they did wish the National Health Service to be included in the trade deal, according to the &quot;International Business Times&quot;.

===Social policy===
In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, commentator Ed Rooksby described UKIP&#x27;s approach to many social issues as being &quot;traditionalist and socially conservative&quot;, while political scientist Stephen Driver has referred to the party&#x27;s appeals to &quot;traditional social values&quot;. UKIP opposed the introduction of same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom. UKIP wants to repeal the Human Rights Act, and remove Britain from both the European Convention on Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). On the repeal of Britain&#x27;s signatory to the ECHR, UKIP would like to see a referendum on the reintroduction of the death penalty in the UK.

In 2015, Farage attracted widespread press attention for suggesting that HIV positive patients who were not British citizens should not receive treatment on the NHS. In that same speech he stated that the UK should put the NHS &quot;there for British people and families, who in many cases have paid into the system for years&quot;. Farage has spoken in favour of an insurance-based system in the past, which he said would resemble the French and Dutch style system rather than an American style private system, but this was rejected by the party. He has commented, &quot;we may have to think about ways in the future about dealing with health care differently&quot;. Critics of UKIP have claimed that the party&#x27;s real desire is to dismantle and privatise the NHS, a claim bolstered by the publication of leaked documents showing that in 2013 the UKIP NEC privately spoke positively of NHS privatisation.

Although Farage had long been reticent about focusing on public anxieties surrounding Muslims in Britain, he spoke out following the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting, claiming that there was a &quot;fifth column&quot; of Islamists in the UK who—while &quot;mercifully small&quot; in number—were &quot;out to destroy our whole civilisation&quot;. At the same time he called for Western states to do more to promote their Judeo-Christian heritage, and criticised state multiculturalism for promoting social segregation, discouraging integration, and generating a &quot;tick-box approach&quot; to identity politics. In its 2017 manifesto, UKIP pledged to abolish the existence of sharia courts in the UK and ban the wearing of the niqab and burka in public; it claimed that these were needed to promote the integration of Muslims with wider British society.

UKIP is the only major political party in the United Kingdom that does not endorse renewable energy and lower carbon emissions, and its media output regularly promotes climate change denial. Farage and other senior UKIP figures have repeatedly spoken out against the construction of wind farms, deeming them a blot on the rural landscape. UKIP&#x27;s media present renewable energy as inefficient and unaffordable, and they promote the use of fossil fuels, nuclear energy and fracking. UKIP has announced that it would repeal the Climate Change Act 2008 and has placed an emphasis on protecting the Green Belt.

In its 2015 election manifesto, UKIP promised to teach a chronological understanding of &quot;British history and achievements&quot; in schools, and it calls for the scrapping of sex education for children under 11. UKIP would introduce an option for students to take an apprenticeship qualification instead of four non-core GCSEs which can be continued at A Level. Schools would be investigated by OFSTED on the presentation of a petition to the Department for Education signed by 25% of parents or governors. UKIP have promoted the scrapping of the government target that 50% of school leavers attend university, and present the policy that tuition fees would be scrapped for students taking approved degrees in science, medicine, technology, engineering or mathematics.

Farage argued that British Overseas Territories like Gibraltar should have representatives in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, akin to the privileges given to French overseas territories in France. Farage believes that all citizens for whom the British Parliament passes legislation, whether in the United Kingdom or its territories, deserve democratic representation in that Parliament.

==Support==
===Financial backing===
In 2008, Usherwood noted that UKIP relied heavily on a small number of major financial backers. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a leaked internal report to UKIP&#x27;s executive committee dated to September 2012 shows that the party&#x27;s leader argued that &quot;the key to money for us will be the hedge fund industry&quot;.

According to UKIP&#x27;s annual returns to the Electoral Commission, in 2013 the party had a total income of £2,479,314. Of this, £714,492 was from membership and subscriptions, £32,115 from fundraising activities and £1,361,640 from donations. By law, individual donations over £7,500 must be reported.

UKIP has several high-profile backers. In March 2009, the Conservative Party&#x27;s biggest-ever donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated £100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron&#x27;s stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon. He was then expelled from the Conservatives and in 2011 appointed treasurer of UKIP. In October 2014, Arron Banks, who previously gave £25,000 to the Conservatives, increased his UKIP donation from £100,000 to £1 million after Hague said he had never heard of him. The multi-millionaire Paul Sykes has helped finance the party, donating over £1 million to its 2014 campaign at the European Parliament.

In December 2014, Richard Desmond, proprietor of Express Newspapers, donated £300,000 to UKIP. Desmond had previously made the UKIP peer David Stevens his deputy chairman. The donation indicated that Desmond&#x27;s papers, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, &quot;Daily Star&quot; and &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot;, would back UKIP in the 2015 general election. Three weeks before the election, Desmond gave the party a further £1 million.

In September 2016, the major UKIP donor, Arron Banks, said that UKIP would be &quot;dead in the water&quot; if Diane James did not become leader. Following her departure after 18 days, Banks said that he would leave UKIP if Steven Woolfe was prevented from running for leader, and if two other members remained in the party: &quot;If Neil Hamilton and Douglas Carswell [UKIP&#x27;s only MP] remain in the party, and the NEC decide that Steven Woolfe cannot run for leader, I will be leaving UKIP&quot;.

===Membership===
UKIP&#x27;s membership numbers increased from 2002 to the time of the 2004 European Parliament election, before hovering around the 16,000 mark during the late 2000s. In 2004, the party claimed 20,000 members, with this remaining broadly stable, and in June 2007 it had a recorded 16,700 members. By July 2013, the figure had grown to 30,000 before ending the year at 32,447. In 2014, the number was 36,000 on 22 April, by 7 May reached 37,000 and on 19 May, less than a fortnight later and only three days before the 2014 European Parliament election, rose to 38,000. In January 2015, UKIP membership was the fifth-highest of British parties.

Membership was 45,000 in May 2015, but since then has fallen to 32,757 in November 2016, and as low as 18,000 under Henry Bolton by January 2018.

In June 2018, four political activists known through social media – Paul Joseph Watson, Mark Meechan, Carl Benjamin, and Milo Yiannopoulos – joined the party. This was followed by the party gaining around 500 members.

In July 2018, it was reported the party had attracted 3,200 new members, a 15% increase.

The party&#x27;s report to The Electoral Commission of its accounts as of 31 December 2020 stated the party had a membership of 3,888.

===Voter base===
In its early years, UKIP targeted itself towards southern English, middle-class Eurosceptic voters, those who had been supporters of the Conservative Party until John Major&#x27;s Conservative government signed the Maastricht Treaty. This led to the widespread perception that UKIP&#x27;s supporters were primarily middle-class ex-Conservative voters, with commentator Peter Oborne characterising UKIP as &quot;the Conservative Party in exile&quot;.

After 2009, UKIP refocused its attention to appeal primarily to white British, working-class, blue-collar workers; those who had traditionally voted Labour or in some cases for Thatcher&#x27;s Conservatives but who had ceased voting or begun to vote BNP since the emergence of the New Labour project in the 1990s. In this way, UKIP&#x27;s support base does not line up with the historical left-right divide in British politics, instead being primarily rooted in class divisions. This mirrored the voting base of other radical right parties across Western Europe which had grown since the early 1990s. This scenario had come about following the rapid growth of the middle-classes and the concomitant decline of the working-class population in Western Europe; the centre-left, social-democratic parties who had traditionally courted the support of the working classes largely switched their attention to the newly emergent middle-classes, leaving their initial support base increasingly alienated and creating the vacuum which the radical right exploited.

On the basis of their extensive study of data on the subject, in 2014 the political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford concluded that &quot;UKIP&#x27;s support has a very clear social profile, more so than any of the mainstream parties. Their electoral base is old, male, working class, white and less educated&quot;. They found that 57% of professed UKIP supporters were over the age of 54, while only one in 10 was under 35, which they attributed to the fact that UKIP&#x27;s socially conservative and Eurosceptic platform appealed far more to Britain&#x27;s older generations that their younger counterparts, who were more socially liberal and less antagonistic towards the EU.

Males accounted for 57% of UKIP supporters, which Ford and Goodwin suggested was due to women voters being put off by a number of high-profile sexist remarks made by UKIP candidates. A vast majority of UKIP supporters, 99.6%, identified as white, reflecting the fact that ethnic minorities tended to avoid the party. Over half, or 55%, of UKIP supporters had left school aged 16 or under, with only 24% having attended university, suggesting that the party primarily appealed to the least educated voters in society. Ford and Goodwin also found that UKIP&#x27;s support base was more working-class than that of any other party, with 42% of supporters in blue-collar jobs. Ford and Goodwin described UKIP&#x27;s voters as primarily comprising the &quot;left behind&quot; sector of society, &quot;older, less skilled and less well educated working-class voters&quot; who felt disenfranchised from the mainstream political parties which had increasingly focused on attracting the support of middle-class swing voters.

Ford and Goodwin nevertheless noted that UKIP was &quot;not a purely blue-collar party but an alliance of manual workers, employers and the self-employed.&quot;
Geoffrey Evans and Jon Mellon highlighted that UKIP receive &quot;a greater proportion of their support from lower professionals and managers&quot; than from any other class group. They highlighted that polls repeatedly demonstrated that UKIP drew more votes from Conservative voters than Labour ones. They suggested that the assumption that working-class voters who supported UKIP had previously been Labour voters was misplaced, suggesting that these people had ceased voting for Labour &quot;a long time before UKIP were an effective political presence&quot;, having been alienated by Labour&#x27;s &quot;pro-middle class, pro-EU and, as it eventually turned out, pro-immigration agenda&quot;.
In 2011, Goodwin, Ford, and David Cutts published a study that identified Euroscepticism as the main causal factor for voters supporting UKIP, with concern over immigration levels and distrust of the political establishment also featuring as important motives. They noted, however, that during elections for the European Parliament, UKIP was able to broaden its support to gain the vote of largely middle-class Eurosceptics who vote Conservative in other elections.

From their analysis of the data, Ford and Goodwin stated that UKIP&#x27;s support base has &quot;strong parallels&quot; both with that of western Europe&#x27;s other radical right parties and with the BNP during their electoral heyday. Conversely, an earlier study by Richard Whitaker and Philip Lynch, based on polling data from YouGov, concluded that UKIP voters were distinct from those of far-right parties. The authors found that voter support for UKIP correlated with concerns about the value of immigration and a lack of trust in the political system, but the biggest explanatory factor for their support of UKIP was Euroscepticism. A further study by the same authors suggests that UKIP voters&#x27; core beliefs align very closely to those of the UKIP candidates; particularly so on issues surrounding European integration, which has resulted in Conservative voters switching to UKIP due to Conservative divisions on this issue. One study found that 63% of UKIP voters considered themselves to be right-wing, while 22% thought centrist and 16% thought leftist. 81% believed that immigration undermined British culture, a view shared by only half the wider British population. On economic issues, there was a divide between UKIP voters and the party itself. In contrast to the party&#x27;s economic liberalism, UKIP supporters often held more leftist attitudes to the economy, with almost 80% opining that big business took advantage of working people and almost 70% thinking that privatisation had gone too far.

UKIP has been most successful along England&#x27;s eastern and southern coasts, in parts of south-west England, and in the Labour heartlands of Northern England and Wales. It has not done well in London and in university towns and urban areas with younger populations like Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, and Brighton. It has done well in areas with large numbers of old, white, and poorer people, and weaker in areas with larger numbers of younger, more ethnically and culturally diverse, and financially secure people.
Ford and Goodwin noted that UKIP &quot;barely registers&quot; with young Britons, graduates, ethnic minorities, and pro-EU voters.
According to an Opinium poll in December 2014 on the views of 17- to 22-year-olds, Farage was the least popular political leader. Only 3% of young people questioned said that they intended to vote for UKIP, compared with 19% among voters of all ages. The 17% who said they would vote outside the three main parties were four times more likely to vote for the Green Party than for UKIP. Conversely, a March 2015 Ipsos Mori poll found among 18- to 34-year-olds UKIP was polling nearly as well as the Green Party, somewhat contradicting the idea that Farage lacked appeal for younger voters. On the basis of their fieldwork among supporters of the English Defence League (EDL), an anti-Islam social movement, Winlow, Hall, and Treadwell noted that most EDL supporters whom they encountered intended to vote for UKIP in the build-up to the 2015 general election.

UKIP supporters are sometimes nicknamed &quot;Kippers&quot;. In May 2017, in response to large defections from the party, Goodwin said &quot;Former Kippers did not walk but literally sprinted over to the Conservatives.&quot;

==Organisation==
===Leadership===
According to Part VII of the UKIP constitution, the party leader is voted for by postal ballot by all paid-up party members &quot;in good standing&quot;. The winner is the candidate with the simple majority of votes cast. If there is only one valid candidate for the position, they are elected without the need for a ballot. While the default term length is four years, the leader can obtain an extension of up to a year if there is an imminent General or European Parliament election; this must be approved by at least two-thirds of the 12-person NEC. If at least nine NEC members endorse a vote of no confidence in the leader, an emergency general meeting (EGM) will be called. When the leadership becomes vacant unexpectedly, the NEC has 14 days to name an interim leader who exercises all leadership functions until the next leadership election. The leader has the power to name a Deputy Leader of their own choice and assign them whatever duty they choose.
==== Timeline ====

===Party chairman===
===Regions===
UKIP&#x27;s organisation is divided into 12 regions: London, South East, South West, Eastern, East Midlands, West Midlands, Yorkshire, North East, North West, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. An additional 13th branch operates in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar; it held its first public meeting at the Lord Nelson pub in April 2013.

At the end of 2013, UKIP Scotland was dissolved after infighting tore the regional party apart; the party&#x27;s administrative body was dissolved, Mike Scott-Hayward (the chairman and chief fundraiser) quit, and Farage fired Lord (Christopher) Monckton via email. The national party and UKIP Scotland focused on supporting the candidates for the 2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom. After David Coburn won an MEP seat in Scotland in those elections, he was elected as leader of UKIP Scotland.

Veteran and former long-serving Antrim and Newtownabbey-based councillor, Robert Hill was appointed by Gerard Batten as UKIP&#x27;s Spokesman for Northern Ireland in May 2018. In August 2018, Welsh Assembly Member Gareth Bennett was elected as leader of UKIP in Wales after a membership ballot.

==Representatives==
===House of Commons===
In the UK, the first-past-the-post voting system for electing MPs to the House of Commons was a significant barrier to UKIP, whose support was widely distributed across different areas rather than being strongly focused in particular constituencies. Further, the system encouraged tactical voting, with many UKIP supporters believing that a vote for the party would be a wasted vote. Recognising this, Farage believed that the best way to win a seat in the House of Commons was to win a by-election, with UKIP contesting a number of these from 2010 onward. Over the next few years, it contested a number of by-elections around the country, coming second in both Barnsley Central and Rotherham.
In 2008, Bob Spink, the MP for Castle Point, resigned the Tory whip (becoming an Independent), but in April that year joined UKIP. However, in November he appeared again as an Independent in Commons proceedings, ultimately losing the seat to a Conservative in 2010.

In 2014, two Conservative MPs changed allegiance to UKIP and resigned their seats to fight by-elections for UKIP. Douglas Carswell won the Clacton by-election on 9 October, making him the first MP to be elected representing UKIP. Mark Reckless was also victorious in the Rochester and Strood by-election on 20 November.
At the 2015 general election, Carswell kept his seat in Clacton but Reckless lost Rochester to the Conservative Kelly Tolhurst. UKIP had 3,881,129 votes (12.6%) and was the third largest party on vote share, yet it won only one seat. Because of this, there were calls from some in UKIP for a voting reform in favour of proportional representation. Carswell quit the party in March 2017 to become an independent, leaving UKIP without any MPs in the Commons.
In the 2017 election, a snap election initiated by PM Theresa May and scheduled for 8 June 2017, UKIP got 1.9% of the votes (after 12.6% in the 2015 election) and no seats in the House of Commons.

===House of Lords===
On 24 June 1995, UKIP gained its first member of the House of Lords, Lord Grantley, who had joined the party in 1993 from the Conservatives and had recently succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles. However, with the coming House of Lords Act 1999, he decided not to stand for election as a continuing member, and so left the House in November 1999. Earlier in 1999, UKIP had gained a second peer in the House of Lords, The Earl of Bradford, but he, too, left the House in November 1999 because of the House of Lords Act. Lord Pearson of Rannoch and Lord Willoughby de Broke both defected to UKIP in 2007, giving the party its first representation in the House of Lords since the departure of Lord Grantley and Lord Bradford. Lord Pearson went on to serve as party leader from November 2009 to September 2010. On 18 September 2012, Lord Stevens of Ludgate joined UKIP, having sat as an Independent Conservative since his expulsion from the Conservatives in 2004. In Autumn 2018, Lord Willoughby de Broke left UKIP, reducing the party&#x27;s representation in the upper house back down to two. Lord Stevens also left the party, in December 2018, leaving former leader Lord Pearson as UKIP&#x27;s sole peer. In October 2019, Lord Pearson resigned his membership of the party.

===Devolved parliaments and assemblies===
UKIP competes electorally in all four parts of the United Kingdom.

==== Northern Ireland ====

In October 2012, UKIP gained its first representation in a devolved Assembly the Northern Ireland Assembly in David McNarry, MLA for Strangford, who had left the Ulster Unionist Party. The party however failed to continue its representation at the 2016 election, coming within a hundred votes of taking a seat in East Antrim. This seat was unsuccessfully contested in the 2017 election.

==== Scotland ====

UKIP&#x27;s support has been particularly weak in Scotland, where it has no representatives in the devolved parliament. UKIP fielded candidates at the Scottish Parliament election on 5 May 2011, when its platform included a commitment to keep the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, while replacing the separately-elected Members of the Scottish Parliament with the Members of the House of Commons elected in Scotland.
The party fielded candidates on the regional lists in the 2016 election without any success. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election candidates were again fielded on regional lists.

==== Wales ====

The party also fielded candidates for the Senedd. In the 2016 election, it entered the Assembly for the first time, winning seven of 60 seats. However, following the resignations of Caroline Jones, Mark Reckless, Nathan Gill and Michelle Brown, by March 2019 the party&#x27;s representation had fallen to three AMs. UKIP ceased to have a formal Welsh Assembly group after David Rowlands resigned in May 2019 to form a new Brexit Party group with Reckless, Jones and Mandy Jones (who had replaced Nathan Gill on his resignation as an AM).
UKIP were left without any Senedd members after the 2021 Senedd election

===Local government===

UKIP initially paid little attention to local government elections. However, this changed after Farage observed that building localised strongholds of support in various parts of the country had been the process by which the Liberal Democrats had entered the House of Commons, and that this was a strategy that could benefit UKIP. UKIP subsequently focused on the 2011 local elections, in which it fielded over 1,100 candidates, winning seven seats and becoming the main opposition in over 100.

The first UKIP local council election win occurred when one of its members was elected to South Cambridgeshire District Council in 2000. A number of Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Independent local councillors in all four constituent nations of the UK defected to UKIP over subsequent years, with the most recent defections to date (May to July 2013) coming from former Conservative councillors in the London Boroughs of Merton, Richmond upon Thames and Havering, and from Labour in Northampton and North-East Lincolnshire. In May 2013, 33 English and one Welsh council held local elections, with UKIP gaining 139 seats for a total of 147, with significant gains in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Kent.

In the 2013 local elections, UKIP won 147 seats and established itself as the largest opposition party in six English county councils. At the 2013 and 2014 local elections, UKIP made significant gains to become the fourth largest party in terms of councillors in England, and fifth largest in the UK, with over 300 seats (out of about 21,000). In the 2015 local elections, UKIP took control of Thanet District Council, its first majority control of a council. However, the party lost control later in the year after several of its councillors defected and it lost its majority. UKIP later took back control as a majority after winning the 2016 Northwood ward by-election, taking its number of councillors up to 29. In the 2016 local elections, UKIP won 58 council seats, an increase of 25. In the 2017 United Kingdom local elections, UKIP lost all of the seats it was defending but gained one from Labour on Lancashire County Council. in the 2018 United Kingdom local elections, UKIP lost all but three of the 126 seats it was defending. In the
2019 United Kingdom local elections, UKIP suffered severe losses, with its number of councillors collapsing by 145 to 31, in the districts where votes were held that year. Its worst result was in Thanet where it lost 33 councillors.

In the 2021 United Kingdom local elections the party&#x27;s support fell away and all the 48 council seats in England the party were defending were lost. No seats were won in the London Assembly, Police and Crime Commissioners or elections for mayors. The 2022 local elections saw the party lose all three seats it was defending from 2018.

In the 2023 local elections, the party lost all remaining representation at council level; only one incumbent councillor defended their seat, out of the six seats UKIP contested, and losing 25 councillors from 2019, the last time the seats were up for election. The party now only has elected representatives on parish and town councils, the lowest level of local government; party chairman Ben Walker said the party had &quot;about 30 parish councillors&quot;. During the elections, Labour made significant inroads into Leave-voting areas that UKIP in which were formerly strongly competitive, and notably won overall control of Thanet District Council, that UKIP either controlled or were the largest party on between 2015 and 2019.

===European Parliament===
As a result of its hard Eurosceptic approach, UKIP does not recognise the legitimacy of the European Parliament, and under Sked&#x27;s leadership refused to take any of the EP seats that it won. This changed after 1997, when the party decided that its elected representatives would take such seats to publicise its anti-EU agenda.
As a result of the 1999 European parliament election, three UKIP MEPs were elected to the European Parliament. Together with Eurosceptic parties from other nations, they formed a new European parliamentary group called Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD).
Following the 2004 European parliament election, 37 MEPs from the UK, Poland, Denmark and Sweden founded a new European Parliamentary group called Independence and Democracy as a direct successor to the EDD group. After the 2009 European parliament election, UKIP was a founder member of a new right-wing grouping called Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) comprising Eurosceptic, radical right, nationalist, national-conservative and other political factions. This group was more right-wing than the previous term&#x27;s Independence and Democracy group.

Following the 2014 European parliament election, the EFD group was reconstituted as the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD or EFD2) group on 24 June 2014, with a significant changes to group composition, including the Five Star Movement of Italy, a total of 48 members. The EFDD group lost official status in October 2014 when the defection of the Latvian MEP Iveta Grigule meant its membership no longer met the required number of states for Parliamentary groups (at least seven different member states). On 20 October, the EFDD announced it had restored the requisite seven state diversity by recruiting Robert Iwaszkiewicz, one of four representatives of the far-right Polish party Congress of the New Right. In December 2014 UKIP co-founded the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe, a European political party whose membership is composed of several member parties of the EFDD parliamentary group.

In the 2009–14 parliament, UKIP ranked 76th out of 76 for attendance, took part in 61% of votes, and had three of the six lowest attending MEPs, which led to criticism from other parties and ex-UKIP MEPs that low participation may damage British interests. Between July 2014 and May 2015, its 23 MEPs maintained their record as the least active, participating on average in only 62.29% of votes. In response to criticism of low participation by UKIP MEPs in the EU Parliament, Farage has said that &quot;Our objective as MEPs is not to keep voting endlessly for more EU legislation and to take power away from Westminster.&quot;

====Members of the European Parliament====
UKIP had no members in the European Parliament following the 2019 EU election. Twenty-four UKIP representatives were elected in the 2014 election, but twenty subsequently defected, one was expelled and three lost their seats in the 2019 election. For a full list of defections see here.

James Carver left UKIP to sit as an independent on 28 May 2018. William Dartmouth left the party on 26 September 2018 to sit as an independent, accusing Batten of &quot;hijacking the party to campaign against Islam as a religion&quot; and associating himself with &quot;outlandish people and extreme right-wing groups&quot;. Bill Etheridge followed shortly afterwards, on 2 October 2018, saying that the party under Batten&#x27;s leadership &quot;is seen by voters as a vehicle of hate towards Muslims and the gay community&quot;.

In November 2018, Patrick O&#x27;Flynn resigned to join the Social Democratic Party in protest over UKIP&#x27;s move to the &quot;hard right&quot;, and Louise Bours became an independent MEP. Former leader Nigel Farage quit on 6 December 2018, as did Scottish MEP David Coburn. Another former leader, Paul Nuttall, quit the party the following day, as did London Assembly Member Peter Whittle. It was reported that Tim Aker had also quietly quit the party earlier in 2018. Julia Reid announced her resignation from UKIP on 8 December 2018, with Jonathan Bullock following the next day. Jill Seymour, Jane Collins and Margot Parker left for the Brexit Party on 15 April 2019, with the first of those three citing the party&#x27;s current direction and occupation of &#x27;the extreme right of politics&#x27; and the second citing Batten&#x27;s &#x27;sick&#x27; defence of Carl Benjamin&#x27;s rape comments. On 17 April, Jonathan Arnott and Ray Finch both defected to The Brexit Party and, along with Seymour, Collins and Parker, sat in the EFDD group.

As of April 2019, Batten and Agnew were members of the Europe of Nations and Freedom group in the European Parliament while Hookem was &quot;Non-Inscrit&quot; (unattached). All lost their seats in the European Parliament in June 2019.

==Election results==

=== European Parliament elections ===
=== General elections ===
During the 2010–15 Parliament, two Conservative MPs defected to UKIP and were re-elected in subsequent by-elections. At the 2015 general election, UKIP retained one of these seats (Clacton) and received over 30% of the vote in Boston and Skegness, South Thanet, Heywood and Middleton, Thurrock and Rochester and Strood. It lost its only seat in the 2017 election, when Clacton was regained by the Conservatives.

==Reception==

===Other political groups===
In campaigning on emotive issues, UKIP has proved divisive. Popular stereotypes have framed it as a far-right party, and portrayed its activists as old white men holding offensive views. The party has faced vocal opposition from anti-fascist groups such as Hope not Hate, who have accused it of tapping into nationalist and xenophobic sentiment in its campaigns. Writing for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Geoffrey Wheatcroft noted that there had been &quot;a concerted campaign to brand UKIP as racist, an accusation that some of its own activists have done nothing to discourage.&quot; Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo highlighted that Farage had been &quot;routinely ridiculed and dismissed&quot;, at best being portrayed as &quot;a beer-swilling populist who wanted to drag Britain back to the 1950s&quot; while at worst depicted as &quot;a racist... would-be demagogue&quot; who secretly wanted to overthrow the UK&#x27;s liberal parliamentary democracy.

For many years, mainstream political figures derided or demeaned the importance of UKIP, although this did little to obstruct its electoral advances. By 2014, at which point UKIP was securing significant electoral support in the European Parliamentary elections, the main parties began to take it more seriously and devoted more time to countering the electoral threat it posed to them, in turn drawing more journalistic attention to the party. This increased attention gave the party the &quot;oxygen of publicity&quot; which helped bring the party to the attention of previously inattentive voters. Many on Britain&#x27;s centre-left have been reluctant to accept that UKIP was hindering public support for Labour, instead believing that they were primarily a problem for the Conservatives and would thus help produce a Labour victory. Labour found that their campaign strategy of accusing UKIP of racism backfired, as rather than distancing UKIP supporters from the party it contributed to the perception that Labour failed to understand widespread concerns regarding immigration. A December 2014 poll by ComRes found that voters saw UKIP as closer to the centre-ground of politics than the Conservatives.

The British National Party blamed UKIP for its decline, accusing the latter of stealing BNP policies and slogans.

===Media and academia===
The British press have publicised statements made by UKIP activists and candidates which have been regarded as racist, sexist or otherwise bigoted. Among the examples of UKIP representatives and supporters embarrassing the party have been an MEP who called for a ban on the construction of mosques and for all British Muslims to sign a code of conduct, a councillor who suggested that shops should be allowed to refuse service to women and homosexuals, and a council candidate who compared Islam to Nazism and told black comedian Lenny Henry to leave Britain after the latter called for greater ethnic diversity within the UK&#x27;s creative industries. In 2015, a documentary called &quot;Meet the Ukippers&quot; filmed activists making racist statements; one said &quot;the only people I do have a problem with are negroes&quot;. For many years such individuals were internally tolerated within the party, although as part of Farage&#x27;s push to professionalise the party a number of its members, such as MEP Godfrey Bloom, were expelled for making comments that brought UKIP into disrepute. In 2018, Jo Marney—who was then the girlfriend of the party leader Henry Bolton—was suspended from UKIP after it was revealed that she had sent texts stating that black Africans were &quot;ugly&quot;. In these messages, she had criticised Meghan Markle for marrying into the British royal family, stating that Markle was &quot;a dumb little commoner&quot; and &quot;a black American. Pushing their way to the top slowly. Next will be a Muslim PM and a black king.&quot;

In a May 2014 YouGov survey, 47% considered the media to be biased against UKIP, which was double the percentage who deemed the media biased against any other party. The BBC received almost 1,200 complaints about its coverage of the 2014 European and local elections; 149 claimed that the BBC were biased against UKIP, while the rest claimed that it gave disproportionate attention to the party. The BBC defended its coverage. Farage accused the BBC of a &quot;liberal bias&quot;, particularly on issues of immigration, the EU, and climate change.

David Deacon and Dominic Wring&#x27;s examination of press coverage of UKIP during their 2014 campaign demonstrated that of the elite newspapers, the pro-EU titles &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; gave the most coverage to perceived racist and intolerant aspects of the party, while the Eurosceptic titles &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; instead focused on questioning the propriety and integrity of UKIP representatives. Among the populist tabloids, &quot;The Sun&quot;/&quot;Sun on Sunday&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;/&quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; were found to contain the most negative coverage of UKIP, while the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot;—owned by UKIP donor Richard Desmond—gave significantly lower coverage to the gaffes and prejudices of UKIP representatives. Deacon and Wring noted that the majority of those right-wing newspapers that share UKIP&#x27;s views on immigration also share the perspective of more liberal newspapers that many of UKIP&#x27;s interventions are racist. This right-wing press opposition to UKIP may result from the allegiance that these newspapers have to the Conservatives, and resulting perception of UKIP as an electoral threat.

Academic research has been carried out into UKIP. In 2016, it was noted that most of this had focused on examining the party&#x27;s electoral support base, its consequences for other parties, and the possibilities and prospects of a referendum on continued EU membership, with little having focused on an examination of the party&#x27;s policies. Two currents have emerged among those seeking to interpret UKIP: the first, and generally older, current views them as a manifestation of Britain&#x27;s strong Eurosceptic movement, while the second seeks to explain their position in the British parliamentary system while drawing upon the comparative literature on right-wing populist parties elsewhere in Europe.

<text>Sweden and Norway or Sweden–Norway (; ), officially the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway, and known as the United Kingdoms, was a personal union of the separate kingdoms of Sweden and Norway under a common monarch and common foreign policy that lasted from 1814 until its peaceful dissolution in 1905.

The two states kept separate constitutions, laws, legislatures, administrations, state churches, armed forces, and currencies; the kings mostly resided in Stockholm, where foreign diplomatic representations were located. The Norwegian government was presided over by viceroys: Swedes until 1829, Norwegians until 1856. That office was later vacant and then abolished in 1873. Foreign policy was conducted through the Swedish foreign ministry until the dissolution of the union in 1905.

Norway had been in a closer union with Denmark, but Denmark–Norway&#x27;s alliance with Napoleonic France caused the United Kingdom and Russia to consent to Sweden&#x27;s annexation of the realm as compensation for the loss of Finland in 1809 and as a reward for joining the alliance against Napoleon. By the 1814 Treaty of Kiel, the King of Denmark-Norway was forced to cede Norway to the King of Sweden, but Norway refused to submit to the treaty provisions, declared independence, and convoked a constituent assembly at Eidsvoll in early 1814.

After the adoption of the new Constitution of Norway on 17 May 1814, Prince Christian Frederick was elected king. The ensuing Swedish–Norwegian War (1814) and the Convention of Moss compelled Christian Frederick to abdicate after calling an extraordinary session of the Norwegian Parliament, the Storting, to revise the Constitution in order to allow for a personal union with Sweden. On 4 November the Storting elected Sweden&#x27;s king, Charles XIII, as the King of Norway, thereby confirming the union. Continuing differences between the two realms led to a failed attempt to create a separate Norwegian consular service and then, on 7 June 1905, to a unilateral declaration of independence by the Storting. Sweden accepted the union&#x27;s dissolution on 26 October. After a plebiscite confirming the election of Prince Carl of Denmark as the new king of Norway, he accepted the Storting&#x27;s offer of the throne on 18 November and took the regnal name of Haakon VII.

== Background ==
Sweden and Norway had been united under the same crown on two previous occasions: from 1319 to 1343 under Magnus Eriksson and again briefly from 1449 to 1450 under Karl Knutsson in opposition to Christian of Oldenburg who was elected king of the Kalmar Union by the Danes. During the following centuries, Norway remained united with Denmark in close union, nominally as one kingdom, but in reality reduced to the status of a mere province ruled by Danish kings from their capital, Copenhagen. After the establishment of absolutism in 1660, a more centralized form of government was established, but Norway kept some separate institutions, including its own laws, army, and coinage. The united kingdoms are referred to as Denmark-Norway by later historians.

Sweden broke out of the Kalmar Union permanently in 1523 under King Gustav Vasa, and in the middle of the 17th century rose to the status of a major regional power after the intervention of Gustavus II Adolphus in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The ambitious wars waged by King Charles XII, however, led to the loss of that status after the Great Northern War, 1700–1721.

Following the dissolution of the Kalmar Union, Sweden and Denmark-Norway remained rival powers and fought many wars, during which both Denmark and Norway had to cede important provinces to Sweden in 1645 and 1658. Sweden also invaded Norway in 1567, 1644, 1658, and 1716 to wrest the country away from the union with Denmark and either annex it or form a union. The repeated wars and invasions led to popular resentment against Sweden among Norwegians.

During the eighteenth century, Norway enjoyed a period of great prosperity and became an increasingly important part of the union. The industry with the largest growth was that of the export of planks, with Great Britain as the chief market. Saw-mill owners and timber merchants in the Christiania region, backed by great fortunes and economic influence, formed an elite group that began to see the central government in Copenhagen as a hindrance to Norwegian aspirations. Their increasing self-assertiveness led them to question the policies that favored Danish interests over that of Norway&#x27;s while rejecting key Norwegian demands for the creation of important national institutions, such as a bank and a university. Some members of the &quot;timber aristocracy&quot; thus saw Sweden as a more natural partner, and cultivated commercial and political contacts with Sweden. Around 1800, many prominent Norwegians secretly favored a split with Denmark, without actively taking steps to promote independence. Their undeclared leader was Count Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg.

The Swedish policy during the same period was to cultivate contacts in Norway and encourage all signs of separatism. King Gustav III (1746–1792) actively approached any circle in Norway that might favor a union with Sweden instead of with Denmark.

Such endeavors on both sides of the border toward a &quot;rapprochement&quot; were far from realistic before the Napoleonic Wars created conditions that caused great political upheavals in Scandinavia.

== Consequences of the Napoleonic Wars ==
Sweden and Denmark-Norway strenuously attempted to remain neutral during the Napoleonic wars, and succeeded for a long time, in spite of many invitations to join the belligerent alliances. Both countries joined Russia and Prussia in a League of Armed Neutrality in 1800. Denmark-Norway was forced to withdraw from the League after the British victory at the First Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801, but still stuck to a policy of neutrality. However, the league collapsed after the assassination of Tsar Paul I in 1801.

Denmark-Norway was compelled into an alliance with France after the second British attack on the Danish navy at the Second Battle of Copenhagen. The Danish were forced to surrender the navy after heavy bombardment, because the army was at the southern border to defend it against a possible French attack. As Sweden in the meantime had sided with the British, Denmark-Norway was forced by Napoleon to declare war on Sweden on 29 February 1808.

Because the British naval blockade severed communications between Denmark and Norway, a provisional Norwegian government was set up in Christiania, led by army general Prince Christian August of Augustenborg. This first national government after several centuries of Danish rule demonstrated that home rule was possible in Norway, and was later seen as a test of the viability of independence. Christian August&#x27;s greatest challenge was to secure the food supply during the blockade. When Sweden invaded Norway in the spring of 1808, he commanded the army of Southern Norway and compelled the numerically superior Swedish forces to withdraw behind the border after the battles of Toverud and Prestebakke. His success as a military commander and as leader of the provisional government made him very popular in Norway. Moreover, his Swedish adversaries noticed his merits and his popularity, and in 1809 chose him as successor to the Swedish throne after King Gustav IV Adolf was overthrown.

One factor contributing to the poor performance of the Swedish invasion force in Norway was that Russia at the same time invaded Finland on 21 February 1808. The two-front war proved disastrous for Sweden, and all of Finland was ceded to Russia at the Peace of Fredrikshamn on 17 September 1809. In the meantime, discontent with the conduct of the war led to the deposition of King Gustav IV on 13 May 1809. Prince Christian August, the enemy commander who had been promoted to viceroy of Norway in 1809, was chosen because the Swedish insurgents saw that his great popularity among the Norwegians might open the way for a union with Norway, to compensate for the loss of Finland. He was also held in high esteem because he had refrained from pursuing the retreating army of Sweden while that country was hard pressed by Russia in the Finnish War. Christian August was elected Crown Prince of Sweden on 29 December 1809 and left Norway on 7 January 1810. After his sudden death in May 1810, Sweden chose as his successor another enemy general, the French marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, who was also seen as a gallant adversary and had proved his ability as an army commander.

=== Sweden seeks compensation for the loss of Finland ===

The chief objective of Bernadotte&#x27;s foreign policy as Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden was the acquisition of Norway, and he pursued that goal by definitively renouncing Sweden&#x27;s claims in Finland and joining the enemies of Napoleon. In 1812, he signed the secret Treaty of Saint Petersburg with Russia against France and Denmark-Norway. His foreign policy provoked some criticism among Swedish politicians, who found it immoral to indemnify Sweden at the expense of a weaker friendly neighbor. Moreover, the United Kingdom and Russia insisted that Charles John&#x27;s first duty was to the anti-Napoleonic coalition. Britain vigorously objected to the expenditure of her subsidies on the Norwegian adventure before the common enemy had been crushed. Only after Charles gave his word did the United Kingdom also promise to countenance the union of Norway and Sweden by the Treaty of Stockholm of 3 March 1813. Some weeks later, Russia gave her guarantee to the same effect, and in April Prussia also promised Norway as his prize for joining the battle against Napoleon. In the meantime, Sweden obliged its allies by joining the Sixth Coalition and declaring war against France and Denmark-Norway on 24 March 1813.

During his campaigns on the Continent, Charles John successfully led the Allied Army of the North in its defense of Berlin, defeating two separate French attempts to take the city, and at the decisive Battle of Leipzig. He then marched against Denmark to force the Danish King to surrender Norway.

== 1814 ==
=== Treaty of Kiel ===
On 7 January, on the verge of being overrun by Swedish, Russian, and German troops under the command of the elected crown prince of Sweden, King Frederick VI of Denmark (and of Norway) agreed to cede Norway to the King of Sweden in order to stave off an occupation of Jutland.

These terms were formalized and signed on 14 January at the Treaty of Kiel, in which Denmark negotiated to maintain sovereignty over the Norwegian possessions of the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. Article IV of the treaty stated that Norway was ceded to &quot;the King of Sweden&quot;, and not to the Kingdom of Sweden – a provision favorable to his former Norwegian subjects as well as to their future king, whose position as a former revolutionary turned heir to the Swedish throne was far from secure. Secret correspondence from the British government in the preceding days had put pressure on the negotiating parties to reach an agreement in order to avoid a full-scale invasion of Denmark. Bernadotte sent a letter to the governments of Prussia, Austria, and the United Kingdom, thanking them for their support, acknowledging the role of Russia in negotiating the peace, and envisaging greater stability in the Nordic region. On 18 January, the Danish king issued a letter to the Norwegian people, releasing them from their fealty to him.

=== Attempted coup d&#x27;état by Hereditary Prince Christian Frederik ===
Already in Norway, the viceroy of Norway, Hereditary Prince Christian Frederik resolved to preserve the integrity of the country, and if possible the union with Denmark, by taking the lead in a Norwegian insurrection. The king was informed of these plans in a secret letter of December 1813 and probably went along with them. But on the face of it, he adhered to the conditions of the Kiel Treaty by ordering Christian Frederik to surrender the border fortresses and return to Denmark. But Christian Frederik kept the contents of the letter to himself, ordering his troops to hold the fortresses. He decided to claim the throne of Norway as rightful heir, and to set up an independent government with himself at the head. On 30 January, he consulted several prominent Norwegian advisors, arguing that King Frederick had no legal right to relinquish his inheritance, asserting that he was the rightful king of Norway, and that Norway had a right to self-determination. His impromptu council agreed with him, setting the stage for an independence movement.

On 2 February the Norwegian public received the news that their country had been ceded to the King of Sweden. It caused a general indignation among most people, who disliked the idea of being subjected to Swedish rule, and enthusiastically endorsed the idea of national independence. The Swedish Crown Prince Bernadotte responded by threatening to send an army to occupy Norway, and to uphold the grain embargo, unless the country voluntarily complied with the provisions of the Kiel Treaty. In that case, he would call a constitutional convention. But for the time being, he was occupied with the concluding battles on the Continent, giving the Norwegians time to develop their plans.

=== The independence movement grows under threat of war ===

On 10 February, Christian Frederik invited prominent Norwegians to a meeting to be held at his friend Carsten Anker&#x27;s estate at Eidsvoll to discuss the situation. He informed them of his intent to resist Swedish hegemony and claim the Norwegian crown as his inheritance. But at the emotional Eidsvoll session, his advisors convinced him that Norway&#x27;s claim to independence should rather be based on the principle of self-determination, and that he should act as a regent for the time being. Back in Christiania on 19 February, Christian Frederik proclaimed himself regent of Norway. He ordered all congregations to meet on 25 February to swear loyalty to the cause of Norwegian independence and to elect delegates to a constitutional assembly to convene at Eidsvoll on 10 April.

The Swedish government immediately sent a mission to Christian Frederik, warning him that the insurrection was a violation of the Treaty of Kiel and put Norway at war with the allied powers. The consequences would be famine and bankruptcy. Christian Frederik sent letters through his personal network to governments throughout Europe, assuring them that he was not leading a Danish conspiracy to reverse the terms of the treaty of Kiel, and that his efforts reflected the Norwegian will for self-determination. He also sought a secret accommodation with Napoleon.

The Swedish delegation arrived in Christiania on 24 February. Christian Frederik refused to accept a proclamation from the Swedish king but insisted instead on reading his letter to the Norwegian people, proclaiming himself regent. The Swedes characterized his decisions as reckless and illegal, and returned to Sweden. The next day, church bells in Christiania rang for a full hour, and the city&#x27;s citizens convened to swear fealty to Christian Frederik.

Carsten Anker was sent to London to negotiate recognition by the British government, with this instruction from the regent: &quot;Our foremost need is peace with England. If, God forbid, our hope of English support is thwarted, you must make it clear to the minister what will be the consequences of leaving an undeserving people to misery. Our first obligation will then be the most bloody revenge upon Sweden and her friends; but you must never lose the hope that England will realize the unjustice that is being done to us, and voice it until the last moment – as well as our constant wish for peace.&quot; Anker&#x27;s plea for support was firmly rejected by prime minister Lord Liverpool, but he persisted in his mission to convince his contacts among British aristocrats and politicians of Norway&#x27;s cause. He succeeded in introducing that cause in Parliament, where Earl Grey spoke for almost three hours in the House of Lords on 10 May. His arguments were also voiced in the House of Commons – after having fought for freedom in Europe for 22 years, the United Kingdom could not go on to support Sweden in her forced subjugation of a free people then under a foreign yoke. But the Treaty between Britain and Sweden could not be ignored: Sweden had helped the allies during the war, and promises had to be kept. Anker stayed on in London until fall, doggedly maintaining his efforts to awaken sympathy and support for Norwegian interests.

By early March, Christian Frederik had also organized a cabinet and five government departments, though he retained all decision-making authority himself.

=== Christian Frederik meets increasing opposition ===
Count Wedel-Jarlsberg, the most prominent member of the Norwegian nobility, had been in Denmark to organize food supplies for the starving population while Prince Christian Frederik staged his insurrection. On his return trip he took time off to see Count Hans Henrik von Essen, newly appointed Swedish governor-general of Norway. When he arrived in March, he warned the regent that he was playing a dangerous game, but was himself accused of colluding with Sweden. Public opinion was increasingly critical of the policy of the regent, who was suspected of maneuvering to bring Norway back under Danish sovereignty.
On 9 March, the Swedish mission to Copenhagen demanded that Christian Frederik be disinherited from succession to the Danish throne and that European powers should go to war with Denmark unless he disassociated himself from the Norwegian independence movement. Niels Rosenkrantz, the Danish foreign minister, responded to the Swedish demands by asserting that the Danish government in no way supported Norwegian independence, but that they could not vacate border posts they did not hold. The demand to disinherit Christian Frederik was not addressed. Swedish troops massed along the border, and there were daily rumors of an invasion. In several letters to von Essen, commander of the Swedish forces at Norway&#x27;s borders, Bernadotte referred to Christian Frederik as a rebel and ordered that all Danish officials who did not return home were to be treated as outlaws. But the regent countered by confiscating all navy vessels stationed in Norway and arresting officers who were planning to sail them to Denmark.

On 1 April, King Frederick VI of Denmark sent a letter to Christian Frederik, asking him to give up his efforts and return to Denmark. The possibility of disinheriting the Crown Prince was mentioned. Christian Frederik rejected the overture, invoking Norway&#x27;s right to self-determination as well as the possibility of reuniting Norway and Denmark in the future. A few days later, Christian Frederik warned off a meeting with the Danish foreign minister, pointing out that it would fuel speculation that the prince was motivated by Danish designs on Norway.

Although the European powers refused to acknowledge the Norwegian independence movement, there were signs by early April that they were not inclined to side with Sweden in an all-out confrontation. As the constitutional convention drew closer, the independence movement gained in strength.

=== The constitutional convention ===
On 10 April, the delegates convened at Eidsvoll. Seated on uncomfortable benches, the convention elected its officers in the presence of Christian Frederik on 11 April, before the debates began the next day. Two parties were soon formed, the &quot;Independence party&quot;, variously known as the &quot;Danish party&quot; or &quot;the Prince&#x27;s party&quot;, and on the other hand, the &quot;Union party&quot;, also known as the &quot;Swedish party&quot;. All delegates agreed that independence would be the ideal solution, but they disagreed on what was feasible.
* The Independence party had the majority and argued that the mandate was limited to formalizing Norway&#x27;s independence based on the popular oath of fealty earlier that year. With Christian Frederik as regent, the relationship with Denmark would be negotiated within the context of Norwegian independence.
* The Union party, a minority of the delegates, believed that Norway would achieve a more independent status within a loose union with Sweden than as part of the Danish monarchy, and that the assembly should continue its work even after the constitution was complete.

The constitutional committee presented its proposals on 16 April, provoking a lively debate. The Independence party won the day with a majority of 78–33 to establish Norway as an independent monarchy. In the following days, mutual suspicion and distrust came to the surface within the convention. The delegates disagreed on whether to consider the sentiments of the European powers; some facts may have been withheld from them.

By 20 April, the principle of the people&#x27;s right to self-determination articulated by Christian Magnus Falsen and Gunder Adler had been established as the basis of the constitution.
The first draft of the constitution was signed by the drafting committee on 1 May. Key precepts of the constitution included the assurance of individual freedom, the right to property, and equality.

Following a contentious debate on 4 May, the assembly decided that Norway would adhere to the Lutheran faith, that its monarch must always have professed himself to this faith (thereby prevent the Catholic-born Bernadotte from being king) and that Jews and Jesuits would be barred from entering the kingdom. But the Independence party lost another battle when the assembly voted 98 to 11 to allow the monarch to reign over another country with the assent of two-thirds of the legislative assembly.

Although the final edict of the constitution was signed on 18 May, the unanimous election of Christian Frederik on 17 May is considered Constitution Day in Norway. The election was unanimous, but several of the delegates had asked that it be postponed until the political situation had stabilized.

=== Search for domestic and international legitimacy ===

On 22 May, the newly elected king made a triumphant entrance into Christiania. The guns of Akershus Fortress sounded the royal salute, and a celebratory service was held in the Cathedral. There was continuing concern about the international climate, and the government decided to send two of the delegates from the constitutional assembly to join Carsten Anker in England to plead Norway&#x27;s case. The first council of state convened, and established the nation&#x27;s supreme court.

On 5 June, the British emissary John Philip Morier arrived in Christiania on what appeared to be an unofficial visit. He accepted the hospitality of one of Christian Frederik&#x27;s ministers and agreed to meet with the king himself informally, stressing that nothing he did should be construed as a recognition of Norwegian independence. It was rumored that Morier wanted Bernadotte deposed and exiled to the Danish island of Bornholm. The king asked the United Kingdom to mediate between Norway and Sweden, but Morier never deviated from the official British government position of rejecting an independent Norway. He stated that Norway should subject itself to a Swedish union, and also that his government&#x27;s position be printed in all Norwegian newspapers. On 10 June, the Norwegian army was mobilized and arms and ammunitions distributed.

On 16 June, Carsten Anker wrote to Christian Frederik about his recent discussions with a high-ranking Prussian diplomat. He learned that Prussia and Austria were waning in their support of Sweden&#x27;s claims to Norway, that Tsar Alexander I of Russia (a distant cousin of Christian Frederik) favored a Swedish-Norwegian union but without Bernadotte as king, and that the United Kingdom was looking for a solution that would keep Norway out of Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence.

=== Prelude to war ===
On 26 June, emissaries from Russia, Prussia, Austria, and the United Kingdom arrived in Vänersborg in Sweden to persuade Christian Frederik to comply with the provisions of the Treaty of Kiel. There they conferred with von Essen, who told them that 65,000 Swedish troops were ready to invade Norway. On 30 June the emissaries arrived in Christiania, where they turned down Christian Frederik&#x27;s hospitality. Meeting with the Norwegian council of state the following day, the Russian emissary Orlov put the choice to those present: Norway could subject itself to the Swedish crown or face war with the rest of Europe. When Christian Frederik argued that the Norwegian people had a right to determine their own destiny, the Austrian emissary August Ernst Steigentesch made the famous comment: &quot;The people? What do they have to say against the will of their rulers? That would be to put the world on its head.&quot;

In the course of the negotiations Christian Frederik offered to relinquish the throne and return to Denmark, provided the Norwegians had a say in their future through an extraordinary session of the Storting. However he refused to surrender the Norwegian border forts to Swedish troops. The four-power delegation rejected Christian Frederik&#x27;s proposal that Norway&#x27;s constitution form the basis for negotiations about a union with Sweden but promised to put the proposal to the Swedish king for consideration.

On 20 July, Bernadotte sent a letter to his &quot;cousin&quot; Christian Frederik, accusing him of court intrigues and foolhardy adventurism. Two days later he met with the delegation that had been in Norway. They encouraged him to consider Christian Frederik&#x27;s proposed terms for a union with Sweden, but the Crown Prince was outraged. He reiterated his ultimatum that Christian Frederik either relinquish all rights to the throne and abandon the border posts or face war. On 27 July, a Swedish fleet took over the islands of Hvaler, effectively putting Sweden at war with Norway. The following day, Christian Frederik rejected the Swedish ultimatum, saying that surrender would constitute treason against the people. On 29 July, Swedish forces invaded Norway.

=== A short war with two winners ===

Swedish forces met little resistance as they advanced northward into Norway, bypassing the fortress of Fredriksten. The first hostilities were short and ended with decisive victories for Sweden. By 4 August, the fortified city of Fredrikstad surrendered. Christian Frederik ordered a retreat to the Glomma river. The Swedish Army, in trying to intercept the retreat, was stopped at the battle of Langnes, an important tactical victory for the Norwegians. The Swedish assaults from the east were effectively resisted near Kongsvinger.

On 3 August Christian Frederik announced his political will in a cabinet meeting in Moss. On 7 August, a delegation from Bernadotte arrived at the Norwegian military headquarters in Spydeberg with a ceasefire offer based on the promise of a union with respect for the Norwegian constitution. The following day, Christian Frederik expressed himself in favor of the terms, allowing Swedish troops to remain in positions east of Glomma. Hostilities broke out at Glomma, resulting in casualties, but the Norwegian forces were ordered to retreat. Peace negotiations with Swedish envoys began in Moss on 10 August. On 14 August, the Convention of Moss was concluded: a general ceasefire based effectively on terms of peace.

Christian Frederik succeeded in excluding from the text any indication that Norway had recognized the Treaty of Kiel, and Sweden accepted that it was not to be considered a premise of a future union between the two states. Understanding the advantage of avoiding a costly war, and of letting Norway enter into a union voluntarily instead of being annexed as a conquered territory, Bernadotte offered favorable peace terms. He promised to recognize the Norwegian Constitution, with only those amendments that were necessary to enable a union of the two countries. Christian Frederik agreed to call an extraordinary session of the Storting in September or October. He would then have to transfer his powers to the elected representatives of the people, who would negotiate the terms of the union with Sweden, and finally he would relinquish all claims to the Norwegian throne and leave the country.

=== An uneasy cease-fire ===
The news hit the Norwegian public hard, and reactions included anger at the &quot;cowardice&quot; and &quot;treason&quot; of the military commanders, despair over the prospects of Norwegian independence, and confusion about the country&#x27;s options. Christian Frederik confirmed his willingness to abdicate the throne for &quot;reasons of health&quot;, leaving his authority with the state council as agreed in a secret protocol at Moss. In a letter dated 28 August he ordered the council to accept orders from the &quot;highest authority&quot;, implicitly referring to the Swedish king. Two days later, the Swedish king proclaimed himself the ruler of both Sweden and Norway.

On 3 September the British announced that the naval blockade of Norway was lifted. Postal service between Norway and Sweden was resumed. The Swedish general in the occupied border regions of Norway, Magnus Fredrik Ferdinand Björnstjerna, threatened to resume hostilities if the Norwegians would not abide by the armistice agreement and willingly accept the union with Sweden. Christian Frederik was reputed to have fallen into a deep depression and was variously blamed for the battleground defeats.

In late September, a dispute arose between Swedish authorities and the Norwegian council of state over the distribution of grain among the poor in Christiania. The grain was intended as a gift from the &quot;Norwegian&quot; king to his new subjects, but it became a matter of principle for the Norwegian council to avoid the appearance that Norway had a new king until the transition was formalized. Björnstjerna sent several missives threatening to resume hostilities.

=== Fulfilling the conditions of the Convention of Moss ===
In early October, Norwegians again refused to accept a shipment of corn from Bernadotte, and Norwegian merchants instead took up loans to purchase food and other necessities from Denmark. However, by early October, it was generally accepted that the union with Sweden was inevitable. On 7 October, an extraordinary session of the Storting convened. Delegates from areas occupied by Sweden in Østfold were admitted only after submitting assurances that they had no loyalty to the Swedish authorities. On 10 October, Christian Frederik abdicated according to the conditions agreed on at Moss and embarked for Denmark. Executive powers were provisionally assigned to the Storting, until the necessary amendments to the Constitution could be enacted.

One day before the cease-fire would expire, the Storting voted 72 to 5 to join Sweden in a personal union, but a motion to elect Charles XIII king of Norway failed to pass. The issue was set aside pending the necessary constitutional amendments. In the following days, the Storting passed several resolutions to assert as much sovereignty as possible within the union. On 1 November they voted 52 to 25 that Norway would not appoint its own consuls, a decision that later would have serious consequences. The Storting adopted the constitutional amendments that were required to allow for the union on 4 November and unanimously &quot;elected&quot; Charles XIII King of Norway, rather than acknowledging him as such.

== The Union ==

The new king never set foot in his Norwegian kingdom, but his adopted heir Charles John arrived in Christiania on 18 November 1814. In his meeting with the Storting, he accepted the election and swore to uphold the constitution on behalf of the king. In his speech, the crown prince emphasized that the Union was a league that the king had entered into with the people of Norway, and that &quot;he had chosen to take on the obligations that were of greater value to his heart, those that expressed the love of the people, rather than the privileges that were acquired through solemn treaties&quot;. His renouncement of the treaty of Kiel as the legal basis for the Union was endorsed by the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates in the preamble to the Act of Union on 15 August 1815. In order to understand the nature of the Union, it is necessary to know the historical events that led to its establishment. These demonstrate clearly that Sweden, aided by the major powers, forced Norway to enter the Union. On the other hand, Norway, aided by the same powers, essentially dictated the terms of the Union.

Seeds of discord were of course inherent in a constitutional association of two parties based on such conflicting calculations. Sweden saw the Union as the realization of an idea that had been nursed for centuries, one that had been strengthened by the recent loss of Finland. It was hoped that with time, the reluctant Norwegians would accept a closer relationship. The Norwegians, however, as the weaker party, demanded strict adherence to the conditions that had been agreed on, and jealously guarded the consistent observance of all details that confirmed the equality between the two states.

An important feature of the Union was that Norway had a more democratic constitution than Sweden. The Norwegian constitution of 1814 adhered more strictly to the principle of separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Norway had a modified unicameral legislature with more authority than any other legislature in Europe. In contrast, Sweden&#x27;s king was a near-autocrat; the 1809 Instrument of Government stated unequivocally that &quot;the king alone shall govern the realm&quot;. More (male) citizens in Norway (around 40%) had the right to vote than in the socially more stratified Sweden. During the early years of the Union, an influential class of civil servants dominated Norwegian politics; however, they were few in number, and could easily lose their grip if the new electors chose to take advantage of their numerical superiority by electing members from the lower social strata. To preserve their hegemony, civil servants formed an alliance with prosperous farmers in the regions. A policy conducive to agriculture and rural interests secured the loyalty of farmers. But with the constitutional provision that of the members of parliament were to be elected from rural districts, more farmers would eventually be elected, thus portending a potential fracture in the alliance. Legislation that encouraged popular participation in local government culminated with the introduction of local self-government in 1837, creating the 373 rural &quot;Formannskapsdistrikt&quot;, corresponding to the parishes of the State Church of Norway. Popular participation in government gave more citizens administrative and political experience, and they would eventually promote their own causes, often in opposition to the class of civil servants.

The increasing democratization of Norway would in time tend to drive the political systems of Norway and Sweden farther apart, complicate the cooperation between the two countries, and ultimately lead to the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. For instance, while the king had the power of absolute veto in Sweden, he only had a suspending veto in Norway. Charles John demanded that the Storting grant him an absolute veto, but was forced to back down. While the constitution vested executive power in the King, in practice it came increasingly to rest in his Council of State (statsråd). A watershed in this process came in 1884, when Norway became the first Scandinavian monarchy to adopt parliamentary rule. After 1884, the king was no longer able to appoint a government entirely of his own choosing or keep it in office against the will of the Storting. Instead, he could only appoint members of the party or coalition having a majority in the Storting. The council also became answerable to the Storting, so that a failed vote of confidence would cause the government to resign. By comparison, parliamentary rule was not established in Sweden until 1905—just before the end of the union. 

=== The Act of Union ===

The lack of a common constitutional foundation for the Union was felt strongly by crown prince Charles John during its first year. The fundamental documents were only the Convention of Moss and the revised Norwegian constitution of 4 November 1814. But the conservative Swedish Riksdag had not allowed the Swedish constitution to be revised. Therefore, a bilateral treaty had to be negotiated in order to clarify procedures for treating constitutional questions that had to be decided jointly by both governments. The Act of Union (&quot;Riksakten&quot;) was negotiated during the spring of 1815, with prime minister Peder Anker leading the Norwegian delegation. The treaty contained twelve articles dealing with the king&#x27;s authority, the relationship between the two legislatures, how the executive power was to be exercised if the king should die before the crown prince had attained majority, and the relationship between the cabinets. It also confirmed the practice of treating questions of foreign policy in the Swedish cabinet, with the Norwegian prime minister present. Vital questions pertaining to the Union were to be treated in a joint cabinet meeting, where all the Norwegian ministers in Stockholm would be present. The Act was passed by the Storting 31 July 1815 and by the Riksdag 6 August, and sanctioned by the king on 15 August. In Sweden the Act of Union was a set of provisions under regular law, but the Norwegian Storting gave it constitutional status, so that its provisions could only be revised according to the procedures laid down in the constitution.

=== The Union in practice ===
The conditions of the Union as laid down in the Convention of Moss, the revised Norwegian constitution, and the Act of Union, secured for Norway more independence than was intended in the Treaty of Kiel. To all appearances, Norway had entered the Union voluntarily and steadfastly denied Swedish superiority, while many Swedes saw Norway as an inferior partner and a prize of war.

Legally, Norway had the status of an independent constitutional monarchy, with more internal independence than it had enjoyed in over 400 years. While it shared a common monarch and a common foreign policy with Sweden, all other ministries and government institutions were separate from each state. Norway had its own army, navy and treasury. The foreign service was directly subordinate to the king, an arrangement that was embodied already in the Norwegian constitution of 17 May 1814, before the revision of 4 November. An unforeseen effect was that foreign policy was decided in the Swedish cabinet and conducted by the Swedish ministry of foreign affairs. When matters of foreign policy were discussed in cabinet meetings, the only Norwegian present who could plead Norway&#x27;s case was the prime minister. The Swedish Riksdag could indirectly influence foreign policy, but not the Norwegian Storting. Because the representations abroad were appointed by the Swedish government and mostly staffed with Swedes, the Union was often seen by foreigners as functioning like a single state rather than two sovereign states. Over time, however, it became less common to refer to the union as &quot;Sweden&quot; and instead to jointly reference it as &quot;Sweden and Norway&quot;.

According to the Norwegian constitution, the king was to appoint his own cabinet. Because the king mostly resided in Stockholm, a section of the cabinet led by the prime minister had to be present there, accompanied by two ministers. The first prime minister was Peder Anker, who had been prominent among the Norwegians who framed the constitution, and had openly declared himself to be in favor of the Union. The Norwegian government acquired a town house, &quot;Pechlinska huset&quot;, as the residence of the cabinet section in Stockholm, which also served as an informal &quot;embassy&quot; of Norway. The other six Christiania-based ministers were in charge of their respective government departments. In the king&#x27;s absence, meetings of the Christiania cabinet were chaired by the viceroy (&quot;stattholder&quot;), appointed by the king as his representative. The first to hold that office was count Hans Henrik von Essen, who had already at the conclusion of the Kiel treaty been appointed governor-general of Norway when the expected Swedish occupation would be effective.

The next viceroys were also Swedes, and this consistent policy during the first 15 years of the Union was resented in Norway. From 1829 onwards, the viceroys were Norwegians, until the office was left vacant after 1856, and finally abolished in 1873.

=== Amalgamation or separation ===

After the accession of Charles John in 1818, he tried to bring the two countries closer together and to strengthen the executive power. These efforts were mostly resisted by the Norwegian Storting. In 1821, the king proposed constitutional amendments that would give him absolute veto, widened authority over his ministers, the right to rule by decree, and extended control over the Storting. A further provocation was his efforts to establish a new hereditary nobility in Norway. He put pressure on the Storting by arranging military maneuvers close to Christiania while it was in session. Nonetheless, all of his propositions were given thorough consideration, and then rejected. They were received just as negatively by the next Storting in 1824, and then shelved, save for the question of an extended veto. That demand was repeatedly put before every Storting during the king&#x27;s lifetime to no avail.

The most controversial political issue during the early reign of Charles John was the question of how to settle the national debt of Denmark-Norway. The impoverished Norwegian state tried to defer or reduce the payment of 3 million speciedaler to Denmark, the amount that had been agreed upon. This led to a bitter conflict between the king and the Norwegian government. Though the debt was finally paid by means of a foreign loan, the disagreement that it had provoked led to the resignation of count Wedel-Jarlsberg as minister of finance in 1821. His father-in-law, prime minister Peder Anker, resigned soon after because he felt that he was distrusted by the king.

The answer from Norwegian politicians to all royal advances was a strict adherence to a policy of &quot;constitutional conservatism&quot;, consistently opposing amendments that would extend royal power or lead to closer ties and eventual &quot;amalgamation&quot; with Sweden, instead favoring regional autonomy.

The differences and distrust of these early years gradually became less pronounced, and Charles John&#x27;s increasingly accommodating attitude made him more popular. After riots in Stockholm in the fall of 1838, the king found Christiania more convivial, and while there, he agreed to several demands. In a joint meeting of the Swedish and Norwegian cabinets on 30 January 1839, a Union committee with four members from each country was appointed to solve contested questions between them. When the Storting of 1839 convened in his presence, he was received with great affection by the politicians and the public.

=== National symbols ===

Another bone of contention was the question of national symbols – flags, coats of arms, royal titles, and the celebration of 17 May as the national day. Charles John strongly opposed the public commemoration of the May constitution, which he suspected of being a celebration of the election of Christian Frederik. Instead, but unsuccessfully, he encouraged the celebration of the revised constitution of 4 November, which was also the day when the Union was established. This conflict culminated with the Battle of the Square (torvslaget) in Christiania on 17 May 1829, when peaceful celebrations escalated into demonstrations, and the chief of police read the Riot Act and ordered the crowd to disperse. Finally, army and cavalry units were called in to restore order with some violence. The public outcry over this provocation was so great that the king had to acquiesce to the celebration of the national day from then on.

Soon after the Treaty of Kiel, Sweden had included the Coat of arms of Norway in the greater Coat of arms of Sweden. Norwegians considered it offensive that it was also displayed on Swedish coins and government documents, as if Norway was an integral part of Sweden. They also resented the fact that the king&#x27;s title on Norwegian coins until 1819 was &quot;king of Sweden and Norway&quot;. All of these questions were resolved after the accession of King Oscar I in 1844. He immediately began to use the title &quot;king of Norway and Sweden&quot; in all documents relating to Norwegian matters. The proposals of a joint committee with regard to flags and arm were enacted for both countries. A union mark was placed in the canton of all flags in both nations, combining the flag colours of both countries, equally distributed. The two countries obtained separate, but parallel flag systems, clearly manifesting their equality. Norwegians were pleased to find the former common war flag and naval ensign replaced by separate flags. The Norwegian arms were removed from the greater arms of Sweden, and common Union and royal arms were created to be used exclusively by the royal family, by the foreign service, and on documents pertaining to both countries. A significant detail of the Union arms is that &quot;two&quot; royal crowns were placed above the escutcheon to show that it was a union between two sovereign kingdoms.

== Zenith of the Union, 1844–1860 ==
The middle years of the 19th century were peaceful ones for the Union. All the symbolic questions had been settled, Norway had obtained more influence on foreign policy, the office of viceroy or governor was kept vacant or filled by Norwegian Severin Løvenskiold, and trade between the countries prospered from treaties (&quot;mellomriksloven&quot;) that promoted free trade and effectively abolished protective tariff walls. The completion of the Kongsvinger Line, the first railway connection across the border, greatly sped up communications. A political climate of conciliation was advanced by Swedish concessions on the issue of equality between the countries.
Scandinavism was at its height during this period and contributed to increasing rapprochement between the Union partners. It supported the idea of Scandinavia as a unified region or a single nation, based on the common linguistic, political, and cultural heritage of the Scandinavian countries. (These three countries are referred to as &quot;three brothers&quot; in the sixth stanza of the national anthem of Norway.) This elite movement was initiated by Danish and Swedish university students in the 1840s. In the beginning, the political establishments in the two countries were suspicious of the movement. However, when Oscar I became king of Sweden and Norway in 1844, the relationship with Denmark improved and the movement started to gain support. Norwegian students joined in 1845 and participated in annual meetings alternating between the countries. During the war between Denmark and Prussia in 1848, King Oscar offered support in the form of a Norwegian-Swedish expeditionary force, though the force never saw combat. The movement received a blow from which it never fully recovered after the second Danish-German war over Schleswig in 1864, when the Swedish and Norwegian governments jointly forced King Charles XV to retract the promise of military support that he had given to the king of Denmark without consulting his cabinets.

By then, the Union had lost its support among Norwegians because of the setback caused by the issue of abolishing the office of viceroy. King Charles XV was in favor of this Norwegian demand, and after his accession in 1859 promised his Norwegian cabinet that he would sanction a decision of the Storting to this effect. The proposition to do away with this detested symbol of dependency and instead replace it with the office of a prime minister in Christiania was nearly unanimously carried. When the king returned to Stockholm, he was met by an unsuspectedly strong reaction from the Swedish nationalist press. &quot;Nya Dagligt Allehanda&quot; cried out that Norway had strayed from the path of lawfulness and turned toward revolution. The Riksdag demanded to have its say on the question. The crux of the matter was whether it was purely Norwegian or of concern to both countries. The conservative Swedish majority proclaimed Sweden&#x27;s &quot;rightful superior position in the Union&quot;. King Charles was forced to retreat when the Swedish cabinet threatened to resign. He chose not to sanction the law, but as a concession to wounded Norwegian sentiments, he did it anyway in a Norwegian cabinet meeting. But his actions had inadvertently confirmed that he was more Swedish than Norwegian, despite his good intentions.

On 24 April 1860, the Norwegian Storting reacted to the Swedish claim to supremacy by unanimously resolving that the Norwegian state had the sole right to amend its own constitution, and that any revision of the conditions of the Union had to be based on the principle of complete equality. This resolution would for many years block any attempts to revise the Act of Union. A new joint committee was appointed in 1866, but its proposals were rejected in 1871 because it did not provide for equal influence on foreign policy, and would pave the way for a federal state.

== Prelude to dissolution ==

The relations with Norway during the reign of King Oscar II (1872–1907) had great influence on political life in Sweden, and more than once it seemed as if the union between the two countries was on the point of ending. The dissensions chiefly had their origin in the demand by Norway for separate consuls and eventually a separate foreign service. Norway had, according to the revised constitution of 1814, the right to separate consular offices, but had not exercised that right partly for financial reasons, partly because the consuls appointed by the Swedish foreign office generally did a satisfactory job of representing Norway. During the late 19th century, however, Norway&#x27;s merchant marine grew rapidly to become one of the world&#x27;s largest, and one of the most important factors of the national economy. It was increasingly felt that Norway needed separate consuls who could assist shipping and national interests abroad. Partly, the demand for separate consuls also became a symbolic one, a way to assert the growing disillusionment with the Union.

In Norway, dissension on constitutional questions led to the &quot;de facto&quot; adoption of parliamentarism in 1884, after an impeachment process against the conservative cabinet of Christian August Selmer. The cabinet was accused of assisting the king in obstructing reform by veto. The new liberal government of Johan Sverdrup was reluctantly installed by King Oscar. It immediately implemented important reforms, among them extended suffrage and compulsory military service. The two opposite groups established formal political parties in 1884, &quot;Venstre&quot; (Left) for the liberals, who wanted to dissolve the Union, and &quot;Højre&quot; (Right) for conservatives, who wanted to retain a union of two equal states.

The liberals won a great majority in the elections of 1891 on a program of universal suffrage for all men and a separate Norwegian foreign service. As a first step, the new Steen government proposed separate consular services, and negotiations with Sweden were initiated. But royal opposition caused a series of cabinet crises until a coalition government was formed in 1895 with Francis Hagerup as prime minister. That year, the third joint Union committee was appointed, with seven members from each country, but it never agreed on crucial issues and was promptly disbanded in 1898. Faced with saber-rattling from militarily superior Sweden, Norway had to withdraw the demands for separate consuls in 1895. That miserable retreat convinced the government that the armed forces had been neglected too long, and rapid rearmament was initiated. Four battleships were ordered from the United Kingdom, and border fortifications were constructed.

In the midst of negotiations and discussions that were in vain, in 1895 the Swedish government gave notice to Norway that the current commercial treaty of 1874, which had provided for a promising common market, would lapse in July 1897. When Sweden reverted to protectionism, Norway also raised customs duties, and the result was a considerable diminution of trade across the border. Count Lewenhaupt, the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, who was considered to be too friendly towards the Norwegians, resigned and was replaced by Count Ludvig Douglas, who represented the opinion of the majority in the First Chamber. However, when the Storting in 1898 for the third time passed a bill for a &quot;pure&quot; flag without the Union badge, it became law without royal sanction.

The new elections to the Riksdag of 1900 showed clearly that the Swedish people were not inclined to follow the ultraconservative &quot;patriotic&quot; party, which resulted in the resignation of the two leaders of that party, Professor Oscar Alin and Court Marshal (Hofmarschall) Patric Reuterswärd as members of the First Chamber. On the other hand, ex-Professor E. Carlson, of the Gothenburg University, succeeded in forming a party of Liberals and Radicals to the number of about 90 members, who asides from being in favor of the extension of the franchise, advocated full equality of Norway with Sweden in the management of foreign affairs. The Norwegian elections of the same year with extended franchise gave the Liberals (Venstre) a great majority for their program of a separate foreign service and separate consuls. Steen stayed on as prime minister, but was succeeded by Otto Blehr in 1902.

=== Final attempts to save the Union ===
The question of separate consuls for Norway soon came up again. In 1902 foreign minister Lagerheim in a joint council of state proposed separate consular services, while keeping the common foreign service. The Norwegian government agreed to the appointment of another joint committee to consider the question. The promising results of these negotiations was published in a &quot;communiqué&quot; of 24 March 1903. It proposed that the relations of the separate consuls to the joint ministry of foreign affairs and the embassies should be arranged by identical laws, which could not be altered or repealed without the consent of the governments of both countries. But it was no formal agreement, only a preliminary sketch, not binding on the governments. In the elections of 1903, the Conservatives (Højre) won many votes with their program of reconciliation and negotiations. A new coalition government under Hagerup was formed in October 1903, backed by a national consensus on the need conclude the negotiations by joint action. The proposals of the &quot;communiqué&quot; were presented to the joint council of state on 11 December, raising hopes that a solution was imminent. King Oscar asked the governments to work out proposals for identical laws.

The Norwegian draft for identical laws was submitted in May 1904. It was met with total silence from Stockholm. While Norway had never had a Storting and a cabinet more friendly to the Union, it turned out that political opinion in Sweden had moved in the other direction. The spokesman for the communiqué, foreign minister Lagerheim, resigned on 7 November because of disagreement with prime minister Erik Gustaf Boström and his other colleagues. Boström now appeared on his own in Christiania and presented his unexpected &quot;principles&quot; or conditions for a settlement. His government had reverted to the stand that the Swedish foreign minister should retain control over the Norwegian consuls and, if necessary, remove them, and that Sweden should always be mentioned before Norway in official documents (a break with the practice introduced in 1844). The Norwegian government found these demands unacceptable and incompatible with the sovereignty of Norway. As the foreign minister was to be Swedish, he could not exercise authority over a Norwegian institution. Further negotiations on such terms would be purposeless.

A counter-proposal by the Swedish government was likewise rejected, and on 7 February 1905 the King in joint council decided to break off the negotiations that he had initiated in 1903. Notwithstanding this, the exhausted king still hoped for an agreement. On the next day Crown Prince Gustaf was appointed regent, and on 13 February appeared in Christiania to try to save the Union. During his month in Christiania, he had several meetings with the government and the parliamentary &quot;Special Committee&quot; that had been formed on 18 February to work out the details on national legislation to establish Norwegian consuls. He begged them not to take steps that would lead to a break between the countries. But to no avail, as the Special Committee recommended on 6 March to go ahead with the work in progress, and the conciliatory Hagerup cabinet was replaced with the more unyielding cabinet of Christian Michelsen.

Back in Stockholm on 14 March, Crown Prince Gustaf called a joint council on 5 April to appeal to both governments to return to the negotiation table and work out a solution based on full equality between the two kingdoms. He proposed reforms of both the foreign and consular services, with the express reservation that a joint foreign minister — Swedish or Norwegian — was a precondition for the existence of the Union. The Norwegian government rejected his proposal on 17 April, referring to earlier fruitless attempts, and declared that it would go on with preparations for a separate consular service. But both chambers of the Riksdag approved the proposal of the crown prince on 2 May 1905. In a last attempt to placate the recalcitrant Norwegians, Boström, considered to be an obstacle to better relations, was succeeded by Johan Ramstedt. But these overtures did not convince the Norwegians. Norwegians of all political convictions had come to the conclusion that a fair solution to the conflict was impossible, and there was now a general consensus that the Union had to be dissolved. Michelsen&#x27;s new coalition cabinet worked closely with the Storting on a plan to force the issue by means of the consular question.

== Dissolution of the Union ==


On 23 May 1905 the Storting passed the government&#x27;s proposal for the establishment of separate Norwegian consuls. King Oscar, who again had resumed the government, made use of his constitutional right to veto the bill on 27 May, and according to plan, the Norwegian ministry tendered their resignation. The king, however, declared he could not accept their resignation, &quot;as no other cabinet can now be formed&quot;. The ministers refused to obey his demand that they countersign his decision, and immediately left for Christiania.

No further steps were taken by the King to restore normal constitutional conditions. In the meantime, the formal dissolution was set to be staged at a sitting of the Storting on 7 June. The ministers placed their resignations in its hands, and the Storting unanimously adopted a planned resolution declaring the union with Sweden dissolved because Oscar had effectively &quot;ceased to act as King of Norway&quot; by refusing to form a new government. It further stated that, as the king had declared himself unable to form a government, the constitutional royal power &quot;ceased to be operative&quot;. Thus, Michelsen and his ministers were instructed to remain in office as a caretaker government. Pending further instructions, they were vested with the executive power normally vested in the king pending the amendments necessary to reflect the fact that the union had been dissolved.

Swedish reactions to the action of the Storting were strong. The king solemnly protested and called an extraordinary session of the Riksdag for 20 June to consider what measures should be taken after the &quot;revolt&quot; of the Norwegians. The Riksdag declared that it was willing to negotiate the conditions for the dissolution of the Union if the Norwegian people, through a plebiscite, had declared themselves in favor. The Riksdag also voted for 100 million kronor to be available as the Riksdag might decide the matter. It was understood, but not openly stated, that the amount was held in readiness in case of war. The unlikely threat of war was seen as real on both sides, and Norway answered by borrowing 40 million kroner from France, for the same unstated purpose.

The Norwegian government knew in advance of the Swedish demands, and forestalled it by declaring a plebiscite for 13 August—before the formal Swedish demand for a plebiscite was made, thus forestalling any claim that the referendum was made in response to demands from Stockholm. The people were not asked to answer yes or no to the dissolution, but to &quot;confirm the dissolution that had already taken place&quot;. The response was 368,392 votes for the dissolution and only 184 against, an overwhelming majority of over 99.9 percent. After a request from the Storting for Swedish cooperation to repeal the Act of Union, delegates from both countries convened at Karlstad on 31 August. The talks were temporarily interrupted along the way. At the same time, troop concentrations in Sweden made the Norwegian government mobilize its army and navy on 13 September. Agreement was nevertheless reached on 23 September. The main points were that disputes between the countries should in the future be referred to the permanent court of arbitration at The Hague, that a neutral zone should be established on both sides of the border, and that the Norwegian fortifications in the zone were to be demolished.

Both parliaments soon ratified the agreement and revoked the Act of Union on 16 October. Ten days later, King Oscar renounced all claims to the Norwegian crown for himself and his successors. The Storting asked Oscar to allow a Bernadotte prince to accede to the Norwegian throne in hopes of reconciliation, but Oscar turned this offer down. The Storting then offered the vacant throne to Prince Carl of Denmark, who accepted after another plebiscite had confirmed the monarchy. He arrived in Norway on 25 November 1905, taking the name Haakon VII.

<text>Port Royal () is a town located at the end of the Palisadoes, at the mouth of Kingston Harbour, in southeastern Jamaica. Founded in 1494 by the Spanish, it was once the largest and most prosperous city in the Caribbean, functioning as the centre of shipping and commerce in the Caribbean Sea by the latter half of the 17th century. It was destroyed by an earthquake on 7 June 1692 and its accompanying tsunami, leading to the establishment of Kingston, the capital and the most populated and prosperous city in Jamaica. Severe hurricanes have regularly damaged the area. Another severe earthquake occurred in 1907.

Port Royal became home port to English and Dutch government sponsored privateers who were encouraged to attack Spanish vessels, at a time when many European nations were reluctant to attack the powerful Spanish fleet directly. As a port city, it was notorious for its gaudy displays of wealth and loose morals, with the privateer crews spending their treasure in the many taverns, gambling houses and brothels which catered for the sailors. When the British and Dutch governments officially abandoned the practice of issuing letters of marque to privateers against the Spanish treasure fleets and possessions in South America in the later 16th century, many of the crews turned pirate to allow themselves to maintain their plundering illegally. Port Royal effectively became a pirate republic, and they continued to use the city as their main base during the 17th century. Pirates from around the world congregated at Port Royal, coming from waters as far away as Madagascar. The town became notorious in folklore as &#x27;the wickedest city on Earth&#x27;.

After the 1692 disaster, Port Royal&#x27;s commercial role was steadily taken over by the rapidly growing nearby town (and later, city) of Kingston. Plans were developed in 1999 to redevelop the small fishing town as a heritage tourism destination to serve cruise ships. The plan was to capitalize on Port Royal&#x27;s unique and fascinating heritage, with archaeological findings from pre-colonial and privateering years as the basis of possible attractions.

==Climate==
Port Royal has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;) with a short dry season from January to April and a lengthy wet season from May to October. Temperatures remain steady throughout the year with the dry season being slightly cooler and range from in January to in May. The average annual precipitation is .

==History==

The Taino historic indigenous people of the Caribbean occupied this area for centuries before European settlement. They used the area, which they called &quot;Caguay&quot; or &quot;Caguaya&quot;, during their fishing expeditions. Although it is not known whether they ever settled at the spot, they did inhabit other parts of Jamaica.

===Colonisation===
The Spanish first landed in Jamaica in 1494 under the leadership of Christopher Columbus, leading to the destruction of the Taino population. Permanent settlement occurred when Juan de Esquivel brought a group of settlers in 1509. They came in search of new lands and valuable resources, like gold and silver. Instead they began to cultivate and process the sugar cane. Much like the Taino before them, the Spanish did not appear to have much use for the Port Royal area. They did, however, retain its Taino name. Spain kept control of Jamaica mostly so that it could prevent other countries from gaining access to the island, which was strategically situated within the trade routes of the Caribbean. Spain maintained control over the island for 146 years, until the English took control following their invasion of 1655.

The town was captured by England in 1655 during the invasion of Jamaica. By 1659 two hundred houses, shops and warehouses had been built around the fort; by 1692 five forts defended the port. The English initially called the place &quot;Cagway&quot; but soon renamed it Port Royal. For much of the period between the English conquest and the 1692 earthquake, Port Royal served as the unofficial capital of Jamaica, while Spanish Town remained the official capital. In 1872 the government designated Kingston, the largest city, as the capital.

===Privateering===

Port Royal provided a initially for privateers and subsequently for pirates plying the shipping lanes to and from Spain and Panama. Buccaneers found Port Royal appealing for several reasons. Its proximity to trade routes allowed them easy access to prey, but the most important advantage was the port&#x27;s proximity to several of the only safe passages or straits giving access to the Spanish Main from the Atlantic. The harbour was large enough to accommodate their ships and the shallow waters provided a place to careen and repair these vessels with no difficulty. It was also ideally situated for launching raids on Spanish settlements. From Port Royal, Christopher Myngs sacked Campeche and Henry Morgan attacked Panama, Portobello, and Maracaibo. Additionally, buccaneers Roche Brasiliano, John Davis and Edward Mansvelt used Port Royal as a base of operations.

In 1657, as a solution to his defence concerns, Governor Edward D&#x27;Oyley invited the Brethren of the Coast to come to Port Royal and make it their home port. The Brethren was a group of pirates descended from cattle-hunting &quot;&quot; (later anglicized to buccaneers), who had turned to piracy after being robbed by the Spanish (and subsequently thrown out of Hispaniola). These pirates concentrated their attacks on Spanish shipping, whose interests were considered the major threat to the town.

The English privateers were given letters of marque by Jamaica&#x27;s governor. Around the same time that pirates were invited to Port Royal, England launched a series of attacks against Spanish shipping vessels and coastal towns. By sending the newly appointed privateers after Spanish ships and settlements, England had successfully set up a system of defence for Port Royal. Spain was forced to continually defend their possessions from attack, providing them with no opportunity and no means with which to attempt to retake the land.

Spain was unable to retake the island and, due to the privateers, could no longer regularly provide their colonies in the New World with manufactured goods. The progressive irregularity of annual Spanish fleets, combined with an increasing demand by colonies for manufactured goods, stimulated the growth of Port Royal. Merchants and privateers worked together in what is now referred to as &quot;forced trade.&quot; Merchants would sponsor trading endeavors with the Spanish, while also sponsoring privateers to attack Spanish ships and rob Spanish coastal towns. While the merchants most certainly had the upper hand, the privateers were an integral part of the operation.

Nuala Zahedieh, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, wrote the quote: &quot;Both opponents and advocates of so-called &#x27;forced trade&#x27; declared the town&#x27;s fortune had the dubious distinction of being founded entirely on the servicing of the privateers&#x27; needs and highly lucrative trade in prize commodities.&quot;. &quot;A report that the 300 men who accompanied Henry Morgan to Portobello in 1668 returned to the town with a prize to spend of at least £60 each (two or three times the usual annual plantation wage) leaves little doubt that they were right&quot;.

The forced trade became almost a way of life in Port Royal. Michael Pawson and David Busseret wrote &quot;...one way or the other nearly all the propertied inhabitants of Port Royal seem to have an interest in privateering.&quot; Forced trade was rapidly making Port Royal one of the wealthiest communities in the English territories of North America, far surpassing any profit made from the production of sugar cane. Zahedieh wrote, &quot;The Portobello raid [in 1668] alone produced plunder worth £75,000, more than seven times the annual value of the island’s sugar exports, which at Port Royal prices did not exceed £10,000 at this time.&quot;
Since the English lacked sufficient troops to prevent either the Spanish or French from seizing it, the Jamaican governors eventually turned to the pirates to defend the city. By the 1660s the city had, for some, become a pirate utopia and had gained a reputation as the &quot;Sodom of the New World&quot;, where most residents were pirates, cutthroats, or prostitutes. When Charles Leslie wrote his history of Jamaica, he included a description of the pirates of Port Royal:
The taverns of Port Royal were known for their excessive consumption of alcohol such that records even exist of the wild animals of the area partaking in the debauchery. During a passing visit, famous Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck is said to have described the scenes:
There is even speculation in pirate folklore that the infamous Blackbeard (Edward Teach) met a howler monkey, while at leisure in a Port Royal alehouse, whom he named Jefferson and formed a strong bond with during the expedition to the island of New Providence. Recent genealogical research indicates that Blackbeard and his family moved to Jamaica where Edward Thatch Jr. is listed as being a mariner in the Royal Navy aboard HMS &quot;Windsor&quot; in 1706. Port Royal benefited from this lively, glamorous infamy and grew to be one of the two largest towns and the most economically important port in the English colonies. At the height of its popularity, the city had one drinking house for every 10 residents. In July 1661 alone, 40 new licenses were granted to taverns. During a 20-year period that ended in 1692, nearly 10,000 people lived in Port Royal. In addition to prostitutes and buccaneers, there were four goldsmiths, 44 tavern keepers, and a variety of artisans and merchants who lived in 2,000 buildings crammed into of real estate. 213 ships visited the seaport in 1688. The city&#x27;s wealth was so great that coins were preferred for payment over the more common system of bartering goods for services.

Following Henry Morgan&#x27;s appointment as lieutenant governor, Port Royal began to change. Pirates were no longer needed to defend the city. The selling of slaves took on greater importance. Upstanding citizens disliked the reputation the city had acquired. In 1687, Jamaica passed anti-piracy laws. Consequently, instead of being a safe haven for pirates, Port Royal became noted as their place of execution. Gallows Point welcomed many to their death, including Charles Vane and Calico Jack, who were hanged in 1720. About five months later, the famous woman pirate Mary Read died in the Jamaican prison in Port Royal. Two years later, 41 pirates met their death in one month.

===The Royal Navy===
Under British rule the Royal Navy made use of a careening wharf at Port Royal and rented a building on the foreshore to serve as a storehouse. From 1675, a resident Naval Officer was appointed to oversee these facilities; however, development was cut short by the 1692 earthquake. After the earthquake, an attempt was made to establish a naval base at Port Antonio instead, but the climate there proved disagreeable. From 1735, Port Royal once more became the focus of the Admiralty&#x27;s attention. New wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: cooperages, workshops, sawpits, and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there. A Royal Naval Hospital was also established on land a little to the west of the Naval Yard; and by the end of the 18th century a small Victualling Yard had been added to the east (prior to this ships had had to go to Kingston and other settlements to take on supplies).

At the start of the 19th century, a significant amount of rebuilding took place in what was by now a substantial Royal Navy Dockyard serving the fleet in the Caribbean. A sizeable storehouse with a clocktower formed the centrepiece, with a covered way leading from it to the careening wharves. The adjacent Port Admiral&#x27;s (later Commodore&#x27;s) House included a watch tower, to counter the threat of privateers. The Yard continued to expand to meet the new requirements of steam-powered vessels: the victualling wharf became a coaling depot in the 1840s, and twenty years later a small engineering complex was built. The Yard continued to expand through to the beginning of the 20th century, but then (with the Admiralty focusing more and more on the situation in Europe) the Navy withdrew from its station in Jamaica and the Dockyard closed in 1905. (Nevertheless, the Naval Yard and Hospital remained in Admiralty ownership until after the Second World War, with part of the Yard being used by the War Department).

Many of the Dockyard buildings (most of which were of timber construction) were subsequently demolished or destroyed (some in the 1907 Kingston earthquake, others by Hurricane Charlie in 1951). A few remain in place, however, including the Naval Hospital complex, some of the steam engineering buildings and a set of officers&#x27; houses. There is also a slipway, completed as late as 1904, which (with its accompanying sheds) was designed for housing and launching torpedo boats, stationed there for the Yard&#x27;s protection. In 2014, it was announced that some of the Historic Naval Hospital buildings would be restored to house a museum as part of a broader Port Royal Heritage Tourism Project.

===Earthquake of 1692===


The town grew rapidly, reaching a population of around 6,500 people and approximately 2,000 dwellings, by 1692. As land on which to build diminished, it became common practice to either fill in areas of water and build new infrastructure on top of it, or simply build buildings taller. Buildings gradually became heavier as the residents adopted the brick-style homes of their native England. Some urged the population to adopt the low, wooden building style of the previous Spanish inhabitants, but many refused. In the end, all of these separate factors contributed to the impending disaster.

On 7 June 1692, a devastating earthquake hit the city causing most of its northern section to be lost – and with it many of the town&#x27;s houses and other buildings. Many of the forts were destroyed, as well; Fort Charles survived, but Forts James and Carlisle sank into the sea, Fort Rupert became a large region of water, and great damage was done to an area known as Morgan&#x27;s Line.

Although the earthquake hit the entire island of Jamaica, the citizens of Port Royal were at a greater risk of death due to the perilous sand, falling buildings, and the tsunami that followed. Though the local authorities tried to remove or sink all of the corpses from the water, they were unsuccessful; some simply got away from them, while others were trapped in places that were inaccessible. Improper housing, a lack of medicine or clean water, and the fact that most of the survivors were homeless led to many people dying of malignant fevers. The earthquake and tsunami killed between 1,000 and 3,000 people combined, nearly half the city&#x27;s population. Disease ran rampant in the next several months, killing an estimated 2,000 additional people.

The historical Jamaica earthquake of 7 June 1692 can be dated closely not only by date, but by time of day as well. This is documented by recovery from the sea floor in the 1960s of a pocket watch stopped at 11:43 a.m., recording the time of the devastating earthquake.

The earthquake caused the sand under Port Royal to liquefy and flow out into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two feet down before the impact, and the town was built on a layer of some of water-saturated sand. This type of area did not provide a solid foundation on which to build an entire town. Unlike the Spanish before them, the English had decided to settle and develop the small area of land, even while acknowledging that the area was nothing but &quot;hot loose sand&quot;.

According to Mulcahy, &quot;[Modern] scientists and underwater archaeologists now believe that the earthquake was a powerful one and that much of the damage at Port Royal resulted from a process known as liquefaction.&quot; Liquefaction occurs when earthquakes strike ground that is loose, sandy, and water-saturated, increasing the water pressure and causing the particles to separate from one another and form a sludge resembling quicksand. Eyewitness accounts attested to buildings sliding into the water, but it is likely some simply sank straight down into the now unstable layer.

Underwater archaeology, some of which can be seen in the National Geographic Channel show &quot;Wicked Pirate City&quot;, reveals the foundations of building underwater, showing there was subsidence, as do comparisons of post-earthquake maps and pre-earthquake maps.

Some attempts were made to rebuild the city, starting with the one third that was not submerged, but these met with mixed success and numerous disasters. An initial attempt at rebuilding was again destroyed in 1703 by fire. Subsequent rebuilding was hampered by several hurricanes in the first half of the 18th century, including flooding from the sea in 1722, a further fire in 1750, and a major hurricane in 1774, and soon Kingston eclipsed Port Royal in importance. In 1815, what repairs were being undertaken were destroyed in another major fire, while the whole island was severely affected by an epidemic of cholera in 1850.

===1907 earthquake and recent history===
A devastating earthquake on 14 January 1907 liquefied the sand spit, destroying nearly all of the rebuilt city, submerging additional portions, and tilting The Giddy House, an artillery storage room built c. 1880 that is today a minor tourist attraction.

Today, the area is a shadow of its former self with a population of fewer than 2,000 that has little to no commercial or political importance. The area is frequented by tourists, but is in a state of disrepair. The Jamaican government has recently resolved to further develop the area for its historic and tourist value. This is in part a result of abandonment of plans begun in the early 1960s to develop the town as a cruise ship port and destination. The plans stimulated the archaeological explorations on the site which, in turn, led to the suspension of development solely as a port but now included archaeological and other attractions.

In 1981, the Nautical Archaeology Program at Texas A&amp;M University began a 10-year underwater archaeological investigation of the portion of Port Royal that sank underwater during the 17th century. The program focused on an area that had sunk directly into the sea and suffered very little damage. Due to very low oxygen levels, a large amount of organic material could be recovered. The efforts made by the program have allowed everyday life in the English colonial port city to be reconstructed in great detail.

In 1998, the Port Royal Development Company commissioned architectural firm The Jerde Partnership to create a master plan for the redevelopment of Port Royal, which was completed in 2000. The focus of the plan is a 17th-century-themed attraction that reflects the city&#x27;s heritage. It has two anchor areas: Old Port Royal and the King&#x27;s Royal Naval Dockyard. Old Port Royal features a cruise ship pier extending from a reconstructed Chocolata Hole harbour and Fisher&#x27;s Row, a group of cafes and shops on the waterfront. The King&#x27;s Royal Naval Dockyard features a combination shipbuilding-museum and underwater aquarium with dioramas for views of the native tropical sealife. The Royal Naval Dockyard also includes the headquarters for the Admiral of the Royal Navy. The redevelopment plan also includes a five-star hotel.

Today, Port Royal is known to post-medieval archaeologists as the &quot;City That Sank&quot;. Robert Marx considers it the most important underwater archaeological site in the western hemisphere, yielding 16th–and-17th-century artifacts and many important treasures from indigenous peoples predating its 1518 founding, some from as far away as Guatemala. Several 17th and early 18th century pirate ships sank within Kingston Harbour and are being carefully harvested, under controlled conditions, by various teams of archaeologists. Other &quot;digs&quot; are staked out along various quarters and streets by different teams.

By 2019, a floating pier where a cruise ship could dock had been built; the first ship arrived on 20 January 2020. Tourists from a few ships (after the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have ended) might be beneficial to the town, but &quot;there&#x27;s still much work to be done if the town will become the &#x27;world-class heritage, environmental and cultural attraction according to a BBC Travel report published in September 2020. Another report that month discussed the well-funded Living Heritage Programme, which was seeking &quot;to transform the town into a SMART, safe and secure community with a vibrant local economy, preserved cultural heritage and protected natural environment&quot;.

<text>The Straße des 17. Juni, or Strasse des 17. Juni (see ß; ; ), is a street in central Berlin, the capital of Germany. Its name refers to the 17 June 1953 uprising in East Germany. The western continuation of the boulevard Unter den Linden, it runs east–west through the Tiergarten, a large park to the west of the city centre. At the eastern end of the street is the Brandenburg Gate and the Platz des 18. März, it then passes the Soviet War Memorial before passing either side of the Victory Column (&quot;Siegessäule&quot;) in the middle of the park, and out of the park through the Charlottenburg Gate, terminating about half a kilometre later at &quot;Ernst-Reuter-Platz&quot;. The street is a section of the main western thoroughfare radiating out from the centre of Berlin so the road continues to the west of &quot;Ernst-Reuter-Platz&quot;, the first section of which is called &quot;Bismarckstraße&quot;.

==History==
Before 1953, the street was called &quot;Charlottenburger Chaussee&quot;, because it ran from the old city center (Berlin-Mitte) to the borough of Charlottenburg through the Tiergarten (Zoo; literally &quot;animal garden&quot;). The 1953 name change was made in order to honor an East German uprising and its victims. Soon after Stalin&#x27;s death many East Berliners began a strike against working conditions, centered on the building sites around today&#x27;s Karl-Marx-Allee. This gained momentum and descended into rioting when faced with strong opposition from the East German authorities, largely on 17 June 1953. (Another street, in northwest Berlin, got the name Charlottenburger Chaussee instead.)

It was made into a paved road in 1799, and owing to Berlin&#x27;s rapid growth in the 19th century it became a major thoroughfare to the affluent western suburbs. At the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, hundreds of thousands of Berliners cheered the military parade, which took place here. At the outbreak of World War II, no such scenes were ever observed, according to the American journalist and historian William L. Shirer.

Charlottenburger Chausee was a part of the &quot;Ost-West-Achse&quot; (East-West Axis), which during the Nazi period became a triumphal avenue lined with Nazi flags. During the Nazi era, the boulevard was made broader and the Prussian-era Victory Column was moved from in front of the Reichstag to the roundabout in the middle of the Tiergarten, where it has remained since 1938.

The Charlottenburger Chaussee was to have formed one aspect of the remodelling of the city of Berlin into the renamed city called Germania, designed by Hitler, Albert Speer, and Paul Troost to be the capital of the Reich.

In the last weeks of World War II, when Berlin&#x27;s airports were unusable, it was used as a landing strip.

In 1953, West Berlin renamed the street &quot;Straße des 17. Juni,&quot; to commemorate the People&#x27;s uprising in East Berlin on 17 June 1953, when the Red Army and GDR Volkspolizei shot protesting workers.

The street has in recent years been used for mega-events such as the Love parade or live8. In 2006, the street was closed to vehicular traffic for six weeks for use as the &quot;Fanmeile&quot; (fan mile) during the 2006 Football World Cup. It also serves as the starting point for the Berlin Marathon. Every New Year&#x27;s Eve, the street is also one of the gathering points in Berlin where usually over a million people gather to watch a stage show at the Brandenburg Gate, party and see fireworks go off at midnight. It is the largest such party in Europe, if not the world.
