<text>Nuevo León, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Nuevo León, is a state in northeastern Mexico. The state borders the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosi, and has an extremely narrow international border with the U.S. state of Texas. Covering 64,156 square kilometers (24,771 square miles) and with a population of 5.78 million people, Nuevo León is the thirteenth-largest federal entity by area and the seventh-most populous as of 2020.

Monterrey, the state&#x27;s capital, is the most populous city in Nuevo León and the ninth-largest in Mexico. Monterrey is part of the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second-largest metropolitan area in the country with an estimated population of 5.3 million people in 2020. About 92% of the state&#x27;s population lives in the metropolitan area.

Prior to European colonization, Nuevo León was home to various nomadic groups, known as chichimecas to the Spaniards. Stemming from Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva&#x27;s expedition in 1580, the New Kingdom of León was established, encompassing present-day Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Texas, but permanent settlement did not occur until 1592. In 1824, Nuevo León became a state of Mexico following the country&#x27;s successful war for independence. The state began industrializing in the late 19th century and early 20th century, establishing various large companies, which accelerated after the Mexican Revolution. Today, Nuevo León is a major manufacturing hub with one of Mexico&#x27;s largest economies.

== Etymology ==
The origins of Nuevo León&#x27;s name can be traced back to the late-16th century, when Spanish explorer Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva named the region the New Kingdom of León, in honor of the Kingdom of León, as Carvajal noted various similarities between both territories, particularly their mountainous terrains. Following Mexican independence, the name was shortened to Nuevo León.

==History==
=== Prehispanic history ===
Prior to European colonization, there was no established nation-state. Historians estimate that there were about 250 distinct indigenous nomad groups living in the state&#x27;s territory, collectively known to the Spaniards as chicimecas. Archaeological remains, such as cave paintings and carved stones, enabled historians to identify four main indigenous groups that inhabited the state: the Coahuiltecans to the west, Alazapas to the north, the &quot;Borrados&quot; to the east, and the Guachichiles to the south.

Like numerous groups across Aridoamerica, the indigenous peoples of Nuevo León were constantly on the move in search for food. Predominantly reliant on hunting and gathering, many peoples traveled in small bands, establishing temporary settlements known as rancherías, which typically housed one or two families. These settlements consisted of semispherical huts constructed from interwoven branches and thatched roofs. Those situated near rivers, such as the Salinas river, or in regions with more temperate climates, like areas near or within the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range, had access to fishing and limited agriculture.

Due to their nomadic lifestyle, the communities never laid claim to land permanently, and they did not develop political hierarchies similar to the ones found in Mesoamerican societies. Consequently, governance within these tribes was absent, reflecting a decentralized social structure.

=== Colonial period ===
In 1535, Alvaro Núñez Cabeza de Vaca led one of the first expeditions into Nuevo León territory. Colonization attempts began in 1577 under Alberto del Canto, who founded &quot;Santa Lucía&quot; in present-day Monterrey. However, these efforts failed due to indigenous raids, who were labeled as Indios Bárbaros by the colonizers. In 1579, Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva, a member of del Canto&#x27;s expedition, returned to Spain and negotiated with King Philip II to establish a new territory in northern New Spain. He returned to the territory in 1580 and founded the New Kingdom of León in 1582, with its capital, &quot;San Luis Rey de Francia&quot;, established where &quot;Santa Lucía&quot; once stood, marking Monterrey&#x27;s second founding. However, colonization efforts failed once again in 1588, when Carvajal was reported to the Inquisition, accused of being a descendant of New Christians. Since then, the region remained mostly uninhabited by the Spaniards.

In 1596, Diego de Montemayor, accompanied by twelve families, sought to repopulate the New Kingdom of León. On 20 September, he established the &quot;Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Señora de Monterrey&quot;, marking Monterrey&#x27;s third and definitive founding. During this period, despite the majority of the population being concentrated in Monterrey, the town remained small and isolated from other important towns like Saltillo and Zacatecas. Life for the early inhabitants was marked by poverty, with agriculture and livestock farming being the primary occupations, focused solely on self-consumption. The establishment of Spanish settlements in the northern part of the territory were hindered by Coahuiltecan attacks, mostly in response to Spanish slave raids on the natives.

Evangelization served as a key instrument of Spanish colonization and cultural assimilation, with numerous friars arriving in the New Kingdom of León during the 17th and 18th centuries to convert the natives. In 1602, the first Franciscan convent in Monterrey was established, named the convent of San Andrés. Throughout the colonial period, a total of twenty missions were established, of which ten are present-day municipalities of Nuevo León, including Salinas Victoria (Mission &quot;Guadalupe de las Salinas&quot;), Agualeguas (Mission &quot;Nuestra Señora de Agualeguas&quot;), and Guadalupe (Mission &quot;Valle de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot;), among others. Some missions failed due to the natives&#x27; resistance or deadly diseases spread by the Spaniards, while others thrived with Tlaxcalan reinforcement.

The New Kingdom of León asserted claims over regions in present-day Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Texas. However, throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the province experienced territorial losses. In 1643, a successful lawsuit brought to the Royal Audiencia of Guadalajara by the governor of Nueva Vizcaya removed the New Kingdom of León&#x27;s jurisdiction over Coahuila and Texas, with the case citing Carvajal&#x27;s illegal attempts to invade territories belonging to Nueva Vizcaya in the 1580s. The second loss was caused by pressure from the French incursions in Louisiana and requests from the New Kingdom of León to colonize the northeastern Mexican coast in order to pacify and convert its natives, prompting the Viceroy of New Spain to reorganize the New Kingdom of León, which established Nuevo Santander, resulting in the loss of present-day Tamaulipas.

During the establishment of the Provincias Internas, the New Kingdom of León became part of the Eastern Internal Provinces, alongside the provinces of Coahuila, Nuevo Santander, and Texas.

=== Mexican War of Independence ===

On 16 September 1810, the Cry of Dolores occurred, signaling the start of Mexican War of Independence. However, it took until 29 September for news of this event to reach the New Kingdom of León due to its geographical isolation from the rest of New Spain. In January 1811, the governor of the New Kingdom of León, Manuel de Santa María, joined the insurgency after the royalist defeat at the Battle of Aguanueva and José Mariano Jiménez&#x27;s arrival in Monterrey, who arrived to spread the insurgency in the Provincias Internas. Despite these efforts, various counter-insurgency movements emerged in the territories, leading to the capture of key figures at the Wells of Baján in Coahuila.

Afterwards, the movement encountered resistance among the population of the territory, as many were royalists. Some attribute this to the region&#x27;s stronger ties to Spain and its high proportion of people of white or criollo ancestry, constituting 63% of the population according to the Revillagigedo census of 1790. The council of Monterrey, which was the capital and biggest city of the New Kingdom of León, remained loyal to Spain until Joaquín de Arredondo, the commandant of the Eastern Internal Provinces, endorsed the Plan of Iguala on 3 July 1821.After Mexican independence, Fray Servando Teresa de Mier represented the New Kingdom of León in the national constituent congress. In the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, the name of the entity was shortened to Nuevo León, its present-day name, and it was made a state of the First Mexican Republic. Mier organized the establishment of the local legislature, which drafted and enacted the state&#x27;s first constitution on 5 March 1825.

=== Independence to late 19th century ===
Once the federal system was established, internal divisions between federalist and centralist factions emerged, eventually leading to the enactment of &quot;Las Siete Leyes&quot; in 1835, which dissolved the federal structure, replacing the state of Nuevo León with a department. In response to these centralist policies, a secessionist movement arose, resulting in the establishment of the Republic of the Rio Grande in 1840. This unrecognized republic encompassed the territories of Coahuila, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and parts of southern Texas, with its capital in Laredo, Texas. However, after a defeat in the Battle of Saltillo, the insurgency ended. By August 1846, the restoration of the 1824 Mexican Constitution reinstated statehood to Nuevo León.

On 21 September 1846, during the Mexican-American War, the Battle of Monterrey was fought, a three-day assault on Nuevo León&#x27;s capital by U.S. forces. The Mexican forces, commanded by Pedro de Ampudia, faced off against the U.S. troops led by Zachary Taylor, whose objective was to take the city in order to advance toward Mexico City. The battle inflicted heavy casualties on both sides. By 24 September, a truce was brokered between the opposing generals, stipulating a two-month armistice and the withdrawal of Mexican forces from the city in exchange for its surrender. The state remained under U.S. occupation until 18 June 1848.

In 1855, Santiago Vidaurri seized control of the Nuevo León government in order to aid in the execution of the Plan of Ayutla, later supplying military assistance to the Liberals during the Reform War. As a means of consolidating power in northeastern Mexico, in 1856, Vidaurri unilaterally announced the annexation of Coahuila, forming the state of Nuevo León and Coahuila, which was later ratified into the 1857 Mexican Constitution after a referendum approved the annexation.

The annexation provided the state government with control over a significant portion of the customhouses along the US-Mexico border. Leveraging the increased revenues, Vidaurri invested in state development initiatives, including public gardens, &quot;Plaza de la Llave&quot;, and the &quot;Teatro del Progreso&quot;, which was the first theater in the state. Additionally, he used the money to pursue campaigns against the Lipan Apache people. Revenues increased further during the American Civil War, as the Confederacy traded cotton through Nuevo León and Coahuila due to the Union blockade of their ports.

On 14 February 1864, during the French intervention in Mexico, Benito Juárez visited Vidaurri to request revenue from the state&#x27;s customshouses, but Vidaurri refused, suggesting a referendum to join the Second Mexican Empire instead. In retaliation, Juárez labeled Vidaurri a traitor and divided Nuevo León and Coahuila, reinstating them as separate states. Juárez led the republic&#x27;s remnants from Nuevo León until 15 August 1864, when the approaching French forces forced him to relocate. In 1865, the empire dissolved Mexico&#x27;s federal structure, reorganizing Nuevo León as a department, with the territory regaining its statehood upon the republic&#x27;s restoration in 1867.

=== Industrialization and Mexican Revolution ===
During the Porfiriato, Bernardo Reyes was sent to Nuevo León by Porfirio Díaz, where Reyes was governor from 1885 to 1887 and from 1889 to 1909. Reyes suppressed small insurrections and banditry in multiple municipalities while also starting infrastructure projects, such as the State Penitentiary, the construction of the Government Palace, and the renovation of numerous plazas and markets. Additionally, in 1892, Reyes negotiated a land swap with Coahuila so that Nuevo León had access to the international border with Texas.

Reyes&#x27; policies rapidly industrialized the state, overseeing the establishment of significant companies, including Cuauhtémoc brewery, later known as Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery, in 1900; Monterrey Foundry, now Fundidora Park, in 1904; Cementos Hidalgo, later known as Cemex, in 1905; and Vidrios y Cristales de Monterrey, later known as Vitro, in 1909.

In 1909, the deadliest hurricane in the state&#x27;s history struck, resulting in around 3,000 deaths in Monterrey and at least $50 million (1909 USD; $ USD) in damages.

During the Mexican Revolution, Monterrey witnessed multiple attempts to seize control by different factions. In October 1913, Carrancista forces initially succeeded in seizing key locations such as the Obispado and a barracks, but faced strong Federal resistance while advancing towards the city center, retreating the next day. In April 1914, after a prolonged conflict, Carrancistas captured the city center, installing Antonio Villarreal, a radical liberal, as governor, who implemented controversial measures like expelling foreign priests, demolishing temples, and destroying religious images. Villista forces briefly captured Monterrey in early 1915, with Pancho Villa visiting Monterrey for fundraising efforts. By May 1915, Carrancistas regained control and installed Idelfonso Vázquez as interim governor.

=== 1930s–present ===
For the rest of the 20th century, Nuevo León&#x27;s economy underwent continued industrialization. Major families, holding majority shares in the state&#x27;s largest companies, such as the Cuauhtémoc brewery, Monterrey Foundry, and Cementos Hidalgo, strategically reinvested their profits into diverse sectors, aiding in the expansion of both the industrial and banking sectors. By the 1980s, 91% of the employed population was in the secondary and tertiary sectors.

The industrial surge led to remarkable population growth, soaring from 417,491 in 1930 to 3,098,736 in 1990. Monterrey&#x27;s urban sprawl surpassed city limits by the 1970s, extending into adjacent municipalities like Guadalupe, San Pedro Garza García, Santa Catarina, San Nicolás, General Escobedo, and Apodaca. The 1960s witnessed the construction of the state&#x27;s first high-rise, &quot;Condominios Acero&quot;. The state&#x27;s first shopping mall, Galerías Monterrey, was founded in 1983, resulting in the development of numerous shopping complexes throughout the region, such as Plaza Fiesta San Agustín in 1988. To meet the population&#x27;s urban transport needs, the government inaugurated Metrorrey, Monterrey&#x27;s light rapid transit system, in 1991.

In 1994, the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement cemented Nuevo León&#x27;s position as a manufacturing hub with an export-oriented economy, capitalizing on its close proximity to the United States to export goods. Taking advantage of its small border with Texas, Colombia, Nuevo León was founded as a port of entry. By the end of the 20th century, the absolute political dominance of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had started in 1929, began to wane, resulting in the election of Fernando Canales Clariond of the National Action Party as governor in 1997. 
The early 21st century saw continued growth, with a population of 5,784,442 by 2020. The process of verticalization in Greater Monterrey intensified, marked by the construction of increasingly numerous and taller skyscrapers, notably Torre Avalanz, Torre KOI, and Torres Obispado, among others. By the late 2010s and 2020s, the state was experiencing a nearshoring boom, characterized by significant foreign investment from automotive companies like Kia and Tesla. However, due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization, the state faced environmental concerns, such as poor air quality and water shortages, the latter caused by droughts.

The Mexican drug war led to a significant decline in security within the state, marked by several massacres during the war&#x27;s initial phases, notable examples being the 2011 Monterrey casino attack and the Cadereyta Jiménez massacre.

==Geography==

Covering an area of 64,156 square kilometers (24,771 square miles), Nuevo León ranks as the 13th largest federal entity by size in Mexico. The state is located in the northeastern part of Mexico and is bordered by Tamaulipas to the east, Coahuila to the west, both Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi to the south, and the U.S. state of Texas to the north. The state boasts a diverse geography, encompassing three key physiographic provinces in the northeast region.

The state&#x27;s southern and western scenery is dominated by the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range, covering 50.9% of the state&#x27;s territory. Notable features formed by the mountain range include the Galeana and Doctor Arroyo plateaus, the Iguana, Picachos, Papagayos, and Santa Clara mountain ranges, and the Pilón, Ascensión, and Río Blanco valleys. Cerro Potosí, which is the state&#x27;s highest elevation at 3,710 meters above sea level, is part of the mountain range.

The Great Plains is considered to start in the northernmost regions of Nuevo León, constituting 34.6% of the state&#x27;s land. This area is characterized by gentle hills along the Rio Grande. In the east, the Northern Gulf Coastal Plains cover 14.5% of the state, featuring low-altitude lands classified as an &quot;inclined plain&quot; due to the alluvial terrain.

The San Juan River, one of the Rio Grande&#x27;s major tributaries, is one of the most important rivers in the state, as it supplies the El Cuchillo reservoir, which in turn provides water for the Monterrey metropolitan area. It is fed by many of its own tributaries, such as the Pesquería River and the , with the latter flowing through the metropolitan area.

The state also houses additional reservoirs to provide water to its residents. Among the significant ones are the Cerro Prieto, La Boca, Agualeguas, Sombreretillo, El Porvenir, and Loma Larga reservoirs.

===Climate===
Nuevo León is located at the intersection of various climate zones, these being hot desert, hot semi-arid, cold semi-arid, and humid subtropical climates. The majority of the state, including most of the Monterrey metropolitan area, has a hot semi-arid climate, while the northern part of the state has a hot desert climate due to its proximity to the Chihuahuan desert. Some southern portions of the state have a humid subtropical climate due to the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range.

The state typically encounters arid, hot summers, with peak temperatures in the hottest regions soaring to 47 °C. As summer progresses, the climate transitions into a wet season, primarily observed in August and September, marked by increased rainfall. During these periods of rainfall, the temperature drops significantly, leading to lower than average temperatures. The state experiences mild winters with average high temperatures around 21 °C and lows around 8 °C. Notably, regions next to or situated on the mountain ranges have lower mean temperatures compared to the rest of the state during the winter months, which may cause occasional light snowfall in the winter.

While snowfall is a rare occurrence in the entire state, it has been documented during winter storms and cold fronts. One notable event happened on January 9, 1967, when 50 cm of snow fell within an 8-hour period. Additional instances of snowfall in the state include a February 1895 winter storm during the Great Freeze, the 2004 Christmas Eve winter storm, and the February 2021 North American winter storm.

==== Tropical cyclones ====
While rare, hurricanes and tropical storms can impact Nuevo León, bringing high levels of rainfall to the state. The increased precipitation often results in the overflow of the state&#x27;s rivers, most notably the Santa Catarina River, leading to fatalities and significant damage to urban infrastructure. Notable examples of this include the 1909 Monterrey hurricane, causing about 3,000 fatalities in Monterrey; Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 with approximately 150 fatalities; and Hurricane Alex in 2010, which caused 15 deaths. Additional storms that have impacted the state have been Tropical Storm Fernand in 2019 and Hurricane Hanna in 2020.


=== Flora and fauna ===
&quot;Pinus pseudostrobus&quot; is the tree with largest volume per hectare in southern Nuevo León.


=== Administrative divisions ===
Nuevo&#x27;s León is divided into 51 municipalities &quot;(municipios)&quot;. These municipalities are categorized into five regions, these being the Monterrey metropolitan area, Peripheral region, Citrícola region, Northern region, and the Southern region.

The Monterrey metropolitan area, which is the most populous and dense region in the state, is made up of twelve municipalities: Monterrey, Apodaca, Guadalupe, General Escobedo, Juárez, San Nicolás de los Garza, García, Santa Catarina, San Pedro Garza García, Cadereyta Jiménez, Salinas Victoria, and Santiago. The ten largest cities in the state are located in the metropolitan area.

==Demography==

=== Population ===
The 2020 census determined that the population of Nuevo León was at 5,784,442, making it the seventh most populous state in the country. The state has experienced steady growth since the 1930s, with an average annual addition of 78,000 people from 1960 onwards. The most significant growth occurred between 2010 and 2020, during which approximately 1,100,000 people were added. 96% percent of the total population occupies urban areas, significantly surpassing the national average of 79%, while only 4% live in rural areas.

As of 2024, Nuevo León ranks first in the country by life expectancy, with a life expectancy of 77.7, surpassing the national average of 75.5. In 2019, the primary causes of death were heart disease, malignant tumors, and diabetes.

Nuevo León&#x27;s population density as of 2020 is 90 people per square kilometer, making it the fourteenth most dense state in Mexico. It is one of the sixteen states that surpass the country&#x27;s average population density, which is 64 people per square kilometer. Much of the state&#x27;s density is found in the Monterrey metropolitan area, where about 92% of the population resides, and where there is a population density of about 700 people per square kilometer.

There are 1,655,256 housing units in the state, placing it sixth nationwide. About 48% of these units have two bedrooms, and more than 95% of the units have running water, sewage systems, and electric power.

In 2020, Nuevo León had 49,500 foreign-born residents, with 46.8% from the United States, 12% from Venezuela, and 8.9% from Honduras. Between 2015 and 2020, 277,369 people immigrated to Nuevo León from other Mexican states, with 24% originating from Veracruz, 15% from Tamaulipas, 11% from San Luis Potosí, 6% from Coahuila, and 5% from the State of Mexico. In this same period, 91,433 emigrated from Nuevo León to other states, where 14% went to San Luis Potosí, 12% to Coahuila, 11% to Tamaulipas, 8% to Veracruz, and 6% to the State of Mexico. Additionally, 22,271 emigrated to another country, with 75% opting for the United States. The three most common motivations for migration in the state were family reunification, employment opportunities, and marriage.

=== Languages ===

During pre-Hispanic times, the nomadic indigenous peoples of Nuevo León spoke a diverse range of languages. Among the notable groups, the Rayados spoke Guachichil, the Pintos and Alazapas spoke Coahuilteco, and the Borrados spoke Quinigua. Other indigenous languages include Mamulique, Xanambre, Tamaulipeco, and Pame. Spanish was first introduced to the population during the Spanish colonization and Nahuatl was introduced by Tlaxcaltecan colonizers.

Currently, Spanish is the primarily spoken language in the state. Additionally, Nuevo León ranks among the top 5 entities in the country with significant English proficiency. Moreover, with the influx of South Korean migration, Korean is gaining importance as a business language.

According to the 2020 census, 1.4% of the state&#x27;s population speaks an indigenous language, a figure that increases every year. The most spoken indigenous languages include Nahuatl, Huasteco, Zapotec, and Otomi. Out of the population that speaks an indigenous language, 12% do not know Spanish.

For the promotion of indigenous languages, Nuevo León has an Indigenous Education department to cater to the student population who speak the five most spoken native languages. The aim is for students to preserve their pre-Hispanic heritage while learning Spanish and English, leading to the implementation of bilingual-indigenous education programs for members of native communities.

=== Religion===
An overwhelming majority of the population believes in a higher power and considers themselves religious or spiritual. Christianity is the most widely professed religion, with 77.7% of the population being Catholic and 11.9% being Protestant or Evangelical. 0.1% of the population follow other religions, including Jewish, Islamic, Ethnic roots, Afro roots, and Spiritualist beliefs. 

The Catholic Church was established in the state after the Spanish conquest of Mexico and has consistently been the predominant religion, with the state ranking seventeenth among the most Catholic states in the country as of 2020. Nuevo León is home to one archdiocese, the Archdiocese of Monterrey, which encompasses the states of Nuevo León, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas. The archdiocese is divided into eight dioceses, three of which are in Nuevo León and the other five pertaining to the neighboring states. As of 2024, in Nuevo León, there are 268 parishes.

Following the nationwide trend, the percentage of Catholics has been diminishing in the state. In 1910, about 96% of the state was Catholic. However, by the 1970s, the emergence of other religions, such as Protestantism and Evangelicalism, became noticeable. In 2000, the Catholic population stood at 87.9%, decreasing further to 77.7% in 2020. Additionally, religious affiliation in the state has also experienced a decline, with 2.8% identifying as non-religious in 2000, rising to 9% in 2020.

==Education==
Nuevo León demonstrates a high standard of living through educational metrics. Only 2% of its population lacks formal education, and 26% have earned professional degrees. Additionally, the state maintains the second-lowest illiteracy rate in the country, at 1.5%, behind only Mexico City.

The state is home to the Autonomous University of Nuevo León (UANL), the third largest public university in Mexico. It has seven campuses scattered across the state, offering 91 undergraduate degrees and 160 postgraduate degrees. According to QS World University Rankings, in 2023, it was ranked as one of the top fifty universities in Latin America and ranked eighth in Mexico. The university also runs 29 high schools in the state, of which 4 are technical high schools. Several graduates from the university have achieved notable success in various fields. Notably, as of 2024, six alumni have served as governor of Nuevo León, while others have become accomplished athletes, including Olympic medalists like Raúl González and Mariana Avitia.
The state is also home to one of the most important private universities in Latin America, the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM). It offers 57 undergraduate and 44 postgraduate degrees and was ranked as the top university in Mexico by QS World University Rankings in 2023. The institute also sponsors a group of five high schools in the state, known as Prepa Tec, with each campus accredited as an IB World School.

Additionally, the state hosts other educational institutions such as the University of Monterrey (UDEM), Universidad Regiomontana (U-ERRE), Universitario Insuco (INSUCO), Universidad del Norte (UN), Universidad Interamericana del Norte (UIN), Universidad del Valle de México (UVM), Universidad Humanista de las Américas (UHA), Centro de Estudios Universitarios (CEU), Universidad Metropolitana de Monterrey (UMM), University of Montemorelos (UM), and the Instituto Tecnológico de Nuevo León (ITNL).

==Economy==
As of 2022, Nuevo León had a gross domestic product (GDP) of MXN 2.349 trillion, or US$116.9 billion, the third highest in Mexico, behind Mexico City and the State of Mexico while also contributing to 8.25% of the country&#x27;s GDP. If the state was its own country, it would have ranked as the 62nd largest economy globally, ahead of Slovakia and behind of Ethiopia. With a GDP per capita of approximately US$19,452, it stands as the third-highest among Mexican states, surpassing the national average of US$10,950. Its GDP per capita is comparable to those of some European Union members like Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland.
There are many important companies headquartered in the Monterrey metropolitan area, some of which include Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery, brewers of &quot;Sol&quot;, &quot;Tecate&quot;, &quot;XX&quot;, &quot;Bohemia&quot;, &quot;Indio&quot; and &quot;Nochebuena&quot;; Cemex, the fifth-largest cement company in the world; FEMSA, the largest bottled beverage company in Latin America; Banorte, one of the strongest national banks in Mexico; and ALFA, producers of petrochemicals, aluminum auto components, and refrigerated foods.

=== Manufacturing ===
Nuevo León&#x27;s economy has a strong focus on export oriented manufacturing (i.e. maquiladora), with manufacturing making up 41.7% of the state&#x27;s GDP in 2021. Additionally, since 2018, Nuevo León has been considered the country&#x27;s leader in manufacturing, contributing 10.6% to the national industrial GDP in 2022. Key manufacturing industries in the state include the automobile, basic metals, food and beverage, and metal fabrication industries.

=== Agriculture ===
In 2022, Nuevo León had 1,035,492 hectares of land available for agricultural use. Most of the state&#x27;s agricultural industry is found outside of the Monterrey metropolitan area, in the Citrícola region, which comprises the municipalities of Allende, General Terán, Hualahuises, Linares, Montemorelos, and Rayones. The region specializes in citrus production, contributing to Mexico&#x27;s citrus production with a notable 7% share in oranges and 1.6% in grapefruits. Additionally, the region also produces corn, beans, wheat, alfalfa, barley, potatoes, sorghum, avocados, apples, and lemons.

There have been efforts of expanding the agricultural industry to the southern part of the state; however, since this region is more dry, it presents a major hurtle for agriculture and livestock.

=== Technology ===
In recent years, the state government has been making efforts in attracting significant investments in aeronautics, biotechnology, mechatronics, information and communication technologies fields with the creation of the Research and Technology Innovation Park PIIT (), a technology park oriented in the development, innovation and research of sciences. The project is one of the key strategies within the Monterrey, City of Knowledge program. The park is located in the municipality of Apodaca, part of Greater Monterrey at the 10 km of the highway to Monterrey&#x27;s International Airport. It consists of a total surface area of 70 Ha (172 acres), half of it already committed to R&amp;D centers. The other 35 Ha (86 acres) are available for research and development centers, and for businesses that meet the Park&#x27;s objectives.

In Nuevo León there is a wide diversity of sports that are practiced with great relevance.

The most practiced sport in the State has been baseball. It is home to the Sultanes de Monterrey, a professional baseball team with the longest history in the Mexican League, who have won ten championships since their founding in 1939. The Estadio Mobil Super is the largest baseball stadium in Mexico. In addition, its children&#x27;s teams have been world champions in 1957, 1958 and 1997 in the Little League World Series.

Since the 1980s, association football has begun to gain popularity in the State after gaining followers among society. The oldest team is the C.F. Monterrey (popularly known as the &quot;Rayados&quot;), who have won the Liga MX on 5 occasions, in addition to 5 Concacaf Champions Leagues -three of them consecutively-, and 3 Cups for a total of 13 championships. For its part, Tigres UANL, the first team from Nuevo León to win a tournament, has 16 titles, including 8 League titles, 3 Cup titles and 1 Concacaf Champions League. The Clásico Regiomontano is considered one of the most anticipated matches of the season, and this is due to the already deep-rooted rivalry between Tigres and Monterrey for the honor of being the best team in the State or the luxurious squads with which they count. Both clubs have had confrontations in decisive matches, such as the two finals they faced, in 2017 and 2019. It is well known that fans each year wait in line for days outside both stadiums to get tickets, which are often priced at two or three times their original value.

Nuevo León also has a professional basketball team, with the Fuerza Regia de Monterrey squad as the greatest exponent that participates in the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP). They play at the Gimnasio Nuevo León. In 2004, it hosted the first WNBA game outside the United States between the Detroit Shock and the San Antonio Silver Stars.

Ice hockey has shown notable growth in the state, although it is less popular than other more popular sports such as soccer or baseball. The state of Nuevo León has a professional team associated with the recent Mexican Hockey Federation, the Toros Monterrey, whose headquarters are the Monterrey Ice Complex ice rink, in Santa Catarina.

Influenced by the proximity to the U.S., American football is another popular sport. The Autonomous University of Nuevo León, with the Auténticos Tigres, and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, with the Borregos Salvajes, are precursors of this sport in the country. The Auténticos play in the Organización Nacional Estudiantil de Fútbol Americano (ONEFA), and are based at the Estadio Gaspar Mass. While the Borregos play in the Comisión Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas (CONADEIP), and are based at the Estadio Borregos.

==Media==
Newspapers and news websites of Nuevo León include: &quot;ABC Noticias&quot;, &quot;El Gráfico de Nuevo León&quot;, &quot;El Norte&quot;, &quot;El Porvenir&quot;, &quot;La Última Palabra&quot;, &quot;Milenio&quot;, &quot;Publimetro edición Monterrey&quot;, &quot;Reporte Índigo&quot;, &quot;Distrito Regio&quot;, &quot;Solo Ofertas&quot;, &quot;El Horizonte&quot;, &quot;Regio.com&quot;, &quot;Red Crucero&quot;, &quot;Noticias Nuevo León&quot;.

<text>Querétaro, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Querétaro, is one of the 32 federal entities of Mexico. It is divided into 18 municipalities. Its capital city is Santiago de Querétaro. It is located in north-central Mexico, in a region known as Bajío. It is bordered by the states of San Luis Potosí to the north, Guanajuato to the west, Hidalgo to the east, México to the southeast and Michoacán to the southwest.

The state is one of the smallest in Mexico, but also one of the most heterogeneous geographically, with ecosystems varying from deserts to tropical rainforest, especially in the Sierra Gorda, which is filled with microecosystems. The area of the state was located on the northern edge of Mesoamerica, with both the Purépecha Empire and Aztec Empire having influence in the extreme south, but neither really dominating it. The area, especially the Sierra Gorda, had a number of small city-states, but by the time the Spanish arrived, the area was independent from imperial powers. Small agricultural villages and seminomadic peoples lived in the area. Spanish conquest was focused on the establishment of Santiago de Querétaro, which still dominates the state culturally, economically and educationally.

For many years, the official name of the state was &quot;Querétaro Arteaga&quot;, but in 2008 the State Legislature approved the adoption of the simpler name &quot;Querétaro&quot;.

== Geography, climate and ecology ==
Querétaro is located in the north-central area of Mexico, or the Sierra Madre Oriental, connecting the wetter climes of the south with the drier deserts of the north. The state is divided into 18 municipalities: Amealco de Bonfil, Arroyo Seco, Cadereyta de Montes, Colón, Corregidora, El Marqués, Ezequiel Montes, Huimilpan, Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros, Pedro Escobedo Municipality, Peñamiller, Pinal de Amoles, Querétaro, San Joaquín, San Juan del Río, Tequisquiapan and Tolimán.

Three of Mexico’s geographic zones cover parts of the state. The Mesa del Centro is in the center-west of the state, and mostly consists of small mesas with an average altitude of above sea level (ASL). A few elevations reach over . The Sierra Madre Oriental occupies the northeast of the state and includes the cities of Huasteca area. The topography of this area is rugged, with long mountain chains and narrow valleys. Elevations here range between and m ASL. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt occupies about half of the state in the center and south. The area is mostly volcanic rock with peaks and mesas between and and valleys between and ASL.

The state is divided into five geographical regions: The Sierra Gorda, El Semidesierto Queretano, Los Valles Centrales, El Bajío Queretano and La Sierra Queretana. The Sierra Gorda is located in the north of the state and is part of the Sierra Madre Oriental, specifically in a subprovince called the Huasteco Karst. It is found in the municipalities of Arroyo Seco, Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros, Pinal de Amoles and San Joaquín and covers an area of 3,789km2 or 32.2% of the state. The topography is rugged, with high elevations and steep valleys. It is a conjunction of mountains and hills formed mostly by limestone, with wide contrasts in climates and vegetation. They range from near desert conditions to forests of pine and holm oak to the tropical rainforests of the Huasteca area in the state of San Luis Potosí. The Sierra Gorda was made a biosphere reserve in 1997, the Reserva de la Biosfera de la Sierra Gorda, to protect its abundance of species and ecosystems. In 2001, the area was registered with the Man and the Biosphere Programme of UNESCO. This area is managed by la Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas of the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources federal agency.

El Semidesierto Queretano (Querétaro Semidesert) is a wide strip that crosses the state from east to west, which is dry due to the blocking of moist air from the Gulf by the Sierra Madre Oriental. The area is found in the municipalities of Cadereyta de Montes, Colón, Peñamiller and Tolimán, with an area of 3,415.6km2 or 29% of the state. As it is near the mountain range, its topography is relatively rugged. Los Valles Centrales (Central Valleys) is in the center of the state, overlapping almost all of the area formed by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, with the exception of the north of the El Marqués municipality, which is in the Mesa del Centro. The continental divide runs through here marked by the Sierra Queretana, the El Macizo and El Zamoarano mountain chains. This area occupies the municipalities of Ezequiel Montes, El Marqués, Pedro Escobedo and San Juan del Río with an extension of 2,480.2kmw or 21.1% of the state. El Bajío Queretano is in the western part of the state, which is a low elevation area that extends into neighboring Guanajuato. This area covers 1,005.7km2 or 8.5% of the state, and contains low hills and small mountain chains that are part of the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt. La Sierra Queretana (Querétaro Sierra Mountains) is in the extreme south of the state, and also part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. It is mostly found in the municipalities of Amealco de Bonfil and Huimilpan, covering an area of 1,078.3 km or 9.2% of the state. The area has high peaks and plains that narrow into valleys and canyons. Some of the flat areas border the Lerma River.

The state contains two river basins: the Lerma/Santiago and the Pánuco. The first is represented by the Lerma and La Laja Rivers and the second is represented by the Tamuín and Moctezuma Rivers. Other important rivers include the Santa María and the San Juan. These rivers contain 16 dams, including the Santa Catarina, El Batán, Constitution de 1917 and the San Ildefonso.

Most of the state is dry, with the exception of the north, which is temperate and rainy. The average temperature is . Three well-defined climate areas are in the state. The south has a temperate and fairly wet climate. Temperatures are relatively stable through the year, ranging from an average of between 12 and , with most rain falling in the summer. This region includes the municipalities of Amealco, Huimilpan, Pedro Escobedo, San Juan del Río and Corregidora. The center and west have drier and hotter climates, especially in areas under 2,000 m ASL. Here, the Sierra Madre Oriental and parts of the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt impede moist air from arriving. This dry area includes the municipalities of Querétaro, Corregidora, El Marqués, Peñamiller, Esequiel Montes, Cadereyta, San Juan del Río, Tolimán and Tequisquiapan. The Sierra Madre Oriental area has climates that range from temperate to cold, varying significantly from north to south and even more due to altitude. The north tends to be warmer than the south, but average temperatures can range from in lower elevations and between in higher elevations.

The state’s ecosystems have 18 different classifications ranging from tropical rainforest to arid scrub brush. Deciduous rainforest is found in parts of the north, center and west of the state such as Jalpan de Serra, Arroyo Seco and Landa de Matamoros. Small deciduous forests are found in Jalpan de Serra and Landa de Matamoros. Oyamel forests are found in the highest elevations of El Zamorano in the municipalities of El Marqués and Colón. Pure pine forests are found in Cadereyta de Montes, Pinal de Amoles, San Joaquín and Landa de Matamoros. Mixed pine and holm oak forests are found in the Sierra de El Zamorano and the El Lobo region, opposite the Sierra Madre Oriental. Deciduous oak forests are found in the municipalities of Amealco de Bonfil, Landa de Matamoros, El Marqués, and a number of others, but only at altitudes between 1,600 and 2,800 m ASL. Juniper and cedar forests are found in Pinal de Amoles, Landa de Matamoros, San Joaquín and Cadereyta de Montes at altitudes of between 1,390 and 2,500 m, generally on low hills. Mesquite forests are scarce given that they tend to grow on land suitable for agriculture, but some can still be found in Pedro Escobedo, San Juan del Río, Cadereyta de Montes and other municipalities. The two types of grasslands are those with some trees and those with none. The latter is much more common and found in various parts of the south of the state. Grasslands dotted with trees are found only in the municipality of Querétaro. The other five ecosystems are dominated by various types of arid scrub brush, ranging from those dominated by thorns, without thorns and intermixed with various types of cactus.

The Cerro del Cimatario, on the borders of the municipalities of Corregidora, Querétaro and El Marqués, has been declared a national park and biosphere reserve due to its forests.

Quakes are not uncommon in the state, so there are monitoring stations in Peñamiller, Extoraz, Peña Blanca and 10 in the Sierra Gorda, including Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros, Arroyo Seco, Pinal de Amoles and San Joaquín. More are planned for Tolimán and Cadereyta. In January 2011, about 70 small quakes caused some damage in the Peñamiller area, in the north, causing a certain amount of panic in the area with an average strength of 3.5 on the Richter magnitude scale; this is not normal for this area. The quakes are believed to be related to mining in the area, but the government denies this.

== Demographics ==

As of 2020, the state had a population of 2,368,467 and a population density of 137 inhabitants per square kilometer. Over the 20th century, from 1900 to 2005, the state’s population has grown from 232,389 to the current figure. Growth rates were highest in the 1970s at over 4%, but since have come down to 1.9%. The fastest rates of population growth in the state now are in Querétaro and San Juan del Río at about 4%. Two, Arroyo Seco and Peñamiller, have lost population in the previous decades. The capital city of Santiago de Querétaro has nearly half of the state’s population. Other major cities include San Juan del Río (208,462) Corregidora (104,218) El Marqués (79,743) and Cadereyta de Montes (57,204). About 37% lives in the 1420 communities with between 1 and 1,999 inhabitants, and 16% in communities of between 2,000 and 14,999. The population of the state is sparse in most areas, concentrated in only one true urban center and some smaller communities. Living standards are higher than average for Mexico in and around the city of Querétaro, but diminish significantly in the rural areas.

One important factor in the population growth has been migration into the state from other parts of Mexico due to the state’s industry, low crime rate and other factors. One recent phenomenon has been the influx of families from northern border states migrating south to escape drug-related violence. An estimated 49 new families move into the state every 24 hours, on average. This has made attendance at private universities climb 11% especially at ITESM-Querétaro, Universidad Anáhuac and the Universidad del Valle de México. Most of the families are moving to the area in and around the capital.

Over 96% of the population is Catholic, with very small percentages reporting as Protestant or Evangelical. The state is not culturally or socially homogenous. The first large distinction is between those who live in the mountains and those who live in the valleys. Those in the mountains are closer culturally to those living on the Gulf Coast, with the latter having more in common with cultures found in the west of Mexico and the central highlands .

There are indigenous communities in seven of the 18 municipalities of the state, mostly Otomi and Pame. These communities are divided into three regions: South, Arid Center and Sierra Madre Oriental, with the Otomis dominating in the first two and the Pames in the last. The most important indigenous group in the state is the Otomi. These people have inhabited central Mexico for over 5,000 years and were part of cities and empires such as Cuicuilco, Teotihuacan and Tula. Their language is part of the Oto-Manguean family, which includes Pame, Mazahua, Matlatzinca and the Chichimeca-Jonaz languages. They have maintained their language, which is called &quot;hñahñu&quot;, which literally means to speak with nasal sounds. However, most Otomi speakers are bilingual. Their name for themselves varies in the different areas of central Mexico where they live, but in southern part of Querétaro, they call themselves the Ñano. Otomi communities in the state have their own authorities, in addition to Mexican ones, in both the civil and religious arenas, who are elected annually. Most profess the Catholic faith, but it is influenced by indigenous beliefs. The trading of goods is still an important part of the economy of many Otomi communities, and they are known for their abilities with herbal medicines. A number who live in rural areas can still be seen in traditional dress. For women, this includes a hand-embroidered blouse and skirt, a garment called a &quot;quexquemetl&quot; and &quot;huaraches&quot;. For men, this includes shirts and pants of undyed or white cotton, tied with an embroidered belt, &quot;huaraches&quot; and a hat made with palm fronds. These communities are located in south in Amealco de Bonfil. Here, over 25,000 people live in 31 communities, such as San Ildefonso, Tultepec, Santiago Mexquititlán, Chitejé de la Cruz and San Miguel Tlaxcatltepec. In the arid parts of the center of the state, indigenous communities are found in the municipalities of Tolimán, Cadereyta, Colón and Ezequiel Montes, with about 21,500 Otomis in 56 different communities. In the Sierra Madre Oriental, about 3,775 people, mostly Pame with an important group of Huastecas are found in three communities in the municipalities of Jalpan de Serra and Arroyo Seco. However, of all the people in these indigenous communities, only a total of 23,363 spoke an indigenous language, primarily Otomi, as of 2005. Most (94.8%) of these were also speakers of Spanish.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.83% of Querétaro&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

== Culture ==
Western painting developed in the state during the colonial period, when artists such as Pedro de Rojas López, Tomás Noriega and Diego Sanabria produced primarily religious art. More diverse production came into being in the 19th century forward; José Mariano Perrusquia y Rubio, Mariano Montenegro and Germán Patiño Díaz produced paintings and even photography. Patiño Díaz was the director of the old Academia de Dibujo y Pintura de San Fernando, which trained more artists in the state such as Agustín Rivera Ugalde. The 20th century produced artists such as Braulio Rodríguez Granda, Jesús Rodríguez de la Vega, Jesús Águila Herrera and Restituto Rodríguez Camacho. The current generation of Querétaro artists includes Rafael Rodríguez, Virginia Ledesma, Ramsés de la Cruz and Juan Eduardo Muñoz . In the field of photography, 
Natalia Baquedano was one of the first women to open a photographic studio in Mexico. She began her training in Querétaro, before moving to Mexico city.

The state has produced a large number of writers. Major writers from the 19th century include poet and journalist Juan María Wenceslao Sánchez de la Barquera y Morales, poet and short story writer Néstora Téllez Rendón, poet and orator Celestino Díaz Domínguez, journalist and playwright Luis Frías Hernández, writer and doctor Hilarión Frías y Soto and poet and academic Juan B. Delgado. The early 20th century produced poet and translator Francisco Cervantes, arguably the most important literary figure from Querétaro internationally; poet and journalist José Dolores Frías Rodríguez, songwriter Carlos Cabrera Pedraza, novelist Alfredo Coéllar Gómez and poet Carlos Septién García. The current generation of writers includes poets Román Luján, Luis Alberto Arellano, Benjamín Moreno, César Cano and Tadeus Argüeyo.

Indigenous music can be found in Otomi areas, such as in the municipalities of Amealco and the arid central areas of the state. Often this includes trios consisting of two flutes or two violins with a drum, most often played for community celebrations. The Otomi of Tolimán have a variant of Otomi music called &quot;viñuetes&quot;, which is played with one large drum, one small drum and a violin. Huapango is a dominant musical form in the Sierra Gorda and some of the arid areas of the center of the state. Two types are generally played: Huasteco and Arribeño. Huasteco is played in trios with two guitars called &quot;huapanguera&quot; and the smaller &quot;jarana huasteca&quot; and a violin. The songs consist of stanzas of four to six verses sung in falsetto, often with improvisation. The Arribeño is most common in the mountains areas bordering the states of San Luis Potosí and Guanajuato. It is played in groups of four with a &quot;huapanguera&quot;, a &quot;vihuela&quot; and two violins. Lyrics tend to be poetic and sung from memory or improvised. Some are religious in nature. Another indigenous form of music, called &quot;comesolos&quot;, played with a flute and drum has almost completely died out. In the mountain village of San Joaquín in April is the Concurso Nacional de Huapango Huasteco (National Huasteca Huapango Contest) . This event attracts thousands of visitors and participants each year, as it is the most important Huapango contests in the country.
Most traditional festivals are tied to the Catholic religion, with some of the most important being &quot;La Candelaria&quot; (Candlemas), Holy Week and Day of the Dead. Locally important are the myriad of festivals to patron saints of towns, villages and municipalities. In addition, ta number of civic and economic festivals and fairs include celebrations of the founding of the various cities, regional fairs in Cadereyta, El Marqués, Jalpan de Serra and others to showcase local products and culture.

México Folklórico is a dance group created in 1990 within the Academia de la Cultura of the state teachers’ union. It consists of teachers’ children, who are studying high school or above, as an extracurricular activity. Its repertoire includes dances and other traditions from various parts of Mexico. It has performed in many parts of Mexico, as well as in the rest of the Americas and Europe.

The cooking of the Sierra Gorda region is strongly influenced by the Huasteca cuisine of neighboring Hidalgo and San Luis Potosí states. One notable dish is &quot;sacahuil&quot;, which is a large tamal wrapped in the leaves of a plant called a &quot;papatla&quot;. This dish is most prevalent in Landa de Matamoros and Jalpan de Serra. During festivals in San Miguel Tolimán, the main dish is chickpeas with saffron accompanied by tortillas in a number of colors. In Peñamiller, they celebrate with goat meat, accompanied by &quot;pulque&quot;. Another common dish in this areas is a variety of tostadas called &quot;arriero&quot; (donkey handler) . &quot;Simichol&quot; is a fermented corn drink prepared in Santiago Mexquititlán. In San Joaquín, the drink is called &quot;charape&quot;, made with &quot;piloncillo&quot;. In this and other central municipalities, &quot;gorditas de migajas&quot; (literally crumb gorditas) is a common dish.

Traditional food products include a candy made of guava fruit and sugar, jams, and sweets made from &quot;pulque&quot;, milk candies from Bernal, a hard bread called &quot;mezquitamal&quot;, which is made by the Otomis, and various types of mole sauces made in Amealco. In the Sierra Gorda area, gorditas can be prepared with sugar, cheese, and &quot;piloncillo&quot;. The &quot;zacahuil&quot;, a large type of tamale, is filled with chicken, turkey or pork with dried chili pepper. A number of insects are used, especially in indigenous dishes such as &quot;tantárreas&quot; (ants from a type of mesquite tree) and &quot;escamoles&quot;, often cooked with cactus flowers. One native beverage, called &quot;mejengue&quot;, is made with &quot;piloncillo&quot; (a type of sugar derived from the cane plant), banana, &quot;pulque&quot; and corn.

== History ==
The official name of the state is &quot;Estado Libre y Soberano de Querétaro&quot; (Free and Sovereign State of Querétaro). The formal name of the capital is Santiago de Querétaro. However, both are commonly referred to simply as Querétaro. The most likely origin of the name is from the Purépecha word &quot;Créttaro&quot; which means &quot;place with crags&quot;. However, there have been other explanations of the name including that it comes from Nahuatl and means Mesoamerican ball court, or even &quot;island of the blue salamanders&quot;. Nevertheless, other scholars suggest that it can mean &quot;place of the reptiles&quot; or &quot;place of the giant rocks&quot;. The city received the title of Noble y Leal Ciudad de Santiago de Querétaro in 1656, but after Independence, it was changed to simply Querétaro. It was returned to Santiago de Querétaro in 1996, when it was named a World Heritage Site. The ending of &quot;de Arteaga&quot; was added to the state&#x27;s name in 1867 in honor of General José María Arteaga. Originally from Mexico City, Arteaga became governor of Querétaro and distinguished himself as a soldier in the middle of the 19th century. It was removed in 2008.

Agricultural settlements dated to about 500 BCE have been found in the San Juan del Río and Huimilpan areas, which was during the Teotihuacan era. The ancient city had interest and influence in the area because of its agriculture, but did not dominate it. After the fall of this city, the Querétaro area had its highest rate of development of both agriculture and social structure. The area was inhabited early on by a number of ethnicities, including the Otomi, Toltecs, Chichimecas, Purépechas and Mexicas. In the 10th century, the area experience population shifts which did not stabilize until the 12th century. Much of this migration moved south from the Querétaro area into the Valley of Mexico. Those who remained by the end of the 12th century were mostly in hunter-gatherer communities and small agricultural settlements. The region’s agriculture and minerals continued to attract the interest of more powerful neighbors. In the 15th century, both the Aztec Empire and Purépecha Empire had strong influence parts of the state, especially in the south, but would never incorporate the area completely into either empire. The Aztec’s interest in the area was mostly to use it as a bulwark against marauding northern Chichimeca tribes, and it never became a tributary state. During this time, as well, a number of new peoples entered the state, most likely from the north, primarily the Pames and the Chichimeca Jonaz. The first group practiced agriculture in the valleys and the latter in the mountain areas.

When the Spanish conquered the Aztec Empire in the early 16th century, the largest indigenous group in the state was the Otomi, many of whom were living more or less under Purépecha rule. This population would increase with Otomi refugees from Aztec lands fleeing the Spanish. Another significant group was the Chichimecas. With the fall of Tenochtitlán, then the Purépecha Empire, the Spanish gained some control over the southern portion of the state. However, the area was still very independent, filled with peoples who lived in small isolated villages or nomadically. There were no major cities, nor large societies there or north.

The conquest and colonization of Querétaro began with the Spanish settlements at San Juan del Río, Querétaro and Huimilpan between 1529 and 1531. Conquistador Hernán Pérez de Bocanegra joined forces with a local Otomi lord from Jilotepec named Conín, also known as Fernando de Tapia, to enter Otomi areas in what is now the city of Querétaro. There would be only one major battle as part of the conquest in 1531. The Spanish and their indigenous allies were battling the local Otomi and Chichimecas at a hill now known as Sangremal, which was then called Ynlotepeque, and considered sacred in pre-Hispanic times. Chronicles of this event, such as those written by Friar Isidro Félix de Espinoza, state that the natives were at the point of winning when a total eclipse of the sun occurred. This supposedly scared the natives and the Spanish claimed to have seen an image of Saint James (the patron saint of Spain) riding a white horse carrying a rose-colored cross. This event caused the natives to surrender. This event is why the city is called Santiago (Saint James) de Querétaro, with James as patron saint A stone cross imitating the one the Spanish supposedly saw was erected on the hill, which later was accompanied by a church and monastery.

During the rest of the 16th century, the Spanish city of Querétaro would form the northern extension of known lands to the Spanish conquerors. The Spanish initially shared power in the area with local indigenous leaders until well into the 17th century in many areas. Indigenous power waned over time, eventually disappearing completely. However, the Spanish would not subdue and evangelize the last of the resistant peoples, the Chichimec Jonaz until the end of the 18th century.

Most of the north of the state consists of an area known as the Sierra Gorda, which is an area of very rugged terrain, with widely varying climates. From the 16th to 19th centuries The Spanish would slowly dominate the lands around it, south in Querétaro, west in Guanajuato and east in Hidalgo, with only military and missionary incursions into the area&#x27;s interior. This was due to the fierce resistance of the local native peoples. Unlike the Pames on the south, the Chichimeca Jonaz were mostly hunter gatherers, not city dwellers, and they were not used to a hierarchical governing system. Attempts to militarily pacify and evangelize the area had little success, with a number of missions never completed or destroyed shortly after they were built. In the mid 18th century, the colonial government in Mexico City decided to make a concerted effort to bring this territory into submission, as it contained important routes to mining areas such as Zacatecas and Guanajuato. José de Escandón was sent in 1727 to pacified a revolt of Pames in Celaya, and was promoted to sergeant mayor of the regiment. In 1732, he subdued rebels at the mines in Guanajuato, and the following year he did the same at Irapuato. In 1734 he pacified 10,000 indigenous rebels at San Miguel el Grande. For these accomplishments, he was promoted to colonel and assigned as an aide to the captain general of the Sierra Gorda. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1748 that José de Escandón won the Battle of Media Luna, in which the Chichimecas were decisively defeated. The Sierra Gorda missions, some 90 miles north of Santiago de Querétaro, were nestled in a vast region of jagged mountains, home of the Pame people and a scattering of Spanish colonists. When Junípero Serra and Francisco Palóu arrived at the village of Jalpan, they found the mission in disarray: The parishioners, numbering fewer than a thousand, were attending neither confession nor Mass. Junípero Serra tackled the practical side of mission administration; working with the college of San Fernando, he had cattle, goats, sheep, and farming tools brought to the Sierra Gorda mission. Francisco Palóu supervised the farm labor of men of the mission, while the women learned spinning, sewing and knitting. Their products were collected and rationed to the mission residents, according to personal needs. Christian Pames sold their surplus products in nearby trading centers, under the friars&#x27; supervision to protect them from cheaters. Pames who adapted successfully to mission life received their own parcels of land to raise corn, beans and pumpkins, and sometimes received oxen and seeds as well. Today, those mission buildings are considered World Heritage Site. A district called an &quot;alcaldía mayor&quot; was established in San José de Escandón -today in the municipality of Pinal de Amoles- which governed what is now the northern half of the state. Decline of mining in the area would have this seat of government moved to Cadereyta in 1675, but this territory would be joined with the alcaldía mayor of the city of Querétaro to form the modern state.

The territory of Querétaro was consolidated during the 17th century. Santiago de Querétaro was declared a city in 1655. The coat of arms granted to the capital city that year is now the state coat of arms, with the substitution of an eagle on a cactus to replace the section referring to the Spanish royalty. Over the colonial period, the Querétaro area became important strategically and economically as it connected the newly explored and conquered lands to the north and west to the center of New Spain in Mexico City. Various trade routes converged here and the city became a cultural crossroads. The activities of Franciscan missionaries were a decisive factor in building the economic, social, political and religious institutions of the state. They were also mostly responsible for the building of most of the religious buildings and the acquisition of paintings and sculptures that can still be seen. These works gave the city an image of richness. The buildings from this era of the city’s history include the Plaza de Armas, The Casa de Ecala, the Casa de los Septién, the Cassa de los Samaniego, the Casa de los Fernández de Jáuregui, the Palacio de la Corregiduría de Legres de Querétaro as well as the Congregación and San Antonio churches. However, the most important structure from the time is the Aqueduct of Querétaro. Much of the evangelization efforts in the Sierra Gorda area was done by Junípero Serra. These efforts left behind a number of missions which exist to this day in Jalpan de Serra, Tancoyol, Concá, Tilaco and Landa de Matamoros.

This development made the city wealthy for the rest of the colonial period. Querétaro reached its height of the colonial period during the 18th century due to its strategic position with the northern territories and because of its livestock production. There was also a significant textile industry for local and regional markets. Querétaro was the first major producer of wool cloth in New Spain. At the end of the century, The Real Fabrica de Tabaco (Royal Tobacco Factory) was established, the second most important of its type in New Spain. There was also some mineral production, especially silver in an area called El Doctor.

The city of Querétaro was strategic in the development of events just before the start of the Mexican War of Independence. It was the site of the conspiracy among Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Ignacio Allende, Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez and her husband the Corregidor of Querétaro Miguel Domínguez. The plot was uncovered when another conspirator, Epigmenio González, was caught with a stockpile of weapons to start the war. Ortiz de Dominguez sent word to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in Dolores, Guanajuato (now Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato) that the plot was discovered. At that point, Hidalgo decided to begin the revolt against colonial rule in on 15 September, rather than in December as planned. Gonzalez was imprisoned in the Philippines from 1810 to 1838 for his role. The Corregidor and his wife were caught and imprisoned for their parts as well. Soon after, the city of Querétaro was taken by royalist forces and would stay that way for much of the war. The only fighting in the state were skirmishes fought in the mountain areas. The city of Querétaro would be one of the last royalist bastions to fall.

After the war, Querétaro was made a state with the 1824 Constitution. However, the city and state would lose the economic and cultural prominence that both had enjoyed during the colonial period. The political instability of the 19th century took its toll on commerce, which made the area’s economy suffer. The status of Querétaro would change between state and department, depending on whether Liberals or Conservatives were in power nationally. Within the state, battles for power between the two groups would lead to the state having twenty five governors between 1824 and 1855.

During the century, the capital city was the scene of a number of important events. During the Mexican–American War, the capital was moved from Mexico City to Querétaro. At the end of that war, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed here. The southernmost raids of the Comanche from the plains and prairies of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas far to the north (along with Kiowas and some Apaches) occurred here in the middle of the 1800s. The 1857 Constitution was published in the city as well and a coalition of states including Querétaro, Jalisco, Aguascalientes, Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Michoacán formed a coalition to defend this constitution against the Plan of Tacubaya. During the short reign of Maximilian I, there were battles between Liberals and Conservatives (with the latter supporting the emperor) in Querétaro. However, Maximilian lost the military support provided by Napoleon III, leaving only four states loyal to the emperor. Querétaro was one of them. Maximilian still resisted Liberal forces which eventually surrounded him at Cerro de Campanas, then outside the city of Querétaro. The emperor was caught and executed on 19 June 1867. Afterwards, the state wrote a new constitution based on Liberal principles. Another new state constitution would be written at the beginning of the Porfiriato in 1879. Despite the turmoil, there was still economic progress in the state, with the establishment of textile mills such as Hércules, Casa Rubio and two other factories in San Antonio and La Purísima. There was also some mining, especially in El Doctor, Río Blando, Maconí and Escanelilla with a total of 216 mines producing silver with some producing gold, copper, lead and more.

Before the end of the century, modern infrastructure such as electricity, telegraph and telephones began to appear. Industry grew and modernized, with El Hércules becoming the largest textile factory in the country. Haciendas and agricultural production also grew, especially in the north of the state. The capital was modified and expanded, and it was linked to the rest of the country via rail in 1882. Public education began in the state at the beginning of the 20th century with fifty-four primary schools and the first graduates of the state’s first teachers’ college.

At the same time, strikes and other movements against the Diaz regime had begun in the state and elsewhere in the country. The largest strike in the state was against the El Hércules factory in 1909. At the start of the Mexican Revolution, there were revolts in Jalpan de Serra and Cadereyta along with protests in the capital. Governor González de Cosío resigned in 1911, replaced by Joaquín F. Chicarro, who was allied with Victoriano Huerta and more authoritarian. In 1916 and 1917, the federal government of Venustiano Carranza had to abandon Mexico City, moving the country’s capital to Querétaro. The country’s current constitution was promulgated from Teatro de la República in the city of Querétaro.

After the war, the economy of the state recovered slowly. Between 1940 and 1960, economic progress came more rapidly, with the industrial infrastructure growing and modernizing. During the same period, the population grew substantially as well. Much of industrial growth from then to the present can be seen in the various industrial parks located north of the capital city. In the following thirty years, the city grew to over four times its previous size. However, the state conserved the city’s historic center, which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1996. The city’s official name, which had been changed simply to &quot;Querétaro&quot;, was restored to &quot;Santiago de Querétaro&quot; the same year.

In 1997, the National Action Party (PAN) won the gubernatorial elections and Ignacio Loyola Vera became the first non PRI governor of the state since the Revolution. In 2008, the state’s constitution was amended to make Querétaro the official state name. The aqueduct Acueducto II was inaugurated in 2011 by President Felipe Calderón and state governor José Calzada Rovirosa. It transports water over 122 km from springs in El Infiernillo to the city of Querétaro. This is to supplement local water sources which are no longer able to meet the city’s needs.

== Economy ==

=== General description ===
Economic activity in the state is closely tied to trends at the national level. This includes the declining contribution to GDP of the agricultural sector and an increase in manufacturing and commerce/services. The city of Querétaro is by far the most important economic center in the state, followed by San Juan del Río. Not only is Querétaro the population center of the state, it has high-quality soil for irrigation farming and cattle. It is directly connected by highway to Mexico City, the country’s largest market, as well as the north of the country and the United States. This makes the city an almost obligatory stop for most people and goods traveling north and south. This geographical advantage has spurred industrial development in the state, especially since the 1970s. Another advantage the state has is its stable social and political situation. It has a low crime rate and also noted by NGO Transparencia Mexicana as having the lowest levels of corruption among all of Mexico’s states. Of the three main sectors of the economy: agriculture, mining/industry and commerce/services, the percentage each employs and contributes to the GDP varies significantly from municipality to municipality, with agriculture making up a higher percentage of local employment and GDP in rural municipalities than in the Querétaro metropolitan area. However, overall, the state has one of the country’s strongest economies. Government authorities report an increase of 4,602 jobs in the state for January 2011, accounting for a quarter of the gain for the country. Some related to Bombardier.

The municipalities of the state are grouped into five economic regions centered on Amealco de Bonfil, Cadereyta de Montes, Jalpan de Serra, Querétaro and San Juan del Río. The Amealco region includes this municipality and the municipality of Huimilpan. Most of its economy is based on cereal production with only minor industry such as maquiladoras and textiles. There are also handcrafts produced by indigenous groups.

The Cadereyta región includes this municipality, Colón, Peñamiller and Tolimán. Agriculture is limited to the rainy season, but there is significant production of livestock such as goats. There is also some forestry activity. Industry is not common, but some technically advanced factories exist. There are also maquiladoras, textile and recycling operations which primarily employ women.

The Jalpan de Serra region includes this municipality and Arroyo Seco, Pinal de Amoles, Landa de Matamoros and San Joaquín. Agriculture is limited, mostly producing fruits such as citrus, mangos, coffee, peaches and apples. Fish farming is a growing and promising enterprise for the areas. Industry is also very limited.

The Querétaro región includes the capital and the municipalities of Corregidora and El Marqués. This area has the second most productive farms in the state, much of which is irrigated. Crops include sorghum, wheat, barley, alfalfa, oats with some vegetables, corn and beans. This area is also an important producer of all kinds of livestock. Industry is limited to the industrial parks located just north of the capital, but they employ most of the industrial workers of the state.

The San Juan del Río region includes this municipality and Ezequiel Montes, Pedro Escobedo and Tequisquiapan. This is the most agriculturally production region of the state, with most farmland irrigated. There is intensive farming of sorghum, wheat, barley, alfalfa, and oats, with some vegetables, corn and beans. Large areas of natural pasture supports a large livestock industry. The region is second in industry behind Querétaro, concentrating on paper products and food processing. Most industry is located in San Juan del Río.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===
Agriculture and livestock have been traditionally important for the state, and while it only provides about four percent of the state’s GDP, down from eighteen percent in 1970, it employs a far larger percentage of the population, with it being the basis of the economy in many rural areas. 28.24% of state land is used for agriculture, mostly raising corn, wheat, alfalfa, sorghum and squash. There is also intensive farming in areas of a number of important crops. Much of the large scale farming is irrigated and is supported in part by the state government, with loans and help with infrastructure such as water and roads. However, most farmland is seasonal, meaning it is worked only during the rainy season. Grains such as barley, wheat, oats and alfalfa are almost exclusively planted on irrigated land along with certain vegetables such as broccoli, garlic, carrots, lettuce, onions and cauliflower. Most nonirrigated land is planted with corn, followed by beans mostly for auto or local consumption. Leading cash crops are beans, cabbage, alfalfa, onions, lettuce and sorghum.

Within agriculture, production of crops has decreased while the production of animal products has increased. Crops as a percentage of agricultural production dropped from 34% in 1988 to 25.8% in 1993. One of the leading milk producers in the country, Querétaro farms also breed livestock and dairy cows. Livestock production is important and growing, mostly consisting of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses and domestic fowl. Querétaro is one of the top producers of chicken in Mexico. The largest producers of livestock in the state are Jalpan, Cadereyta, San Juan del Río and Querétaro.

Forest land is one of the state’s two main natural resources. These forests contain commercial species such as pine, oak, cedar, juniper, mesquite and more. Most of these are found in and around the Sierra Gorda area. There is about 70,000 hectares of possible productive land but only 17,000 have been studied for management. Land actively involved in forestry operations equals 9,358m2, most of which is in the municipalities of Landa de Matamoros and Amealco de Bonfil. 20.7% is used for grazing. 24.22% is forest; 3.95% is rainforest and 40.62 is arid scrub brush.

=== Mining and industry ===
Mining, manufacturing and construction accounts for about 39% of the GDP, with manufacturing alone accounting for 32%. This has remained steady for the past few decades. Minerals are one of the state’s two main natural resources. Mining is a traditional economic activity for the state. There are ten mining districts in the Sierra Gorda alone producing lead, silver, zinc, copper, gold, mercury and antimony. Nonmetallic products include marble, kaolin, sandstone, and more. Opals are a distinctive state resource. State and local governments, in partnership with private industry, actively promote foreign investment into the region. The priority of the state government is to encourage industries which use low levels of water for environmental reasons. These have mostly been auto parts, food processing and electronics. Other major industries include chemicals, plastics, textiles, paper products and printing and wood products. Most are micro- and small-sized operations.

Querétaro’s major cities are home to industrial complexes that produce machinery and other metallic products, chemicals and processed foods. However, most of the state’s manufacturing companies are located in or around the city of Querétaro. Carnation and Purina are among the best-known food processing companies with facilities in the state, and numerous textile mills manufacture clothing made of wool, cotton and henequen. One of the biggest employers is Tremec, an auto parts manufacturer. Currently, there are 392 companies with direct foreign investment and 238 exporting companies that have located in the state. Exports in 2002 totaled $3.35 billion USD, and direct investment in 2003 reached $169 million. Many of these companies are headquartered in modern industrial parks, one of the newest and most technologically advanced being El Marques Industrial Park. This facility was inaugurated in 2003, with an initial investment of $13 million USD. The park occupies a space of with international tenants from Italy, Germany, Spain, the US, Taiwan as well as Mexico representing real estate, automotive, carton packing, food processing and some high tech enterprises. One of these tenants is Siemens whose plant is dedicated to manufacturing equipment for high voltage systems.

The city of Querétaro has become the most advanced center of the aeronautics industry in Mexico, anchored by a plant belonging to Canadian conglomerate Bombardier, which opened in 2005. This plant manufactures fuselages and electrical systems, recently adding wing production for the Learjet 85, a nonmetallic plane. This plant is the largest of the 189 aeronautics facilities in Mexico, employing about 2,000 people. There are eight other aeronautics enterprises located in the state.

The state is known for dairy products and wine. Two of Querétaro’s cities, San Juan del Río and Ezequiel Montes, have thriving vinicultures. Some of the best comes from the Rancho Santa Marina just to the south of the capital in the municipality of El Marqués. This ranch specializes in sheep milk cheese such as feta, ricotta, picodon and criollo/crottin. Rancho Hondonada is another reputable producer as well as Quesos Vai, which specializes in Mexican cheeses such as Oaxaca and panela. The best known winery is Freixenet which is on the highway between Tequisquiapan and San Juan del Río. The 45-hectare vineyard grows four varieties of grapes: Saint Emilion, Macabeu, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir. A cave 25 meters (82 ft) below ground maintains a constant and ideal climate for wine cellaring. Other producers include La Redonda and Rancho Los Azteca.

=== Traditional handcrafts ===
Handcrafts produced in the state include baskets, textiles, metal objects, pottery and items made from wood, leather and paper. Basket making is common in many parts of the state, and similar fibers are also used to create hats, decorative items and more made from various materials such as reed, willow branches and palm fronds. In Jalpan de Serra, they make various items from palm fronds such as bags, hats and mats. Fine woven hats can be found in Tequisquiapan as well as baskets made with a variety of willow. Baskets are made in San Juan del Río as well as in Cadereyta with willow and with reeds. Basket making and rope are made in most areas of the state. In Ezequiel Montes, ixtle fiber is used to make sisal and rope. In Peñamiller henequen is used. In San Juan del Río reeds are used to make baskets. In Tolimán, furniture and more is made with willow branches. Tequisquiapan makes crafts with rattan, roots, juniper and pine branches along with ixtle.

Tolimán is known for its traditional clothing, especially quexquemetls made of silk and embroidered with colored thread for men and quexquemetls made of cotton for women. The ones made here are the largest in the country, made on backstrap looms. They also weave and embroider bags and linens such as tablecloths and napkins. Another area for traditional Otomi dress is Amealco de Bonfil, where blouses, skirts and more are embroidered with designs from this ethnicity. They also make cloth dolls dressed in traditional clothing. In Tolimán, Pame influence is noted in the textiles, which are mostly woven to make tablecloths and napkins. Colón, Cadereyta and Bernal are known for items made of wool which has been naturally dyed, such as rebozos, blankets and more.

Sculpting and building with sandstone is a major business and craft due to the material’s abundance in the mountains. Various types of sculptures as well as building blocks are created from it. In the communities of Escolásticas and Ejido de Ajuchitlancito in the Pedro Escobedo municipality, families, associations and cooperatives work with the stone. The work from Pedro Escobedo has been exported for many years. Various communities in the Huimilpan municipality do as well. The items create range from ashtrays to large columns for buildings. Much of the stonework of La Cañada in the El Marqués municipality is exported. Another stone that is worked is marble, especially in Vizarrón in Cadereyta municipality and in Tequisquiapan. Onyx, marble, opal and turquoise are worked in San Juan del Río and in the capital city. Opals are mined in the state and come in a variety of colors and sizes. They are mostly made into jewelry.

There are various communities in the state which specialize in pottery. Products include every day utensils and cookware to architectural elements, figures and sculptures. The clay from Cadereyta is valued for its quality. In the community of San Juan de Guedío in the municipality of Amealco they specialized in storage containers as well as the figures of saints and those for nativity scenes. Other areas noted for their pottery are Colón and Ezequiel de Montes.

Other items are made from materials such as wood, leather and paper. Wood items include furniture, toys and musical instruments, especially guitars and violins and include miniature musical instruments, which are made in San Joaquín. Leather is fashioned into belts, pistol holders, handbags, wallets and cowboy boots. These are mostly available in CadereytaLanda de Matamoros and San Vicente Ferrer in the municipality of El Marqués. Cardboard is used to fashion masks and items related to mojiganga theater mostly for use in parades and traditional festivals. Mojiganga figures are made with a reed frame to which the cardboard is applied. Bernal is noted for its masks made of paper and plaster which are often molded. In the city of Querétaro they make masks and mojiganga items, as well as large paper sculptures such as the Judas figures, which are burned.

=== Commerce, services and tourism ===
Commerce, services and tourism accounts for 57% of the state’s GDP, led by commerce at 19% and services at 18% both related and not to tourism. This is an increase from 45% in 1970. Since the 1990s, the state has promoted its tourism industry, with attendance at international forums, and building of hotels and other infrastructure. The Centro de Congresos (Convention Center) of Querétaro was inaugurated in 2011 to attract more business travel to the state. The facility contains ten halls, with a capacity of 9,000 people.

There are two areas declared as historic monuments by the Mexican federal government, the historic center of Querétaro and the historic center of San Juan del Río. The historic center of Querétaro has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Most historic and cultural attractions are located in the capital. Museums include the Museo de Arte de Querétaro, the Museo Regional de Querétaro, the Museo de la Ciudad, the Museo del Sitio de Querétaro and Museo de la Matemática. Outside of the capital, there are the Museo Histórico de la Sierra Gorda, Museo Arqueológico y Minero de la Sierra and the Museo de la Muerte in San Juan del Río. Another major attraction is its 74-arched aqueduct built in the early 1700s. The aqueduct rises 23 meters (75 ft) above street level and conveyed drinking water to the city from regional springs until 1970. The founding of the city of Querétaro is celebrated in July with various cultural and gastronomic events. Conchero dancers go in procession to the La Cruz Church to commemorate the appearance of Saint James.

Querétaro has a number of areas which lend themselves to ecotourism. One area especially promoted is the Sierra Gorda region. The area is a complex of canyons and mountains extending over 400,000 hectares with a well conserved biological diversity. In the deep canyons there are grottos, valleys, ravines and arroyos. In the higher areas there are forests of pines and holm oak, and tropical forests in the lower elevations. The area was declared a biological reserve and contains about 1,700 species of plants, some endemic only to the area. There are also 360 species of birds, 130 of mammals, and just over 100 of amphibians and reptiles. A number of these are in danger of extinction such as macaws, the black bear, the porcupine and the spider monkey.

The state promotes its wine and cheeses with a Ruta del Vino or Wine Route. This connects three major wineries, Freixenet, La Redonda and Los Aztecas, along with various cheese producing facilities and some small towns chosen for their charm, such as Tequisquiapan and Bernal. There is also a Cheese and Wine Museum. At the wineries, one can observe how the product is made, which includes both sparkling and normal wines. The cheese producers make their products from goats’, cows’ and sheep’s milk, and in the two villages, one can enjoy both wine and cheese at the same time. At the end of July and the beginning of August, there is the first harvest, called the Vendimia. At the end of May and beginning of June, Tequisquiapan hosts the National Cheese and Wine Fair. The Feria del Queso y el Vino (Cheese and Wine Fair) is held at the end of may and beginning of June in Tequisquiapan featuring wine producers from various parts of the world. Grape harvest festivals are held at Freixenet and La Redonda at the end of June.

Querétaro has one Pueblo Mágico, San Sebastián Bernal. It is best known as the home of the Peña de Bernal, the third largest monolith in the world after the Rock of Gibraltar and Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro. It was considered sacred by the Chichimeca and dates back to the Jurassic Period more than 100 million years ago. The community was originally occupied by the Otomi. Many colonial structures in the town of sandstone have survived to the present day. It also was a scene of a battle during the French intervention in Mexico . The El Cerrito pyramid is here climbed by those dressed in White for the spring equinox. Today, tourism is an important part of the area’s economy, attracting both those interested in history and those interested in ecotourism activities.

In addition, there are a number of old haciendas which have been converted into hotels, spas and other recreational facilities. The Juriquilla Hacienda is one of nine haciendas which dominated the municipality of San Rosa. The largest was Juriquilla, founded in 1707. In the 19th century, it belonged to Timoteo Fernando de Jaurgui and later to a number of entrepreneurial families. Since 1993, the main house has been converted into a 196 room hotel, maintaining the buildings colonial architecture. The best conserved structure is the hacienda chapel. The Jurica Hacienda is known for its freshwater springs. The main house is a hotel with 182 rooms. The former chapel is intact, all original except the flooring. The Galindo Hacienda was converted into a hotel and restore in the 1970s after decades of abandonment. The San Gil Hacienda is traditionally said to have been a property of La Malinche. Today it is a hotel and spa surrounding the original gardens of the main house. The La Venta Hacienda has its origins in the late 16th century as a land grant to Baltasar de Salazar to build lodgings for those traveling to the unexplored northern lands. It is the smallest of the hacienda resorts with only 51 rooms in its hotel.

The state has a number of colonial era missions, mostly in the Sierra Gorda region. The early ones were founded by the Augustinians and Franciscans with the aim of evangelizing of the area, but they were shut down soon after their founding by the hostility of the Chichimeca. Most were unfinished and/or destroyed. The first successful missionary in the area was Jesuit Junípero Serra because colonial authorities began to militarily control the area. The best known is Bucareli Mission in Pinal de Amoles founded in 1797. Other missions are found including Santiago de Jalpan, San Miguel Concá, Santa María del Agua de Landa, San Francisco del Valle de Tilacoal and Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Tancoyol, all established in the 1750s and 1760s. After restoration efforts between 1979 and 2002, there have been efforts to register these missions as a World Heritage Site.

== Education ==
Basic Education is defined as the levels from preschool to middle school and includes other types of education such as special education, indigenous schools, bilingual school and adult remedial education. The state contains nearly 2,000 schools at this level including 1,225 preschools, 1,392 primary schools and 364 middle schools. Education Media Superior includes high schools, vocational schools and technical schools for those who graduate middle school. There are 115 campuses of this type located in all the municipalities of the state, but it covers less than 80% of the demand for this kind of education. The average number of years of schooling in the state is 7.5 years, meaning the completion of primary school and a little over a year in middle school. Levels of schooling increase with younger generations, with nearly all under 5 attending preschool before primary school. Nearly all children of age attend and finish primary school, and nearly all of these begin middle school. However, 8.8% of the population fifteen and older have not enrolled in school at all. 19% have completed primary, 27.2% have completed at least middle school/technical school, 17.9% have completed high school and 14.5 have gone onto higher education.

The state’s cultural and educational center is the capital, with a variety of universities, technological schools and institutes of higher technical studies, with include. These institutions supply highly trained graduates for the work force. This is one factor that contributes to the higher socioeconomic level of the state. University level education has been the fastest growing level, with the most recent additions being the Universidad Tecnológica de San Juan del Río and the Instituto Tecnológico de Querétaro, Jalpan Campus. In total, there are twenty two public and private institutions. These include the Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro with 43 bachelors, 36 masters and ten doctorate programs, the Instituto Tecnológico de Querétaro with eight bachelors and two masters programs, ITESM-Querétaro with 23 bachelors and seven masters programs, the Universidad Pedagógica Nacional with 19 bachelors programs and the Universidad del Valle de México with 18 bachelors and two masters programs. Other institutions include the Universidad Internacional de México, Universidad Cuauhtémoc, Universidad Contemporánea (UCO), Universidad Mesoamericana, CUMDES, campus Corregidora, Escuela Normal del Estado, Escuela Normal de Jalpan, Escuela Normal Superior, Escuela Normal Queretana, Instituto 5 de Mayo, Normal Instituto la Paz de Querétaro, Universidad Tecnológica del Estado de Querétaro, Centro Interdisciplinario de Investigación y Docencia en Educación Técnica, Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA), Conservatorio Libre de Música &quot;J. Guadalupe Velázquez&quot; and Centro Nacional de Danza Contemporánea. These together cover about eighty percent of the demand for education at this level.

The state university is the Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro. Its origins are in two colonial era colleges of San Ignacio and San Francisco Javier. These were Jesuit colleges established at the urging of Vasco de Quiroga. The first, San Ignacio, was established in 1625. The two were run by the Jesuits until they were expelled from New Spain in 1767. From then until 1832, the schools were run by regular clergy. The two were converged and reorganized into the State Civil College in 1868 and operated as such until 1950. This college was closed and reorganized again to open as the current institution.

The Universidad Tecnológica de Querétaro (UTEQ) was founded in 1994 with 146 students with majors in Administration, Business, Industrial Maintenance and Production Processes. The first classes were taught in rented as facilities were being built on a 25 hectare campus in Colonia San Pedrito Peñuelas. Today the school has eight majors at the undergraduate level.

The Instituto Tecnológico de Querétaro is part of the National System of Technological Institutes in Mexico. It was founded in 1967, and today it offers six engineering majors and technical training in electrical items, machines and automotive.

There are also thirty one research centers with the most prominent being: el Instituto de Ciencias de la Tierra de la UNAM, Campus Juriquilla, Centro Nacional de Investigación en Fisiología y Mejoramiento Animal (CENIF-MAI), CIATEQ, A.C. (Centro de Investigación y Asistencia Técnica del Estado de Querétaro - CIATEQ), Centro Interdisciplinario de Investigación y Docencia en Educación Técnica (CIIDET), Instituto Mexicano del Transporte (IMT), Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Electroquímica del Estado (CIDETEQ), Laboratorio de Materiales Unidad Querétaro del CINESTAV-I.P.N., Centro de Neurobiología, Instituto Tecnológico de Querétaro, Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Campus Querétaro (ITESM), Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Condumex, Transmisiones y Equipos Mecánicos (TREMEC), Centro Queretano de Recursos Naturales (CQRN), Centro de Ingeniería y Desarrollo Industrial (CIDESI), MABE Tecnología y Desarrollo, Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales y Agropecuarias (INIFAP), Instituto de Física UNAM, Escuela Normal del Estado de Querétaro &quot;Andrés Balvanera&quot; (ENEQ) and the Centro de Investigación en Ciencia Aplicada y Tecnología Avanzada I.P.N. (CICATA).

A number of these facilities support manufacturing and other industrial sectors of the economy. This also permits partnerships and alliances. One of the most important research center in the state is the National Metrology Center (CENAM), which is a dependency of the Secretariat of Economy. The main function of the center is to bring together science and technology to support the country’s economy. It is the second most important of its kind in the Americas.

In December 2013, Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, Arkansas announced the construction of an ASU Campus in Querétaro. The school is said to be the first &quot;american-style&quot; campus in Latin America, meaning students will be able to live on-campus, instead of having to commute from home to class. Construction began in February 2014. While classes were originally expected to start in July 2015, due to infrastructure issues (e.g., water and power), the opening has been rescheduled for 2016. Plans for the school include dorms, a library, student resource centers, and sports complexes. The campus is set to open in 2017 with 1,000 students. Whether or not the school will field intercollegiate athletics teams or if the complexes are for student recreational use is unclear.

== Transportation and communications ==
===Transport===
The state has a total of 3,349.5 km of highways, almost all of which is paved. 571 km of this is federal highway, 880.90 is state highway and 1,885.70 are rural roads. This includes a section of the Pan American Highway. The highway system centers on the capital and connects the state with Mexico City, Guadalajara, Ciudad Valles and north to Ciudad Juárez and the United States. Much of the rural highway infrastructure, especially in the Sierra Gorda area, is for the benefit of mining, agriculture and forestry. The most important of the interstate roads links the state with Mexico City metropolitan area and its market of 20 million people as well as 25 other million customers within . The US border is a nine-hour drive. To support the international transportation of goods, Querétaro has an inner customs office that facilitates the shipment of manufactured products to foreign countries. However, the highway system is most concentrated in the municipalities of Querétaro and San Juan del Río and the corridor in between. Fifty five percent of the traffic along this corridor begins or terminates within the state.

Other infrastructure includes water systems, public buses, rail lines, an international airport and radio and television stations. Most of the irrigation and water-storage areas are also concentrated in the Querétaro and San Juan del Rio municipalities. The capital is home to the state’s largest public bus terminal called the Terminal de Autobuses de Querétaro. This station is a transfer point for many who travel north or south in the country. Other major terminals exist in Colón, Tequisquiapan, Jalpan de Serra, San Juan del Río, Cadereyta and Amealco de Bonfil. The state has 338.9 km of rail line, much the same as it had when they were initially built in the early 20th century. They mostly carry freight and connect the cities of San Juan del Río, Tequisquiapan, Pedro Escobedo, Querétaro, Colón and El Marqués. The Querétaro Intercontinental Airport began operations in 2004, replacing the older Ing. Fernando Espinosa Gutierrez Airport. Located in the capital, the facility handles both cargo and passengers.

===Media===
The state has twenty radio stations, seventeen of which are commercial enterprises. Stations include XHUAQ, XHORT, XHOZ, XHOE, XHQTO, XHMQ, XHJHS, XHZQ, XHRQ, XEUAQ, XEQG, XEKH, XEXE, XWGV, XEQUE, XEJX, XEHY and XENA. Television stations are mostly repeaters of national channels such as Televisa and Azteca. Televisa has a local operation called Televisora Queretana. Only TV Q is a fully local station. Cable television for the state is provided by Cablecom, Megacable.

Major newspapers and magazines include Noticias, Diario de Querétaro, Sol de San Juan, Financiero Regional, Nuevo Amanecer, Futuro de Querétaro, Para Comentar, Nuevo Milenio, Rotativo, Año 2000, Mundo de Querétaro, Agora, Cabañuelas, El Imparcial, El Informador, Mass, Magazine, Reporte (Q), Rincones Queretanos, Radar and El Informador de Santa Rosa Jáuregui.

== Government ==
The state government is divided into the Legislative, Judicial and Executive branches under Article 23 of the state constitution. The executive branch is headed by the governor, under whom are a number of agencies, including the state secretary and the state attorney general. The Legislature is unicameral made up of representatives popularly elected in districts of the state. This legislature has a number of committees tasked with certain types of legislation. The Judiciary consists of a state supreme court and a system of various lower courts.

== Archaeology ==
Humans have been living in the area for between 4,000 and 6,000 years, with the oldest settlements in the southern part. In the pre-Hispanic period the area was important for its commercial routes which linked the Gulf Coast, the Huasteca Region and the central highlands of Mexico principally, but there is evidence of commercial traffic from much further away. This made the area one of cultural exchanges with various ethnicities. When the Spanish arrived, the area was inhabited by the Chichimeca Jonaz, the Huastecas, the Ximpeces and the Pames.(arqueomex) Four archeological sites are open to the public: Las Ranas, Toluquilla, El Quirambal and El Cerrito.

Las Ranas and Toluquilla are two sites located near each other in the southwest of the Sierra Gorda, about ninety km northwest of Tequisquiapan, in San Joaquín. Both controlled the important commercial routes of the area which linked the Gulf Coast and the central highlands of Mexico, principally, but there is evidence of trade through here from even farther away. One economic activity important to both was the mining of cinnabar (mercury sulfate) which was highly prized as a red pigment in the pre Hispanic period. Las Ranas was established first, reaching its height between the years 200 and 600, but remained an inhabited city until 1000. The main political buildings were constructed on two natural elevations that form a corner. These elevations were terraced to accommodate buildings of stone and mud, then covered in stone plates or tiles to form façades. Other significant buildings include various temples and five Mesoamerican ball courts.

Toluquilla is a smaller site, occupied from 300 CE to 1300CE. This site was a ceremonial, political and administrative center, located on the upper part of an elongated hill, surrounded by ravines. The structures consist of a series of pyramid bases of stone and mud covered in stone plates or tiles. It also contains four Mesoamerican ball courts, one of which is much larger than other similar ones in the area from the same time. There is also a building which shows evidence of stucco work. Later in its history, the area was invaded by the Chichimeca Jonaz, but when the Spanish arrived both sites were abandoned.

El Quirambal is located in the Sierra Gorda between Pinal de Amoles and Jalpan de Serra, in the small community of San Juan. The ruins lie top of a hill and their construction is similar to other sites in the Huasteca region from the end of the Classic into the Post Classic periods (800-1200CE). One important structure is a Mesoamerican ball court which measures forty by twenty meters. On one side of this court, there is a temple with a pyramid base fourteen meters long and seven meters high. All along this flat topped hill, there are structures such as pyramid bases and dwellings and semi circular structures whose purpose has not been determined. The area was inhabited as early as 200 CE and stayed there until it was abandoned in 1200CE. During that time, much of the economy was based on primitive mining.

El Cerrito is located in the municipality of Corregidora, only ten minutes from the historic center of the municipal seat. Twenty three million pesos has been budgeted for its restoration. Only part of the site is open to visitors, which focuses on the El Cerrito pyramid, which is illuminated on certain occasions. This pyramid’s dimensions are similar to that of the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuacan. This is one of the main tourist attractions of the area. The name comes from the fact that the site was part of the El Cerrito Hacienda, named after the site, which then was only a &quot;hill&quot; covered in vegetation. The site was an important Toltec influenced ceremonial center, later occupied by the Chichimecas. Later, the area was converted into the sanctuary of the &quot;Virgen de El Pueblito&quot; Virgin Mary image for about a century. Besides the pyramid, another significant structure is called &quot;El Fortín (The Small Fort), which was built over a pre Hispanic pyramid base in 1876, with Neo Gothic doors and windows.

The La Campana archeological site has been sacked and severely damaged. The site is the most important in the northwest of the state, corresponding to the Huasteca culture dating from the year 600 CE. The site was discovered in the mid 20th century, but has not been excavated due to the lack of funds. It contains 160 structures including platforms, plazas, patios, and more.

Other discoveries in the state have included that of a 2,300-year-old mummy of a female child, with accompanying fabric, hair, feathers and plant remains. The discovery was made in a cave at a dry, cold, high-altitude site in the Sierra Gorda region. It is one of the oldest mummies found in Mexico, and was mummified through natural causes rather than by any preservation technique. The girl is estimated to have died around 320 BCE.

<text>Sinaloa (), officially the  (), is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, compose the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 18 municipalities, and its capital city is Culiacán Rosales.

It is located in northwest Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the northwest, Chihuahua to the north and Durango to the east, both across the Sierra Madre Occidental; and Nayarit to the southeast. To the west, Sinaloa faces Baja California Sur, across the Gulf of California. The state covers an area of and includes the islands of Palmito Verde, Palmito de la Virgen, Altamura, Santa María, Saliaca, Macapule, and San Ignacio. In addition to the capital city, the state&#x27;s important cities include Mazatlán and Los Mochis.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sinaloa&quot; combines two words from the Cahita language: (&#x27;pithaya plant&#x27;), and (&#x27;rounded&#x27;); &quot;sinalobola&quot; was shortened to &quot;sinaloa&quot;. This most popular etymology is attributed to Eustaquio Buelna. Another etymology attributed to Pablo Lizárraga is Mexica &quot;cintli&quot; (&#x27;dry corn and cob&#x27;) and &quot;ololoa&quot; (&#x27;to pile up&#x27;), and to locative, &quot;where they pile up or store corn on the cob.&quot; Yet another etymology from Héctor R. Olea combinsa Cahia &quot;sina&quot; with the locative &quot;ro&quot; from the Purépecha language and &quot;a&quot; from Aztec &quot;atl&quot; (&#x27;water&#x27;), thus &quot;place of pithayas in the water.

==History==

Sinaloa belongs to the northern limit of Mesoamerica. From the Fuerte River to the north is the region known as Aridoamerica, which includes the deserts and arid places of northern Mexico and southwestern United States. Before European contact, the territory of Sinaloa was inhabited by groups such as the Cahitas, the Tahues, the Acaxees, the Xiximes, the Totorames, the Achires and the Guasaves.

In 1531, Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán, with a force of over 10,000 men, established a Spanish and allied Indian outpost at San Miguel de Culiacán. Over the next decade, the Cahíta suffered severe depopulation from conquest, smallpox and other diseases brought by Europeans.

The Spanish organized Sinaloa as part of the &quot;gobierno&quot; of Nueva Galicia. In 1564, the area was realigned: the area of Culiacán and Cosalá remained in control of Nueva Galicia, while the areas to the north, south and west were made part of the newly formed Nueva Vizcaya province, making the Culiacán area an exclave of Nueva Galicia. The first capital of Nueva Vizcaya was located in San Sebastián, near Copala, but was moved to Durango in 1583.

Starting in 1599, Jesuit missionaries spread out from a base at what is now Sinaloa de Leyva and by 1610, the Spanish influence had been extended to the northern edge of Sinaloa. In 1601, the Jesuits&#x27; movement into the eastern part of Sinaloa led to the Acaxee going to war. The Spanish eventually managed to reassert authority in the Sierra Madre Occidental region and executed 48 Acaxee leaders.

After the Mexican War of Independence, Sinaloa was joined with Sonora as Estado de Occidente, but became a separate, sovereign state in 1830. The Porfiriato era was marked by the administration of Francisco Cañedo, who served multiple non-consecutive terms from 1877 to 1909. After the Mexican Revolution, infrastructure projects and land reform consolidated the agrarian sector, which led to the state being named &quot;the granary of Mexico&quot;.

==Geography==
The coastal plain is a narrow strip of land that stretches along the length of the state and lies between the Gulf of California and the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, which dominates the eastern part of the state. Sinaloa is traversed by many rivers, which carve broad valleys into the foothills. The largest of these rivers are the Culiacán, Fuerte, and Sinaloa.

Sinaloa has a warm climate on the coast; moderately warm climate in the valleys and foothills; moderately cold in the lower mountains, and cold in the higher elevations. Its weather characteristics vary from subtropical and tropical, found on coastal plains, to cold in the nearby mountains. Temperatures range from to with rain and thunderstorms during the rainy season (June to October) and dry conditions throughout most of the year. Its average annual precipitation is 790 millimetres.

Numerous species of plants and animals are found within Sinaloa. Notable among the tree species is the elephant tree, &quot;Bursera microphylla&quot;.
==Demography==
According to the 2020 census, Sinaloa is home to 3,026,943 inhabitants, 60% of whom reside in the capital city of Culiacán and the municipalities of Mazatlán and Ahome. It is a young state in terms of population, 56% of which is younger than 30 years of age.

Other demographic particulars report 87% of the state practices the Catholic faith. Also, 1% of those over five years of age speak an indigenous language alongside Spanish; the main indigenous ethnic group residing in the state is the Mayo or &quot;Yoreme&quot; (Cáhita language) people. Life expectancy in the state follows the national tendency of higher rates for women than men, a difference of almost six years in the case of Sinaloa, at 74.2 and 68.3 years respectively.

In ethnic composition, Sinaloa has received large historic waves of immigration from Europe (mainly Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, Italy and Russia) and Asia (namely China, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Armenia, Lebanon, and Syria). The last two countries also make up most of the Arab Mexican community in the state. In recent years, retirees from the U.S., Canada, Australia, and South America have arrived and made Sinaloa their home. 

There was also a sizable influx of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews in the first decades of the twentieth century.

Greeks form a notable presence in Sinaloa, where one can find local cuisine with kalamari and a few Greek Orthodox churches along the state&#x27;s coast.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.39% of Sinaloa&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or having African descent.

Sinaloenses have moved to the United States in large numbers since 1970; a large community lives in the twin towns of Indio, California and Coachella, California about 40 km (25 miles) east of the resort city of Palm Springs, California in the Colorado Desert of Southern California.

=== Sports ===
Sinaloa is one of the few places where the ancient Mesoamerican ballgame is still played, in a handful of small, rural communities not far from Mazatlán. The ritual ballgame was central in the society, religion and cosmology of all the great Mesoamerican cultures including the Mixtecs, Aztecs, and Maya. The Sinaloa version of the game is called &quot;ulama&quot; and is very similar to the original. There are efforts to preserve this 3500-year-old unique tradition by supporting the communities and children who play it.

The state is home to several baseball teams such as Tomateros de Culiacán, Venados de Mazatlán, Cañeros de Los Mochis and Algodoneros de Guasave which take part in the Mexican Pacific League.

<text>Tamaulipas, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Tamaulipas, is a state in Mexico; one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, comprise the 32 federal entities of Mexico. It is divided into 43 municipalities.

It is located in northeast Mexico and is bordered by the states of Nuevo León to the west, San Luis Potosí to the southwest, and Veracruz to the southeast. To the north, it has a stretch of the U.S.–Mexico border with the state of Texas, and to the east it is bordered by the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to the capital city, Ciudad Victoria, the state&#x27;s largest cities include Reynosa, Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Tampico, and Mante.

==Etymology==
The name Tamaulipas is derived from &quot;Tamaholipa&quot;, a Huastec term in which the &quot;tam-&quot; prefix signifies &quot;place (where)&quot;. No scholarly agreement exists on the meaning of &quot;holipa&quot;, but &quot;high hills&quot; is a common interpretation. Another explanation of the state name is that it is derived from &quot;Ta ma ho&#x27;lipam&quot; (&quot;place where the Lipan Apache prey&quot;).

== History ==
The area known as Tamaulipas has been inhabited for at least 8,000 years. Several different cultures (north coastal, south coastal, lowlands, and mountains) have come and gone during that period.

Tamaulipas was originally populated by the nomad Chichimec and sedentary Huastec, in addition to non-Chichimec hunter-gatherer and fishing tribes.

===Spanish era===
A gradual process was needed for Spain to subjugate the inhabitants of Tamaulipas in the 16th and 17th centuries. The first permanent Spanish settlement in the area was Tampico in 1554. Further settlement was done by Franciscan missionaries; widespread cattle and sheep ranching by the Spanish bolstered the area&#x27;s economy while forcing native populations from their original lands. Repeated indigenous rebellions kept the area unstable and weakened colonial interest in the region. What is now Tamaulipas was first incorporated as a separate province of New Spain in 1746 with the name Nuevo Santander. The local government capital during this time moved from Santander to San Carlos, and finally to Aguayo. The territory of this time spanned from the San Antonio River to the northeast to the Gulf of Mexico, then south to the Pánuco River near Tampico and west to the Sierra Madre Mountains. The area became a haven for rebellious Indians who fled there after increased Spanish settlements in Nuevo León and Coahuila.

In 1784 Nuevo Santander (Tamaulipas) led by Escandón, annexed San Antonio de los Llanos and its dependencies on the Purificación lagoon together with a certain number of ranches on the right bank of the Río Grande that belonged to Nuevo León. New settlements were then founded and the line of towns along the Rio Grande would later be dubbed the &quot;villas del norte&quot;, or northern towns (Laredo, Revilla [Guerrero], Mier, Camargo, and Reynosa) which were established as a key part of Escandón&#x27;s plan for the pacification and colonization of the province. These settlements, from Laredo to Reynosa, served as a defensive line for larger centers of population in the Mexican interior. Moreover, the villas functioned as a means to introduce Spanish &quot;civilization&quot; to the indigenous groups of the area. The Tamaulipas-Nuevo Leon border likely runs along old Mesquite Posts.

In the mid-17th century, various Apache bands from the Southern Plains, after acquiring horses from Europeans in New Mexico, moved southeastward into the Edwards Plateau, displacing the native hunting and gathering groups. One of these groups was known as Lipan (see Hodge 1907 Vol. I:769 for a confusing list of synonyms). After 1750, when most Apache groups of the Central Texas highlands were displaced by Comanche and moved into the coastal plain of southern Texas, the Europeans of the San Antonio area began referring to all Apache groups in southern Texas as Lipan or Lipan Apache.

Many Indian groups of missions in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico had recently been displaced from their territory through the southward push by the Lipan Apaches and were still hostile toward Apaches, linking arms with the local Spanish authorities against their common foe.

By 1790, Europeans turned their attention from the aboriginal groups and focused on containing the Apache invaders. In northeastern Coahuila and adjacent Texas, Spanish and Apache displacements created an unusual ethnic mix. Here, the local Indians mixed with displaced groups from Coahuila and Chihuahua and Texas. Some groups, to escape the pressure, combined and migrated north into the Central Texas highlands.

=== Independent Mexico ===
In 1824, after the Mexican War of Independence from Spain, and the fall of the Mexican Empire, Tamaulipas was one of the 19 founder states of the new United Mexican States. Slavery was formally abolished by the 1824 Constitution. During the fights between centralists and federalists that after independence, the successful Texas Revolution led to the creation of the Republic of Texas in 1836. The new republic claimed as part of its territory northern Tamaulipas.
In 1840, it became a part of the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, Tamaulipas lost more than a quarter of its territory via the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. American president James K. Polk had desired to annex Mexican territory as far south as Tampico although his negotiator Nicholas Trist disregarded this and settled on a border with Texas on the Rio Grande. Its capital was kept at Aguayo, which later was renamed Ciudad Victoria in honor of Guadalupe Victoria, first President of Mexico.

In the wake of the war, Tamaulipas remained an object of interest to American expansionists. The climate was considered suitable for the spread of slavery by Southerners who desired the admission of new territory to shift the balance in Congress back towards the slave states. Senator Albert Gallatin Brown declared &quot;I want Tamaulipas, Potosi, and one or two other Mexican states; and I want them all for the same reason – for the plantation and spreading of slavery&quot;. In the 1850s José María Jesús Carbajal led several incursions into Tamaulipas before being indicted for violating the Neutrality Act. Filibustering efforts were also directed towards Cuba with the Lopez Expedition, which was desired for the same reason as Tamaulipas.

The French occupation and reign of Emperor Maximilian during the 1860s was difficult for Tamaulipas, at least on the borders and in the city of Tampico. Portions of Tamaulipas supported the republican forces led by President Benito Juarez in resisting the French, especially in the north. Two years after French occupation began, Tamaulipas as a state finally acceded to Maximilian&#x27;s rule, and the last French soldiers left the state in 1866, leading up to Maximilian&#x27;s execution and fall of the Second Mexican Empire in 1867.

However, the years after Maximilian&#x27;s defeat were ones of rebuilding and great growth in Tamaulipas. International trade began to blossom, especially with the coming of the railroad to Tampico, which was developing as not only a port city but also as an industrial and commercial center. The railroad allowed goods to flow quickly from the mines and cities of the interior and the Texas border to Tampico for processing and shipment. This, in turn, caused significant growth in towns such as Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo.

Since the revolution of 1910, successive governments have dedicated themselves to building industry and infrastructure in Tamaulipas, including communications and educational systems. Norberto Treviño Zapata founded the state university system, as well as reformed the state oil industry. Marte Gómez provided increased farm sizes for private family farmers. And more recently, Emilio Martínez Manautou led industrial growth. Lately, a push has been to strengthen fishing, including efforts to increase the price of fish and shellfish on the international market.

During the 1970s, Colombia was experiencing the Colombian Conflict, leading to the rise of illicit criminal organizations like the Cali Cartel and Medellín Cartel led by drug traffickers like Pablo Escobar and Fabio Ochoa Vásquez. In Mexico, there had already existed various illicit organizations doing drug trafficking like the Gulf Cartel, Milenio Cartel, Juaréz Cartel, Guadalajara Cartel, and a new group of vigilante drug traffickers called La Familia Michoacana. The Gulf Cartel was in charge of the State of Tamaulipas and other gulf coast states, leading to the drug trafficking rates going high in the 1990s. Around that time, a group of defectors from the Mexican Special Forces that participated in the Chiapas conflict defected as Osiel Cárdenas Guillén made them promises that they would receive better wages if they worked as the enforcer group of the Gulf Cartel called Los Zetas. They did incursions in states like Michoacán and merged La Familia Michoacana as an enforcer group from 2004 to 2006. In 2006, their crimes resulted in the Mexican drug war and Joint Operation Nuevo León-Tamaulipas.

== Geography ==


The Tropic of Cancer crosses the southern part of the municipality of Victoria.
The coastal plains along the Gulf have a large presence in the state, whereas inland the landscape is adorned by cactus species and pasture. Predominant fauna in the region include the cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), long-tailed weasel (&quot;Mustela frenata&quot;), ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;), American badger (&quot;Taxidea taxus&quot;), North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), plain chachalaca (&quot;Ortalis vetula&quot;) and quail.

In the western part of the state, the Sierra Madre Oriental displays warm valleys and high sierras with peaks reaching in the Pedragoso Sierra; in the Borregos Sierra; in La Gloria Sierra; in Cerro el Nacimiento; and above sea level in the Sierra el Pinal. The Sierra de Tamaulipas and the Sierra de San Carlos are isolated mountain ranges in eastern Tamaulipas.

In terms of hydrology, the Bravo, Purificacion, and Guayalejo Rivers flow into the Gulf of Mexico after crossing the state from the western inland. On their way, their basins and zones of influence naturally correspond to the areas destined for agricultural use. The Rio Grande, known to Mexicans as the Río Bravo, represents the northern frontier shared with the United States. One of the tributaries of this natural border, the San Juan River, feeds the . Agricultural and cattle-raising activities are served by 14 other dams across the state, with a total capacity of of water.

===Climate===
About 58% of the state has a hot humid subtropical climate. In the centre, north, and towards southwest, an arid and semi-arid climate predominate (both of these account for 38% of the state). A temperate subtropical climate is found in the extreme southwest of the state while in the extreme southeast, such as Tampico, there is a tropical savanna climate. Mean annual temperature in the state is around while mean annual precipitation is , mostly concentrated between June and September.

==Government and infrastructure==

State agencies include:
* Secretaría de Seguridad Pública (Tamaulipas)
* Secretetaria De Obras Publica
* Fiscalia General De Justica Tamaulipas
* Guardia Estatal

==Economy==

Northern Tamaulipas shares its economic culture with that of Texas, and is primarily characterized by agriculture and strong growth in all industrial sectors. This region is home to many of the maquiladoras, factories owned by foreign companies but worked by Mexicans, primarily by women. In the state there are important industrial parks such as the Oradel Industrial Center, located in the border city of Nuevo Laredo.

Southern Tamaulipas&#x27; economy is primarily based on the petrochemical industries. There are petrochemical production plants around Altamira as well as a principal Gulf coast container port, refinery facilities in Ciudad Madero and many oil-industry support service companies in Tampico, as well as a major general and bulk cargo port. Also of importance are the tourism and fishing industries, as well as much commercial shipping, based in Tampico and Altamira. The little village of La Pesca, in the municipality of Soto La Marina, about midway between Brownsville, Texas and Tampico, is a rapidly growing tourist area with lovely beaches and excellent fishing both in the Gulf of Mexico and the Rio Soto La Marina. The central zone contains the capital, Ciudad Victoria, and is home to much forestry and farming, as well as some industrial development. About 30% of the population lives here, both in the capital and in Ciudad Mante. Ciudad Victoria is a significant educational center, home to the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas (which also has campuses in other cities in the state), the Regional Technical Institute of Ciudad Victoria, the University of Valle de Bravo, and other institutions of learning.

As of the 1990 Mexican census, 13 percent of the homes had only dirt floors, nearly 19 percent had no running water, and over 15 percent of the homes had no electricity. This was better than the national average but was skewed because of the high rate of development in the urban centers. In rural communities in Tamaulipas, access to running water was available in less than 40 percent of homes.

As of 2005, Tamaulipas&#x27;s economy represents 3.3% of Mexico&#x27;s total gross domestic product or 21,664 million USD. Tamaulipas&#x27;s economy has a strong focus on export oriented manufacturing (i.e. maquiladora / IMMEX). As of 2005, 258,762 people are employed in the manufacturing sector. Foreign direct investment in Tamaulipas was 386.2 million USD for 2005. The average wage for an employee in Tamaulipas is approximately 240 pesos per day, $2.00 to $3.00 an hour.

== Demographics ==

There is a large number of people (around 200 000 only in the city of Reynosa) born in the southern neighboring state of Veracruz who are economic immigrants that end up working in the maquila industry.

==Education==

Tamaulipas enjoys standards slightly higher than the national averages, since illiteracy has been reduced to 5% for those over 15 years of age, average schooling reaches 7.8 years, and as many as 11% have earned a professional degree.

Institutions of higher education include:
*Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Tamaulipas (IEST)
*Instituto Tecnológico de Ciudad Madero (ITCM)
*Universidad Autónoma de Tamaulipas
*Tec Campus Tampico (ITESM)

==Transportation==

==State anthem==
The current anthem of the state of Tamaulipas is &quot;&quot;, composed in 1926 by Rafael Antonio Pérez Pérez, set to music by Alfredo Tamayo Marín. Normally, only the chorus, first verse and chorus are sung in public.
== Crime ==
This state is known to be the site of a territorial struggle between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. The resulting deaths and unresolved kidnappings from the gang violence have been described as a &quot;humanitarian tragedy&quot;.

The state of Tamaulipas is one of the most affected by violence in the country, mainly caused by organized crime. In February 2010, an armed conflict broke out between the criminal groups known as the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, resulting in many border cities becoming &quot;ghost towns&quot;; such is the case of the border strip known as &quot;La Frontera Chica&quot; made up of the cities of Miguel Alemán, Mier, Camargo and Nueva Ciudad Guerrero.

In November 2010, the Mexican army, together with the Federal Police and the Navy, launched an operation around the north of the state of Tamaulipas, allowing hundreds of families to return to their homes after months of exile in other states, mainly in municipalities like Mier, where around 4,000 people returned.

According to INEGI, in 2012 Tamaulipas contained 9 municipalities with a homicide rate higher than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants: Cruillas (106), San Fernando (175), Llera (159), Mier (156), Güémez (141), Hidalgo (135), Nuevo Laredo (134), González (109) and Soto la Marina (100). On the other hand, the municipalities that had had the most intentional homicides in 2012 were Nuevo Laredo (536 homicides), Victoria (165) and San Fernando (102).

In 2013, 880 homicides were recorded in the state, giving a rate of 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. This placed it that year in the 9th position of the states with the most homicides in Mexico. In 2013, Tamaulipas reached the first national place in kidnappings with 275 known cases and the ninth place in violent highway robbery (68 cases).

As of 2021, Tamaulipas continues to be affected by violence, this being one of the factors that have greatly hindered the economic and social activity of the state. In 2014 it was estimated that the losses due to violence by each company in Tamaulipas reached an average of 95 thousand pesos per year (fourth highest in the country). This placed it above the national average in terms of cost of crime for each company (13,600 pesos against the national average of 12,800).

<doc id="222257" wikidata="Q3817219" url="?curid=222257" title="Juan Downey">
<text>Juan Downey (May 11, 1940 – June 9, 1993) was a Chilean artist who was a pioneer in the fields of video art and interactive art.

== Early life and education ==
Downey was born in Santiago, Chile. His father, David Downey V., was a distinguished architect in Chile, and following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Juan Downey studied to complete a Bachelor of Architecture in 1964 from the Pontificia Universidad Católica of Chile. In 1961, to further his studies and develop his artistic practice, Downey traveled to Europe. He spent a few months in Barcelona and Madrid, followed by Paris, where he lived for three years studying printmaking at Stanley William Hayter&#x27;s legendary Atelier 17. During that time, he befriended artists Eugenio Téllez, Roberto Matta, Julio Le Parc, and Takis.

In 1965, Downey traveled to Washington, D.C., at the invitation of the Organization of American States to present a solo show of his work. It was there that Downey would meet his future wife, Marilys Belt. Downey stayed in Washington for a couple of years before moving with his family to New York in 1969. 
Downey was an associate professor of art at the Pratt Institute in New York from 1970 until 1993. He died in New York on June 9, 1993, as a result of cancer.

== Career ==
In New York, Downey would become involved with the groups Radical Software and Raindance collective, both of them early proponents of using video for artistic and political means.

Downey is recognized as a pioneer and early adopter of video art, but during his artistic career, he created an extensive body of work that also includes electronic and video sculptures, photography, painting, drawing, printmaking, performance, installation, and writing. Downey&#x27;s drawings are especially remarkable and remained a constant practice of his. All of his major works were accompanied by drawings. They reflect not only his “sureness of hand,” as curators David Ross and James Harithas noted, but also his compelling ideas and visions, and they reveal a sustained practice of drawing over a lifetime.

The early period of Juan Downey&#x27;s artistic practice consisted of painting, drawing, writing, and printmaking. After moving to the United States in 1965, he began to experiment with numerous forms of art that included creating interactive electronic sculptures, performances, happenings, and, in the late 1960s, video art. He wrote: “The universe is not an assemblage of independent parts, but an overlapping, interrelated system of energy. All my work relates to this vision.” These media permitted Downey to investigate ideas about invisible energy as well as to invite active participation by viewers of his work.

Two seminal series in Downey&#x27;s career were &quot;Video Trans Americas&quot;, begun in 1971, and &quot;The Thinking Eye&quot;, begun in the mid-1970s. &quot;Video Trans Americas&quot; (VTA.) is often divided into two groups: the first group was developed from 1973 to 1976, and the second from 1976 to 1977. The two series stress Downey&#x27;s preoccupation with political discourse, the self, the history of art, Western civilization, and Latin American identity.

====Video Trans Americas====
The Video Trans Americas (VTA) Series was a video-installation composed of videos recorded with a Sony portapak during Downey’s travels from North to Central and South America between 1973 and 1976. The first complete screening of the VTA video-installation was in the exhibition &quot;Landscape Studies in Video&quot; curated by David Ross at the Long Beach Museum of Art in 1975. The VTA video-installation in subsequent exhibitions at other museum institutions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art (1976) was exhibited differently. This was largely due to the spatial component entailed in the presentation of the work, a key concern for Downey, as well as his own artistic liberty to make changes or integrate other components in the installation.

<text>Bubble gum (or bubblegum) is a type of chewing gum, designed to be inflated out of the mouth as a bubble.

==Composition==
In modern chewing gum, if natural rubber such as chicle is used, it must pass several purity and cleanliness tests. However, most modern types of chewing gum use synthetic gum-based materials. These materials allow for longer lasting flavor, a softer texture, and a reduction in .

==Mechanical properties==
As a sort of chewing gum consisting of long-chain polysaccharides, bubblegum can typically exhibit linear and nonlinear viscoelastic behaviors. Therefore, the distinct deformations under chewing can be affected by shear rate, shear strain, and shear stress applied through teeth. Based on these, it is helpful to characterize the intrinsic rheological properties of chewing gums for future improvement and optimization of commercial products’ texture and chewiness.

The linear viscoelastic (LVE) property can be probed on pre-shaped gum cuds through a small isothermal strain deformation (i.e., below yield strain) under small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS). Here the critical yield strain is defined as the modulus deviating about 10% from its initial value. Under it, gum cuds show elastic deformation that follows power-law behavior as a critical gel in the linear regime; otherwise, exhibiting nonlinear responses with increasing shear stress (plasticity). Normally, this yield strain is less than 1%.

Regarding plastic deformation, the nonlinear viscoelasticity can be explored through shear creep experiments (relaxation time) and the start-up of steady shear stress-controlled uniaxial/biaxial extension. The former demonstrates that fractional recovery, defined as the ratio between measured strain after deformation and recovered strain without adding shear stress, for chewing gums under moderate shear stress (~ 1000 Pa) is between 25% and 40%. This relatively high fractional recovery (the ability to recover its previous shape) is consistent with providing a satisfying sensory feel. On the contrary, bubble gums only show fractional recovery lower than 15%. Therefore, bubble gums can withstand more substantial stresses before break-up than normal chewing gums. This distinction is mainly due to its on-purpose design, which allows it to form and maintain large, stable bubbles when blown up through sizeable shear stress on the tongue.

The stretching experiment shows gum cuds owning strain hardening during uniaxial extension. In particular, the LVE regime is absent with applying a constant Hencky strain rate, like the plastic flow in polycrystals or polymers. Moreover, different values of Hencky strain rates can lead to either extensional viscosity plateaus before sagging (macroscopic failure) or necking (strain hardening) following a low/high strain rate. Typically, the strain softening at a low strain rate manifests the disintegration of brittle networks within gums. In contrast, the nonuniform deformation of polymers and crystallization induced by strain explain the strain hardening behavior at a high strain rate.

==History==

In 1928, Walter Diemer, an accountant for the Fleer Chewing Gum Company in Philadelphia, was experimenting with new gum recipes. One recipe, based on a formula for a chewing gum called &quot;Blibber-Blubber&quot;, was found to be less sticky than regular chewing gum and stretched more easily. This gum became highly successful and was eventually named by the president of Fleer as Dubble Bubble because of its stretchy texture.

This remained the dominant brand of bubble gum until after WWII, when Bazooka bubble gum entered the market.

Until the 1970s, bubble gum still tended to stick to one&#x27;s face as a bubble popped. At that time, synthetic bubble gum was introduced, which would almost never stick. The first brands in the US to use these new synthetic gum bases were Hubba Bubba and Bubble Yum.

Bubble gum got its distinctive pink color because the original recipe Diemer worked on produced a dingy gray colored gum, so he added red dye (diluted to pink), as that was the only dye he had on hand at the time.

==Flavors==
In taste tests, children tend to prefer strawberry and blue raspberry flavors, rejecting more complex flavors, as they say these make them want to swallow the gum rather than continue chewing.

==Bubble gum flavor==
While there is a bubble gum &quot;flavor&quot; – which various artificial flavorings including esters are mixed to obtain – it varies from one company to another. Esters used in synthetic bubble gum flavoring may include methyl salicylate, ethyl butyrate, benzyl acetate, amyl acetate or cinnamic aldehyde.
A natural bubble gum flavoring can be produced by combining banana, pineapple, cinnamon, cloves, and wintergreen. Vanilla, cherry, lemon, and orange oil have also been suggested as ingredients.

==Records==
In 1996, Susan Montgomery Williams of Fresno, California, set the Guinness World Record for largest bubble gum bubble ever blown, which was in diameter. However, Chad Fell holds the record for &quot;Largest Hands-free Bubblegum Bubble&quot; at , achieved on 24 April 2004.

==Tourism==
Bubblegum Alley is a tourist attraction in downtown San Luis Obispo, California, known for its accumulation of used bubble gum on the walls of an alley.

The Market Theater Gum Wall is a brick wall covered in used chewing gum, located in an alleyway in Post Alley under Pike Place Market in Downtown Seattle.

<doc id="222273" wikidata="Q5867166" url="?curid=222273" title="History of professional baseball in Washington, D.C.">
<text>Washington, D.C., has been home to over a dozen baseball organizations beginning in 1872, and since 2005 has been represented in Major League Baseball (MLB) by the Washington Nationals.

==Early years: 1867–1899==
The first professional baseball teams and leagues were formed in the late 19th century and several were based in Washington, D.C. Many early teams used the names &quot;Nationals&quot; and &quot;Senators&quot; but were otherwise unrelated.
*The National Base Ball Club of Washington, D.C. (1867)
*The National Association Washington Olympics (1871–1872)
*The National Association Washington Nationals (1872)
*The National Association Washington Blue Legs (1873)
*The National Association Washington Nationals (1875)
*The Union Association Washington Nationals (1884)
*The American Association Washington Nationals (1884)
*The National League Washington Nationals (1886–1889)
*The American Association Washington Statesmen (1891) 
*The National League Washington Senators (1892–1899)

==&quot;First in war, first in peace, and last in the American League&quot;: 1901–1971==
Washington was continuously home to a major league baseball team from 1901 until 1971. Two separate franchises alternated between the nicknames &quot;Senators&quot; and &quot;Nationals&quot; and sometimes used the names interchangeably.

*The American League Washington Nationals/Senators (1901–1960): The team was officially the &quot;Senators&quot; from 1901 to 1904, the &quot;Nationals&quot; from 1905 to 1955 and the Senators again from 1956 to 1960 but nonetheless was commonly referred to as the Senators throughout its history (and unofficially as the &quot;Grifs&quot; during Clark Griffith&#x27;s tenure as manager from 1912 to 1920). In 1961, this team moved to Minneapolis-St. Paul and became the Minnesota Twins.
*The American League Washington Senators (1961–1971): This expansion team began play in Washington immediately following the departure of the former franchise. In 1972, this team moved to Dallas–Fort Worth and became the Texas Rangers.

Since the expansion franchise began play the year immediately after the original franchise&#x27;s final year in Washington, and because they both used the same nickname, the teams are commonly confused or combined and photographs are often dated based on player uniforms. The original club used dark blue as its primary color, with a thick, sans-serif, red or white block &quot;W&quot; on its caps. The expansion club mainly used caps with a stylized cursive &quot;W,&quot; first in blue with a red letter (1963–1967), then in red with a white letter (1968–1971), similar to current Washington Nationals. In 1961–1962, the expansion Senators wore dark blue caps with a sans-serif block &quot;W&quot; outlined in white, nearly identical to the caps of the original Senators save for a red button at the top of the cap. Varying shades of the Senators&#x27; red, white and blue colors are still used by their successor teams in Minnesota and Texas.

Two other teams also competed in Washington during this time period.
*The United States Baseball League Washington Senators (1912): This club was unrelated to the American League team and the new league folded after one month of operation. 
*The Negro National League Homestead Grays (1930–1948): Though officially based on Homestead, Pennsylvania, this club played many of its games in Washington and were informally known as the &quot;Washington Homestead Grays.&quot; When baseball returned to Washington in 2005, &quot;Grays&quot; was one of the three finalists for the team&#x27;s nickname.

==Return: since 2005==
Major League Baseball returned to Washington in 2005 after a 33-year absence.
*The National League Washington Nationals (2005–): The Montreal Expos, under the ownership of Major League Baseball, were relocated to Washington and sold to a new ownership group.
The Nationals adopted similar colors to 1968–1971 Senators adding gold accents to a tilted version of the expansion Senators cursive &quot;W&quot; logo.

In 2012, the Nationals won the NL East division championship and brought postseason baseball to Washington, D.C., for the first time in 79 years.

In 2014, the Nationals won their second NL East division championship in three years after defeating the Atlanta Braves, 3–0, on September 16, 2014. In the NLDS of the same year, the Nationals lost to the San Francisco Giants, who went on to win the World Series.

In 2019, the Washington Nationals won the Wild Card game, defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series, and then on October 30 won their first franchise World Series, defeating the American League champion Houston Astros in an historic matchup where neither team won a home game.

Construction of the line began on July 4, 1828, and it operated as B&amp;O from 1830 until 1987, when it was merged into the Chessie System. Its lines are today controlled by CSX Transportation.

The railroad was founded to serve merchants from Baltimore who wanted to do business with settlers crossing the Appalachian Mountains. It would compete with several existing and proposed turnpikes and canals, including the Erie and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Building west from the port of Baltimore, the B&amp;O reached Sandy Hook, Maryland, in 1834; Cumberland in 1842; the Ohio River at Moundsville, Virginia, in 1852; Wheeling, Virginia, in 1853; and in 1857, Parkersburg, Virginia, below rapids that made navigation difficult during parts of the year. 

The railroad, whose owners were Union sympathizers, proved crucial to the North&#x27;s success during the American Civil War, which caused considerable damage to the system. After the Civil War, the B&amp;O consolidated several feeder lines in Virginia and West Virginia, and expanded westward into Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. 

At the end of 1970, the B&amp;O operated of 4,535 miles of mainline track, not including the Staten Island Rapid Transit (SIRT) or the Reading Railroad and its subsidiaries. The B&amp;O’s long-distance passenger trains were discontinued in 1971 when the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) took over intercity passenger service, although it continued limited commuter service at Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. After a series of mergers, the B&amp;O became part of the CSX Transportation (CSX) network in 1980.

The B&amp;O is noted for its pioneering innovations in railroading. It was the first U.S. railroad to operate a steam locomotive, it built historic infrastructure, and it operated prestigious passenger trains. It gained additional fame by lending its name as one of the four railroads in the original version of the popular board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

==History==
===Ohio===

The railroad did not reach the Ohio River until 1852, 24 years after the project started. Yet the Ohio River was from the beginning the destination the railroad was seeking to link with Baltimore, at the time a transportation center. By crossing the Appalachian Mountains, a technical challenge, it would link the new and booming territories of what at the time was the West, particularly Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, with the east coast rail and boat network, from Maryland northward. There was no rail link between Maryland and Virginia until the B&amp;O opened the Harpers Ferry bridge in 1839.

Starting in 1825, the Erie Canal provided an animal-powered water facility, connecting New York City with Ohio via Lake Erie. It took ten days to travel downstream from Buffalo, New York, to New York City. The Cumberland Road, later the beginning of the federally financed National Road, provided a road link for animal-powered transport between Cumberland, Maryland, on the Potomac River and Wheeling, Virginia, in present-day West Virginia, on the Ohio River, when completed in 1837. It was the second paved road in the country. However, the 1831 DeWitt Clinton locomotive, running between Albany and Schenectady, New York, demonstrated speeds of , dramatically decreasing the cost of transportation and announcing the coming end of the canal and turnpike (road) systems, many of which were never completed since they were or would soon be obsolete.

In New York, political support for the Erie Canal detracted from the prospect of building a railroad to replace it, whose full length did not open until 1844. Mountains in Pennsylvania made construction in the western part of the state expensive and technically challenging, and the Pennsylvania Railroad, linking Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, did not open its full length until 1852, and there was no rail link west from Pittsburgh to Ohio for several more years.

The fast-growing port city of Baltimore, Maryland, faced economic stagnation unless it opened a route to the Western states. On February 27, 1827, twenty-five merchants and bankers studied the best means of restoring &quot;that portion of the Western trade which has recently been diverted from it by the introduction of steam navigation.&quot; Their answer was to build a railroad: one of the first commercial lines in the world.

Their plans worked well, despite many political problems from canal backers and other railroads. For example, only the Pennsylvania Railroad was allowed to build in its namesake state, requiring the B&amp;O to skirt around a corner of the state, even though the Pennsylvania Railroad didn&#x27;t even operate in that area of Pennsylvania.

The railroad grew from a capital base of $3 million in 1827 (equivalent to $ million in ) to a large enterprise generating $2.7 million of annual profit on its of track in 1854, with 19 million passenger miles. The railroad fed tens of millions of dollars of shipments to and from Baltimore and its growing hinterland to the west, thus making the city the commercial and financial capital of the region south of Philadelphia.

===Charters===
Although the Albany and Schenectady Railroad was chartered a year earlier, in 1826, the B &amp; O Railroad was the first to open in the US. Philip E. Thomas and George Brown were the pioneers of the railroad. In 1826, they investigated railway enterprises in England, which were at that time being tested in a comprehensive fashion as commercial ventures. Their investigation completed, they held an organizational meeting on February 12, 1827, including about twenty-five citizens, most of whom were Baltimore merchants or bankers. , passed February 28, 1827, and the Commonwealth of Virginia on March 8, 1827, chartered the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company, with the task of building a railroad from the port of Baltimore west to a suitable point on the Ohio River. The railroad, formally incorporated April 24, was intended to provide a faster route for Midwestern goods to reach the East Coast than to the hugely successful but slow Erie Canal across upstate New York. Thomas was elected as the first president and Brown the treasurer. The capital of the proposed company was fixed at $5 million, but the B&amp;O was initially capitalized in 1827 with a $3 million issue of stock. Half of this stock was reserved for the Maryland state government, which invested $1,000,000, and the municipal government of Baltimore, which invested $500,000. The remaining private equity was purchased by around 22,000 people, equivanlent to one-quarter of the city&#x27;s population at the time.

===Early construction and legal battles===

Construction began on July 4, 1828. Charles Carroll of Carrollton (the last living signer of the Declaration of Independence) laying the cornerstone at a groundbreaking ceremony. 

The initial tracks were built with granite stringers topped by strap iron rails. The first section, from Baltimore west to Ellicott&#x27;s Mills (now known as Ellicott City), opened on May 24, 1830. While a steam locomotive (&quot;Tom Thumb&quot;) was demonstrated on the B&amp;O in 1830, the railroad did not switch to steam until 1831, and the first trains on the round trip to Ellicott&#x27;s Mills were pulled by horses.

From Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, the railroad followed the Patapsco River upstream to a high point near Parr&#x27;s Ridge (now known as Mount Airy), where it descended into the Monocacy and Potomac river valleys. Further extensions opened to Frederick (including the short Frederick Branch) on December 1, 1831; Point of Rocks on April 2, 1832; and Sandy Hook on December 1, 1834. Sandy Hook, on the north bank of the Potomac, remained the end of the line until 1836 when the railroad opened its bridge over the Potomac River to reach Harpers Ferry (then Virginia, now West Virginia). A connection at Harpers Ferry with the Winchester and Potomac Railroad, running southwest to Winchester, Virginia, opened in 1837.

Pushing west from Harpers Ferry, the B&amp;O reached Martinsburg in May 1842; Hancock in June 1842; and Cumberland on November 5, 1842, which remained the end of the line for a number of years. Additional sections opened to Piedmont on July 21, 1851, and Fairmont on June 22, 1852. Later that year, the B&amp;O finally reached the Ohio River at Moundsville, where port facilities were built, followed shortly later by Wheeling (then Virginia, now West Virginia) on January 1, 1853. Wheeling remained the terminus through the American Civil War until a bridge could be constructed across the Ohio River.

The narrow strip of available land along the Potomac River between Point of Rocks and Harpers Ferry caused years of legal battles between the B&amp;O and the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O) Canal, as both sought to exclude the other from its use. A compromise eventually allowed the two companies to share the right of way. The B&amp;O also prevailed in a lawsuit brought against it by the Washington and Baltimore Turnpike Road.

The B&amp;O wanted links to Virginia&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley, as well as the parts of western Virginia draining into the Ohio River valley and ultimately the Mississippi River, such as Wheeling (where the National Road crossed the Ohio River) and the Kanawha River valley. However, many Virginia politicians wanted the minerals, timber and produce of those areas to instead ship through Richmond and reach the Atlantic through Norfolk, although the James River Canal required substantial maintenance and was never completed through the Appalachians to the Ohio River watershed. Thus, while the B&amp;O reached Wheeling in 1853, political compromises meant the B&amp;O would only reach Grafton to connect to Parkersburg on the Ohio River through a connection with the Northwestern Virginia Railroad which was completed in 1857. During the &quot;Great Railway Celebrations of 1857&quot;, a large group of notables boarded the B&amp;O in Baltimore, then transferred to steamboats that took them from Wheeling to Marietta, Ohio, where they boarded a railroad to Cincinnati, where after another celebration, they boarded the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, which brought them to St. Louis, Missouri, three days after they had started their journey. The B&amp;O would only reach Charleston (at the confluence of the Kanawha and Elk Rivers) and ultimately Huntington (which was named after a major B&amp;O investor) on the Ohio River more than a decade after the American Civil War and the creation of the state of West Virginia.

Meanwhile, the State of Maryland granted the B&amp;O a charter to build a line from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., in 1831, and the Washington Branch was opened in 1835. This line joined to the original mainline at Relay, Maryland, crossing the Patapsco River on the Thomas Viaduct (which remains one of the B&amp;O&#x27;s signature structures). This line was partially funded by the state of Maryland, and was operated separately until the 1870s, with Maryland receiving a 25 percent cut of gross passenger receipts. The B&amp;O&#x27;s charter also forbade further taxation of the railroad, and that no-tax provision was upheld in the 1840s after Baltimore City tried to tax it. This Washington Branch line was built in stone, much like the original mainline. By this time, however, strap rail was no longer used for new construction. Most of the stone bridges on the Old Main Line did not last long, being washed out by the periodic flooding of the Patapsco River and replaced at first by Bollman Truss bridges. The Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad to Annapolis connected to this line at Annapolis Junction in 1840. As an unwritten condition for the charter, it was understood that the state of Maryland would not charter any competing line between Baltimore and Washington, and no such charters were approved until well after the American Civil War, when the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired a railroad on the Delmarva Peninsula, which had the power to build short branch lines, so it was able to connect to Washington through Bowie, Maryland.

The B&amp;O also wanted access to Pittsburgh and coal fields in western Pennsylvania and Ohio. Although the directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad wanted a monopoly in their state, delays in laying track to Pittsburgh led the Pennsylvania legislature in 1846 to require construction to be completed within 10 years, else competition would be allowed. The Pennsylvania Railroad finished its trans-Allegheny track with two years to spare, thus the B&amp;O would only be able to extend its tracks up the Youghiogheny River valley to the soft coal fields in 1871.

===Early engineering===
When construction began on the B&amp;O in the 1820s, railroad engineering was in its infancy. Unsure exactly which materials would suffice, the B&amp;O erred on the side of sturdiness and built many of its early structures of granite. Even the track bed to which iron strap rail was affixed consisted of the stone.

Though the granite soon proved too unforgiving and expensive for track, most of the B&amp;O&#x27;s monumental bridges have survived to this day, and many are still in active railroad use by CSX. Baltimore&#x27;s Carrollton Viaduct, named in honor of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, was the B&amp;O&#x27;s first bridge, and is the oldest railway bridge in the Americas still carrying trains (and the third oldest in the world, after the Skerne Bridge, Darlington, UK, of 1824–1825, and the Bassaleg Viaduct, Newport, UK, of 1826). The Thomas Viaduct at Relay, Maryland, was the longest bridge in the United States upon its completion in 1835. It also remains in use. The B&amp;O made extensive use of the Bollman iron truss bridge design in the mid-19th century. Its durability and ease of assembly aided faster railroad construction.
As the B&amp;O built the main line west to Parr&#x27;s Ridge, near Mount Airy, Maryland, it had limited information about the capabilities of steam locomotives; at the time, the line had three, the &quot;York, Atlantic,&quot; and the &quot;Franklin.&quot; When planning the extension to Sandy Hook, Maryland, and then Harpers Ferry, the company was uncertain if the engines&#x27; metal wheels would grip the metal rails sufficiently to pull a train up to the top of the ridge. The railroad decided to construct two inclined planes, one on each side of the ridge, along which teams of horses, and perhaps steam-powered winches, would assist pulling the trains uphill. The planes, about a mile long on each side, quickly proved an operational bottleneck. Before the decade of the 1830s ended, the B&amp;O built a alternate route that became known as the Mount Airy Loop. The planes were quickly abandoned and forgotten, though some artifacts survive to the present.

===First telegraph line===
In 1843, Congress appropriated $30,000 for construction of an experimental telegraph line between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore along the B&amp;O&#x27;s right-of-way. The B&amp;O approved the project with the agreement that the railroad would have free use of the line upon its completion. An impressive demonstration occurred on May 1, 1844, when news of the Whig Party&#x27;s nomination of Henry Clay for U.S. president was telegraphed from the party&#x27;s convention in Baltimore to the Capitol Building in Washington. On May 24, 1844, the line was officially opened as Samuel F. B. Morse sent his famous words, &quot;What hath God wrought&quot;, from the B&amp;O&#x27;s Mount Clare station to the Capitol by telegraph.

===Innovations===
Contrary to legend, the B&amp;O was not the first chartered railroad in the United States; John Stevens obtained a charter for the New Jersey Railroad in 1815. The B&amp;O was, however, the first company to operate a locomotive built in America, with the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; in 1829. It built the first passenger and freight station (Mount Clare in 1829) and was the first railroad to earn passenger revenues in December 1829, and publish a timetable on May 23, 1830. On Christmas Eve 1852, the B&amp;O line was completed between Baltimore and the Ohio River near Moundsville, West Virginia.

===Conflicts in the early years===

Partial government ownership caused some operational problems. Of the thirty members on its board of directors, twelve were elected by shareholders, while eighteen were appointed either by Maryland or the Baltimore City Council. Many had conflicting interests: the directors appointed by the state and city desired low fares and all construction to be funded from corporate revenues, while the directors elected by shareholders desired greater profits and dividends. These conflicts became more intense in the 1850s after the completion of the C&amp;O Canal, which brought additional competition to the B&amp;O. In 1853, after being nominated by large shareholder and director Johns Hopkins, John W. Garrett became president of the B&amp;O, a position he would hold until his death in 1884. In the first year of his presidency, corporate operating costs were reduced from 65 percent of revenues to 46 percent, and the railroad began distributing profits to its shareholders.

===John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry===
The B&amp;O played a major role, and got national attention, in the response to abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia), in October 1859. Black porter Hayward Shepherd, to whom there is a monument in Harpers Ferry, was the first man killed; stationmaster Fontaine Beckham, who was also the town&#x27;s mayor, was killed the next day. Raiders had cut the telegraph line, and stopped the 1:30 am Wheeling to Baltimore express, but after several hours the train was allowed to continue and at the first station with a working telegraph (Monocacy) the conductor sent a telegram to B&amp;O headquarters. After confirming from the Martinsburg station (via Wheeling, because of the cut telegraph line) that the report was not a hoax, Garrett telegraphed President James Buchanan, the Secretary of War, the Governor of Virginia, and Maryland Militia General George Hume Steuart about the insurrection in progress. The B&amp;O made its rolling stock available to the military. At 3:20 pm a train left Washington Depot with 87 U.S. Marines and two howitzers, and a 3:45 p.m. train from nearer Frederick, Maryland, carried three Maryland militia companies under Col. Edward Shriver. These trains stopped before the bridge at Sandy Hook, Maryland (end of the line before the bridge was built), and troops continued across the bridge on foot. Soon Garrett&#x27;s Master of Transportation William Prescott Smith left Baltimore City, together with Maryland Gen. Charles G. Egerton Jr. and the Second Light Brigade, which train also picked up the Marines on the federal troop train at the junction in Relay, Maryland. All awaited Lt.Col. Robert E. Lee and Lt. J.E.B. Stuart, who had received orders from the Secretary of War to retake Harpers Ferry and capture the insurgent abolitionists, which they quickly did. Garrett reported with evident relief the next day that aside from the cut telegraph line, which was quickly repaired, there had been no damage to any B&amp;O track, equipment, or facilities.

The government of Maryland published in a book the many telegrams sent by B&amp;O employees and management during the raid.

===American Civil War===
At the outset of the Civil War, the B&amp;O possessed 236 locomotives, 128 passenger coaches, 3,451 rail cars and of rail road, all in states south of the Mason–Dixon line, as Garrett had noted before the war began. Although many Marylanders had Southern sympathies, Garrett and Hopkins supported the Union. The B&amp;O became crucial to the Federal government during the Civil War, being the main rail connection between Washington, D.C., and the northern states, especially west of the Appalachian mountains.

However, its initial problem became Lincoln&#x27;s first Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, a major stockholder in the rival North Central Railroad, which received long haul freight destined for Baltimore from the rival Pennsylvania Railroad. Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Railroad and other investors sought permission to construct rail lines which threatened the B&amp;O&#x27;s monopolies on the Washington Branch (between Relay and Washington DC) and westward through Cumberland, Maryland. Raids and battles during the war also cost the B&amp;O substantial losses, many never indemnified. Master of Transportation Prescott Smith kept a diary during the war years, describing incidents such as the June 1861 derailment of a 50 car coal train, which plunged into a ravine after a bridge was destroyed (the wreckage burned for months and melted the metal coal hoppers), as well as later ironclad trains (one only disabled by an artillery shell piercing the boiler).

==== 1861–1862 ====
On April 18, 1861, the day after Virginia seceded from the Union, Virginia militia seized the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, which was also an important work station on the B&amp;O&#x27;s main westward line. The following day, Confederate rioters in Baltimore attempted to prevent Pennsylvania volunteers from proceeding from the North Central Railway&#x27;s Bolton station to the B&amp;O&#x27;s Mount Clare station, and Maryland&#x27;s governor Hicks and Baltimore Mayor George W. Brown ordered 3 North Central and 2 Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&amp;B) bridges destroyed to prevent further federal troop movements through (and riots in) the city. Soon B&amp;O president John Work Garrett received letters from Virginia&#x27;s Governor John Letcher telling the B&amp;O to pass no federal troops destined for any place in Virginia over the railroad, and threatening to confiscate the lines. Charles Town&#x27;s mayor also wrote, threatening to cut the B&amp;O&#x27;s main line by destroying the long bridge over the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry, and Garrett also received anonymous threats. Thus he and others asked Secretary of War Cameron to protect the B&amp;O as the national capitol&#x27;s main westward link. Cameron instead warned Garrett that passage of any rebel troops over his line would be treason. The Secretary of War agreed to station troops to protect the North Central, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and even the PW&amp;B, but flatly refused to help the B&amp;O, his main competition.

The B&amp;O had to repair damaged line at its own expense, and often received late or no payment for services rendered to the federal government. In May, CSA Colonel Jackson&#x27;s operations against the B&amp;O Railroad (1861) began. Stonewall Jackson initially permitted B&amp;O trains to operate during limited hours over the approximately 100 miles from Point of Rocks to Cumberland. On June 20, 1861, Jackson&#x27;s Confederates seized Martinsburg, a major B&amp;O work center, having blown up the Harpers Ferry railroad bridge on June 14. Confederates confiscated dozens of locomotives and train cars and ripped up double track in order to ship rails for Confederate use in Virginia (14 locomotives and 83 rail cars were dismantled and sent south, and another 42 locomotives and 386 rail cars damaged or destroyed at Martinsburg, with the B&amp;O water station and machine shops also destroyed and miles of telegraph wire removed by the time federal control was restored in March 1862). By the end of 1861, 23 B&amp;O railroad bridges had been burned and of track were torn up or destroyed.

Since Jackson cut the B&amp;O main line into Washington for more than six months, the North Central and Pennsylvania Railroads profited from overflow traffic, even as many B&amp;O trains stood idle in Baltimore. Garrett tried to use his government contacts to secure the needed protection, from Maryland Delegate Reverdy Johnson to General George McClellan and Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. As winter began, coal prices soared in Washington, even though the B&amp;O in September arranged for free coal transport from its Cumberland, Maryland, terminal down the C&amp;O Canal (which reduced prices somewhat, although Confederates also damaged the C&amp;O canal that winter). Furthermore, western farmers could not get their produce to markets because of the B&amp;O shutdown, only partially alleviated by the summer 1861 Union army victories at the Battle of Philippi (West Virginia) and Rich Mountain, and vigorous army and company work crews which reduced the main-line gap to 25 miles between Harpers Ferry and Back Creek.

Finally at year end, Samuel M. Felton, the PW&amp;B President, wrote newspapers about the War Department&#x27;s discrimination against his cooperating railroad line, which competed with Cameron&#x27;s favored North Central and Pennsylvania Railroads. President Lincoln (familiar with railroad law since his days as an Illinois lawyer) in January 1862 replaced Cameron with Pennsylvania lawyer Edwin M. Stanton, who had been serving as Cameron&#x27;s legal advisor. Furthermore, on January 31, 1862, Congress passed the Railways and Telegraph Act of January 31, 1862, creating the United States Military Railroad and allowing it to seize and operate any railroad or telegraph company&#x27;s equipment, although Stanton and USMRR Superintendent Daniel McCallum would take a &quot;team of rivals&quot; approach to railroad management and allow civilian operations to continue. In February 1862, Union forces recaptured Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry, and work crews continued replacing wrecked bridges and equipment, although bushwhacker raids continued.
Even then train movements were sporadic and subject to frequent stoppages, derailments, capture and attack. Prominent raids on the B&amp;O railroad during this period were:
* The Great Train Raid of 1861, May 22 – June 23, 1861
* The Romney Expedition, January 1 through January 24, 1862
* Operations during the Maryland Campaign, September 8, 1862
* Various raids of Brigadier General A. G. Jenkins, Fall, 1862

====1863–1865====
The second half of the Civil War was characterized by near-continuous raiding, which severely hampered the Union defense of Washington, D.C. Union forces and leaders often failed to properly secure the region, despite the B&amp;O&#x27;s vital importance to the Union cause.

This military strategy, or lack thereof, allowed Confederate commanders to contribute significantly to the length of the war, by conducting free-ranging military operations against the region and railroad.

Before the Battle of Monocacy, B&amp;O agents began reporting Confederate troop movements eleven days prior to the battle, and Garrett had their intelligence passed to authorities in the War Department and to Major General Lew Wallace, who commanded the department responsible for defense of the area. As preparations for the battle progressed, the B&amp;O provided transport for federal troops and munitions, and on two occasions Garrett was contacted directly by President Abraham Lincoln for further information. Though Union forces lost this battle, the delay allowed Ulysses S. Grant to successfully repel the Confederate attack on Washington at the Battle of Fort Stevens two days later. After the battle, Lincoln paid tribute to Garrett as:

* The Jones-Imboden Raid, April 24 through May 22, 1863
* The Catoctin Station Raid, June 17, 1863
* The First Calico Raid, June 19, 1863
* The B&amp;O Raid on Duffield Station, January 1864
* The McNeill Raid, May 5, 1864
* The Second Calico Raid, July 3, 1864
* The Battle of Monocacy, July 9, 1864
* Gilmor&#x27;s Raid, July 11, 1864
* The Greenback Raid, by Mosby&#x27;s Rangers on October 14, 1864
* The B&amp;O Raid on Duffield Station II, January 1865
* Gilmor&#x27;s B&amp;O Raid, February 1865
* The B&amp;O Derailment Raid, March 1865
The Confederate leaders who led these operations and specifically targeted the railroad included:
* Lieutenant General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson and many units under his command
* Lieutenant General Jubal Anderson Early and many units under his command
* Brigadier General Turner Ashby and his &quot;Black Horse&quot; cavalry
* Brigadier General John D. Imboden and the 62nd Virginia Mounted Infantry (1st Partisan Rangers)
* Brigadier General Albert G. Jenkins and the 8th Virginia Cavalry
* Brigadier General William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones and the &quot;Laurel Brigade&quot;
* Colonel John S. Mosby&#x27;s &quot;Mosby&#x27;s Rangers&quot;
* Major Harry Gilmor&#x27;s &quot;Gilmor&#x27;s Raiders&quot;
* Captain John H. McNeill&#x27;s &quot;McNeill&#x27;s Rangers&quot;

Bases of operation involved in raiding the B&amp;O Railroad:
* Winchester, Virginia
* Harpers Ferry, West Virginia

===Westward by merger===
A steel and stone bridge was built across the Ohio River between Bellaire, Ohio, and Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1871, connecting the B&amp;O to the Central Ohio Railroad, which the B&amp;O had leased starting in 1866. This provided a direct rail connection to Columbus, Ohio, and the lease marked the beginning of a series of expansions to the west and north.

Other railroads included in the B&amp;O were:

* Winchester and Potomac Railroad and Winchester and Strasburg Railroad from 1867. This pair of lines connected with the B&amp;O at Harper&#x27;s Ferry, West Virginia, and constituted the only significant B&amp;O trackage in present-day Virginia.
* Sandusky, Mansfield and Newark Railroad leased through the Central Ohio in 1869
* Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad from 1871. This was the B&amp;O entry into Pittsburgh, thwarting the denial of a Pennsylvania charter to the B&amp;O.
* Somerset and Cambria Railroad from 1879
* Buffalo Railroad from 1880
* Pittsburgh Southern Railroad acquired 1883. Originally a narrow-gauge railroad, it was converted to standard gauge and renamed the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Short Line.
* West Virginia and Pittsburgh Railroad from 1890
* Columbus and Cincinnati Midland Railroad leased through the Central Ohio in 1890
* Monongahela River Railroad from 1900
* Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad from 1882. This was initially renamed the Cincinnati, Washington and Baltimore Railroad and then again to the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad in 1889. The B&amp;OSW absorbed the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in 1893, giving the B&amp;O a connection to St. Louis, Missouri, and finally the B&amp;OSW disappeared into the rest of the system in 1900.
* Ohio River Railroad from 1901
* Pittsburgh Junction Railroad from 1902
* Pittsburgh and Western Railroad from 1902. This was originally a narrow-gauge system which was standard gauged from 1883 to 1911. It formed the main B&amp;O line west from Pittsburgh. The line passed the Mars Train Station in Mars, Pennsylvania, northwest of Pittsburgh.
* Cleveland, Terminal and Valley Railway from 1895. This was the B&amp;O&#x27;s entry into Cleveland, Ohio.
* Cleveland, Lorain and Wheeling Railroad from 1909
* Chicago Terminal Transfer Company, reorganized in 1910 as the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad. This switching line was always operated as a separate company.
* Salisbury Railroad near Pittsburgh, operated from 1912
* Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad from 1912
* Morgantown and Kingwood Railroad from 1920
* Coal and Coke Railway from 1916
* Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Western Railroad from 1927. This was originally part of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton, and gave the B&amp;O a connection to Springfield, Illinois.
* Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway in 1932. This gave the B&amp;O a line into New York state.
* Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad from 1932. Part of the line was severed from the rest of the system by flooding, and became part of the Wellsville, Addison and Galeton Railroad in 1955.

(This list omits certain short lines.)

The Chicago and Alton Railroad was purchased by the B&amp;O in 1931 and renamed the Alton Railroad. It was always operated separately and was eventually bought by the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad after receivership in 1942.

===Great Railroad Strike of 1877===

As a result of poor national economic conditions in the mid-1870s following the Panic of 1873, the B&amp;O attempted to reduce its workers&#x27; wages. After a second reduction in wages was announced in the same year, workers began the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Striking workers would not allow any of the trains, mainly freight trains, to roll until the third wage cut was revoked. West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent in state militia units to restore train service but the soldiers refused to fire on the strikers. The strike spread to Cumberland, and when Maryland Governor John Lee Carroll attempted to put down the strike by sending the state militia from Baltimore, riots broke out resulting in 11 deaths, the burning of parts of Camden station, and damage to several engines and cars. The next day workers in Pittsburgh staged a sympathy strike that was also met with an assault by the state militia; Pittsburgh then erupted into widespread rioting. The strike ended after federal troops and state militias restored order.

===New lines in Maryland===

In 1866 the B&amp;O began constructing the Metropolitan Branch west out of Washington, which was completed in 1873 after years of erratic effort. Before this line was laid, rail traffic west of Washington had to travel first to Relay or Baltimore before joining the main line. The line cut a more or less straight line from Washington to Point of Rocks, Maryland, with many grades and large bridges. Upon the opening of this line, through passenger traffic was rerouted through Washington, and the Old Main Line from Point of Rocks to Relay was reduced to secondary status as far as passenger service was concerned. The Washington to Gaithersburg section of the Met Branch was double-tracked during 1886–1893. Rebuilding in the early 20th century and complete double-tracking of the branch by 1928 increased capacity; the &quot;branches&quot; became the &quot;de facto&quot; mainline, though the Old Main Line was retained as a relief route.

Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) outmaneuvered the B&amp;O to acquire the B&amp;O&#x27;s northern connection, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, in the early 1880s, cutting off the B&amp;O&#x27;s access to Philadelphia and New York. The state of Maryland had stayed true to its implicit promise not to grant competing charters for the Baltimore/Washington line, but when a charter was granted in 1860 to build a line from Baltimore to Pope&#x27;s Creek in southern Maryland, lawyers for the Pennsylvania RR picked up on a clause in the unfulfilled charter allowing branches up to long, from any point and in any direction. The projected route, passing through what is now Bowie, Maryland, could have a &quot;branch&quot; constructed that would allow service into Washington. The Pennsylvania picked up the charter through the agency of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad and in 1872 service between Baltimore and Washington began. (&quot;See&quot; Pope&#x27;s Creek Subdivision.) At the same time, the PRR outmaneuvered the B&amp;O and took control of the Long Bridge across the Potomac River into Virginia, the B&amp;O&#x27;s connection to southern lines.
In response, the B&amp;O chartered the Philadelphia Branch in Maryland and the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad in Delaware and Pennsylvania and built a parallel route, finished in 1886. The 10th president, Charles F. Mayer, spearheaded the development of the Baltimore Belt Line, which opened in 1895, and recruited engineer Samuel Rea to design it. This belt line connected the main line to the Philadelphia Branch without the need for a car ferry across the Patapsco River, but the cost of constructing the Howard Street Tunnel drove the B&amp;O to bankruptcy in 1896.

Two other lines were built in attempts to reconnect to the south. The Alexandria Branch (now called the Alexandria Extension) was built in 1874, starting from Hyattsville, Maryland, and ending at a ferry operation at Shepherd&#x27;s Landing. The ferry operation continued until 1901 when the trackage rights agreement concluded as part of the construction of Washington Union Station saw the south end of the branch realigned to link to the PRR trackage in Anacostia, across the Anacostia Railroad Bridge, into the Virginia Avenue Tunnel, through Southwest Washington, D.C., to Potomac Yard in Alexandria, Virginia. (&quot;See&quot; RF&amp;P Subdivision.) The Alexandria Branch trackage to Shepherd&#x27;s Landing was heavily used during World War II when traffic congestion on the Long Bridge caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct a bridge along the original plan of the B&amp;O: Alexandria to Shepherd&#x27;s Landing, Washington. Trains of empty freight cars were routed north and south over the structure, which was demolished after the end of World War II.

Before either connection was made, however, another branch was built around the west side of Washington. During the 1880s the B&amp;O had organised a group of bankrupt railroads in Virginia into the Virginia Midland Railroad. The VM track ran from Alexandria to Danville, Virginia. The line projected west across the Potomac River was intended to cross the Potomac just north of the D.C. line, to continue southwest to a connection with the B&amp;O-controlled Virginia Midland (VM) in Fairfax (now Fairfax Station, to distinguish it from what was Fairfax Court House and is now the City of Fairfax, Virginia), and if possible to a connection with the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in Quantico. The branch was started in 1892 and reached Chevy Chase, Maryland, the same year. Financial problems in both the VM and B&amp;O forced a halt to construction and led to the B&amp;O&#x27;s loss of control of the VM. Following bankruptcy, and control by the Pennsylvania Railroad, by the time the line was completed in 1910 there was no longer any point to the river crossing. Thus, the renamed Georgetown Branch came to serve a wide range of customers in Maryland and in Georgetown, such as the Potomac Electric Power Company, the Washington Milling Company, and the U.S. government. The line cut directly across various creeks, and includes what was said to be the longest wood trestle on the railroad over Rock Creek; and a short tunnel, Dalecarlia Tunnel, under the Washington Aqueduct. The line was almost completely abandoned in 1986 by CSX and is presently used in part as the right-of-way for the Capital Crescent Trail.

After a flood damaged the C&amp;O Canal in 1877, the B&amp;O acquired a majority interest in the canal mainly to keep its property and right of way from potential use by the Western Maryland Railroad. The canal was operated by the B&amp;O until 1924 when it was damaged in another flood. The canal&#x27;s property was later transferred to the U.S. government in 1938 in consideration for obtaining a loan from the federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

In 1895 the B&amp;O introduced electric locomotives over of line near Camden, initially using an overhead electric slot system.

===The 20th century===

Following its emergence from bankruptcy, control of the B&amp;O was acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1901, though the two kept separate corporate identities. A rising young PRR Vice President, Leonor F. Loree, was appointed president. Loree shared the Pennsy management&#x27;s belief in infrastructure and the B&amp;O at that time needed some of that. New classes of engines were built to haul longer, heavier trains faster. The Old Main Line was reworked, sections of the original right-of-way cut off by the straightening of curves and replacement of old, weight-restricted bridges with newer, heavier bridges. Most of Loree&#x27;s work on the B&amp;O physical plant remains evident today. Many iron and steel bridges on the railroad were replaced with stone (Pennsy preferred stone to the preference of the Reading and Lackawanna Railroad for concrete). With the adoption of anti-trust legislation in 1906, the relation between the two companies was severed.

The railroad&#x27;s passenger numbers were at a disadvantage with the railroad&#x27;s major competitor in the northeast, the Pennsylvania Railroad. That railroad had a tunnel into Manhattan, thus carrying passengers directly into New York City. The B&amp;O had no tunnel rights, and its New York City market trains actually terminated at the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal in Jersey City. From Philadelphia to Jersey City the B&amp;O traveled over Reading Railroad tracks to Bound Brook and there joining Central Railroad of New Jersey tracks to Jersey City. Passengers rode CNJ ferries or B&amp;O busses to Manhattan. Suffering from its weaker market position from Baltimore to New York, the B&amp;O discontinued all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958. One day later, the railroad had declared itself fully dieselized.

The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway took financial control of the B&amp;O in 1963. On May 1, 1971, Amtrak had taken over all of the remaining non-commuter routes of the B&amp;O. The B&amp;O already had a controlling interest in the Western Maryland Railway. In 1973 the three railroads were brought together under one corporate identity, the Chessie System, although they continued to operate as separate railroads. In 1980 the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, a holding company that owned the Seaboard Coast Line, the Louisville &amp; Nashville, the Clinchfield, and the Georgia Railroad, agreed to form CSX Corporation. SCL Industries was renamed the Seaboard System Railroad (SBD) in 1983, the same year that the Western Maryland Railway was completely absorbed into the B&amp;O. SBD was renamed CSX Transportation (CSX) in 1986. On April 30, 1987, the B&amp;O&#x27;s corporate existence ended when it was absorbed into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, which merged into CSX Transportation on August 31 of that year.

In railroading&#x27;s golden age, the B&amp;O was one of several trunk lines uniting the northeast quadrant of the United States into a wide industrial zone. It was the southern border as the New York Central was the northern border. The Pennsylvania Railroad controlled the center, and smaller roads like the Lackawanna, Lehigh Valley, and the Erie in the center surviving largely through the Interstate Commerce Commission. The corners of this map are Baltimore in the southeast, Boston in the northeast, Chicago in the northwest, and St. Louis in the southwest.



== Legacy ==
When CSX established the B&amp;O Railroad Museum as a separate entity from the corporation, it donated some of the former B&amp;O Mount Clare Shops in Baltimore, including the Mt. Clare roundhouse, to the museum, while selling the rest of the property. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Warehouse at Camden Yards rail junction in Baltimore now dominates the view over the right-field wall at the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; current home, Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

== Locomotive roster==

Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had numerous locomotives and cab units, mostly the latter. The railroad had locomotives from the following companies:
::*Electro-Motive Diesel
::*Baldwin Locomotive Works
::*Lima Locomotive Works
::*Fairbanks-Morse

==Heritage units==
In 2021, CSX repainted three EMD F40PHs into an honorary B&amp;O scheme: CSX 1, CSX 2 and CSX 3.

In May 2023, GE ES44AH unit #1827 entered service, being repaired and painted at CSX shops in Waycross, GA under the honorary B&amp;O scheme similar to that of the three F40PH locomotives. It is CSX&#x27;s first heritage unit.

<text>In film and television production, B-roll, B roll, B-reel or B reel is supplemental or alternative footage intercut with the main shot. The term &quot;A-roll&quot;, referring to main footage, has fallen out of use to some degree.

==Film and video production==
Films and videos may cut away from the main story to show related scenery or action. Establishing shots may be used to show the audience the context of the story. These secondary images are often presented without sound, or with very low level sound, as the sound from the primary footage is expected to continue while the other images are shown. The various shots presented without sound are called &quot;B-roll&quot;.

B-roll may be shot by smaller second unit crews, since there is no need for sound. In film, smaller MOS cameras, lacking sound circuitry, may be used for greater portability and ease of setup. In electronic news-gathering (ENG) and documentary film projects, B-roll footage is often shot after the main interview is shot, to provide supporting scenes for what was said by the interview subject. In a docudrama project, B-roll may refer to dramatic re-enactment scenes staged by the producer and performed by actors, to be used as cutaway shots.

There are many different types of B-roll, including: insert shots, FX shots, establishing shots, stock footage, and pickup shots.

B-roll footage may be added to or drawn from a stock footage library.

==History==

The term &quot;B-roll&quot; originates from a particular solution to the problem of visible splices in the narrow film stock used in 16 mm film. 35 mm film was wide enough to hide splices, but 16 mm film revealed the splices as flaws in the picture. To avoid this problem, the intended shots were spliced to opaque black leader, with the black leader hiding the splice. Two sequences of shots were assembled, the odd-numbered shots on the A-roll, and the even-numbered shots on the B-roll, such that all of the shots on one roll were matched by black leader on the other roll, in a checkerboard pattern (an alternate name for the process was &quot;checkerboard printing&quot;.) Unexposed 16 mm raw print stock was exposed twice, once to the A-roll, then it was exposed again to the B-roll.

Until the mid-1970s, news teams shot both main A-roll and secondary B-roll footage on 16 mm film. Sound was integrated onto the film by way of a magnetic stripe at the edge of the film. The A-roll and B-roll scenes, shot at 24 frames per second, were converted to the television frame rate of 30 fps using a telecine system consisting of two film projectors, one showing the main A-roll footage and the other showing the B-roll. The sound from the A-roll footage was used, or sound from narration or voiceover, while MOS images from the B-roll were intercut as desired.

In the 1980s, the term &quot;B-roll&quot; was adopted for linear video editing using at least two video tape machines. Traditionally, the tape decks in an edit suite were labeled by letter, with the &#x27;A&#x27; deck being the one containing the main tape upon which the main action material was shot. The &#x27;B&#x27; deck was used to run tapes that held additional footage such as establishing shots, cutaway shots, and any other supporting footage. The sound was usually taken from the A deck alone, so that the B deck provided video without sound. As linear editing systems were unable to dissolve between clips on the same tape, an edit decision list (EDL) was used to mark clips as &quot;A-roll&quot; and &quot;B-roll&quot; to indicate source machines.

<text>Rykodisc is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group, operating as a unit of WMG&#x27;s Independent Label Group and distributed through Alternative Distribution Alliance.

==History==
Claiming to be the first CD-only independent record label in the United States, Rykodisc was founded in January 1984 in Cannes, France, by Arthur Mann, Rob Simonds, Doug Lexa and Don Rose. The name &quot;Ryko,&quot; which the label claimed was a Japanese word meaning &quot;sound from a flash of light,&quot; was chosen to reflect the company&#x27;s CD-only policy. In the late 1980s, however, the label also began to issue high-quality cassette / vinyl and MiniDisc versions of many releases under the name Ryko Analogue.

Initially founded as an audiophile-oriented label, Rykodisc shifted its focus towards mainstream audiences following the worldwide success of Dire Straits″ 1985 album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, which demonstrated that the compact disc&#x27;s growth would be significantly faster than initially anticipated. The label subsequently saw notable successes in the CD reissue industry, as artists such as Elvis Costello, David Bowie, Yoko Ono, Frank Zappa, the estate of Nick Drake, Nine Inch Nails, Sugar, Robert Wyatt, and Mission of Burma allowed Rykodisc to issue their catalogs on CD. Rykodisc also re-released the SST Records-era recordings by the Meat Puppets. It also was responsible for the first release of the &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; LP by the late Chris Bell of Big Star, another band on the label.
Over the years, the label acquired Hannibal Records, Tradition Records, Gramavision (founded by Jonathan F. P. Rose), Emperor Norton Records, Restless Records and Cordless Recordings. Rykodisc also founded a distribution company, Ryko Distribution, and a music publishing company, Rykomusic. The label&#x27;s catalog exceeds 1,200 titles.

In 1998, Chris Blackwell left Island Records and bought Rykodisc for a reported $35 million as a means of acquiring music marketing and distribution expertise for his new venture, a media company called Palm Pictures. In 1999, one year after the Blackwell buy-out, the office in Salem, Massachusetts, was closed, and many industry veterans were laid off. In 2001, Blackwell parted ways with Rykodisc. The label was then located in New York City with offices in Los Angeles and in Beverly, Massachusetts.

On March 23, 2006, it was announced that Warner Music Group acquired the Ryko Corporation for $67.5 million. The Zappa Family Trust and Ryko parted ways in 2012 with the Zappa Family Trust reacquiring Frank Zappa&#x27;s recorded music catalogue and Universal Music Enterprises taking over distribution of the Zappa catalogue. Also in 2006, the independent publishing company Evergreen Copyrights purchased the Rykomusic publishing catalogue, among others. In September 2010, Evergreen was acquired by BMG Rights Management.

In 2009, Ryko Distribution was folded into Alternative Distribution Alliance.

<text>Social history, often called &quot;history from below&quot;, is a field of history that looks at the lived experience of the past. Historians who write social history are called social historians. 

Social history came to prominence in the 1960s, spreading from schools of thought in the United Kingdom and France which posited that the Great Man view of history was inaccurate because it did not adequately explain how societies changed. Instead, social historians wanted to show that change arose from within society, complicating the popular belief that powerful leaders were the source of dynamism. While social history came from the Marxist view of history (historical materialism), the cultural turn and linguistic turn saw the number of sub-fields expand as well as the emergence of other approaches to social history, including a social liberal approach and a more ambiguous critical theory approach.

In its &quot;golden age&quot; it was a major field in the 1960s and 1970s among young historians, and still is well represented in history departments in Britain, Canada, France, Germany and the United States. In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%. In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 841 (25%).

==&quot;Old&quot; social history==
There is an important distinction between old social history and new social history that exists in what are now sub-fields of social history that predate the 1960s. E. P. Thompson identified labour history as the central concern of new social historians because of its &quot;Whiggish narratives&quot;, such as the term &quot;labour &quot;movement&quot;&quot; which, he says, erroneously suggests the constant progression toward the perfect future. The older social history included numerous topics that were not part of mainstream historiography, which was then political, military, diplomatic, constitutional history, the history of great men and intellectual history. It was a hodgepodge without a central theme, and it often included political movements, such as populism, that were &quot;social&quot; in the sense of being outside the elite system.

==The emergence of &quot;new&quot; social history==

The popular view is that new social history emerged in the 1960s with the publication of Thompson&#x27;s The Making of the English Working Class (1963). Writing in 1966 in The Times Literary Supplement, Thompson described his approach as &quot;history from below&quot; and explained that it had come from earlier developments within the French Annales School.

According to C. J. Coventry, new social history arose in the 1930s at the University of Cambridge with the Communist Party Historians Group. Citing the reflections of Eric Hobsbawm, a contemporary of Thompson&#x27;s and a fellow member of the Historians&#x27; Group, Coventry shows that the &quot;new&quot; social history popularly associated with Thompson&#x27;s &quot;history from below&quot; was in fact a conscious revival of historical materialism by young British Marxist intellectuals under the tutelage of the Cambridge economist Maurice Dobb. If so, the foundational text of social history is Karl Marx&#x27;s The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852), which is marked by its society-wide approach and consideration of everyday people. It was not until the 1960s, however, that social history gained popularity and scholarship flourished. This was when, according to Thompson, &quot;social history truly came into being, with historians reflecting on their aristocratic and middle-class preoccupations, their veneration of elites (especially Great Men), their Protestant moralising and misanthropic tendencies&quot;.

==The definition of social history==

There are many definitions of social history, most of them isolated to national historiographies. The most consequential definition of social history is the one Thompson provided. Thompson saw his &quot;history from below&quot; approach as an attempt to reveal the &quot;social nexus&quot; through which broadscale change occurs. This is reflective of his historical materialism. However, Thompson&#x27;s 1963 book was disproportionately concerned with the lived experience of forgotten or everyday people. The disparity between a society-wide approach (historical materialism) and the narrower preoccupation with giving voice to the voicesless (justice-seeking) is the basis of present-day confusion about the definition of social history. The confusion arose from Thompson&#x27;s own inner political turmoil. Staughton Lynd sees Thompson&#x27;s career as a gradual departure from Marxism until, in his last interview, he declined to describe himself as a Marxist. Where Thompson had said he did not believe in &quot;theory with a capital T&quot; and Marxism, Lynd shows that Thompson&#x27;s departure was actually much more gradual, beginning with the 1956 Hungarian Uprising. The highly influential, but confused, definition used by Thompson was not resolved in part because of the cultural turn and the decline of Marxism on the left in the 1970s and 1980s.

===British and Irish social history===

Social history is associated in the United Kingdom with the work of E. P. Thompson in particular, and his studies &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; and &quot;Whigs and Hunters: The Origin of the Black Act&quot;. Emerging after the second world war, it was consciously opposed to traditional history&#x27;s focus on &#x27;great men&#x27;, which it counter-posed with &#x27;History from below&#x27;.

Thus in the UK social history has often had a strong political impetus, and can be contrasted sharply with traditional history&#x27;s (partial) documentation of the exploits of the powerful, within limited diplomatic and political spheres, and its reliance on archival sources and methods (see historical method and archive) that exclude the voices of less powerful groups within society. Social history has used a much wider range of sources and methods than traditional history and source criticism, in order to gain a broader view of the past. Methods have often including quantitative data analysis and, importantly, oral history which creates an opportunity to glean perspectives and experiences of those people within society that are unlikely to be documented within archives. Eric Hobsbawm was an important UK social historian, who has both produced extensive social history of the UK, and has written also on the theory and politics of UK social history. Hobsbawn and E. P. Thompson were both involved in the pioneering History Workshop Journal and Past &amp; Present.

Ireland has its own historiography.

===American social history===

In United States historiography, history from below is referred to as &quot;history from the bottom-up&quot; and is closely related to &quot;peoples history&quot;, associated in popular consciousness with Howard Zinn and his 1980 book, A People&#x27;s History of the United States. Charles Tilly argues the tasks of the social historian are 1) &quot;documenting large structural changes; 2) reconstructing the experiences of ordinary people in the course of those changes; and (3) connecting the two&quot;. Americanist Paul E. Johnson recalls the heady early promise of the movement in the late 1960s:
:The New Social History reached UCLA at about that time, and I was trained as a quantitative social science historian. I learned that &quot;literary&quot; evidence and the kinds of history that could be written from it were inherently elitist and untrustworthy. Our cousins, the Annalistes, talked of ignoring heroes and events and reconstructing the more constitutive and enduring &quot;background&quot; of history. Such history could be made only with quantifiable sources. The result would be a &quot;History from the Bottom Up&quot; that ultimately engulfed traditional history and, somehow, helped to make a Better World. Much of this was acted out with mad-scientist bravado. One well-known quantifier said that anyone who did not know statistics at least through multiple regression should not hold a job in a history department. My own advisor told us that he wanted history to become &quot;a predictive social science.&quot; I never went that far. I was drawn to the new social history by its democratic inclusiveness as much as by its system and precision. I wanted to write the history of ordinary people—to historicize them, put them into the social structures and long-term trends that shaped their lives, and at the same time resurrect what they said and did. In the late 1960s, quantitative social history looked like the best way to do that.

The Social Science History Association was formed in 1976 to bring together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history. It is still active and publishes &quot;Social Science History&quot; quarterly. The field is also the specialty of the &quot;Journal of Social History&quot;, edited since 1967 by Peter Stearns It covers such topics as gender relations; race in American history; the history of personal relationships; consumerism; sexuality; the social history of politics; crime and punishment, and history of the senses. Most of the major historical journals have coverage as well. However, after 1990 social history was increasingly challenged by cultural history, which emphasizes language and the importance of beliefs and assumptions and their causal role in group behavior.

===France===

Social history has dominated French historiography since the 1920s, thanks to the central role of the Annales School. Its journal &quot;Annales&quot; focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

===Germany===

Social history developed within the West German discipline of history during the 1950s-60s as the successor to national history, which was discredited in the aftermath of National Socialism. The German brand of the &quot;history of society&quot; – &quot;Gesellschaftsgeschichte&quot; – has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. Modernization theory was presented by Hans-Ulrich Wehler (1931–2014) and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform &quot;traditional&quot; German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few &quot;great men,&quot; into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of Max Weber and concepts from Karl Marx, Otto Hintze, Gustav Schmoller, Werner Sombart and Thorstein Veblen.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, German historians of society, led by Wehler and Jürgen Kocka of the &quot;Bielefeld School&quot;, gained dominance in Germany by applying both modernization theories and social science methods. From the 1980s, however, they were increasingly criticized by proponents of the &quot;cultural turn&quot; for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (analogously with Marx&#x27;s inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems involved in the positions criticized were not resolved, but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted in a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted in a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted in modern causal explanation.

Jürgen Kocka finds two meanings to &quot;social history.&quot; At the simplest level, it was the subdivision of history that focused on social structures and processes. In that regard, it stood in contrast to political or economic history. The second meaning was broader, and the Germans called it &quot;Gesellschaftsgeschichte&quot;. It is the history of an entire society from a social-historical viewpoint. The English historian G. M. Trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, &quot;[w]ithout social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible.&quot; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as &quot;history with the people put back in.&quot;

In Germany the &quot;Gesellschaftsgeschichte&quot; movement introduced a vast range of topics, as Kocka, a leader of the Bielefeld School recalls:
:In the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;social history&quot; caught the imagination of a young generation of historians. It became a central concept – and a rallying point – of historical revisionism. It meant many things at the same time. It gave priority to the study of particular kinds of phenomena, such as classes and movements, urbanization and industrialization, family and education, work and leisure, mobility, inequality, conflicts and revolutions. It stressed structures and processes over actors and events. It emphasized analytical approaches close to the social sciences rather than by the traditional methods of historical hermeneutics. Social historians frequently sympathized with the causes (as they saw them) of the &quot;little people&quot;, the underdog, popular movements, or the working class. Social history was both demanded and rejected as a vigorous revisionist alternative to the more established modes of history studies, in which the reconstruction of politics and ideas, the history of events and hermeneutic methods traditionally dominated.

===Hungarian social history===
Before World War II, political history was in decline and an effort was made to introduce social history in the style of the French Annales School. After the war only Marxist interpretations were allowed. With the end of Communism in Hungary in 1989. Marxist historiography collapsed and social history came into its own, especially the study of the demographic patterns of the early modern period. Research priorities have shifted toward urban history and the conditions of everyday life.

===Soviet Union and social history===
When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, large parts of the Soviet archives were opened. The historians&#x27; data base leapt from a limited range of sources to a vast array of records created by modern bureaucracies. Social history flourished.

===Canadian social history===

Social history had a &quot;golden age&quot; in Canada in the 1970s, and continues to flourish among scholars. Its strengths include demography, women, labour, and urban studies.

===Social history of Africa===
Events of Africa&#x27;s general social history since the twentieth century refer to the colonial era for most of the countries with the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia, which were never colonized. Major processes in the continent involve resistance, independence, reconstruction, self-rule, and the process of modern politics including the formation of the African Union. Post-colonial milestones towards stability, economic growth, and unity have been made with continuous developments. Natural phenomena and subsequent economic effects have been more pronounced, for example in Ethiopia, followed by ethnic-based social crises and violence in the twenty-first century — that led to the mass migration of youth and skilled workers. Political and economic stability with respect to measures taken by international donor groups such as sanctions and subsequent responses from various nationals to such measures and Pan-Africanism are other dimensions of Africa&#x27;s social history.

===Australian social history===

In Australia, social history took on a non-Marxist concern for revealing the lives of people who had previously been neglected by older generations of historians. The two most significant social historians of Australian historiography, Ann Curthoys and Humphrey McQueen have both identified a lack of interest in social history among scholars compared with other national historiographies and a general non-Marxist, a-theoretical approach to social history among Australian social historians. Scholars generally see the first application of social history as McQueen&#x27;s &quot;A New Britannia&quot; (1970), although some believe Russel Ward&#x27;s &quot;The Australian Legend&quot; (1958) may have been a prototype new social history.

==Subfields==

===Historical demography===

The study of the lives of ordinary people was revolutionized in the 1960s by the introduction of sophisticated quantitative and demographic methods, often using individual data from the census and from local registers of births, marriages, deaths and taxes, as well as theoretical models from sociology such as social mobility. H-DEMOG is a daily email discussion group that covers the field broadly.

Historical demography is the study of population history and demographic processes, usually using census or similar statistical data. It became an important specialty inside social history, with strong connections with the larger field of demography, as in the study of the Demographic Transition.

===African-American history===
Black history or African-American history studies African Americans and Africans in American history. The Association for the Study of African American Life and History was founded by Carter G. Woodson in 1915 and has 2500 members and publishes the &quot;Journal of African American History,&quot; formerly the &quot;Journal of Negro History.&quot; Since 1926 it has sponsored Black History Month every February.

===Ethnic history===
Ethnic history is especially important in the US and Canada, where major encyclopedias helped define the field. It covers the history of ethnic groups (usually not including Black or Native Americans).
Typical approaches include critical ethnic studies; comparative ethnic studies; critical race studies; Asian-American, and Latino/a or Chicano/a studies. In recent years Chicano/Chicana studies has become important as the Hispanic population has become the largest minority in the US.

* The Immigration and Ethnic History Society was formed in 1976 and publishes a journal for libraries and its 829 members.

* The Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society was founded in May 1977, publishes the &quot;Journal of the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society&quot;.

===Labor history===

Labor history, deals with labor unions and the social history of workers. See for example Labor history of the United States The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000. It publishes &quot;International Labor and Working-Class History&quot;. H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students. the Labor and Working-Class History Association formed in 1988 and publishes &quot;.&quot;

Kirk (2010) surveys labour historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labour history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labour, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labour historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics. Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.

===Women&#x27;s history===
Women&#x27;s history exploded into prominence in the 1970s, and is now well represented in every geographical topic; increasingly it includes gender history. Social history uses the approach of women&#x27;s history to understand the experiences of ordinary women, as opposed to &quot;Great Women,&quot; in the past. Feminist women&#x27;s historians such as Joan Kelly have critiqued early studies of social history for being too focused on the male experience.

===Gender history===
Gender history focuses on the categories, discourses and experiences of femininity and masculinity as they develop over time. Gender history gained prominence after it was conceptualized in 1986 by Joan W. Scott in her article &quot;Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis.&quot; Many social historians use Scott&#x27;s concept of &quot;perceived differences&quot; to study how gender relations in the past have unfolded and continue to unfold. In keeping with the cultural turn, many social historians are also gender historians who study how discourses interact with everyday experiences.

===History of the family===

The History of the family emerged as a separate field in the 1970s, with close ties to anthropology and sociology. The trend was especially pronounced in the US and Canada. It emphasizes demographic patterns and public policy, but is quite separate from genealogy, though often drawing on the same primary sources, such as censuses and family records.

The influential pioneering study &quot;Women, Work, and Family&quot; (1978) was done by Louise A. Tilly and Joan W. Scott. It broke new ground with their broad interpretive framework and emphasis on the variable factors shaping women&#x27;s place in the family and economy in France and England. The study considered the interaction of production, or traditional labor, and reproduction, the work of caring for children and families, in its analysis of women&#x27;s wage labor and thus helped to bring together labor and family history. Much work has been done on the dichotomy in women&#x27;s lives between the private sphere and the public. For a recent worldwide overview covering 7000 years see Maynes and Waltner&#x27;s 2012 book and ebook, &quot;The Family: A World History&quot; (2012). For comprehensive coverage of the American case, see Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong, eds. &quot;The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia&quot; (4 vol, 2014).

The history of childhood is a growing subfield.

===History of education===

For much of the 20th century, the dominant American historiography, as exemplified by Ellwood Patterson Cubberley (1868–1941) at Stanford, emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and a firm basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. It was a story of enlightenment and modernization triumphing over ignorance, cost-cutting, and narrow traditionalism whereby parents tried to block their children&#x27;s intellectual access to the wider world. Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic-minded community were the heroes. The textbooks help inspire students to become public schools teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.

The crisis came in the 1960s, when a new generation of New Left scholars and students rejected the traditional celebratory accounts, and identified the educational system as the villain for many of America&#x27;s weaknesses, failures, and crimes. Michael Katz (1939–2014) states they:
:tried to explain the origins of the Vietnam War; the persistence of racism and segregation; the distribution of power among gender and classes; intractable poverty and the decay of cities; and the failure of social institutions and policies designed to deal with mental illness, crime, delinquency, and education.

The old guard fought back and bitter historiographical contests, with the younger students and scholars largely promoting the proposition that schools were not the solution to America&#x27;s ills, they were in part the cause of Americans problems. The fierce battles of the 1960s died out by the 1990s, but enrollment in education history courses never recovered.

By the 1980s, compromise had been worked out, with all sides focusing on the heavily bureaucratic nature of the American public schooling.

In recent years most histories of education deal with institutions or focus on the ideas histories of major reformers, but a new social history has recently emerged, focused on who were the students in terms of social background and social mobility. In the US attention has often focused on minority and ethnic students. In Britain, Raftery et al. (2007) looks at the historiography on social change and education in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with particular reference to 19th-century schooling. They developed distinctive systems of schooling in the 19th century that reflected not only their relationship to England but also significant contemporaneous economic and social change. This article seeks to create a basis for comparative work by identifying research that has treated this period, offering brief analytical commentaries on some key works, discussing developments in educational historiography, and pointing to lacunae in research.

Historians have recently looked at the relationship between schooling and urban growth by studying educational institutions as agents in class formation, relating urban schooling to changes in the shape of cities, linking urbanization with social reform movements, and examining the material conditions affecting child life and the relationship between schools and other agencies that socialize the young.

The most economics-minded historians have sought to relate education to changes in the quality of labor, productivity and economic growth, and rates of return on investment in education. A major recent exemplar is Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, &quot;The Race between Education and Technology&quot; (2009), on the social and economic history of 20th-century American schooling.

===Urban history===

The &quot;new urban history&quot; emerged in the 1950s in Britain and in the 1960s in the US. It looked at the &quot;city as process&quot; and, often using quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites. A major early study was Stephan Thernstrom&#x27;s &quot;Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City&quot; (1964), which used census records to study Newburyport, Massachusetts, 1850–1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources, &quot;bottom-up&quot; history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups. Other exemplars of the new urban history included Kathleen Conzen, &quot;Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860&quot; (1976); Alan Dawley, &quot;Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn&quot; (1975; 2nd ed. 2000); Michael B. Katz, &quot;The People of Hamilton, Canada West&quot; (1976); Eric H. Monkkonen, &quot;The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865&quot; (1975); and Michael P. Weber, &quot;Social Change in an Industrial Town: Patterns of Progress in Warren, Pennsylvania, From Civil War to World War I.&quot; (1976).

Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, &quot;The European City&quot; (1993); Christopher R. Friedrichs, &quot;The Early Modern City, 1450-1750&quot; (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. &quot;Edo and Paris&quot; (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women&#x27;s roles have proven useful. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as &quot;agents&quot; who shape the direction of urbanization. The subfield has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.

===Rural history===

Agricultural history handles the economic and technological dimensions, while rural history handles the social dimension. Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of modern English rural history and identifies an &quot;orthodox&quot; school, focused on the economic history of agriculture. This historiography has made impressive progress in quantifying and explaining the output and productivity achievements of English farming since the &quot;agricultural revolution.&quot; The celebratory style of the orthodox school was challenged by a dissident tradition emphasizing the social costs of agricultural progress, notably inclosure, which removed much common resource and lead to riots for some 300 years. Recently, a new school, associated with the journal &quot;Rural History,&quot; has broken away from this narrative of agricultural change, elaborating a wider social history. The work of Alun Howkins has been pivotal in the recent historiography, in relation to these three traditions. Howkins, like his precursors, is constrained by an increasingly anachronistic equation of the countryside with agriculture. Geographers and sociologists have developed a concept of a &quot;post-productivist&quot; countryside, dominated by consumption and representation that may have something to offer historians, in conjunction with the well-established historiography of the &quot;rural idyll.&quot; Most American rural history has focused on the American South—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a &quot;new rural history&quot; of the North as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the &quot;women&#x27;s sphere.&quot; These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.

===Religion===

The historiography of religion focuses mostly on theology and church organization and development. Recently the study of the social history or religious behavior and belief has become important.

==Political history==
While the study of elites and political institutions has produced a vast body of scholarship, the impact after 1960 of social historians has shifted emphasis onto the politics of ordinary people—especially voters and collective movements. Political historians responded with the &quot;new political history,&quot; which has shifted attention to political cultures. Some scholars have recently applied a cultural approach to political history. Some political historians complain that social historians are likely to put too much stress on the dimensions of class, gender and race, reflecting a leftist political agenda that assumes outsiders in politics are more interesting than the actual decision makers.

Social history, with its leftist political origins, initially sought to link state power to everyday experience in the 1960s. Yet by the 1970s, social historians increasingly excluded analyses of state power from its focus. Social historians have recently engaged with political history through studies of the relationships between state formation, power and everyday life with the theoretical tools of cultural hegemony and governmentality.

<text>A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance where participants fast as an act of political protest, usually with the objective of achieving a specific goal, such as a policy change. Hunger strikers that do not take fluids are named dry hunger strikers.

In cases where an entity (usually the state) has or is able to obtain custody of the hunger striker (such as a prisoner), the hunger strike is often terminated by the custodial entity through the use of force-feeding.

==Early history==
Fasting was used as a method of protesting injustice in pre-Christian Ireland, where it was known as &quot;Troscadh&quot; or &quot;Cealachan&quot;. Detailed in the contemporary civic codes, it had specific rules by which it could be used, and the fast was often carried out on the doorstep of the home of the offender. Scholars speculate that this was due to the high importance the culture placed on hospitality. Allowing a person to die at one&#x27;s doorstep, for a wrong of which one was accused, was considered a great dishonor. Others say that the practice was to fast for one whole night, as there is no evidence of people fasting to death in pre-Christian Ireland. The fasts were primarily undertaken to recover debts or get justice for a perceived wrong. Legends of Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, have used the hunger strike as well.

In India, the practice of a hunger protest, where the protester fasts at the door of an offending party (typically a debtor) in a public call for justice, was abolished by the government in 1861; this indicates the prevalence of the practice prior to that date, or at least a public awareness of it.

==Medical view==
In the first three days, the body still uses energy from glucose. After that, the liver starts processing body fat, in a process called ketosis. After depleting fat, the body enters a &quot;starvation mode&quot;. At this point the body &quot;mines&quot; the muscles and vital organs for energy, and loss of bone marrow becomes life-threatening. There are examples of hunger strikers dying after 46 to 73 days of strike, for example the 1981 Irish hunger strike. Hunger strikers can experience hallucinations and delirium. Death usually occurs when a hunger striker has lost about 40–50% of their pre-strike weight at about 60–70 days in. Obese individuals can last longer.

==Examples==
===British and American suffragettes===
In the early 20th century suffragettes frequently endured hunger strikes in British prisons. Marion Dunlop was the first in 1909. She was released, as the authorities did not want her to become a martyr. Other suffragettes in prison also undertook hunger strikes. The prison authorities subjected them to force-feeding, which the suffragettes categorized as a form of torture. Emmeline Pankhurst&#x27;s sister Mary Clarke died shortly after being force-fed in prison, and others including Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton are believed to have had serious health problems caused by force feeding, dying of a heart attack not long after. William Ball, a working class supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, was the subject of a pamphlet &quot;Torture in an English Prison&quot; not only due to the effects of force-feeding, but a cruel separation from family contact and mental health deterioration, secret transfer to a lunatic asylum and needed lifelong mental institutional care. In December 1912, a Scottish prison put four suffragettes in the &#x27;political prisoner&#x27; category rather than &#x27;criminal&#x27; second division, but staff at Craiginches Prison, Aberdeen still subjected them to force-feeding when they went on hunger strike.

In 1913 the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913 (nicknamed the &quot;Cat and Mouse Act&quot;) changed policy. Hunger strikes were tolerated but prisoners were released when they became sick. When they had recovered, the suffragettes were taken back to prison to finish their sentences. About 100 women received medals for hunger striking or enduring force-feeding.

Like their British counterparts, American suffragettes also used this method of political protest. A few years before the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a group of American suffragettes led by Alice Paul engaged in a hunger strike and endured forced feedings while incarcerated at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia.

===Ireland===

Hunger strikes have deep roots in Irish society and in the Irish psyche. Fasting in order to bring attention to an injustice which one felt under his lord, and thus shame him, was a common feature of early Irish society and this tactic was fully incorporated into the Brehon legal system. The tradition is ultimately most likely part of the still older Indo-European tradition of which the Irish were part. Within the 20th century a total of 22 Irish republicans died on hunger strike with survivors suffering long-term health and psychological effects.

The tactic was used by physical force republicans during the 1916–23 revolutionary period. Early use of hunger strikes was countered with force-feeding, culminating in 1917 in the death of Thomas Ashe in Mountjoy Prison. During the Anglo-Irish war, in October 1920, the Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, died on hunger strike in Brixton prison. At the same time, the 1920 Cork hunger strike took place. Two other Cork Irish Republican Army (IRA) men, Joe Murphy and Michael Fitzgerald, died in this protest. Demanding reinstatement of political status and release from prison, nine men undertook a hunger strike at Cork County Gaol for 94 days, from August 11 to November 12, 1920. Arthur Griffith called off the strikes after the deaths of MacSwiney, Murphy and Fitzgerald.

During the early 1920s, the vessel was used as a prison ship for the holding of Irish republicans by the British. Conditions on board were &quot;unbelievable&quot; and there were several hunger strikes, including one involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923.

====Irish hunger strikes between 1923 and 1976====

In February 1923, 23 women (members of Cumann na mBan) went on hunger strike for 34 days over the arrest and imprisonment without trial of Irish republican prisoners. The Free State subsequently released the women republican prisoners. Most of the male republicans were not released until the following year. After the end of the Irish Civil War in October 1923, up to 8,000 IRA prisoners went on hunger strike to protest their continued detention by the Irish Free State (a total of over 12,000 republicans had been interned by May 1923). Three men, Denny Barry, Joseph Whitty, and Andy O&#x27;Sullivan, died during the 1923 Irish Hunger Strikes. The strike, however, was called off by Republican leadership in the camps (November 23, 1923) before any more deaths occurred.

Under de Valera&#x27;s first Fianna Fáil government in 1932, military pensions were awarded to dependants of republicans who died in 1920s hunger strikes on the same basis as those who were killed in action. During the state of emergency of World War II another De Valera government interned many IRA members, three of whom died on hunger strike: Sean McCaughey, Tony D&#x27;Arcy and Jack McNeela. Hundreds of others carried out shorter hunger strikes during the de Valera years.

The tactic was revived by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the early 1970s, when several republicans successfully used hunger strikes to get themselves released from custody without charge in the Republic of Ireland. Michael Gaughan died after being force-fed in Parkhurst Prison in 1974. Frank Stagg, an IRA member being held in Wakefield Prison, died in 1976 after a 62-day hunger strike which he began as a campaign to be repatriated to Ireland.

Members of other movements like Holger Meins of German Red Army Fraction used hunger strikes as a political weapon at this time. Meins went on hunger strike for the first time in 1973 together with other prisoners in protest against the prison conditions. The RAF prisoners wanted to be pooled together and claimed prisoner of war status. The 1.83m tall Meins still weighed 39 kg in November 1973 and died in prison.

====Irish hunger strike of 1981====
In 1980, seven Irish Republican prisoners, six from the IRA and one from the Irish National Liberation Army, in the Maze Prison launched a hunger strike as a protest against the revocation by the British Government of a prisoner-of-war-like Special Category Status for paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland. The strike, led by Brendan Hughes, was called off before any deaths, when the British government seemed to offer to concede their demands; however, the British Government then reneged on the details of the agreement. The prisoners then called another hunger strike the following year. This time, instead of many prisoners striking at the same time, the hunger strikers started fasting one after the other in order to maximise publicity over the fate of each one.

Bobby Sands was the first of ten Irish republican paramilitary prisoners to die after 66 days during the 1981 hunger strike, with Mickey Devine being the last to die after 60 days. There was widespread sympathy for the hunger strikers from Irish republicans and the broader nationalist community on both sides of the Irish border. Sands was elected as an MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone to the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Commons and two other prisoners, Paddy Agnew (who was not a hunger striker) and Kieran Doherty, were elected to Dáil Éireann in the Republic of Ireland by electorates who wished to register their opposition to the British Government&#x27;s policy. The ten men survived without food for 46 to 73 days, taking only water and salt, before succumbing. After the deaths of the men and severe public disorder, the British Government granted partial concessions to the prisoners, and the strike was called off. The hunger strikes gave a significant propaganda boost to a previously severely demoralised IRA.

===Gandhi and Bhagat Singh===


Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned in 1908, 1909, 1913, 1917, 1919, 1922, 1930, 1932, 1933, and 1942. Because of Gandhi&#x27;s stature around the world, British authorities were loath to allow him to die in their custody; Gandhi engaged in several famous hunger strikes to protest British rule in India.

In addition to Gandhi, various others used the hunger strike option during the Indian independence movement, including Jatin Das, who fasted to death, and Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt in 1929

===Potti Sriramulu===
In 1952, in independent India, revolutionary Potti Sriramulu undertook a hunger strike for 56 days in an attempt to achieve the formation of a separate state, to be known as Andhra State. His death on December 15 became instrumental in the linguistic re-organisation of states.

He is revered as &quot;Amarajeevi&quot; (Immortal being) in Coastal Andra for his role in achieving the linguistic re-organisation of states. As a devout follower of Mahatma Gandhi, he worked for much of his life to uphold principles such as truth, non-violence and patriotism, as well as causes such as Harijan movement to end the traditional alienation of, and accord respect and humane treatment to those traditionally called &quot;untouchables&quot; in Indian society.

===Cuban dissidents===
On April 3, 1972, Pedro Luis Boitel, an imprisoned poet and dissident, declared himself on hunger strike. After 53 days on hunger strike, receiving only liquids, he died of starvation on May 25, 1972. His last days were related by his close friend, poet Armando Valladares. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cólon Cemetery in Havana. 

Guillermo Fariñas did a seven-month hunger strike to protest against the extensive Internet censorship in Cuba. He ended it in Autumn 2006, with severe health problems although still conscious. Reporters Without Borders awarded its cyber-freedom prize to Guillermo Fariñas in 2006.

Jorge Luis García Pérez (known as Antúnez) has done hunger strikes. In 2009, following the end of his 17-year imprisonment, Antúnez, his wife Iris, and Diosiris Santana Pérez started a hunger strike to support other political prisoners. Leaders from Uruguay, Costa Rica, and Argentina declared their support for Antúnez.

On February 23, 2010, Orlando Zapata, a dissident arrested in 2003 as part of a crackdown on opposition groups, died in a hospital while undertaking a hunger strike that had been ongoing for 85 days. His hunger strike was a protest against poor prison conditions. Amnesty International had declared him a prisoner of conscience.

=== Mongolian Democracy Movement ===
During pro-democracy demonstrations in 1990 youth activists carried out a hunger strike in Ulan Bator&#x27;s central Sukhbaatar Square from March 7 onwards. The public nature of the action plus the fact it was held in freezing conditions gained much public attention and place pressure upon the government.

=== Hazara Refugees ===
Rather than process their claims within its own country, from 2001 to 2008 the Australian federal government moved and detained up to 1200 refugees at a time on Nauru. The majority of these were Hazara people, who faced persecution in Afghanistan. Beginning on 10 December 10, 2003 detainees began a hunger strike, which within a fortnight came to involve forty people. Timed to coincide with World Human Rights Day the protest brought much international attention to the plight of the refugees and their demand to be resettled, despite the Australian government initially refusing to acknowledge or comment on the matter.

==Legal situation==
Article 8 of the 1975 World Medical Association Declaration of Tokyo states that doctors are not allowed to force-feed hunger strikers. They are supposed to understand the prisoner&#x27;s independent wishes, and it is recommended to have a second opinion as to the capability of the prisoner to understand the implication of their decision and be capable of informed consent.

:Where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the physician as capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgement concerning the consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment, they shall not be fed artificially. The decision as to the capacity of the prisoner to form such a judgement should be confirmed by at least one other independent physician. The consequences of the refusal of nourishment shall be explained by the physician to the prisoner.

The World Medical Association (WMA) recently revised and updated its Declaration of Malta on Hunger Strikers. Among many changes, it unambiguously states that force feeding is a form of inhumane and degrading treatment in its Article 21.

The American Medical Association (AMA) is a member of the WMA, but the AMA&#x27;s members are not bound by the WMA&#x27;s decisions, as neither organization has formal legal powers. The AMA has formally endorsed the WMA Declaration of Tokyo and has written several letters to the US government and made public statements in opposition to US physician involvement in force feeding of hunger strikers in contravention of medical ethics. The United States Code of Federal Regulations rule on hunger strikes by prisoners states, &quot;It is the responsibility of the Bureau of Prisons to monitor the health and welfare of individual inmates, and to ensure that procedures are pursued to preserve life.&quot; It further provides that when &quot;a medical necessity for immediate treatment of a life or health threatening situation exists, the physician may order that treatment be administered without the consent of the inmate.&quot;

<doc id="222294" wikidata="Q343960" url="?curid=222294" title="John Hinckley Jr.">
<text>John Warnock Hinckley Jr. (born May 29, 1955) is an American musician who attempted to assassinate U.S. president Ronald Reagan as he left the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., on March 30, 1981, two months after Reagan&#x27;s first inauguration. Using a revolver, Hinckley wounded Reagan, police officer Thomas Delahanty, Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy and White House Press Secretary James Brady. Brady was left disabled and died 33 years later from his injuries.

Hinckley was reportedly seeking fame to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he had a fixation after watching her in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and remained under institutional psychiatric care for over three decades. Public outcry over the verdict led state legislatures and Congress to narrow their respective insanity defenses.

In 2016, a federal judge ruled that Hinckley could be released from psychiatric care as he was no longer considered a threat to himself or others, albeit with many conditions. After 2020, a ruling was issued that Hinckley may showcase his artwork, writings, and music publicly under his own name, rather than anonymously as he had in the past. Since then, he has maintained a YouTube channel for his music. His restrictions were unconditionally lifted in June 2022.

==Early life==
John Warnock Hinckley Jr. was born in Ardmore, Oklahoma and moved with his wealthy family to Dallas, Texas at the age of four. His father was John Warnock Hinckley Sr. (1925–2008), founder, chairman, chief executive and president of the Vanderbilt Energy Corporation. His mother was Jo Ann Hinckley (née Moore; 1925–2021).

Hinckley grew up in University Park, Texas, and attended Highland Park High School in Dallas County. After Hinckley graduated from high school in 1973, his family, owners of the Hinckley oil company, moved to Evergreen, Colorado, where the new company headquarters was located. He was an off-and-on student at Texas Tech University from 1974 to 1980, but eventually dropped out. 

In 1975, Hinckley went to Los Angeles in the hope of becoming a songwriter. His efforts were unsuccessful, and he wrote to his parents with tales of misfortune and pleas for money. He spoke of a girlfriend, Lynn Collins, who turned out to be a fabrication. In September 1976, he returned to his parents&#x27; home in Evergreen. 

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hinckley began purchasing weapons and practicing with them. He was prescribed antidepressants and tranquilizers to deal with his emotional problems.

==Obsession with Jodie Foster==
Hinckley became obsessed with the 1976 film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, in which disturbed protagonist Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) plots to assassinate a presidential candidate. Bickle was partly based on the diaries of Arthur Bremer, who attempted to assassinate George Wallace. Hinckley developed an infatuation with Iris, a sexually trafficked 12-year-old child, played by Jodie Foster. Hinckley began to adopt the dress and mannerisms of the Travis Bickle character.
When Foster entered Yale University, Hinckley moved to New Haven, Connecticut for a short time to stalk her. His parents had given him funds to attend a writing course at Yale. He never enrolled in the course, but instead used the money to support himself while sending Foster love letters and romantic poems, and repeatedly calling and leaving her messages.

Failing to develop any meaningful contact with Foster, Hinckley fantasized about conducting an aircraft hijacking or killing himself in front of her to get her attention. Eventually, he settled on a scheme to impress her by assassinating the president, thinking that by achieving a place in history, he would appeal to her as an equal. Hinckley trailed President Jimmy Carter from state to state during his campaign for the 1980 United States presidential election and got to within 20 feet of him at a rally at Dayton, Ohio.

On October 9, 1980, Hinckley was in Nashville, Tennessee, on the same day Carter was visiting the city. Hinckley was arrested at Nashville International Airport while trying to board a flight to New York with handcuffs and three unloaded guns in his hand-luggage. The airport police handed him over to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. Hinckley&#x27;s guns and handcuffs were confiscated, and he was fined $50 plus court costs. He was released later the same day.

After Nashville, Hinckley flew to Dallas. On October 13, he bought more guns from a Dallas pawn shop. They included the .22 caliber Röhm RG-14 revolver he used five months later to attempt the assassination of Reagan. The $3,600 from his parents was now exhausted and he returned home penniless. He spent four months undergoing psychiatric treatment for depression, but his mental health did not improve. In 1981, he began to target the newly elected president Ronald Reagan. For this purpose, he collected material on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

==Ronald Reagan assassination attempt==


Hinckley arrived in Washington DC on March 29, 1981, after travelling by Greyhound bus from Los Angeles. He spent the night in a hotel. The following morning, he read President Reagan&#x27;s itinerary in a newspaper and discovered that later that day, Reagan was to be at the Hilton Hotel to address an AFL–CIO conference. Hinckley spent the morning composing a letter to Jodie Foster.
After finishing the letter, he took a taxi to the Hilton Hotel.

At 2:27 p.m. EST, Hinckley was among a crowd of several hundred outside the hotel. He was carrying his Röhm revolver. When Reagan emerged from the hotel, Hinckley shot all six of the bullets in the gun at Reagan. The first shot critically wounded press secretary James Brady. The second wounded police officer Thomas Delahanty. The third shot missed, but the fourth hit Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy, who was deliberately standing in the line-of-fire to shield Reagan. The fifth bullet struck the armoured glass of the presidential limousine. The sixth and last seriously wounded Reagan, when it ricocheted off the side of the limousine and hit him in the chest.

Alfred Antenucci, a Cleveland, Ohio, labor official who stood near Hinckley and saw him firing, hit Hinckley in the head and pulled him to the ground. Within two seconds, agent Dennis McCarthy (no relation to agent Timothy McCarthy) dove onto Hinckley, intent on protecting Hinckley, to avoid what happened to Lee Harvey Oswald, who was killed before he could be tried for the assassination of President Kennedy. Another Cleveland-area labor official, Frank J. McNamara, joined Antenucci and started punching Hinckley in the head, striking him so hard he drew blood.

As a result of the shooting, Brady endured a long recuperation period, remaining paralyzed on the left side of his body, until his death on August 4, 2014. Brady&#x27;s death was ruled a homicide 33 years after the shooting.

==Trial==
Hinckley was initially held at Marine Corps Base Quantico, where he met his defense lawyer Vincent J. Fuller. He was quickly moved to Federal Correctional Complex, Butner. For four months, he was interviewed by both prosecution and defense psychiatrists. During his incarceration he twice tried to kill himself, in May and November 1981.

At trial, the government emphasized Hinckley&#x27;s premeditation of the shooting: noting that he had purchased a gun, trailed President Reagan, traveled to Washington, D.C., left a note detailing his plan, selected particularly devastating ammunition, and fired six shots. The defense argued that Hinckley&#x27;s actions and his obsession with Foster indicated that he was legally insane. The trial was chiefly devoted to a battle of the psychiatric experts concerning Hinckley&#x27;s mental state. Because Hinckley was charged in federal court, the prosecution was required to prove his sanity beyond reasonable doubt.

For the defense, William T. Carpenter, who diagnosed Hinckley with schizophrenia, testified for three days, opining that Hinckley had amalgamated various personalities from fiction and real life—including Travis Bickle from &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and John Lennon. Carpenter concluded that Hinckley could not emotionally appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions because he was consumed by the prospect of a &quot;magical unification with Jodie Foster&quot;. David Bear testified that Hinckley&#x27;s actions followed &quot;the very opposite of logic&quot; and that Hinckley did not exhibit signs of malingering. Bear said that his opinion was in part supported by a CAT scan of Hinckley&#x27;s brain showing widened sulci, a feature Bear said was found in of persons with schizophrenia, but only two percent of non-schizophrenics. Similarly, Ernest Prelinger testified that, while Hinckley had an above-average IQ, his results on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were highly abnormal—specifically, Prelinger said that only one person out of a million with Hinckley&#x27;s score would not be suffering from serious mental illness.

For the prosecution, Park Dietz testified that he had diagnosed Hinckley with dysthymia and three types of personality disorders: narcissistic, schizoid, and mixed, with borderline, and passive-aggressive features. Dietz found that none of these illnesses rendered Hinckley legally insane. His report said that there was &quot;no evidence that [Hinckley] was so impaired that he could not appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law&quot;. Sally Johnson, a psychiatrist in the federal prison who interviewed Hinckley more than any other doctor, emphasized that Hinckley had planned the shooting and that he was preoccupied with being famous. Johnson said that Hinckley&#x27;s interest in Foster was no different than any young man&#x27;s interest in a movie star.

The insanity instruction provided to the Hinckley jurors was based on the American Law Institute&#x27;s Model Penal Code:
The jury deliberated for a total of 24 hours over the course of four days. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity to all his 13 charges on June 21, 1982.

===Aftermath===
Soon after his trial, Hinckley wrote that the shooting was &quot;the greatest love offering in the history of the world&quot; and was disappointed that Foster did not reciprocate his love. In 1985, Hinckley&#x27;s parents wrote &quot;Breaking Points&quot;, a book detailing their son&#x27;s mental condition.

On August 4, 2014, James Brady died. Because the medical examiner determined his death to be a result of the &quot;gunshot wound and consequences thereof&quot;, it was labeled a homicide. Hinckley did not face charges as a result of Brady&#x27;s death because he had been found not guilty of the original crime by reason of insanity. In addition, since Brady&#x27;s death occurred more than 33 years after the shooting, prosecution of Hinckley was barred under the year and a day law in effect in the District of Columbia at the time of the shooting.

====Effect on insanity defenses====
Before the Hinckley case, the insanity defense had been used in less than 2% of all American felony cases and was unsuccessful in almost 75% of those trials. Created in 1962, the Model Penal Code&#x27;s insanity test broadened the then-dominant M&#x27;Naghten test. By 1981, it was adopted in ten of the eleven federal circuits and a majority of the states. As a consequence of public outcry over the Hinckley verdict, the United States Congress and a number of states enacted legislation making the insanity defense more restrictive. Congress rejected the MPC test, and by 2006, only 14 states retained it. Eighty percent of insanity-defense reforms between 1978 and 1990 occurred shortly after the Hinckley verdict. In addition to restricting eligibility for the defense, many of these reforms shifted the burden of proof to the defendant.

For the first time, Congress passed a law stipulating the insanity test to be used in all federal criminal trials, the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984. The IDRA excised the Model Penal Code&#x27;s volitional element in favor of an exclusively cognitive test, affording the insanity defense to a defendant who can show that, &quot;at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts&quot;. At the state level, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, and Utah abolished the defense altogether.

Hinckley&#x27;s acquittal led to the popularization of the &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; (GBMI) verdict, typically used when a defendant&#x27;s mental illness did not result in sufficient impairment to warrant insanity. A defendant receiving a GBMI verdict generally receives an identical sentence to a defendant receiving a guilty verdict, but the designation allows for a medical evaluation and treatment. Studies have suggested that jurors often favor a GBMI verdict, considering it to be a compromise.

Changes in federal and some state rules of evidence laws have since excluded or restricted the use of testimony of an expert witness, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, regarding conclusions on &quot;ultimate&quot; issues in insanity defense cases, including whether a criminal defendant is legally &quot;insane&quot;, but this is not the rule in most states.

==Treatment==

Hinckley was confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. After Hinckley was admitted, tests found that he was an &quot;unpredictably dangerous&quot; man who might harm himself or any third party. In 1983, he told &quot;Penthouse&quot; that on a normal day he would &quot;see a therapist, answer mail, play guitar, listen to music, play pool, watch television, eat lousy food and take delicious medication&quot;.

Around 1986, Hinckley and the hospital began seeking various conditional releases, which required judicial authorization. The Reagan family frequently spoke out against these requests. In 1986, a judge denied Hinckley&#x27;s request to be transferred to a less restrictive ward. In 1987, the hospital requested that Hinckley be given a 12-hour unescorted pass, allowing Hinckley to visit his parents on Easter. Glenn Miller, who had performed the initial evaluation of Hinckley, testified, &quot;I do not believe he&#x27;s suicidal, I do not believe he&#x27;s a danger to Jodie Foster, I do not believe he&#x27;s a danger to Mr. Reagan or Mr. Brady.&quot;

But Miller also revealed that Hinckley had written to serial killer Ted Bundy, sought the address of Charles Manson, and received a letter from Manson family member Lynette Fromme. The hospital subsequently withdrew the request for &quot;administrative&quot; reasons, though it emphasized that the &quot;clinical&quot; assessment was unchanged. In 1992, Hinckley again submitted a request for additional privileges, but he later withdrew that request. During this period, St. Elizabeths gradually expanded Hinckley&#x27;s privileges, by allowing off-site trips under custodial supervision.

In 2003, Hinckley, for the first time, received judicial approval for a release proposal: six local day visits under the supervision of his parents and, upon the successful completion and evaluation of those day visits, two local overnight visits under parental supervision. On June 17, 2009, Judge Friedman ruled that Hinckley would be permitted to visit his mother for a dozen visits of 10 days at a time, rather than six, to spend more time outside of the hospital, and to have a driver&#x27;s license. The court ordered that Hinckley be required to carry a GPS-enabled cell phone to track him whenever he was outside of his parents&#x27; home. He was prohibited from speaking with the news media. Prosecutors objected to this ruling, saying that Hinckley was still a danger to others and had unhealthy and inappropriate thoughts about women. Hinckley had recorded a song, &quot;Ballad of an Outlaw&quot;, which the prosecutors claimed was &quot;reflecting suicide and lawlessness&quot;.

On March 29, 2011, the day before the 30th anniversary of the assassination attempt, Hinckley&#x27;s attorney filed a court petition requesting more freedom for his client, including additional unsupervised visits to the Virginia home of Hinckley&#x27;s mother, Jo Ann. On November 30, 2011, a hearing in Washington was held to consider whether he could live full-time outside the hospital. The Justice Department opposed this, stating that Hinckley still poses a danger to the public. Justice Department counsel argued that Hinckley had been known to deceive his doctors in the past. By December 2013, the court ordered that visits be extended to his mother, who lives near Williamsburg. Hinckley was permitted up to eight 17-day visits, with evaluation after the completion of each one.

===Release and later activities===
On July 27, 2016, a federal judge ruled that Hinckley could be released from St. Elizabeths on August 5, as he was no longer considered a threat to himself or others. Patti Davis, one of Reagan&#x27;s daughters, and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump both denounced Hinckley&#x27;s release.

Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, with many conditions—including that he was required to live full-time at his mother&#x27;s home in Williamsburg, Virginia, to work at least three days a week and record his browser history. He was also prohibited from a variety of activities, including contacting the Reagan, Brady, or Foster families; watching or listening to violent media; accessing pornography; and speaking to the press. In November 2018, Judge Friedman ruled Hinckley could move out of his mother&#x27;s house in Virginia and live on his own, upon location approval from his doctors.

In September 2019, Hinckley&#x27;s attorney stated that he planned to ask for full, unconditional release from the court orders that determined how he could live by the end of 2019. On September 27, 2021, a federal judge approved Hinckley for unconditional release, beginning June 2022. Michael Reagan, Reagan&#x27;s son, spoke out in favor of the decision, while Davis again denounced it. On June 15, 2022, Hinckley was fully released from court restrictions. In a June 2022 interview with CBS, Hinckley expressed remorse for his actions, and apologized to the Reagan and Brady families, as well as Jodie Foster.

On July 17, 2024, following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Hinckley tweeted, &quot;Violence is not the way to go. Give peace a chance.&quot;

==Depiction in media==

Phoenix, Arizona hardcore punk band Jodie Foster&#x27;s Army (JFA) formed in 1981 and their name was a reference to the assassination attempt. Their eponymous song referred to Hinckley. Ohio new wave band Devo recorded the song &quot;I Desire&quot; for their fifth studio album, &quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot; (1982), which brought the band controversy because the lyrics were taken directly from a poem written by Hinckley. Hinckley has claimed that he has not received royalties for the use of his poem by them.

In 1984, Lansing, Michigan hardcore band the Crucifucks recorded &quot;Hinkley Had a Vision&quot;, which expressed a desire to kill the president. Another new wave band, Wall of Voodoo, released a song about Hinckley and his life titled &quot;Far Side of Crazy&quot; (1985), with the name also being a quotation from his poetry. Singer-songwriter Carmaig de Forest devoted a verse of his song &quot;Hey Judas&quot; to Hinckley, blaming him for Reagan&#x27;s increased popularity following the assassination attempt.

Hinckley is featured as a character of the Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman musical &quot;Assassins&quot; (1990), in which he and Lynette Fromme sing &quot;Unworthy of Your Love&quot;, a duet about their respective obsessions with Foster and Charles Manson. Hinckley&#x27;s life leading up to the assassination attempt is fictionalized in the 2015 novel &quot;Calf&quot; by Andrea Kleine. The novel includes a fictionalization of Hinckley&#x27;s former girlfriend, Leslie deVeau, whom he met at St. Elizabeths Hospital.

Hinckley is portrayed by Steven Flynn in the 1991 American television film &quot;Without Warning: The James Brady Story&quot;. Hinckley appears as a character in the 2001 television film &quot;The Day Reagan Was Shot&quot;, portrayed by Christian Lloyd. He was portrayed by Kevin Woodhouse in the 2003 television film &quot;The Reagans&quot;. Hinckley is portrayed by Kyle S. More in the 2016 movie &quot;Killing Reagan&quot;. In the 2018 TV series &quot;Timeless&quot;, he is portrayed by Erik Stocklin. Hinckley is portrayed by Lauden Baker in the 2024 film &quot;Reagan&quot;.

A skit on the sketch comedy show &quot;The Whitest Kids U&#x27; Know&quot; that satirized the presidency of Ronald Reagan depicted a fictionalized version of Hinckley.

Transgressive punk rock singer GG Allin was arrested by the US Secret Service in Illinois in September 1989 after he corresponded with Hinckley and they discovered he had an outstanding arrest warrant for assault in Michigan.

==Songwriting, performance, and art==
As a young adult, Hinckley made unsuccessful efforts to become a songwriter. Years later, he posted music online anonymously but received little interest. In October 2020, a federal court ruled that Hinckley may showcase and market his artwork, writings, and music publicly under his own name, but his treatment team could rescind the display privilege. Hinckley created a YouTube channel where, since December 2020, he has posted videos of himself performing original songs with a guitar and covers of songs such as &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; by Bob Dylan, and the Elvis Presley song &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;. His subscribers totaled over 41,000 by February 2025.

On June 6, 2021, Hinckley stated in a YouTube video that he was working on an album and looking for a record label to release it. Hinckley announced in December 2021 that the album would be released in early 2022 on Emporia Records, a label he founded to &quot;[release] the music of others, music that needs to be heard&quot;.

On October 7, 2021, Hinckley self-published his first single called &quot;We Have Got That Chemistry&quot; onto streaming platforms.

On November 10, 2021, Hinckley self-published another single called &quot;You Let Whiskey Do Your Talking&quot; onto multiple streaming platforms. Hinckley has also continued to release other original songs on his YouTube channel.

In January 2022, Hinckley announced that he was looking for members for his own band.

On June 15, 2022, after his restrictions were unconditionally lifted, it was announced that what would have been Hinckley&#x27;s first live performance in front of a physically present audience at a Brooklyn, New York venue had been canceled over security concerns for &quot;vulnerable communities&quot; after it had received threats. Three other planned concerts that summer, in Chicago, Hamden, Connecticut, and Williamsburg, Virginia were cancelled because of threats to the venues. In July 2022 Asbestos Records decided to release some of Hinckley&#x27;s songs on vinyl later that year. The album was released on July 12, 2023.

Following his release, Hinckley took up painting, using his pet cat as a reference. As of May 2023, he had sold several pieces on eBay.

In December 2024, Hinckley announced he would open a music store in Williamsburg, Virginia, but these plans were quickly scrapped by Hinckley due to negative publicity and security concerns.

<doc id="222297" wikidata="Q2916173" url="?curid=222297" title="Tropic hormone">
<text>Tropic hormones are hormones that have other endocrine glands as their target. Most tropic hormones are produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus secretes tropic hormones that target the anterior pituitary, and the thyroid gland secretes thyroxine, which targets the hypothalamus and therefore can be considered a tropic hormone.

The term &quot;&quot; is from Ancient Greek (&quot;tropikós&quot;), in the sense &quot;of or pertaining to a turn or change&quot;, meaning &quot;causing a change, affecting&quot;; this is the same origin as &quot;tropic&quot; and &quot;trope.&quot; This should not be confused with &quot;,&quot; as in similar-sounding trophic hormone – the words and concepts are both unrelated. Tropic hormones are contrasted with non-tropic hormones, which directly stimulate target cells.

==Examples==

===Anterior pituitary===
Tropic hormones from the anterior pituitary include:

*Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) – stimulates the thyroid gland to make and release thyroid hormone.
*Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH or corticotropin) – stimulates the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids.
*Luteinizing hormone (LH) – stimulates the release of steroid hormones in gonads—the ovary and testes.
*Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) – stimulates the maturation of eggs and production of sperm.

===Hypothalamus===
In turn, the hypothalamus controls the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary by secreting a class of hypothalamic neurohormones called releasing and release-inhibiting hormones—which are released to the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system and act on the anterior pituitary.

*Non-tropic hormone
*Trophic hormone

<text>Human vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin, is a hormone synthesized from the &quot;AVP&quot; gene as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and is converted to AVP. It then travels down the axon terminating in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure.

A third function is possible. Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus, and may play an important role in social behavior, sexual motivation and pair bonding, and maternal responses to stress.

Vasopressin induces differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promotes heart muscle homeostasis.

It has a very short half-life, between 16 and 24 minutes.

==Physiology==
===Function===
Vasopressin regulates the tonicity of body fluids. It is released from the posterior pituitary in response to hypertonicity and causes the kidneys to reabsorb solute-free water and return it to the circulation from the tubules of the nephron, thus returning the tonicity of the body fluids toward normal. An incidental consequence of this renal reabsorption of water is concentrated urine and reduced urine volume. AVP released in high concentrations may also raise blood pressure by inducing moderate vasoconstriction.

AVP also may have a variety of neurological effects on the brain. It may influence pair-bonding in voles. The high-density distributions of vasopressin receptor AVPr1a in prairie vole ventral forebrain regions have been shown to facilitate and coordinate reward circuits during partner preference formation, critical for pair bond formation.

A very similar substance, &quot;lysine vasopressin&quot; (LVP) or lypressin, has the same function in pigs and its synthetic version was used in human AVP deficiency, although it has been largely replaced by desmopressin.

====Kidney====
Vasopressin has three main effects which are:

# Increasing the water permeability of distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting tubules (CCT), as well as outer and inner medullary collecting duct (OMCD &amp; IMCD) in the kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption and excretion of more concentrated urine, i.e., antidiuresis. This occurs through increased transcription and insertion of water channels (Aquaporin-2) into the apical membrane of collecting tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores. Vasopressin, acting through cAMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells.
# Increasing permeability of the inner medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the medullary interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct.
# Acute increase of sodium absorption across the ascending loop of Henle. This adds to the countercurrent multiplication which aids in proper water reabsorption later in the distal tubule and collecting duct.

The hormone vasopressin also stimulates the activity of NKCC2. Vasopressin stimulates sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the nephron by activating signaling pathways. Vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate.

====Central nervous system====

Vasopressin released within the brain may have several actions:
* Vasopressin is released into the brain in a circadian rhythm by neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
* Vasopressin released from posterior pituitary is associated with nausea.
* Recent evidence suggests that vasopressin may have analgesic effects. The analgesia effects of vasopressin were found to be dependent on both stress and sex.

===Regulation===
==== Gene regulation ====
Vasopressin is regulated by &quot;AVP&quot; gene expression which is managed by major clock controlled genes. In this circadian circuit known as the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL), Per2 protein accumulates and is phosphorylated by CK1E. Per2 subsequently inhibits the transcription factors Clock and BMAL1 in order to reduce Per2 protein levels in the cell. At the same time, Per2 also inhibits the transcription factors for the &quot;AVP&quot; gene in order to regulate its expression, the expression of vasopressin, and other &quot;AVP&quot; gene products.

Many factors influence the secretion of vasopressin:
* Ethanol (alcohol) reduces the calcium-dependent secretion of AVP by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in neurohypophyseal nerve terminals in rats.
* Angiotensin II stimulates AVP secretion, in keeping with its general pressor and pro-volumic effects on the body.
* Atrial natriuretic peptide inhibits AVP secretion, in part by inhibiting Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of AVP secretion.
* Cortisol inhibits secretion of antidiuretic hormone.

===Production and secretion===
The physiological stimulus for secretion of vasopressin is increased osmolality of the plasma, monitored by the hypothalamus. A decreased arterial blood volume, (such as can occur in cirrhosis, nephrosis, and heart failure), stimulates secretion, even in the face of decreased osmolality of the plasma: it supersedes osmolality, but
with a milder effect. In other words, the unloading of arterial baroreceptors when the arterial blood volume is low stimulates vasopressin secretion despite the presence of hypoosmolality (hyponatremia).

The AVP that is measured in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the posterior pituitary gland (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood.

There are other sources of AVP, beyond the hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. For example, AVP is also synthesized by parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the PVN, transported and released at the median eminence, from which it travels through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates corticotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue).

=== Vasopressin during surgery and anaesthesia ===
Vasopressin concentration is used to measure surgical stress for evaluation of surgical techniques. Plasma vasopressin concentration is elevated by noxious stimuli, predominantly during abdominal surgery, especially at gut manipulation, traction of viscera, as well as abdominal insufflation with carbon dioxide during laparoscopic surgery.

=== Receptors ===

Types of AVP receptors and their actions:

===Structure and relation to oxytocin===

The vasopressins are peptides consisting of nine amino acids (nonapeptides). The amino acid sequence of arginine vasopressin (argipressin) is Cys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, with the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond and the &quot;C&quot;-terminus of the sequence converted to a primary amide. Lysine vasopressin (lypressin) has a lysine in place of the arginine as the eighth amino acid, and is found in pigs and some related animals, whereas arginine vasopressin is found in humans.

The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of the vasopressins: It is also a nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge and its amino acid sequence differs at only two positions. The two genes are located on the same chromosome separated by a relatively small distance of less than 15,000 bases in most species. The magnocellular neurons that secrete vasopressin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that secrete oxytocin, and are similar in many respects. The similarity of the two peptides can cause some cross-reactions: oxytocin has a slight antidiuretic function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions.

==Medical use==

Vasopressin is used to manage anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. Vasopressin is used to treat diabetes insipidus related to low levels of antidiuretic hormone. It is available as Pressyn.

Vasopressin has off-label uses and is used in the treatment of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.

Vasopressin agonists are used therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin is used in conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, as well as for control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970.

Vasopressin infusions are also used as second line therapy for septic shock patients not responding to fluid resuscitation or infusions of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine) to increase the blood pressure while sparing the use of catecholamines. These argipressins have much shorter elimination half-life (around 20 minutes) comparing to synthetic non-arginine vasopresines with much longer elimination half-life of many hours. Further, argipressins act on V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors which consequently lead to higher eGFR and lower vascular resistance in the lungs. A number of injectable arginine vasopressins are currently in clinical use in the United States and in Europe.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Vasopressin is administered through an intravenous device, intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection. The duration of action depends on the mode of administration and ranges from thirty minutes to two hours. It has a half life of ten to twenty minutes. It is widely distributed throughout the body and remains in the extracellular fluid. It is degraded by the liver and excreted through the kidneys. Arginin vasopressins for use in septic shock are intended for intravenous use only.

=== Side effects ===
The most common side effects during treatment with vasopressin are dizziness, angina, chest pain, abdominal cramps, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, trembling, fever, water intoxication, pounding sensation in the head, diarrhoea, sweating, paleness, and flatulence. The most severe adverse reactions are myocardial infarction and hypersensitivity.

===Contraindications===
The use of lysine vasopressin is contraindicated in the presence of hypersensitivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic kidney failure. It is recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of perioperative polyuria, sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease.

===Interactions===
* alcohol - may lower the antidiuretic effect
* carbamazepine, chloropropamide, clofibrate, tricyclic antidepressants and fludrocortisone may raise the antidiuretic effect
* lithium, demeclocycline, heparin or norepinephrine may lower the antidiuretic effect
* vasopressor effect may be higher with the concurrent use of ganglionic blocking medications

===Deficiency===
Decreased AVP release (neurogenic — i.e. due to alcohol intoxication or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), polyuria (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst).

===Excess===


Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH) in turn can be caused by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs have been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists.

==History==
Vasopressin was elucidated and synthesized for the first time by Vincent du Vigneaud.

== Animal studies ==
Evidence for an effect of AVP on monogamy vs polygamy comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin receptors in the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and polygamous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared.

== Human studies ==
Vasopressin has shown nootropic effects on pain perception and cognitive function. Vasopressin also plays a role in autism, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

* Atrial natriuretic peptide: When the atrium stretches, blood pressure is considered to be increased and sodium is excreted to lower blood pressure.
* Renin-angiotensin system: When the blood flow through the juxtaglomerular apparatus decreases, blood pressure is considered low, and the adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone to increase sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct, thereby increasing blood pressure.
* Bainbridge reflex: In response to stretching of the right atrium wall, heart rate increases, lowering venous blood pressure.
* Baroreflex: When the stretch receptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus increase, the blood pressure is considered to be elevated and the heart rate decreases to lower blood pressure.

<text>Oxytocin is a peptide hormone and neuropeptide normally produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. Present in animals since early stages of evolution, in humans it plays roles in behavior that include social bonding, love, reproduction, childbirth, and the period after childbirth. Oxytocin is released into the bloodstream as a hormone in response to sexual activity and during childbirth. It is also available in pharmaceutical form. In either form, oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions to speed up the process of childbirth. 

In its natural form, it also plays a role in maternal bonding and milk production. Production and secretion of oxytocin is controlled by a positive feedback mechanism, where its initial release stimulates production and release of further oxytocin. For example, when oxytocin is released during a contraction of the uterus at the start of childbirth, this stimulates production and release of more oxytocin and an increase in the intensity and frequency of contractions. This process compounds in intensity and frequency and continues until the triggering activity ceases. A similar process takes place during lactation and during sexual activity.

Oxytocin is derived by enzymatic splitting from the peptide precursor encoded by the human OXT gene. The deduced structure of the active nonapeptide is:

: Cys – Tyr – Ile – Gln – Asn – Cys – Pro – Leu – Gly – NH2, or CYIQNCPLG-NH2.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;oxytocin&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;ὠκυτόκος&quot; (&quot;ōkutókos&quot;), based on ὀξύς (oxús), meaning &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;swift&quot;, and τόκος (tókos), meaning &quot;childbirth&quot;. The adjective form is &quot;oxytocic&quot;, which refers to medicines which stimulate uterine contractions, to speed up the process of childbirth. Colloquially, it has been referred to as the &quot;cuddle hormone&quot; or the &quot;moral molecule&quot; which have been considered misnomers.

== History ==
The uterine-contracting properties of the principle that would later be named oxytocin were discovered by British pharmacologist Henry Hallett Dale in 1906, and its milk ejection property was described by Ott and Scott in 1910 and by Schafer and Mackenzie in 1911. In 1909 the first clinical use of oxytocin was performed by William Blair-Bell to induce childbirth in patients with complications.

By the 1920s, oxytocin and vasopressin had been isolated from pituitary tissue and given their current names. Oxytocin&#x27;s molecular structure was determined in 1952. In the early 1950s, American biochemist Vincent du Vigneaud found that oxytocin is made up of nine amino acids, and he identified its amino acid sequence, the first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced. In 1953, du Vigneaud carried out the synthesis of oxytocin, the first polypeptide hormone to be synthesized. Du Vigneaud was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1955 for his work. Further work on different synthetic routes for oxytocin, as well as the preparation of analogues of the hormone (&quot;e.g.&quot; 4-deamido-oxytocin) was performed in the following decade by Iphigenia Photaki.

==Biochemistry==
Estrogen has been found to increase the secretion of oxytocin and to increase the expression of its receptor, the oxytocin receptor, in the brain. In women, a single dose of estradiol has been found to be sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations.

===Biosynthesis===
Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones released by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. However, oxytocin neurons make other peptides, including corticotropin-releasing hormone and dynorphin, for example, that act locally. The magnocellular neurons that make oxytocin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that make vasopressin and are similar in many respects.

The oxytocin peptide is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein from the &quot;OXT&quot; gene. This precursor protein also includes the oxytocin carrier protein neurophysin I. The inactive precursor protein is progressively hydrolyzed into smaller fragments (one of which is neurophysin I) via a series of enzymes. The last hydrolysis that releases the active oxytocin nonapeptide is catalyzed by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM).

The activity of the PAM enzyme system is dependent upon vitamin C (ascorbate), which is a necessary vitamin cofactor. By chance, sodium ascorbate by itself was found to stimulate the production of oxytocin from ovarian tissue over a range of concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Many of the same tissues (&quot;e.g.&quot; ovaries, testes, eyes, adrenals, placenta, thymus, pancreas) where PAM (and oxytocin by default) is found are also known to store higher concentrations of vitamin C.

Oxytocin is known to be metabolized by the oxytocinase, leucyl/cystinyl aminopeptidase. Other oxytocinases are also known to exist. Amastatin, bestatin (ubenimex), leupeptin, and puromycin have been found to inhibit the enzymatic degradation of oxytocin, though they also inhibit the degradation of various other peptides, such as vasopressin, met-enkephalin, and dynorphin A.

===Neural sources===
In the hypothalamus, oxytocin is made in magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is stored in Herring bodies at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) of the pituitary gland. These axons (likely, but dendrites have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate neurons in the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure where oxytocin receptors are expressed. The endocrine effects of hormonal oxytocin, and the cognitive or behavioral effects of oxytocin neuropeptides are thought to be coordinated through its common release through these collaterals. Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project to other parts of the brain and to the spinal cord. Depending on the species, oxytocin receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.

In the pituitary gland, oxytocin is packaged in large, dense-core vesicles, where it is bound to neurophysin I as shown in the inset of the figure; neurophysin is a large peptide fragment of the larger precursor protein molecule from which oxytocin is derived by enzymatic cleavage.

Secretion of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve endings is regulated by the electrical activity of the oxytocin cells in the hypothalamus. These cells generate action potentials that propagate down axons to the nerve endings in the pituitary; the endings contain large numbers of oxytocin-containing vesicles, which are released by exocytosis when the nerve terminals are depolarised.

===Non-neural sources===
Endogenous oxytocin concentrations in the brain have been found to be as much as 1000-fold higher than peripheral levels. Outside the brain, oxytocin-containing cells have been identified in several diverse tissues, including in females in the corpus luteum and the placenta; in males in the testicles&#x27; interstitial cells of Leydig; and in both sexes in the retina, the adrenal medulla, the thymus and the pancreas. The finding of significant amounts of this classically &quot;neurohypophysial&quot; hormone outside the central nervous system raises many questions regarding its possible importance in these diverse tissues.

The Leydig cells in some species have been shown to possess the biosynthetic machinery to manufacture testicular oxytocin &quot;de novo&quot;, to be specific, in rats (which can synthesize vitamin C endogenously), and in guinea pigs, which, like humans, require an exogenous source of vitamin C in their diets. Oxytocin is synthesized by corpora lutea of several species, including ruminants and primates. Along with estrogen, it is involved in inducing the endometrial synthesis of prostaglandin F2α to cause regression of the corpus luteum.

===Evolution===
Virtually all vertebrates have an oxytocin-like nonapeptide hormone that supports reproductive functions and a vasopressin-like nonapeptide hormone involved in water regulation. The two genes are usually located close to each other (less than 15,000 bases apart) on the same chromosome, and are transcribed in opposite directions (however, in fugu, the homologs are further apart and transcribed in the same direction). The two genes are believed to result from a gene duplication event; the ancestral gene is estimated to be about 500 million years old and is found in cyclostomata (modern members of the Agnatha).

A 2023 study found that zebrafish utilize oxytocin in reaction to the fear of other fish. It found that zebrafish that have had oxytocin production removed by gene editing cannot respond to the fear of other fish. When oxytocin is injected back into the fish, they react again in a way that suggests they may have empathy in regards to this emotion. Furthermore, because the same regions of the brain are involved as in mammals, the study suggests oxytocin-based empathy may have evolved from a common ancestor many millions of years ago.

==Biological function==
Oxytocin has peripheral (hormonal) actions and also has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor, OT-R, which requires magnesium and cholesterol and is expressed in myometrial cells. It belongs to the rhodopsin-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors.

Studies have looked at oxytocin&#x27;s role in various behaviors, including orgasm, social recognition, pair bonding, anxiety, in-group bias, situational lack of honesty, autism, and maternal behaviors. Oxytocin is believed to have a significant role in social learning. There are indicators that oxytocin may help to decrease noise in the brain&#x27;s auditory system, increase perception of social cues and support more targeted social behavior. It may also enhance reward responses. However, its effects may be influenced by context, such as the presence of familiar or unfamiliar individuals. In addition to its oxytocin receptor agonism, oxytocin has been found to act as a PAM of the μ- and κ-opioid receptors and this may be involved in its analgesic effects.

===Physiological===
The peripheral actions of oxytocin mainly reflect secretion from the pituitary gland. The behavioral effects of oxytocin are thought to reflect release from centrally projecting oxytocin neurons, different from those that project to the pituitary gland, or that are collaterals from them. Oxytocin receptors are expressed by neurons in many parts of the brain and spinal cord, including the amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamus, septum, nucleus accumbens, and brainstem, although the distribution differs markedly between species. Furthermore, the distribution of these receptors changes during development and has been observed to change after parturition in the montane vole.

* Milk ejection reflex/Letdown reflex: in lactating (breastfeeding) mothers, oxytocin acts at the mammary glands, causing milk to be &#x27;let down&#x27; into lactiferous ducts, from where it can be excreted via the nipple. Suckling by the infant at the nipple is relayed by spinal nerves to the hypothalamus. The stimulation causes neurons that make oxytocin to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve terminals of the pituitary gland.
* Uterine contraction: important for cervical dilation before birth, oxytocin causes contractions during the second and third stages of labor. Oxytocin release during breastfeeding causes mild but often painful contractions during the first few weeks of lactation. This also serves to assist the uterus in clotting the placental attachment point postpartum. However, in knockout mice lacking the oxytocin receptor, reproductive behavior and birth are normal.
*In male rats, oxytocin may induce erections. A burst of oxytocin is released during ejaculation in several species, including human males; its suggested function is to stimulate contractions of the reproductive tract, aiding sperm release.
* Human sexual response: Oxytocin levels in plasma rise during sexual stimulation and orgasm. At least two uncontrolled studies have found increases in plasma oxytocin at orgasm in both men and women. Plasma oxytocin levels are increased around the time of self-stimulated orgasm and are still higher than baseline when measured five minutes after self arousal. The authors of one of these studies speculated that oxytocin&#x27;s effects on muscle contractibility may facilitate sperm and egg transport.
:In a study measuring oxytocin serum levels in women before and after sexual stimulation, the author suggests it serves an important role in sexual arousal. This study found genital tract stimulation resulted in increased oxytocin immediately after orgasm. Another study reported increases of oxytocin during sexual arousal could be in response to nipple/areola, genital, and/or genital tract stimulation as confirmed in other mammals. Murphy et al. (1987), studying men, found that plasma oxytocin levels remain unchanged during sexual arousal, but that levels increase sharply after ejaculation, returning to baseline levels within 30 minutes. In contrast, vasopressin was increased during arousal but returned to baseline at the time of ejaculation. The study concludes that (in males) vasopressin is secreted during arousal, while oxytocin is only secreted after ejaculation. A more recent study of men found an increase in plasma oxytocin immediately after orgasm, but only in a portion of their sample that did not reach statistical significance. The authors noted these changes &quot;may simply reflect contractile properties on reproductive tissue&quot;.
* Due to its similarity to vasopressin, it can reduce the excretion of urine slightly, and so it can be classified as an antidiuretic. In several species, oxytocin can stimulate sodium excretion from the kidneys (natriuresis), and in humans high doses can result in low sodium levels (hyponatremia).
* Cardiac effects: oxytocin and oxytocin receptors are also found in the heart in some rodents, and the hormone may play a role in the embryonal development of the heart by promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation. However, the absence of either oxytocin or its receptor in knockout mice has not been reported to produce cardiac insufficiencies.
* Modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity: oxytocin, under certain circumstances, indirectly inhibits release of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol and, in those situations, may be considered an antagonist of vasopressin.
* Preparing fetal neurons for delivery (in rats): crossing the placenta, maternal oxytocin reaches the fetal brain and induces a switch in the action of neurotransmitter GABA from excitatory to inhibitory on fetal cortical neurons. This silences the fetal brain for the period of delivery and reduces its vulnerability to hypoxic damage.
*Feeding: a 2012 paper suggested that oxytocin neurons in the para-ventricular hypothalamus in the brain may play a key role in suppressing appetite under normal conditions and that other hypothalamic neurons may trigger eating via inhibition of these oxytocin neurons. This population of oxytocin neurons is absent in Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that leads to uncontrollable feeding and obesity, and may play a key role in its pathophysiology. Research on the oxytocin-related neuropeptide asterotocin in starfish also showed that in echinoderms, the chemical induces muscle relaxation, and in starfish specifically caused the organisms to evert their stomach and react as though feeding on prey, even when none were present.

===Psychological===
* Autism: Oxytocin has been implicated in the etiology of autism, with one report suggesting autism is correlated to a mutation on the oxytocin receptor gene (&quot;OXTR&quot;). Studies involving Caucasian, Finnish and Chinese Han families provide support for the relationship of &quot;OXTR&quot; with autism. Autism may also be associated with an aberrant methylation of &quot;OXTR&quot;. However, evidence has shown that intranasal administration is likely insufficient to produce behavioural effects and it could be explained by publication bias and selective outcome reporting, impacting reproducibility of results. In addition, current discussion has challenged the intervention and stated that neurodivergent perspectives need to be considered, with focus being primarily on animal models, which have a lack of translational validity due to autism&#x27;s complex social and communicative dimensions.
* Protection of brain functions: Studies in rats have demonstrated that nasal application of oxytocin can alleviate impaired learning capabilities caused by restrained stress. The authors attributed this effect to an improved hippocampal response in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) being observed. Accordingly, oxytocin has been shown to promote neural growth in the hippocampus in rats even during swim stress or glucocorticoid administration. In a mouse model of early onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s, the administration of oxytocin by a gel particularly designed to make the peptide accessible for the brain, the cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy of these mice were delayed. Moreover, the amyloid β-protein deposit and nerve cell apoptosis were retarded. An observed inhibitory impact by oxytocin on the inflammatory activity of the microglia was proposed to be an important factor.

====Bonding====

In the prairie vole, oxytocin released into the brain of the female during sexual activity is important for forming a pair bond with her sexual partner. Vasopressin appears to have a similar effect in males. Oxytocin has a role in social behaviors in many species, so it likely also does in humans. In a 2003 study, both humans and dog oxytocin levels in the blood rose after a five to 24 minute petting session. This possibly plays a role in the emotional bonding between humans and dogs.
* Maternal behavior: Female rats given oxytocin antagonists after giving birth do not exhibit typical maternal behavior. By contrast, virgin female sheep show maternal behavior toward foreign lambs upon cerebrospinal fluid infusion of oxytocin, which they would not do otherwise. Oxytocin is involved in the initiation of human maternal behavior, not its maintenance; for example, it is higher in mothers after they interact with unfamiliar children rather than their own.
*Human ingroup bonding: Oxytocin can increase positive attitudes, such as bonding, toward individuals classified as &quot;in-group&quot; members, whereas other individuals become classified as &quot;out-group&quot; members. Oxytocin has also been implicated in lying when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of dishonesty in the participants&#x27; responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected. Both of these examples show the tendency of individuals to act in ways that benefit those considered to be members of their social group, or in-group.
* Decreased oxytocin &amp; receptor expression has been associated with aggressive behavior in aggressive-impulsive disorders. 

Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual&#x27;s attachment to the conflict. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals. These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics. Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one&#x27;s entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners. People also show more affection for their country&#x27;s flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin. It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in xenophobic tendencies secondary to this effect. Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific &quot;home&quot; country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.

====Drugs====
* Drug interaction: According to several studies in animals, oxytocin inhibits the development of tolerance to various addictive drugs (opiates, cocaine, alcohol), and reduces withdrawal symptoms. MDMA (ecstasy) may increase feelings of love, empathy, and connection to others by stimulating oxytocin activity primarily via activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, if initial studies in animals apply to humans. The anxiolytic drug buspirone may produce some of its effects via 5-HT1A receptor-induced oxytocin stimulation as well.
* Addiction vulnerability: Concentrations of endogenous oxytocin can impact the effects of various drugs and one&#x27;s susceptibility to substance use disorders, with higher concentrations associated with lower susceptibility. The status of the endogenous oxytocin system can enhance or reduce susceptibility to addiction through its bidirectional interaction with numerous systems, including the dopamine system, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the immune system. Individual differences in the endogenous oxytocin system based on genetic predisposition, gender and environmental influences, may therefore affect addiction vulnerability. Oxytocin may be related to the place conditioning behaviors observed in habitual drug abusers.

====Fear and anxiety====
Oxytocin is typically remembered for the effect it has on prosocial behaviors, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. However, oxytocin has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that oxytocin modulates fear and anxiety; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety. Two dominant theories explain the role of oxytocin in fear and anxiety. One theory states that oxytocin increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that oxytocin increases the salience of certain social stimuli, causing animals (including humans) to pay closer attention to socially relevant stimuli.

Nasally administered oxytocin has been reported to reduce fear, possibly by inhibiting the amygdala (which is thought to be responsible for fear responses). Indeed, studies in rodents have shown oxytocin can efficiently inhibit fear responses by activating an inhibitory circuit within the amygdala. Some researchers have argued oxytocin has a general enhancing effect on all social emotions, since intranasal administration of oxytocin also increases envy and &quot;Schadenfreude&quot;. Individuals who receive an intranasal dose of oxytocin identify facial expressions of disgust more quickly than individuals who do not receive oxytocin. Facial expressions of disgust are evolutionarily linked to the idea of contagion. Thus, oxytocin increases the salience of cues that imply contamination, which leads to a faster response because these cues are especially relevant for survival. In another study, after administration of oxytocin, individuals displayed an enhanced ability to recognize expressions of fear compared to the individuals who received the placebo. Oxytocin modulates fear responses by enhancing the maintenance of social memories. Rats who are genetically modified to have a surplus of oxytocin receptors display a greater fear response to a previously conditioned stressor. Oxytocin enhances the aversive social memory, leading the rat to display a greater fear response when the aversive stimulus is encountered again.

====Mood and depression====
Oxytocin produces antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression, and a deficit of it may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression in humans. The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor. In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail suspension test. In contrast to WAY-267,464, carbetocin, a close analogue of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.

Oxytocin mediates the antidepressant-like effects of sexual activity. A drug for sexual dysfunction, sildenafil enhances electrically evoked oxytocin release from the pituitary gland. In accordance, it may have promise as an antidepressant.

==== Sex differences====
It has been shown that oxytocin differentially affects males and females. Females who are administered oxytocin are overall faster in responding to socially relevant stimuli than males who received oxytocin. Additionally, after the administration of oxytocin, females show increased amygdala activity in response to threatening scenes; however, males do not show increased amygdala activation. This phenomenon can be explained by looking at the role of gonadal hormones, specifically estrogen, which modulate the enhanced threat processing seen in females. Estrogen has been shown to stimulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus and promote receptor binding in the amygdala.

It has also been shown that testosterone directly suppresses oxytocin in mice. This has been hypothesized to have evolutionary significance. With oxytocin suppressed, activities such as hunting and attacking invaders would be less mentally difficult as oxytocin is strongly associated with empathy.

====Social====
Because oxytocin plays a role in social bonding, maternal behaviors and emotional connections between people, it is also informally referred to as the &quot;love hormone&quot;. This term is not a medical or scientific name but is often used to describe oxytocin&#x27;s effects on human behavior and emotions.
* Affecting generosity by increasing empathy during perspective taking: In a neuroeconomics experiment, intranasal oxytocin increased generosity in the Ultimatum Game by 80%, but had no effect in the Dictator Game that measures altruism. Perspective-taking is not required in the Dictator Game, but the researchers in this experiment explicitly induced perspective-taking in the Ultimatum Game by not identifying to participants into which role they would be placed. Serious methodological questions have arisen, however, with regard to the role of oxytocin in trust and generosity. Empathy in healthy males has been shown to be increased after intranasal oxytocin This is most likely due to the effect of oxytocin in enhancing eye gaze. There is some discussion about which aspect of empathy oxytocin might alter – for example, cognitive vs. emotional empathy. While studying wild chimpanzees, it was noted that after a chimpanzee shared food with a non-kin related chimpanzee, the subjects&#x27; levels of oxytocin increased, as measured through their urine. In comparison to other cooperative activities between chimpanzees that were monitored including grooming, food sharing generated higher levels of oxytocin. This comparatively higher level of oxytocin after food sharing parallels the increased level of oxytocin in nursing mothers, sharing nutrients with their kin. 
* Trust is increased by oxytocin. Study found that with the oxytocin nasal spray, people place more trust to strangers in handling their money. Disclosure of emotional events is a sign of trust in humans. When recounting a negative event, humans who receive intranasal oxytocin share more emotional details and stories with more emotional significance. Humans also find faces more trustworthy after receiving intranasal oxytocin. In a study, participants who received intranasal oxytocin viewed photographs of human faces with neutral expressions and found them to be more trustworthy than those who did not receive oxytocin. This may be because oxytocin reduces the fear of social betrayal in humans. Even after experiencing social alienation by being excluded from a conversation, humans who received oxytocin scored higher in trust on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. Moreover, in a risky investment game, experimental subjects given nasally administered oxytocin displayed &quot;the highest level of trust&quot; twice as often as the control group. Subjects who were told they were interacting with a computer showed no such reaction, leading to the conclusion that oxytocin was not merely affecting risk aversion. When there is a reason to be distrustful, such as experiencing betrayal, differing reactions are associated with oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) differences. Those with the CT haplotype experience a stronger reaction, in the form of anger, to betrayal.
* Romantic attachment: In some studies, high levels of plasma oxytocin have been correlated with romantic attachment. For example, if a couple is separated for a long period of time, anxiety can increase due to the lack of physical affection. Oxytocin may aid romantically attached couples by increasing feelings of anxiety during separation.
*Group-serving dishonesty/deception: In a carefully controlled study exploring the biological roots of immoral behavior, oxytocin was shown to promote dishonesty when the outcome favored the group to which an individual belonged instead of just the individual.
* Oxytocin affects social distance between adult males and females, and may be responsible at least in part for romantic attraction and subsequent monogamous pair bonding. An oxytocin nasal spray caused men in a monogamous relationship, but not single men, to increase the distance between themselves and an attractive woman during a first encounter by 10 to 15 centimeters. The researchers suggested that oxytocin may help promote fidelity within monogamous relationships. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;bonding hormone&quot;. There is some evidence that oxytocin promotes ethnocentric behavior, incorporating the trust and empathy of in-groups with their suspicion and rejection of outsiders. Furthermore, genetic differences in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) have been associated with maladaptive social traits such as aggressive behavior.
* Social behavior and wound healing: Oxytocin is also thought to modulate inflammation by decreasing certain cytokines. Thus, the increased release in oxytocin following positive social interactions has the potential to improve wound healing. A study by Marazziti and colleagues used heterosexual couples to investigate this possibility. They found increases in plasma oxytocin following a social interaction were correlated with faster wound healing. They hypothesized this was due to oxytocin reducing inflammation, thus allowing the wound to heal more quickly. This study provides preliminary evidence that positive social interactions may directly influence aspects of health.
* According to a study published in 2014, silencing of oxytocin receptor interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of female mice resulted in loss of social interest in male mice during the sexually receptive phase of the estrous cycle. Oxytocin evokes feelings of contentment, reductions in anxiety, and feelings of calmness and security when in the company of the mate. This suggests oxytocin may be important for the inhibition of the brain regions associated with behavioral control, fear, and anxiety, thus allowing orgasm to occur. Research has also demonstrated that oxytocin can decrease anxiety and protect against stress, particularly in combination with social support. It is found that endocannabinoid signaling mediates oxytocin-driven social reward. During a 2008 study, a lack of oxytocin in mice was associated with abnormalities in emotional behavior. Another study conducted in 2014 saw similar results with a variation in the oxytocin receptor connected with dopamine transport and how levels of oxytocin are dependent on the levels of dopamine transporter levels. One study explored the effects of low levels of oxytocin and the other on possible explanation of what affects oxytocin receptors. As a lack of social skills and proper emotional behavior are common signs of Autism, low levels of oxytocin could become a new sign for individuals that fall into the Autism Spectrum.

==Chemistry==
Oxytocin is a peptide of nine amino acids (a nonapeptide) in the sequence cysteine-tyrosine-isoleucine-glutamine-asparagine-cysteine-proline-leucine-glycine-amide (Cys – Tyr – Ile – Gln – Asn – Cys – Pro – Leu – Gly – NH2, or CYIQNCPLG-NH2); its &quot;C&quot;-terminus has been converted to a primary amide and a disulfide bridge joins the cysteine moieties. Oxytocin has a molecular mass of 1007 Da, and one international unit (IU) of oxytocin is the equivalent of 1.68 μg of pure peptide.

While the structure of oxytocin is highly conserved in placental mammals, a novel structure of oxytocin was reported in 2011 in marmosets, tamarins, and other new world primates. Genomic sequencing of the gene for oxytocin revealed a single in-frame mutation (thymine for cytosine) which results in a single amino acid substitution at the 8-position (proline for leucine). Since this original Lee &quot;et al.&quot; paper, two other laboratories have confirmed Pro8-OT and documented additional oxytocin structural variants in this primate taxon. Vargas-Pinilla &quot;et al.&quot; sequenced the coding regions of the OXT gene in other genera in new world primates and identified the following variants in addition to Leu8- and Pro8-OT: Ala8-OT, Thr8-OT, and Val3/Pro8-OT. Ren &quot;et al.&quot; identified a variant further, Phe2-OT in howler monkeys.

Recent advances in analytical instrumental techniques highlighted the importance of liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) for measuring oxytocin levels in various samples derived from biological sources. Most of these studies optimized the oxytocin quantification in electrospray ionization (ESI) positive mode, using [M+H]+ as the parent ion at mass-to-charge ratio (&quot;m/z&quot;) 1007.4 and the fragment ions as diagnostic peaks at &quot;m/z&quot; 991.0, &quot;m/z&quot; 723.2 and &quot;m/z&quot; 504.2. These important ion selections paved the way for the development of current methods of oxytocin quantification using MS instrumentation.

The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of vasopressin. Both are nonapeptides with a single disulfide bridge, differing only by two substitutions in the amino acid sequence (differences from oxytocin bolded for clarity): Cys – Tyr – Phe – Gln – Asn – Cys – Pro – Arg – Gly – NH2. Oxytocin and vasopressin were isolated and their total synthesis reported in 1954, work for which Vincent du Vigneaud was awarded the 1955 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with the citation: &quot;for his work on biochemically important sulphur compounds, especially for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone.&quot;

Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones released by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. However, oxytocin neurons make other peptides, including corticotropin-releasing hormone and dynorphin, for example, that act locally. The magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make oxytocin are adjacent to magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make vasopressin. These are large neuroendocrine neurons which are excitable and can generate action potentials.

==In medicine==
Small-molecule oxytocin receptor agonists like LIT-001 may prove to be useful in the treatment of social deficits, for instance in autism.

<text>James Vincent Forrestal (February 15, 1892 – May 22, 1949) was the last cabinet-level United States secretary of the navy and the first United States secretary of defense.

Forrestal came from a very strict middle-class Irish Catholic family. He was a successful financier on Wall Street before becoming Undersecretary of the Navy in 1940, shortly before the United States entered the Second World War. He became Secretary of the Navy in May 1944 upon the death of his superior, Col. Frank Knox. President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested that Forrestal take the lead in building up the Navy. In 1947, after the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman appointed him the first secretary of the newly created Department of Defense. Forrestal was intensely hostile to the Soviet Union, fearing Communist expansion in Europe and the Middle East. Along with Secretary of State George C. Marshall, he strongly opposed the United States&#x27; support for the establishment of the State of Israel, fearing that this would alienate Arab nations which were needed as allies, and whose petroleum reserves were vital for both military and civilian industrial expansion.

Forrestal was a supporter of naval battle groups centered on aircraft carriers. He tried to weaken the proposed Department of Defense for the Navy&#x27;s benefit, but was hard-pressed to run it from 1947 to 1949 after Truman named him Secretary of Defense. The two men were often at odds, and Truman forced Forrestal&#x27;s resignation.

Thereafter, Forrestal&#x27;s mental health rapidly deteriorated, declining to the point in which he underwent medical care for depression. While a patient at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Forrestal died by an alleged suicide from fatal injuries sustained after falling out of a sixteenth-floor window.

In 1954, the USN&#x27;s new supercarrier was named in his honor, as is the James V. Forrestal Building, which houses the headquarters of the United States Department of Energy. He is the namesake of the Forrestal Lecture Series at the United States Naval Academy and of the James Forrestal Campus of his alma mater Princeton University.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Forrestal was born in Matteawan (now part of Beacon, New York), the youngest son of James Forrestal, an Irish immigrant who dabbled in politics. His mother, the former Mary Anne Toohey (herself the daughter of another Irish immigrant) raised him as a devout Catholic. During his youth, Forrestal was an amateur boxer. After graduating from high school in 1908, at the age of 16, he spent the next three years working for a trio of newspapers: the &quot;Matteawan Evening Journal&quot;, the &quot;Mount Vernon Argus&quot; and the &quot;Poughkeepsie News Press&quot;.

Forrestal entered Dartmouth College in 1911, but transferred to Princeton University in his sophomore year, where he served as an editor for &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;. His senior class voted him &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot;, but he left just prior to completing work on a degree. Forrestal was a member of University Cottage Club while he was a student at Princeton. Forrestal married the former Josephine Stovall (née Ogden), a &quot;Vogue&quot; writer, in 1926. She eventually developed a dependence on alcohol and suffered various mental health issues.

=== Wall Street financier ===
Forrestal went to work as a bond salesman for William A. Read and Company (later renamed Dillon, Read &amp; Co.) in 1916. When the US entered World War I, he enlisted in the Navy and ultimately became a Naval Aviator, training with the Royal Flying Corps at Camp Borden and Deseronto in Canada. During the final year of the war Forrestal spent much of his time in Washington, at the Office of Naval Operations, while completing his flight training and reaching the rank of lieutenant. After the war, Forrestal resumed his career in finance and made his fortune on Wall Street. He became a partner in 1923, was appointed vice president in 1926, and by 1937 was president of the company. He also acted as a publicist for the Democratic Party committee in Dutchess County, New York, helping politicians from the area win elections at both the local and state level. One of the individuals aided by his work was a neighbor, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Forrestal has been characterized 
as a compulsive workaholic and skilled administrator. Biographers have described him as pugnacious, introspective, shy, philosophic, solitary, and emotionally insecure. He took no part in national politics, though he usually voted for Democrats, but did not support New Deal liberalism.

===Political career===

====Secretary of the Navy====

President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Forrestal a special administrative assistant on June 22, 1940. Six weeks later, he nominated him for the newly established position, Undersecretary of the Navy. In his nearly four years as undersecretary, Forrestal proved highly effective at mobilizing domestic industrial production for the war effort. The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Ernest J. King, wanted to control logistics and procurement, but Forrestal prevailed.

In September 1942, to get a grasp on the reports for material his office was receiving, he made a tour of naval operations in the Southwest Pacific and a stop at Pearl Harbor. Returning to Washington, D.C., he made his report to Roosevelt, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the cabinet. In response to Forrestal&#x27;s elevated request that materiel be sent immediately to the Southwest Pacific area, Stimson (who was more concerned with supplying Operation Torch in North Africa), told Forrestal, &quot;Jim, you&#x27;ve got a bad case of localitis.&quot; Forrestal shot back in a heated manner, &quot;Mr. Secretary, if the Marines on Guadalcanal were wiped out, the reaction of the country will give you a bad case of localitis in the seat of your pants.&quot;

He became Secretary of the Navy on May 19, 1944, after his immediate superior, Secretary Frank Knox, died from a heart attack. Knox had been a figurehead as secretary and Forrestal was highly energetic. Forrestal led the Navy through the closing year of the war and the early years of demobilization that followed. Forrestal ordered that a Naval Court of Inquiry be convened to investigate the facts surrounding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and to assess any culpability borne by members of the Navy. The Court consisted of Admiral Adolphus Andrews; Admiral Orin G. Murfin, who served as President of the Court and Admiral Edward C. Kalbfus.

The court convened on July 24, 1944, and held daily sessions in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Pearl Harbor. After interviewing numerous witnesses, it completed its work on October 19, 1944. Its report to the Navy Department largely exonerated Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet at the time of the attack. The court found that Kimmel&#x27;s decisions had been correct given the limited information available to him, but criticized then-Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark for failing to warn Kimmel that war was imminent. The court concluded that &quot;based upon the facts established, the Court is of the opinion that no offenses have been committed nor serious blame incurred on the part of any person or persons in the naval service.&quot; Because the court&#x27;s findings implicitly revealed that American cryptographers had broken the Japanese codes, a critical wartime secret, the court&#x27;s report was not made public until after the end of the war.

Upon reviewing the report, Forrestal felt that the court had been too lenient in assigning blame for the disaster. The court had found that the Army and Navy had adequately cooperated in the defense of Pearl Harbor; that there had been no information indicating that Japanese carriers were on their way to attack Pearl Harbor; and that the attack had succeeded principally because of the aerial torpedo, a secret weapon whose use could not have been predicted. Forrestal disapproved all of these findings, judging that Kimmel could have done more with the information he had had to prevent or mitigate the attack. Forrestal concluded that both Kimmel and Stark had &quot;failed to demonstrate the superior judgment necessary for exercising command commensurate with their rank and their assigned duties.&quot;

As Secretary, Forrestal introduced a policy of racial integration in the Navy. Forrestal traveled to combat zones to see naval forces in action. He was in the South Pacific in 1942, present at the Battle of Kwajalein in 1944, and (as Secretary) witnessed the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. After five days of pitched battle, a detachment of Marines was sent to hoist the American flag on the 545-foot summit of Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima. This was the first time in the war that the U.S. flag had flown on Japanese soil. Forrestal, who had just landed on the beach, claimed the historic flag as a souvenir. When Forrestal witnessed the sight of the Stars and Stripes atop Mount Suribachi, he turned to Major General Holland Smith and said, &quot;the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.&quot; A second, larger flag was run up in its place, and this second flag-raising was the moment captured by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal in his famous photograph.

In the early months of 1945, Forrestal, along with Stimson and Under Secretary of State Joseph Grew, strongly advocated a softer policy toward Japan that would permit a negotiated armistice, a face-saving surrender. Forrestal&#x27;s primary concern was not the resurgence of a militarized Japan, but rather &quot;the menace of Russian Communism and its attraction for decimated, destabilized societies in Europe and Asia,&quot; and, therefore, keeping the Soviet Union out of the war with Japan. So strongly did he feel about this matter that he cultivated negotiation efforts that some regarded as approaching insubordination.

His counsel on ending the war was finally followed, but not until the atomic bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 10 August 1945, the day after the Nagasaki attack, the Japanese sent out a radio transmission saying that it was ready to accept the terms of the Allies&#x27; Potsdam Declaration, &quot;with the understanding that said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler.&quot; That position still fell short of the U.S. &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; demand, retaining the sticking point that had held up the war&#x27;s conclusion for months. Strong voices within the administration, including Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, counseled fighting on. At that point, &quot;Forrestal came up with a shrewd and simple solution: Accept the offer and declare that it accomplishes what the Potsdam Declaration demanded. Say that the Emperor and the Japanese government will rule subject to the orders of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. This would imply recognition of the Emperor while tending to neutralize American public passions against the Emperor. President Harry S. Truman liked this. It would be close enough to &#x27;unconditional&#x27;.&quot;

After the war, Forrestal urged Truman to take a hard line with the Soviets over Poland and other issues. In furtherance of the anti-Soviet position, he was the primary promoter of the famous &quot;long telegram&quot; by State Department official George Kennan. &quot;[Averell] Harriman thought Forrestal&#x27;s reaction [to the Kennan document] was a &#x27;decisive&#x27; catalyst in shaping American opinion on the issue.&quot; He also strongly influenced the new Wisconsin Senator, Joseph McCarthy, concerning infiltration of the government by Communists. Upon McCarthy&#x27;s arrival in Washington in December 1946, Forrestal invited him to lunch. In McCarthy&#x27;s words, &quot;Before meeting Jim Forrestal I thought we were losing to international Communism because of incompetence and stupidity on the part of our planners. I mentioned that to Forrestal. I shall forever remember his answer. He said, &#x27;McCarthy, consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If they were merely stupid, they would occasionally make a mistake in our favor.&#x27; This phrase struck me so forcefully that I have often used it since.&quot;

====Secretary of Defense====
In 1947, Truman appointed him the first United States Secretary of Defense. Forrestal continued to advocate for complete racial integration of the services, a policy eventually implemented in 1949.

During private cabinet meetings with Truman in 1946 and 1947, Forrestal had argued against partition of Palestine on the grounds it would infuriate Arab countries who supplied oil needed for the U.S. economy and national defense. Instead, Forrestal favored a federalization plan for Palestine. Outside the White House, response to Truman&#x27;s continued silence on the issue was immediate. Truman received threats to cut off campaign contributions from wealthy donors, as well as hate mail, including a letter accusing him of &quot;preferring fascist and Arab elements to the democracy-loving Jewish people of Palestine.&quot; Appalled by the intensity and implied threats over the partition question, Forrestal appealed to Truman in two separate cabinet meetings not to base his decision on partition, whatever the outcome, on the basis of political pressure. In his only known public comment on the issue, Forrestal stated to J. Howard McGrath, Senator from Rhode Island:

...no group in this country should be permitted to influence our policy to the point it could endanger our national security.

Forrestal&#x27;s statement soon earned him the active enmity of some congressmen and supporters of Israel. He was also an early target of the muckraking columnist and broadcaster Drew Pearson, an opponent of foreign policies hostile to the Soviet Union, who began to regularly call for Forrestal&#x27;s removal after Truman named him Secretary of Defense. Pearson told his own protege, Jack Anderson, that he believed Forrestal was &quot;the most dangerous man in America&quot; and claimed that if he was not removed from office, he would &quot;cause another world war&quot;.

Upon taking office as Secretary of Defense, Forrestal was surprised to learn that the administration did not budget for defense needs based on military threats posed by enemies of the United States and its interests. According to historian Walter LaFeber, Truman was known to approach defense budgetary requests in the abstract, without regard to defense response requirements in the event of conflicts with potential enemies. The president would begin by subtracting from total receipts the amount needed for domestic needs and recurrent operating costs, with any surplus going to the defense budget for that year. The Truman administration&#x27;s willingness to slash conventional readiness needs for the Navy and Marine Corps soon caused fierce controversies within the upper ranks of their respective branches.

During the Reagan years, Paul Nitze reflected upon the qualities which made a Secretary of Defense great: the ability to work with Congress, the ability for &quot;big-time management,&quot; and an ability at war planning. Nitze felt that Forrestal was the only one who possessed all three qualities together.

====Post-war====
At the close of World War II, millions of dollars of serviceable equipment had been scrapped or abandoned rather than having funds appropriated for its storage costs. New military equipment &quot;en route&quot; to operations in the Pacific theater was scrapped or simply tossed overboard. Facing the wholesale demobilization of most of the US defense force structure, Forrestal resisted Truman&#x27;s efforts to substantially reduce defense appropriations, but was unable to prevent a steady reduction in defense spending, resulting in major cuts not only in defense equipment stockpiles, but also in military readiness.

By 1948, Truman had approved military budgets billions of dollars below what the services were requesting, putting Forrestal in the middle of a fierce tug-of-war between the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Forrestal was also becoming increasingly worried about the Soviet threat. His 18 months at Defense came at an exceptionally difficult time for the U.S. military establishment: Communist governments came to power in Czechoslovakia and China; the Soviets imposed a blockade on West Berlin prompting the U.S. Berlin Airlift to supply the city; the 1948 Arab–Israeli War followed the establishment of Israel; and negotiations were going on for the formation of NATO.

Dwight D. Eisenhower recorded he was in agreement with Forrestal&#x27;s theories on the dangers of Soviet and International communist expansion. Eisenhower recalled that Forrestal had been &quot;the one man who, in the very midst of the war, always counseled caution and alertness in dealing with the Soviets.&quot; Eisenhower remembered on several occasions, while he was Supreme Allied Commander, he had been visited by Forrestal, who carefully explained his thesis that the Communists would never cease trying to destroy all representative government. Eisenhower commented in his personal diary on 11 June 1949, &quot;I never had cause to doubt the accuracy of his judgments on this point.&quot;

Forrestal also opposed the unification of the military services proposed by the Truman officials. Even so, he helped develop the National Security Act of 1947 that created the National Military Establishment (the Department of Defense was not created as such until August 1949). With the former Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson retiring to private life, Forrestal was the next choice.

Michael Hogan downplays Forrestal&#x27;s achievements:
:Forrestal was not in FDR&#x27;s inner circle, was not apprised of the Manhattan Project, and did not attend the major wartime conferences...Forrestal also ended up on the wrong side of the struggle to unify the armed forces...He slowed but did not stop the unification process as secretary of the navy and then had to live with legislation that prevented him from managing the military establishment efficiently as the country&#x27;s first secretary of defense. In that capacity, however, Forrestal was unable to devise an integrated defense budget, work out a joint war plan, or compel the Joint Chiefs of Staff to accept presidential directives they did not like.

====Resignation as Secretary of Defense====
Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey was expected to win the presidential elections of 1948. Forrestal met with Dewey privately, and it was agreed he would continue as Secretary of Defense under a Dewey administration. Unwittingly, Forrestal would trigger a series of events that would not only undermine his already precarious position with Truman but also contribute to the loss of his job, his failing health and eventual demise. Weeks before the election, Pearson published an exposé of the meetings between Dewey and Forrestal.
In 1949, angered over Forrestal&#x27;s continued opposition to his defense economization policies, and concerned about reports in the press over his mental condition, Truman abruptly asked Forrestal to resign. By March 31, 1949, Forrestal was out of a job. He was replaced by Louis A. Johnson, an ardent supporter of Truman&#x27;s defense retrenchment policy.

===Psychiatric treatment===
In 1949, exhausted from overwork, Forrestal entered psychiatric treatment. The attending psychiatrist, Captain George N. Raines, was handpicked by the Navy Surgeon General. The regimen was as follows:
# 1st week: narcosis with sodium amytal.
# 2nd – 5th weeks: a regimen of insulin sub-shock combined with psycho-therapeutic interviews. According to Raines, the patient overreacted to the insulin much as he had to the amytal and this would occasionally throw him into a confused state with a great deal of agitation and confusion.
# 4th week: insulin administered only in stimulating doses; 10 units of insulin four times a day, morning, noon, afternoon and evening.

According to Raines, &quot;We considered electro-shock but thought it better to postpone it for another 90 days. In reactive depression if electro-shock is used early and the patient is returned to the same situation from which he came there is grave danger of suicide in the immediate period after they return... so strangely enough we left out electro-shock to avoid what actually happened anyhow.&quot;

===Death===
Although Forrestal told associates he had decided to resign, he was reportedly shattered when Truman abruptly asked for his resignation. His letter of resignation was tendered on March 28, 1949, and his condition steadily deteriorated. On the day of Forrestal&#x27;s resignation from office, he was reported to have gone into a daze and was flown on a Navy airplane to the estate of Under Secretary of State Robert A. Lovett in Hobe Sound, Florida, where Forrestal&#x27;s wife, Josephine, was vacationing. William C. Menninger of the Menninger Clinic in Kansas was consulted and he diagnosed &quot;severe depression&quot; of the type &quot;seen in operational fatigue during the war&quot;. The Menninger Clinic had successfully treated similar cases during the war, but Forrestal&#x27;s wife, his friend and associate Ferdinand Eberstadt, Menninger, and Navy psychiatrist Captain George N. Raines decided to send the patient to the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) in Bethesda, Maryland. He was checked into NNMC five days later. The decision to house him on the 16th floor instead of the first floor was justified in the same way. Forrestal&#x27;s condition was officially announced as &quot;nervous and physical exhaustion&quot;; his lead doctor, Captain Raines, diagnosed his condition as &quot;depression&quot; or &quot;reactive depression&quot;. As a person who prized anonymity and once stated that his hobby was &quot;obscurity&quot;, Forrestal, with his policies, had been the constant target of vicious personal attacks from columnists, including Drew Pearson and Walter Winchell. Pearson&#x27;s protégé, Jack Anderson, later asserted that Pearson &quot;hectored Forrestal with innuendos and false accusations&quot;.

Forrestal seemed to be on the road to recovery, having regained since his admission into the hospital. However, in the early morning hours of May 22, his body, clad only in the bottom half of a pair of pajamas, was found on a third-floor roof below the sixteenth-floor kitchen across the hall from his room. Forrestal&#x27;s alleged last written statement, touted in the contemporary press and later biographers as an implied suicide note, was part of a poem from W. M. Praed&#x27;s translation of Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Ajax&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;Fair Salamis, the billows&#x27; roar,
Wander around thee yet,
And sailors gaze upon thy shore
Firm in the Ocean set.
Thy son is in a foreign clime
Where Ida feeds her countless flocks,
Far from thy dear, remembered rocks,
Worn by the waste of time–
Comfortless, nameless, hopeless save
In the dark prospect of the yawning grave...
Woe to the mother in her close of day,
Woe to her desolate heart and temples gray,
When she shall hear
Her loved one&#x27;s story whispered in her ear!
&quot;Woe, woe!&quot; will be the cry–
No quiet murmur like the tremulous wail
Of the lone bird, the querulous nightingale–
&lt;/poem&gt;
The official Navy review board, which completed hearings on May 31, waited until October 11, 1949, to release only a brief summary of its findings. The announcement, as reported on page 15 of the October 12 &quot;New York Times&quot;, stated only that Forrestal had died from his fall from the window. It did not say what might have caused the fall, nor did it make any mention of a bathrobe sash cord that had first been reported as tied around his neck. The full report was released by the Department of the Navy in April 2004.
He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==&quot;The Forrestal Diaries&quot;==
Forrestal&#x27;s diaries from 1944 to March 1949 were serialised in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; in 1951, and published as a 581-page book &quot;The Forrestal Diaries&quot;, edited by Walter Millis in October 1951. They were censored prior to publication. Adam Matthew Publications Ltd. published a microfilm of the complete and unexpurgated diaries in 2001, from the originals preserved in the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library, Princeton University; a digital edition was released in January 2020. An example of censorship is the removal of the following account of a conversation with Truman: &quot;He [the President] referred to Hitler as an egomaniac. The result is we shall have a Slav Europe for a long time to come. I don&#x27;t think it is so bad.&quot;

== Possible conflicted personality ==

According to biographer Arnold Rogow, Forrestal was brought up in a rigidly Catholic environment, where harsh discipline gave rise to self-doubts that were never overcome by his many achievements. He compensated by emphasizing toughness in terms of physicality and morality—he had no use for slackers or cowards. He felt war was a necessity and that negotiation was possible only alongside military parity or superiority. This intensity alienated his colleagues, as he focused his fears on Communists and Zionists. He abandoned his religion and his Irish community, but was never at ease on Wall Street, where he suspected and envied its rich and well-born WASP elite. Although his brilliance and energy made him a favorite of President Roosevelt, he profoundly distrusted liberalism and never championed the New Deal.

==Awards==
Forrestal was awarded both the Distinguished Service Medal and the Medal of Merit by President Truman.

==Legacies and depictions ==

===Namesakes===
The James V. Forrestal Building in Washington, D.C., completed in 1969, is named for him.

The J. V. Forrestal Elementary School at 125 Liberty Street in Beacon, New York, his hometown, is named for him. Forrestal Elementary School in the Great Lakes military housing area is named for him.

The aircraft carrier USS &quot;Forrestal&quot;, in commission 1955–1993, was named for him.

=== In literature and the arts ===
In the 2002 HBO TV movie &quot;Path to War&quot;, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (portrayed by Alec Baldwin) hauntingly recounts the story of James Forrestal&#x27;s dismissal and suicide to speechwriter Richard Goodwin (portrayed by James Frain).

In the 2006 film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers,&quot; Forrestal was played by Michael Cumpsty.

The story of James Forrestal is prominently featured in Chapter 4 of the Oliver Stone popular documentary series &quot;Oliver Stone&#x27;s Untold History of the United States,&quot; which aired on Showtime in 2012–13.

The later part of Forrestal&#x27;s life, including his marriage and his death, is a large part of &quot;Majic Man&quot; by Max Allan Collins.

In the anime OVA series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory&quot;, a secret document is briefly viewable in the eighth episode that mentions the death of a Secretary Forrestal. It goes on to say that a &quot;vacancy&quot; was left due to his death until he was replaced by an unnamed general.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
A number of works (shown below) have implied or indicated that Forrestal&#x27;s death was suspicious or nefarious.

In December 1950, William Bradford Huie published an article titled &quot;Untold Facts about the Death of James Forrestal&quot; in &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, which he co-owned. That article, later entered into the Congressional Record and republished, suggested Forrestal has been forced to resign amid pressure from &quot;disgruntled politicians, Communists, Zionists, and gossip columnists&quot;. Huie opined that &quot;Much of the truth has thus far been suppressed, but the ghost of Jim Forrestal is not going to be laid until there are reasonable answers to such questions as these: Why was the attack on Forrestal so reckless and sadistically savage? Why have his papers been held secret? Where is the report of those who investigated his death? Why was the deposed Defense Secretary held a virtual prisoner at Bethesda Naval Hospital—a prisoner who could not be visited by his own priest.&quot;

In 1954, journalist Walter Trohan published a piece listing Forrestal&#x27;s death as part of a pattern of suspicious deaths of federal officials. In 1955, anti-Communist investigative journalist Howard Rushmore claimed, without evidence, that the former Secretary had been murdered by Communists. In 1966, a book-length treatment of the conspiracy theory was published in the fringe press.

In a statement posted to the Paranet BBS in December 1987, John Lear claimed that Forrestal&#x27;s suicide was connected to the &quot;horrible truth&quot; about aliens and their interactions with humanity, and implies that his medical records remain sealed as part of the coverup initiated by President Truman.

In 2017, on the final episode of the Netflix miniseries &quot;Wormwood&quot;, journalist Seymour Hersh implies that Forrestal&#x27;s death may have been one of a series of deaths labeled as suicides that were actually covert assassinations by the CIA.
&quot;The Assassination of James Forrestal&quot;, a 2019 nonfiction book by David Martin, argues that Forrestal was killed.

==== In fiction ====
Forrestal conspiracy theories have been featured in numerous works of fiction. In the 1994 television movie &quot;Roswell&quot;, Forrestal is portrayed by Eugene Roche. He is depicted as sitting on a commission concerning the Roswell UFO incident and advocating the eventual release of information to the public. The film treats his death and classified diary as highly suspicious.

An opera concerning the conspiracy theories behind Forrestal&#x27;s death, &quot;Nightingale: The Last Days of James Forrestal&quot; composed by Evan Hause with a libretto by Gary Heidt, premiered in New York City at the Present Company Theatorium on May 19, 2002

In &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, a DC Comics &quot;Elseworlds&quot; &quot;imaginary story&quot; four-issue prestige format mini-series by James Robinson (writer) and Paul Smith (artist), Forrestal&#x27;s death is shown to have been a murder. Forrestal is pushed from the window of his Bethesda Naval Hospital room by the Golden Age Robotman.

In the PC game &quot;Area 51&quot; one of the secret documents the player can collect talks about the Majestic 12 initiative being threatened with &quot;receiving the same punishment as his last secretary, Forrestal&quot;, implying the murder of Forrestal was to cover his operation from the public. (Forrestal was allegedly a member of Majestic 12.)

The 2020 film &quot;The 11th Green&quot; suggests that in 1949, Forrestal was preparing to make public proof of alien visitations and technology, and was forced by two Men in Black to choose between committing suicide or seeing his entire family killed. A title slide over the last shot of the movie says &quot;Dedicated to the Memory of James V. Forrestal (1892–1949), who understood the significance of the events and sought to act honorably amid treachery.&quot;

<doc id="222302" wikidata="Q7854848" url="?curid=222302" title="Turey El Taíno">
<text>Turey El Taíno is a Puerto Rican publication that remains the most long-standing local comic to date. Originally available in stand-alone magazines and in a strip featured on the now defunct &quot;El Mundo&quot; newspaper, &quot;Turey&quot; debuted in news stands on October 26, 1989. Published by &quot;Editorial Manos&quot; and written and drawn by Ricardo Álvarez-Rivón, &quot;Turey&quot; shows its readers the way the Taínos used to live before Puerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus and his crew. It also depicts the many different words and instruments they used and how they battled their arch-enemies, the Caribs. Between 1991 and 2006, &quot;Turey&quot; strips were published in &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;. Álvarez-Rivón continues to write and illustrate the Turey comic strips with the collaboration of his wife, Magali Álvarez-Rivón.

In 1999, the USPS&#x27;s Hato Rey station honored the magazine by nicknaming the station the &quot;Turey station&quot;.

==Publication history==
Puerto Rican artist Jorge Rechani first instructed Álvarez Rivón in basic illustration at Colegio San José, from where he graduated in 1968. During this timeframe, he had become heavily invested in comics, avidly following the work of Will Eisner and other authors. Despite emphasizing in his professional career, Álvarez Rivón continued to practice and refine his illustration abilities. In 1979, he became the Art Director of a magazine named &quot;Torito y sus amiguitos&quot; (lit. &quot;Torito and friends&quot;) and worked along José Miguel Agrelot, where he first published what he later referred to as a &quot;precursor to Turey&quot;. Álvarez Rivón&#x27;s work in &quot;Torito y sus amiguitos&quot;, headlined by &quot;Coquí Lindo&quot;, featured the same educational content that he would later use in Turey. He continued to publish these for a period of approximately four years. As a reader of other Latin American comic series such as &quot;Condorito&quot; and &quot;Mafalda&quot;, Álvarez Rivón felt that Puerto Rico needed its own autochthonous series. Due to his work in public relations, he identified that this niche was unexploited.

Aided by his wife, Magali J. Meléndez, Álvarez Rivón then began the process of creating Turey, a character that he intended to portray as a &quot;Puerto Rican hero&quot; that could serve as a positive role model for children, but without being excessively theatric or unrealistic. In his efforts to create a relatable character, he noted that Turey was never meant to be a superhero, &quot;he was not Superman […] he was a human character&quot;. When the approach to the character was tilting towards idealism, Meléndez contributed to keep it more realistic. At the time there were some comic authors in Puerto Rico such as Pepe Vázquez and Pedro Cortés, but none were employing the cultural aspects that Álvarez Rivón included in &quot;Turey&quot;. After settling on the idea that a Puerto Rican Taíno was the best choice for the main character, he invested heavily in familiarizing himself with their culture and customs, buying several history books in an effort to make his work as didactic as possible. The name choose is the Taíno word for &quot;sky&quot;. After deciding that the best format was to print the comic in magazines, Álvarez Rivón and Meléndez began pursuing someone that could finance their work. However, after visiting several banks, their own personal savings were used along some sponsors. To reduce production costs, the couple was forced to contract a Miami-based print works. Hurricane Hugo delayed the debut of the series, since it prevented the copies from shipping. Originally intended for the first week of the month, the first issue of Turey was published on October 26, 1989.

Only three days later, the comic strip variant debuted in the &quot;Gente Joven&quot; (lit. &quot;Young People&quot;) section of the now-defunct &quot;El Mundo&quot;. All of the original comics employed the same format, a fully colored cover featuring the series’ logo and its slogan, &quot;ACCIÓN, ENTRETENIMIENTO, AVENTURA&quot; (lit. &quot;Action, Entertainment, Adventure&quot;), with black-and-white interior art. However, the newspaper variant featured colored strips. &quot;Turey&quot; was self-published by Editorial Manos, with Álvarez Rivón in charge of illustrating and writing while Meléndez was in charge of distribution. Approx. 10,000 of each issue were printed monthly and sold in several businesses, including pharmacies and other unorthodox places. Initially, around 5,000 or 6,000 remained unsold, which were then stored by advertising agencies and later
redistributed as promotional material. The number of copies was later limited to 7,000-8,000 monthly copies. This first effort did cost them some losses, something that they solved by innovating their approach. Meléndez decided to expand the brand by selling the Turey character as a mascot to several companies. Locally, it replaced Ernie Keebler as Keebler Company&#x27;s mascot.

The government also adopted Turey, first becoming the image of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. This was followed by an alliance with the Puerto Rico Department of Education, which led to the creation of seven publications. A van labelled with &quot;Turey el Taíno el cómic de aquí: el cómic número uno de Puerto Rico&quot; (lit. &quot;Turey the Taíno the local comic: the number one comic in Puerto Rico&quot;) was used to promote the publication, traveling as far as Mayagüez and working along drink bottler Malta India and radio station Sistema 102. The year after &quot;El Mundo&quot; closed, &quot;El Nuevo Día&#x27;s&quot; Graphic Director and a comic enthusiast himself, José Luis Díaz de Villegas, brought the &quot;Turey&quot; comic strip to that newspaper. There the sequences were featured in a section titled &quot;Muñequitos&quot; (lit. &quot;Cartoons&quot;) of the &quot;En Grande&quot; (lit. &quot;In a Big Way&quot;) Sunday supplement. &quot;Turey&quot; shared this space with several local comics, including Nadia Martín&#x27;s &quot;Tuta y Tita&quot; and Nick Ianone&#x27;s &quot;Paladín El Cacique y los Campeadores Boricuas&quot;, as well as foreign publications. However, the section was systematically reduced to create space and reduce costs, eventually disappearing. Despite this, &quot;Turey&quot; survived and continued being published in the children-friendly Mi Pequeño Día (lit. &quot;My Little Day&quot;), being joined by Martín Gaudier&#x27;s &quot;Tato y Kenepo&quot;.

Afterwards, Álvarez Rivón made an effort to bring the character to contemporary relevancy. In its original run, the &quot;Turey&quot; comic book magazines published 35 issues, with the last one being released in June 1995. This was the longest run of a stand-alone comic book magazine in Puerto Rico. In its newspaper format, the comic strips continued to be published on a regular basis. Eventually, the supplement&#x27;s editor, Josefina Barceló, requested that the &quot;Turey&quot; strips were simplified and easier to understand. However, Álvarez Rivón and Meléndez did not agree with this, feeling that it would damage its intellectual property. Barceló&#x27;s demands were regarded as ridiculous and heavily deviated from its source material, with the artist noting particular discontent with an Easter strip where Turey was depicted practicing the Anglo-Saxon tradition of finding Easter eggs. After growing frustrations, Álvarez Rivón and Meléndez decided to withdraw the comic strip from &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; in 2006, ending a 15-year run in that newspaper. The decision was made public in one last strip, which almost went unpublished.

==Art style==
Throughout the years, &quot;Turey&quot; has featured the work of several illustrators and artists. Among them are Arturo Vilmenay, David Álvarez, and Reynaldo León, who went on to create their own series and characters. However, this also led to wildly fluctuating and contrasting art styles. In its initial form, Álvarez Rivón employed an art style that heavily incorporated textures and emphasized lighting and shadowing which has been described as &quot;attractive [and] dynamic&quot;. His work featured aspects from older cartoon and comic strips, such as the employment of onomatopoeias and visual metaphors. His use of facial expressions bears a resemblance to that of Quino. Álvarez Rivón also used this art style to convey environmental hazards and other panoramic features. Lettering of the speech balloons was done by hand, and also featured the work of Vilmenay, who employed a different style for the character of Baracutey to emphasize his emotionless demeanor. The topic of issue 32 was based on a suggestion of Vilmenay, where the sister of a now deceased Baracutey steals his body bent on revenge, with the artist providing a realistic and detailed cover that distanced itself from Álvarez Rivón&#x27;s style to depict a more vile and dark character.

Of the guest artists, León was the one that took more liberty with the artistic license. His work in issues 14, 33, 34 and 35 was notably cartoonish, heavily depending on exaggeration to emphasize its humor. David Álvarez collaborated with illustrations in issues 20, 22, 23 and 25, also inking issue 21. Finally, Pepe &quot;J.H. Vazz&quot; Vázquez&#x27;s guest artist collaboration deviates from the art style used by all other artists, employing his personal illustration and shadowing style. Despite these variations, the content of the comic remained unchanged, with Álvarez Rivón noting that regardless of the illustration quality his priority was always the quality of the script. All of these artists, and several invited guests such as Eddie Ortiz, Nadia Martín, Paco López, Vicente Avilés, Freddy Camareno and Arturo Yépez, were featured in interviews included within the comics.

==Characters==
* Turey: family leader, adventurer, father of Tureycito.
* Tureycito: son of Turey, inquisitive, acts like a child because he is a child.
* Yaya: wife of Turey.
* Batu: comedic character, always prefers to stay on the safe side of things.
* Baracutey: cold blooded warrior, but loyal to his friends. He possesses almost inhuman strength and many times is portrayed fighting sharks and other hard to beat opponents.
* Mambi: leader of the Caribs, who later befriends Turey

==Plot==
Set in 1490, only two years before the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the Americas, the comic follows the life of a Taíno &quot;yucayeque&quot; or village in the island of Borikén (Puerto Rico). Among them was a member of the worker &quot;naboría&quot; class named Turey, who despite being significantly shorter than his counterparts, dreamed of becoming a member of &quot;cacique&quot; Yaguaca&#x27;s royal guard. The series also follows the exploits of his family, particularly his wife Yaya and his son Tureycito, as well as his friends and other members of the village. Eventually, Turey&#x27;s courage earned him the respect of his &quot;yucayeque&quot;. In its different issues, Álvarez Rivón covers different aspects of Taíno culture, ranging from their complete reliance on nature to their territorial disputes with the neighboring Carib tribes. However, these aspects are included as part of a larger story, which in turn balance its educational content with entertainment. After its third issue, the stories ended with a moral message authored by Meléndez. Each issue introduced new words from the Taíno language, with their meaning being discussed in detail in a section titled Vocabulario Taíno (lit. &quot;Taíno Vocabulary&quot;) included towards the end of each magazine. The newspaper strips relaxed this dynamic, focusing on a humorous approach that sometimes bordered on the absurd, surreal or hypothetical. From 2000 onwards, Turey was more often depicted in large single-panel strips depicting his reaction when placed in contemporary situations or historical events, a change based on the editorial decisions of &quot;El Nuevo Día&#x27;s&quot; staff.

==Reception==
Finding original copies of the comics is difficult, something that has made it a sought after item among collectors. The entire collection is available in two volumes, and the cost of each has been estimated to be $150 per book. &quot;Turey&quot; earned the approval of author Abelardo Díaz Alfaro, who congratulated Álvarez Rivón on both his illustrations and the comic&#x27;s capacity to transmit educational material about the Taínos. Likewise, Ricardo Alegría praised its timing, noting that the publication appeared just when it was needed, in years after native archeological sites were being unearthed in Tibes and Caguana. Despite featuring an art style that mostly appealed to preteens and teenagers, &quot;Turey&quot; was followed by children as young as 9-years old and was used as a resource by several school teachers. The popularity gathered during its initial run allowed the brand to expand, eventually branching into other products. Among these was a puppet show featuring Turey, Yaya and Tureycito, which was mostly a musical albeit with educational content. The marionettes were handled by two independent performers. The shows gathered contracts with the government and other entities, often being sponsored by corporations such as Mattel or Coca-Cola. Likewise, the Puerto Rico Department of Education sponsored several related presentations.

Its local popularity opened doors beyond Puerto Rico, with anglosaxon McGraw-Hill publishing a licensed English book titled &quot;Laugh &#x27;n&#x27; Learn Spanish: Turey el Taíno&quot;, authored by Brenda Wegmann and Llanca Letelier. However, not all of the international attention gathered was positive. On three separate occasions, &quot;Turey&quot; was plagiarized by foreign publishers. In October 2005, WAPA-TV gave Turey its first television segment in its morning newscast, &quot;Noticentro 4 Al Amanecer&quot; (lit. &quot;Noticentro 4 in the Morning&quot;). &quot;El Mensaje Positivo de Turey el Taíno&quot; (lit. &quot;The Positive Message of Turey the Taíno&quot;) was animated with Adobe Flash, and in 30-second vignettes the character would transmit a motivational message. In November 2017, the character migrated to Univision Puerto Rico where it served as a host of educational segments named &quot;Aprendiendo con Turey el Taíno&quot; (lit. &quot;Learning with Turey the Taíno&quot;), ending a decade in its previous television spot.

The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture honored Turey by publishing a book about the character, which included a collection of the comic strips. Turey is also the principal figure on an educational pamphlet published by &quot;El Nuevo Día Educador&quot; (&quot;ENDE&quot;). The United States Postal Service honored &quot;Turey&quot; and his creator in 1999, by presenting a cancelled postal stamp and renaming the postal station in Plaza Las Americas in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the &quot;Turey Postal Station&quot;. On November 10, 1999, The Puerto Rican House of Representatives, honored Álvarez Rivón and presented him with a plaque. The titular character received a recognition during the 2013 San Sebastián Festival, an annual cultural event celebrated in the vicinity of Old San Juan.

<text>Gringo (, , ) (masculine) or gringa (feminine) is a term in Spanish and Portuguese for a foreigner. In Spanish, the term usually refers to English-speaking Anglo-Americans. There are differences in meaning depending on region and country. The term is often considered derogatory, but is not always used to insult, and in the United States its usage and offensiveness is disputed.

The word derives from the term used by the Spanish for a Greek person: &quot;griego&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first recorded use in English comes from John Woodhouse Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Western Journal of 1849–1850&quot;, in which Audubon reports that his party was hooted and shouted at and called &quot;Gringoes&quot; while passing through the town of Cerro Gordo, Veracruz.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;gringo&quot; originally referred to any kind of foreigner. It was first recorded in 1787 in the Spanish &quot;Diccionario castellano con las voces de Ciencias y Artes&quot;:

The most likely theory is that it originates from &quot;griego&quot; (&#x27;Greek&#x27;), used in the same way as the English phrase &quot;it&#x27;s Greek to me&quot;. Spanish is known to have used Greek as a stand-in for incomprehensibility, though now less common, such as in the phrase &quot;hablar en griego&quot; (lit. &#x27;to speak Greek&#x27;). The 1817 &quot;Nuevo diccionario francés-español&quot;, for example, gives &quot;gringo&quot; and &quot;griego&quot; as synonyms in this context:
This derivation requires two steps: &quot;griego&quot; &gt; &quot;grigo&quot;, and &quot;grigo&quot; &gt; &quot;gringo&quot;. Corominas notes that while the first change is common in Spanish (e.g. &quot;&quot; to &quot;&quot;), there is no perfect analogy for the second, save in Old French (&quot;Gregoire&quot; to &quot;Grigoire&quot; to &quot;Gringoire&quot;). However, there are other Spanish words whose colloquial form contains an epenthetic &quot;n&quot;, such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (&#x27;chubby&#x27;), and &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (&#x27;South Vietnam&#x27;). It is also possible that the final form was influenced by the word &quot;jeringonza&quot;, a game like Pig Latin also used to mean &quot;gibberish&quot;.

Alternatively, it has been suggested that &quot;gringo&quot; could derive from the Caló language, the language of the Romani people of Spain, as a variant of the hypothetical *&quot;peregringo&quot;, &#x27;peregrine&#x27;, &#x27;wayfarer&#x27;, &#x27;stranger&#x27;.

===False etymologies===
There are several false etymologies that purport to derive the origin of &quot;gringo&quot; from word coincidences. Many of these folk etymologies date the word to the Mexican–American War (1846–1848):

* Gringo is a result of American troops singing songs which began with &quot;Green grows...&quot; such as &quot;Green Grow the Rushes, O&quot;, &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;, and various others. 
* Another theory involves locals yelling &quot;Green, go home!&quot; at invading American soldiers (sometimes in conflicts other than the Mexican–American War), in reference to their supposedly green uniforms. 
* Another derives from the Irish &quot;Erin go bragh&quot; (&quot;Ireland forever&quot;), which served as the motto for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion who fought alongside the Mexican army.

==Regional usage==
===Argentina===
The word &quot;gringo&quot; is mostly used in rural areas following the original Spanish meaning. &quot;Gringo&quot; in Argentina was used to refer to non-Spanish European immigrants who first established agricultural colonies in the country. The word was used for Swiss, German, Polish, Italian and other immigrants, but since the Italian immigrants were the larger group, the word primarily referred to Italians in the &quot;lunfardo&quot; argot. It also found use in the intermittent exercise Gringo-Gaucho between Argentine Naval Aviation and US Navy aircraft carriers.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the word &quot;gringo&quot; means &quot;foreigner&quot; and has no connection to physical characteristics or specific countries. For example, foreign football players in the Brazilian Championship that come from other South American countries are referred to as &quot;gringos&quot; by the sports media and by sports fans.

As the word has no connection to physical appearance in Brazil, black African or African American foreigners are also called &quot;gringos&quot;. Popularly used terms for fair-skinned and blond people are generally based in specific nationalities, like &quot;alemão&quot; (i.e., German), &quot;russo&quot; (Russian) or, in some regions, &quot;polaco&quot; (Polack) and &quot;galego&quot; (Galician) which are used for both Brazilians and foreigners with such characteristics, regardless of national or ethnic origins. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the word &quot;gringo&quot; is also used to refer to people of Italian ancestry.

=== Chile ===

In Chile, the word &quot;gringo&quot; is mostly used to refer to people from the United States. The word &quot;Gringolandia&quot; is used colloquially as synonymous with the United States of America.

Sometimes, it is used for people from some English-speaking countries, like Great Britain or Canada.

=== Mexico ===

In Mexico, the use of the word &quot;gringo&quot; has been reserved for people from the U.S., often white people (or also those who have blond hair or European appearance), since the end of the 19th century.

The term is mentioned in its meaning of &quot;incomprehensible language&quot; from the 18th century (1789) to the 1830s, but also to indicate foreign troops, at first, coming from Spain in the second half of the 18th century. A text published in Mexico, but written by a Spaniard, denigrates a Mexican from Sonora for speaking &quot;gringo&quot;, in reference to the indigenous language. After the Mexican–American War, &quot;gringo&quot; began to be used for citizens from that country, with expressions such as &quot;American gringo&quot; or simply &quot;gringo&quot;, attested as in popular use in Tepetitlán in 1849. Since then, &quot;gringo&quot; became a way to designate United States citizens exclusively.

The term is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and art; for example, in the novel &quot;The Old Gringo&quot; by Carlos Fuentes or in the songs &quot;Frijolero&quot; by Molotov and &quot;Somos Más Americanos&quot; by Los Tigres del Norte.

=== United States ===
In the United States, &quot;gringo&quot; is often used by Latino Americans to refer to Anglo Americans. Sometimes it is also used by Americans to refer to themselves. It is considered to be a racial slur targeted towards non-Hispanic white people but it may also refer to any person that is not Latino. Among the US Latino communities it may also disparagingly refer to another Latino person perceived to not be culturally Latino, e.g. inability to speak Spanish.

Alicia Shepard stated that there is a disagreement between Hispanics and non-Hispanics about its offensiveness. She argued that even though in Spanish it is defined as a neutral term and not as an insult, in English it can be interpreted as such, and should be avoided.

Gustavo Arellano said that the term is &quot;technically a slur&quot;, but &quot;its power to offend nowadays is minimal&quot;. He compared the ban on the term as an attempt to cancel aspects of Mexican culture.

==Other uses==
=== Food ===
In Mexican cuisine, a &quot;gringa&quot; is a flour tortilla with al pastor pork meat with cheese, heated on a &quot;comal&quot; and optionally served with a &quot;salsa de chile&quot; (chilli sauce). Some attribute the name to the white flour used.

===Activism===
In 1969, José Ángel Gutiérrez, one of the leaders of the Mexican American Youth Organization, said his and MAYO&#x27;s use of the term, rather than referring to non-Latinos, referred to people or institutions with policies or attitudes that reflect racism and violence.

In 2018, he starred in the musical &quot;Knights’ Tale&quot; directed by John Caird as well.

== Career ==

Born in Ashiya, Hyōgo, Japan, Domoto joined the Japanese talent agency Johnny &amp; Associates at the age of 12 after his sister sent in his application without his knowledge. Domoto and his bandmate Tsuyoshi Domoto first worked together as back-dancers for Hikaru Genji, who were holding a concert at Yokohama Arena, and has since then been partnered up for magazine photoshoots, music acts and drama projects. The duo eventually made their debut in 1997 with a double release of a single &quot;Garasu no Shōnen&quot; and an album &quot;A Album&quot;, both of which went on to sell over a million copies.

=== Theatre ===
In 1993, Domoto played in his first stage in SMAP&#x27;s &quot;ANOTHER.&quot; As early as in 1994, he expressed his enthusiasm of musical, saying that his dream was to &quot;play in musicals that have singing, dancing and acting&quot; in an interview. In 1997, he played in the stage &quot;kyotokyo&quot; with many others from Johnny &amp; Associates. He managed to star as the lead (or Zachō in Japanese) in musical &quot;MASK&#x27;99&quot; in Nissay Theatre in 1999.

In November 2000, Domoto played the lead role in musical &quot;MILLENNIUM SHOCK,&quot; becoming the youngest Zachō and also the first idol to play the lead at Tokyo Imperial Theatre. Since then, &quot;SHOCK&quot; series has continued to perform every year. The title was changed to &quot;Shōgeki・SHOCK, SHOCK is Real SHOCK&quot; and &quot;Shocking SHOCK&quot; in the following years but had the similar story&quot;.&quot; In 2005, it was revised to &quot;Endless SHOCK&quot; and the story was changed completely. Domoto started to participate as the director and composed several songs since this year. In April 2008, the long-running musical &quot;Endless SHOCK&quot; was awarded the Grand Prize of the 33rd Kazuo Kikuta Drama Awards for theatre. In January 2012, &quot;Endless SHOCK&quot; was performed at Hakata-za in Fukuoka, which was the first time for the musical to be performed in places other than Tokyo. On March 21, 2013, &quot;Endless SHOCK&quot; welcomed its 1000th performance, making it the forth theatre to reach 1000 performances in Japan. It was also brought to Umeda Arts Theatre in Osaka in September 2013. After its 1408th performance on October 26, 2014, &quot;Endless SHOCK&quot; overtook Matsumoto Hakuō II&#x27;s Japanese version of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; to become the most-performed musical and the second most-performed theatre with single lead-starring in Japan. In April 2020, Domoto alone was awarded the Grand Prize of the 45th Kazuo Kikuta Drama Awards for his achievement for leading &quot;SHOCK&quot; series for twenty years, becoming the youngest single winner of this award. &quot;SHOCK&quot; series reached its 1800th performance on February 12, 2021.

It was believed that idols were unqualified to stand at the most famous and important theatre in Japan, let alone playing the lead at the age of 21. However, &quot;SHOCK&quot; gradually becomes one of the most important musicals at Imperial Theatre and one of the representing Japanese original musicals.

<doc id="222309" wikidata="Q985899" url="?curid=222309" title="Tsuyoshi Domoto">
<text>is a Japanese idol, singer, songwriter, actor, and television personality. Along with Koichi Domoto (with whom he has no blood-relation), he is a member of Domoto, which is a Japanese duo under the management of Starto Entertainment (formerly of Johnny &amp; Associates) and the record holder of Guinness World Records for having the record of the most consecutive number-one singles since their debut single.

== Biography ==

Domoto was born in Nara. He has a sister, older by six years.

On June 28, 2017, Domoto was hospitalized after experiencing sudden deafness. Although he&#x27;s been treated, Domoto will never recover fully. He has been using earphones when appearing in music programs because of it.

==Career==
Domoto joined Johnny&#x27;s Entertainment on May 5, 1991, which also the first time he met his future bandmate Koichi Domoto. The opportunity came while without his knowing, his mother and his sister sent his resume to the office. Domoto and his bandmate Koichi Domoto first worked together as backdancers for Hikaru Genji, who were holding a concert at Yokohama Arena, and has since then been partnered up for magazine photoshoots, music acts and drama projects. The duo starred in their first drama together called &quot;Ningen Shikkaku&quot; in 1994, in which Domoto was awarded Best Newcomer in the Television Drama Academy Awards.

With Koichi Domoto, he eventually made his debut in 1997 as KinKi Kids with a double release of a single &quot;Garasu no Shōnen&quot; and an album &quot;A Album&quot;, both of which went on to sell more than a million copies.

On May 29, 2002, Domoto released his first solo single, &quot;Machi/Dekiai Logic&quot;, in which he penned and composed all the tracks. The single was used as the theme song for Domoto&#x27;s lead-role drama &quot;Yume no California&quot; and it reached number 1 in the weekly chart. In the following month, Domoto started his career as an illustrator by publishing a book in collaboration with writer Shizuka Iziyuuin. They collaborated again for another book in 2003.

Domoto appeared in the 2003 drama &quot;Moto Kare&quot;, in which he co-starred for the second time with Ryōko Hirosue after their hit drama &quot;Summer Snow&quot; in 2000. In April 2004, Domoto once again provided the theme song for his lead-role drama &quot;Home Drama&quot;. This year, he won the &#x27;Best Jeanist&#x27; award. The following year, Domoto acted in a movie, &quot;Fantastipo&quot;, with fellow Johnny&#x27;s personality Taichi Kokubun. He paired with Toraji Haiji to release the theme song for the movie. The same year, Domoto starred in &quot;Hoshi ni Negai o&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Wish Upon A Star&quot;), a TV drama produced by Disney and Fuji TV based on the true story of planetarium engineer Takayuki Ohira who designed Megastar II – the world&#x27;s most advanced planetarium projector.

In 2006, Domoto put his acting career on hold and focused more on his music career. He began to release his solo work under the project name Endlicheri-Endlicheri. During his Endlicheri-Endlicheri era, Domoto released three singles which all topped the weekly charts and made him the second male soloist after Masahiko Kondo to have achieved five consecutive number one singles. He then renamed his solo project 244 Endli-x (pronounced &quot;Tsuyoshi Endorikkusu&quot;) in 2008. He announced that he would go on his first concert tour as 244 Endli-x soon after, which began on March 29, 2008, at the Yokohama Arena and ended in Sendai on May 8, 2008. At the end of April, Domoto was appointed to be the first special ambassador for Nara tourism.

Domoto once again changed his solo project name in 2009 to and simultaneously released a single and an album on his birthday, April 10. In the same year, he released another single, &quot;Rain&quot;, on September 9, which topped the Oricon Single Weekly Charts. Domoto also announced his collaboration with the hat brand CA4LA. Known as the fashion leader with unique style, Domoto was chosen by famous sports brand Adidas Originals to be the image character for its new campaign BE Originals which start on February 12, 2010.

On April 6, 2011, Domoto released his ninth single, &quot;Eni o Yuite&quot;, which was recorded at shrines believed to have connections to Nara&#x27;s entertainment and music industries. Another single, &quot;Niji no Uta&quot;, was released in September 2011.

On June 28, 2017, it was revealed that Domoto would be hospitalized for one week after experiencing sudden deafness, otherwise known as sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Due to this, he was unable to attend TV Tokyo&#x27;s “Ongakusai 2017” broadcast on the same date with bandmate Koichi. He was released the following week and was instructed to continue outpatient recovery. He returned to the stage after a 4-month hiatus, participating in the music festival &quot;TV Asahi Dream Festival 2017&quot; with Koichi on the 29th of October.

Domoto, once again changing his name to Endrecheri, released a new full-length studio album titled &quot;Naralien&quot; on August 14, 2019. The album featured lead track &quot;4 10 cake (Hot Cake) and brand new songs “FUNK TRON”, “Heki”, and “PURPLE FIRE”. Remakes of his older songs “Believe in intuition…” &amp; “NIPPON” were also included. The album was released in three versions. Limited Edition A included a DVD containing the music video for the Album&#x27;s lead track “4 10 cake (Hot cake)” and footage from ENDRECHERI&#x27;s performance at SUMMER SONIC 2018, while the Limited Edition B is packaged with a second DVD which includes an hour-long video centering around Tsuyoshi and his band members. The album charted #1 on the Oricon weekly Albums chart.

In the video for the album&#x27;s lead track &quot;4 10 cake (Hot Cake)&quot; Domoto is seen singing and dancing with various different dancers including Japanese Choreographer Riehata.

On February 22, 2024, Domoto announced via the fan club site that he would be leaving the agency on March 31. Days later, on his radio program &quot;Domoto Tsuyoshi to Fashion and Music Book&quot;, he announced to the public his decision. One of the reasons for seeking his independence was his health, with priority for his hearing. According to Domoto, the doctor in charge said, &quot;I think there is a need to change the environment significantly&quot;. He has been talking about his condition on the program, receiving messages from listeners who are battling illness themselves. That particular day, he received a message from a fan in his 80s, who was left paralyzed by a cerebral hemorrhage, and a man in his 40s, sentenced to six months to live. While addressing the listeners fighting illnesses, he was also telling himself, &quot;I will never give up until the very end&quot;. Through such heart-to-heart exchanges, Tsuyoshi Domoto must have become more convinced that he only has one life, and that he must take care of himself. Tsuyoshi Domoto (the man) has not given up on Tsuyoshi Domoto (the artist). He also announced it in his Instagram, after deleting all his previous posts. &quot;Regarding my personal activities, I have decided to terminate my contract with my agency on March 31, 2024 at the time of renewal and move on to a new field of life&quot; &quot;I felt that I needed to make a big change in my environment in order to continue my life as an artist&quot;, is part of the message he shared there. Regarding the activities of Kinki Kids and his relationship with Koichi, he said on the program &quot;Kinki Kids donnamonya&quot; that they had been talking about the ways to continue working together, not considering disbanding as a solution. Of course there was concern about the fans, and he stated it. &quot;There will be new forms between us and our fans. However, the time we create (together) will have to change in order to continue. I think that&#x27;s a very positive thing, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem if something changes. I think there&#x27;s a future that we can walk towards because we&#x27;re all part of it&quot;, he said, hopeful that the change will also reach the fans&#x27;s future selves. Koichi Domoto had also shared his feelings about his partner&#x27;s decision on the 22, saying &quot;We will continue to deliver on our activities. Until now, KinKi Kids has continued activities while taking Tsuyoshi&#x27;s health into consideration. There were some wonderful works and moving performances that were created because of these hardships. With Tsuyoshi&#x27;s decision to continue his individual activities in a new field, expectations are high that the resolution of &quot;what we want to express as KinKi Kids&quot; will become clearer.&quot;

<text>In petroleum exploration and development, formation evaluation is used to determine the ability of a borehole to produce petroleum. Essentially, it is the process of &quot;recognizing a commercial well when you drill one&quot;.

Modern rotary drilling usually uses a heavy mud as a lubricant and as a means of producing a confining pressure against the formation face in the borehole, preventing blowouts. Only in rare and catastrophic cases, do oil and gas wells &quot;come in&quot; with a fountain of gushing oil. In real life, that is a &quot;blowout&quot;—and usually also a financial and environmental disaster. But controlling blowouts has drawbacks—mud filtrate soaks into the formation around the borehole and a mud cake plasters the sides of the hole. These factors obscure the possible presence of oil or gas in even very porous formations. Further complicating the problem is the widespread occurrence of small amounts of petroleum in the rocks of many sedimentary provinces. In fact, if a sedimentary province is absolutely barren of traces of petroleum, it is not feasible to continue drilling there.

The formation evaluation problem is a matter of answering two questions:
#What are the lower limits for porosity, permeability and upper limits for water saturation that permit profitable production from a particular formation or pay zone; in a particular geographic area; in a particular economic climate.
#Do any of the formations in the well under consideration exceed these lower limits.

It is complicated by the impossibility of directly examining the formation. It is, in short, the problem of looking at the formation &quot;indirectly&quot;.

==Formation evaluation tools==
Tools to detect oil and gas have been evolving for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is well cuttings examination. Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic microscope to determine the lithology of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining. A portable ultraviolet light chamber or &quot;Spook Box&quot; is used to examine the cuttings for fluorescence. Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals. They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish. The solvent is usually carbon tetrachlorethane. Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates. The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.

Well cuttings examination is a learned skill. During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about across, are cut from the bottom of the hole by the bit. Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole. During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning drillpipe, mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction. They then are screened out of the mudstream by the shale shaker and fall on a pile at its base. Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the &#x27;lag time&#x27; between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the wellsite geologist (or mudlogger as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material. Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a &quot;bit trip&quot; when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit. At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (cavings), making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.

===Coring===

One way to get more detailed samples of a formation is by coring. Two techniques commonly used at present. The first is the &quot;whole core&quot;, a cylinder of rock, usually about 3&quot; to 4&quot; in diameter and up to long. It is cut with a &quot;core barrel&quot;, a hollow pipe tipped with a ring-shaped diamond chip-studded bit that can cut a plug and bring it to the surface. Often the plug breaks while drilling, usually in shales or fractures and the core barrel jams, slowly grinding the rocks in front of it to powder. This signals the driller to give up on getting a full-length core and to pull up the pipe.

Taking a full core is an expensive operation that usually stops or slows drilling for at least the better part of a day. A full core can be invaluable for later reservoir evaluation. Once a section of well has been drilled, there is, of course, no way to core it without drilling another well.

Another, cheaper, technique for obtaining samples of the formation is &quot;Sidewall Coring&quot;. One type of sidewall cores is percussion cores. In this method, a steel cylinder—a coring gun—has hollow-point steel bullets mounted along its sides and moored to the gun by short steel cables. The coring gun is lowered to the bottom of the interval of interest and the bullets are fired individually as the gun is pulled up the hole. The mooring cables ideally pull the hollow bullets and the enclosed plug of formation loose and the gun carries them to the surface. Advantages of this technique are low cost and the ability to sample the formation after it has been drilled. Disadvantages are possible non-recovery because of lost or misfired bullets and a slight uncertainty about the sample depth. Sidewall cores are often shot &quot;on the run&quot; without stopping at each core point because of the danger of differential sticking. Most service company personnel are skilled enough to minimize this problem, but it can be significant if depth accuracy is important.

A second method of sidewall coring is rotary sidewall cores. In this method, a circular-saw assembly is lowered to the zone of interest on a wireline, and the core is sawed out. Dozens of cores may be taken this way in one run. This method is roughly 20 times as expensive as percussion cores, but yields a much better sample.

A serious problem with cores is the change they undergo as they are brought to the surface. It might seem that cuttings and cores are very direct samples but the problem is whether the formation at depth will produce oil or gas. Sidewall cores are deformed and compacted and fractured by the bullet impact. Most full cores from any significant depth expand and fracture as they are brought to the surface and removed from the core barrel. Both types of core can be invaded or even flushed by mud, making the evaluation of formation fluids difficult. The formation analyst has to remember that all tools give indirect data.

===Mud logging===

Mud logging (or Wellsite Geology) is a well logging process in which drilling mud and drill bit cuttings from the formation are evaluated during drilling and their properties recorded on a strip chart as a visual analytical tool and stratigraphic cross sectional representation of the well. The drilling mud which is analyzed for hydrocarbon gases, by use of a gas chromatograph, contains drill bit cuttings which are visually evaluated by a mudlogger and then described in the mud log. The total gas, chromatograph record, lithological sample, pore pressure, shale density, D-exponent, etc. (all lagged parameters because they are circulated up to the surface from the bit) are plotted along with surface parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), Weight On Bit (WOB), rotation per minute etc. on the mudlog which serve as a tool for the mudlogger, drilling engineers, mud engineers, and other service personnel charged with drilling and producing the well.

===Wireline logging===

The oil and gas industry uses wireline logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation&#x27;s rock properties. Wireline logging can be defined as being &quot;The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services.&quot; Note that &quot;wireline logging&quot; and &quot;mud logging&quot; are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to &quot;TAH&quot; - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as hydrocarbon saturation and formation pressure, and to make further drilling and production decisions.

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a &#x27;logging tool&#x27; - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an oil well (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to.

The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a &quot;well log&quot; is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data. Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.

Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth. Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time. The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log. Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy.

The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length. The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.[1]

There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. &quot;Open hole logs&quot; are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. &quot;Cased hole logs&quot; are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe.[2]

Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured.

===Electric logs===
In 1928, the Schlumberger brothers in France developed the workhorse of all formation evaluation tools: the electric log. Electric logs have been improved to a high degree of precision and sophistication since that time, but the basic principle has not changed. Most underground formations contain water, often salt water, in their pores. The resistance to electric current of the total formation—rock and fluids—around the borehole is proportional to the sum of the volumetric proportions of mineral grains and conductive water-filled pore space. If the pores are partially filled with gas or oil, which are resistant to the passage of electric current, the bulk formation resistance is higher than for water filled pores. For the sake of a convenient comparison from measurement to measurement, the electrical logging tools measure the resistance of a cubic meter of formation. This measurement is called &quot;resistivity&quot;.

Modern resistivity logging tools fall into two categories, Laterolog and Induction, with various commercial names, depending on the company providing the logging services.

Laterolog tools send an electric current from an electrode on the sonde directly into the formation. The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself. Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid. Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode in order to maintain a constant current intensity. This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation. Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid. Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud.
Induction logs use an electric coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction. This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers. The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde. The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation. Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution). Until the late 80&#x27;s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of . Since the 90&#x27;s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools. These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils. Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils. Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity. Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid. In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.

Until the late 1950s electric logs, mud logs and sample logs comprised most of the oilman&#x27;s armamentarium. Logging tools to measure porosity and permeability began to be used at that time. The first was the microlog. This was a miniature electric log with two sets of electrodes. One measured the formation resistivity about 1/2&quot; deep and the other about 1&quot;-2&quot; deep. The purpose of this seemingly pointless measurement was to detect permeability. Permeable sections of a borehole wall develop a thick layer of mudcake during drilling. Mud liquids, called filtrate, soak into the formation, leaving the mud solids behind to -ideally- seal the wall and stop the filtrate &quot;invasion&quot; or soaking. The short depth electrode of the microlog sees mudcake in permeable sections. The deeper 1&quot; electrode sees filtrate invaded formation. In nonpermeable sections both tools read alike and the traces fall on top of each other on the stripchart log. In permeable sections they separate.

Also in the late 1950s porosity measuring logs were being developed. The two main types are: nuclear porosity logs and sonic logs.

===Porosity logs===
The two main nuclear porosity logs are the Density and the Neutron log.

Density logging tools contain a caesium-137 gamma ray source which irradiates the formation with 662 keV gamma rays. These gamma rays interact with electrons in the formation through Compton scattering and lose energy. Once the energy of the gamma ray has fallen below 100 keV, photoelectric absorption dominates: gamma rays are eventually absorbed by the formation. The amount of energy loss by Compton scattering is related to the number electrons per unit volume of formation. Since for most elements of interest (below Z = 20) the ratio of atomic weight, A, to atomic number, Z, is close to 2, gamma ray energy loss is related to the amount of matter per unit volume, i.e., formation density.

A gamma ray detector located some distance from the source, detects surviving gamma rays and sorts them into several energy windows. The number of high-energy gamma rays is controlled by compton scattering, hence by formation density. The number of low-energy gamma rays is controlled by photoelectric absorption, which is directly related to the average atomic number, Z, of the formation, hence to lithology. Modern density logging tools include two or three detectors, which allow compensation for some borehole effects, in particular for the presence of mud cake between the tool and the formation.

Since there is a large contrast between the density of the minerals in the formation and the density of pore fluids, porosity can easily be derived from measured formation bulk density if both mineral and fluid densities are known.

Neutron porosity logging tools contain an americium-beryllium neutron source, which irradiates the formation with neutrons. These neutrons lose energy through elastic collisions with nuclei in the formation. Once their energy has decreased to thermal level, they diffuse randomly away from the source and are ultimately absorbed by a nucleus. Hydrogen atoms have essentially the same mass as the neutron; therefore hydrogen is the main contributor to the slowing down of neutrons. A detector at some distance from the source records the number of neutron reaching this point. Neutrons that have been slowed down to thermal level have a high probability of being absorbed by the formation before reaching the detector. The neutron counting rate is therefore inversely related to the amount of hydrogen in the formation. Since hydrogen is mostly present in pore fluids (water, hydrocarbons) the count rate can be converted into apparent porosity. Modern neutron logging tools usually include two detectors to compensate for some borehole effects. Porosity is derived from the ratio of count rates at these two detectors rather than from count rates at a single detector.

The combination of neutron and density logs takes advantage of the fact that lithology has opposite effects on these two porosity measurements. The average of neutron and density porosity values is usually close to the true porosity, regardless of lithology. Another advantage of this combination is the &quot;gas effect.&quot; Gas, being less dense than liquids, translates into a density-derived porosity that is too high. Gas, on the other hand, has much less hydrogen per unit volume than liquids: neutron-derived porosity, which is based on the amount of hydrogen, is too low. If both logs are displayed on compatible scales, they overlay each other in liquid-filled clean formations and are widely separated in gas-filled formations.

Sonic logs use a pinger and microphone arrangement to measure the velocity of sound in the formation from one end of the sonde to the other. For a given type of rock, acoustic velocity varies indirectly with porosity. If the velocity of sound through solid rock is taken as a measurement of 0% porosity, a slower velocity is an indication of a higher porosity that is usually filled with formation water with a slower sonic velocity.

Both sonic and density-neutron logs give porosity as their primary information. Sonic logs read farther away from the borehole so they are more useful where sections of the borehole are caved. Because they read deeper, they also tend to average more formation than the density-neutron logs do. Modern sonic configurations with pingers and microphones at both ends of the log, combined with computer analysis, minimize the averaging somewhat. Averaging is an advantage when the formation is being evaluated for seismic parameters, a different area of formation evaluation. A special log, the Long Spaced Sonic, is sometimes used for this purpose. Seismic signals (a single undulation of a sound wave in the earth) average together tens to hundreds of feet of formation, so an averaged sonic log is more directly comparable to a seismic waveform.

Density-neutron logs read the formation within about four to of the borehole wall. This is an advantage in resolving thin beds. It is a disadvantage when the hole is badly caved. Corrections can be made automatically if the cave is no more than a few inches deep. A caliper arm on the sonde measures the profile of the borehole and a correction is calculated and incorporated in the porosity reading. However, if the cave is much more than four inches deep, the density-neutron log is reading little more than drilling mud.

===Lithology logs - SP and gamma ray===
There are two other tools, the SP log and the Gamma Ray log, one or both of which are almost always used in wireline logging. Their output is usually presented along with the electric and porosity logs described above. They are indispensable as additional guides to the nature of the rock around the borehole.

The SP log, known variously as a &quot;Spontaneous Potential&quot;, &quot;Self Potential&quot; or &quot;Shale Potential&quot; log is a voltmeter measurement of the voltage or electrical potential difference between the mud in the hole at a particular depth and a copper ground stake driven into the surface of the earth a short distance from the borehole. A salinity difference between the drilling mud and the formation water acts as a natural battery and will cause several voltage effects. This &quot;battery&quot; causes a movement of charged ions between the hole and the formation water where there is enough permeability in the rock. The most important voltage is set up as a permeable formation permits ion movement, reducing the voltage between the formation water and the mud. Sections of the borehole where this occurs then have a voltage difference with other nonpermeable sections where ion movement is restricted. Vertical ion movement in the mud column occurs much more slowly because the mud is not circulating while the drill pipe is out of the hole. The copper surface stake provides a reference point against which the SP voltage is measured for each part of the borehole. There can also be several other minor voltages, due for example to mud filtrate streaming into the formation under the effect of an overbalanced mud system. This flow carries ions and is a voltage generating current. These other voltages are secondary in importance to the voltage resulting from the salinity contrast between mud and formation water.

The nuances of the SP log are still being researched. In theory, almost all porous rocks contain water. Some pores are completely filled with water. Others have a thin layer of water molecules wetting the surface of the rock, with gas or oil filling the rest of the pore. In sandstones and porous limestones there is a continuous layer of water throughout the formation. If there is even a little permeability to water, ions can move through the rock and decrease the voltage difference with the mud nearby. Shales do not allow water or ion movement. Although they may have a large water content, it is bound to the surface of the flat clay crystals comprising the shale. Thus mud opposite shale sections maintains its voltage difference with the surrounding rock. As the SP logging tool is drawn up the hole it measures the voltage difference between the reference stake and the mud opposite shale and sandstone or limestone sections. The resulting log curve reflects the permeability of the rocks and, indirectly, their lithology. SP curves degrade over time, as the ions diffuse up and down the mud column. It also can suffer from stray voltages caused by other logging tools that are run with it. Older, simpler logs often have better SP curves than more modern logs for this reason. With experience in an area, a good SP curve can even allow a skilled interpreter to infer sedimentary environments such as deltas, point bars or offshore tidal deposits.

The gamma ray log is a measurement of naturally occurring gamma radiation from the borehole walls. Sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz and limestones are nonradioactive calcite. Shales however, are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium. Thus the presence or absence of gamma rays in a borehole is an indication of the amount of shale or clay in the surrounding formation. The gamma ray log is useful in holes drilled with air or with oil based muds, as these wells have no SP voltage. Even in water-based muds, the gamma ray and SP logs are often run together. They comprise a check on each other and can indicate unusual shale sections which may either not be radioactive, or may have an abnormal ionic chemistry. The gamma ray log is also useful to detect coal beds, which, depending on the local geology, can have either low radiation levels, or high radiation levels due to adsorption of uranium. In addition, the gamma ray log will work inside a steel casing, making it essential when a cased well must be evaluated.

==Interpreting the tools==

The immediate questions that have to be answered in deciding to complete a well or to plug and abandon (P&amp;A) it are:
*Do any zones in the well contain producible hydrocarbons?
*How much?
*How much, if any, water will be produced with them?

The elementary approach to answering these questions uses the Archie Equation.

<doc id="222314" wikidata="Q2745520" url="?curid=222314" title="Meritage">
<text>Meritage is a name for red and white Bordeaux-style wines without infringing on the Bordeaux (France) region&#x27;s legally protected designation of origin. Winemakers must license the Meritage trademark from its owner, the California-based Meritage Alliance. Member wineries are found principally in the United States, though increasingly elsewhere.

== History ==
The Meritage Association was formed in 1988 by a small group of Sonoma County and Napa Valley, California vintners increasingly frustrated by U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives regulations stipulating wines containing at least 75 percent of a specific grape to be labeled as a varietal. As interest grew in creating Bordeaux-style wines, which by their blended nature fail to qualify for varietal status, members sought to create a recognizable name for their blended wines.

In 1988, the association hosted a contest to conceive a proprietary name for these wines, receiving over 6,000 submissions. &quot;Meritage&quot;—a portmanteau of &quot;merit&quot; and &quot;heritage&quot;—was selected and its coiner awarded two bottles of the first ten vintages of every wine licensed to use the brand.

The first wine to be labeled with the term &quot;Meritage&quot; was the 1986 &quot;The Poet&quot; by Mitch Cosentino (Cosentino Winery) and 1985 vintage by Dry Creek Vineyard was the oldest vintage released &quot;Meritage&quot;.

By 1999, the Meritage Association had grown to 22 members. Shifting its focus from trademark policing to education and marketing resulted in swift growth. By 2003, the Association had over 100 members, including its first international participants. In May 2009, the Meritage Association announced that it had changed its name to the Meritage Alliance. As of July 2014, the Alliance had over 350 members.

== Trademark licensing and wine production ==
The Meritage agreement stipulates the blends that can be labeled &quot;Meritage&quot;, a fee per case (currently $1.00, capped at $500.00 per vintage), and various labeling restrictions.

A red Meritage must be made from a blend of at least two of the following varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot, St. Macaire, Gros Verdot, or Carmenère, with no variety comprising more than 90 percent of the blend.

A white Meritage must be made from a blend of at least two or more of the following varieties: Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon, or Muscadelle du Bordelais, with no variety comprising more than 90 percent of the blend.

Although not stipulated by the licensing agreement, the Meritage Alliance strongly recommends that wineries label only their best blend Meritage and limit production to no more than 25,000 cases.

Unlike regulations like French AOC, there are no mandatory rules related to winemaking or winegrowing.

== Pronunciation ==
Although many people, including many wine experts, have a tendency to the word &quot;Meritage&quot; by pronouncing its last syllable with a &quot;zh&quot; sound, as in the U.S. pronunciation of &quot;garage&quot;, the Meritage Alliance specifically states that the word should be pronounced to rhyme with &quot;heritage&quot;. Meritage should be pronounced .

<text>Interphase is the active portion of the cell cycle that includes the G1, S, and G2 phases, where the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for mitosis, respectively. Interphase was formerly called the &quot;resting phase,&quot; but the cell in interphase is not simply dormant. Calling it so would be misleading since a cell in interphase is very busy synthesizing proteins, transcribing DNA into RNA, engulfing extracellular material, and processing signals, to name just a few activities. The cell is quiescent only in G0. Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life. Interphase is the &quot;daily living&quot; or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, replicates its DNA in preparation for mitosis, and conducts other &quot;normal&quot; cell functions.

A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis, but since mitosis is the division of the nucleus, prophase is actually the first stage.

In interphase, the cell gets itself ready for mitosis or meiosis. Somatic cells, or normal diploid cells of the body, go through mitosis in order to reproduce themselves through cell division, whereas diploid germ cells (i.e., primary spermatocytes and primary oocytes) go through meiosis in order to create haploid gametes (i.e., sperm and ova) for the purpose of sexual reproduction.

==Stages of interphase==
There are three stages of cellular interphase, with each phase ending when a cellular checkpoint checks the accuracy of the stage&#x27;s completion before proceeding to the next. The stages of interphase are:

* G1 (Gap 1), in which the cell grows and functions normally. During this time, a high amount of protein synthesis occurs and the cell grows (to about double its original size) – more organelles are produced and the volume of the cytoplasm increases. If the cell is not to divide again, it will enter G0.
* Synthesis (S), in which the cell synthesizes its DNA and the amount of DNA is doubled but the number of chromosomes remains constant (via semiconservative replication).
* G2 (Gap 2), in which the cell resumes its growth in preparation for division. The cell continues to grow until mitosis begins. In plants, chloroplasts divide during G2.
* In addition, some cells that do not divide often or ever, enter a stage called G0 (Gap zero), which is either a stage separate from interphase or an extended G1.
The duration of time spent in interphase and in each stage of interphase is variable and depends on both the type of cell and the species of organism it belongs to. Most cells of adult mammals spend about 24 hours in interphase; this accounts for about 90%-96% of the total time involved in cell division.
Interphase includes G1, S, and G2 phases. Mitosis and cytokinesis, however, are separate from interphase.

DNA double-strand breaks can be repaired during interphase by two principal processes. The first process, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), can join the two broken ends of DNA in the G1, S and G2 phases of interphase. The second process, homologous recombinational repair (HRR), is more accurate than NHEJ in repairing double-strand breaks. However HRR is only active during the S and G2 phases of interphase when DNA replication is either partially or fully accomplished, since HRR requires two adjacent homologous chromosomes.

==Interphase within sequences of cellular processes==

===Interphase and the cell cycle===
When G2 is completed, the cell enters a relatively brief period of nuclear and cellular division, composed of mitosis and cytokinesis, respectively. After the successful completion of mitosis and cytokinesis, both resulting daughter cells re-enter G1 of interphase.

In the cell cycle, interphase is preceded by telophase and cytokinesis of the M phase. In alternative fashion, interphase is sometimes interrupted by G0 phase, which, in some circumstances, may then end and be followed by the remaining stages of interphase. After the successful completion of the G2 checkpoint, the final checkpoint in interphase, the cell proceeds to prophase, or in plants to preprophase, which is the first stage of mitosis.

G0 phase is viewed as either an extended G1 phase where the cell is neither dividing nor preparing to divide, or as a distinct stage which occurs outside of the cell cycle.

===Interphase and other cellular processes===
In gamete production, interphase is succeeded by meiosis. In programmed cell death, interphase is followed or preempted by apoptosis.

<doc id="222324" wikidata="Q850653" url="?curid=222324" title="Archegonium">
<text>An archegonium (: archegonia), from the Ancient Greek &quot;ἀρχή&quot; (&quot;beginning&quot;) and &quot;γόνος&quot; (&quot;offspring&quot;), is a multicellular structure or organ of the gametophyte phase of certain plants, producing and containing the ovum or female gamete. The corresponding male organ is called the antheridium. The archegonium has a long neck canal or venter and a swollen base. Archegonia are typically located on the surface of the plant thallus, although in the hornworts they are embedded.
==Bryophytes==
In bryophytes and other cryptogams, sperm reach the archegonium by swimming in water films, whereas in Pinophyta and angiosperms, the pollen are delivered by wind or animal vectors and the sperm are delivered by means of a pollen tube.
In the moss &quot;Physcomitrella patens&quot;, archegonia are not embedded but are located on top of the leafy gametophore (s. Figure). The Polycomb protein FIE is expressed in the unfertilized egg cell (right) as the blue colour after GUS staining reveals. Soon after fertilisation, the FIE gene is inactivated (the blue colour is no longer visible, left) in the young embryo.

==Gymnosperms==
They are much-reduced and embedded in the megagametophytes of gymnosperms. The term is not used for angiosperms or the gnetophytes &quot;Gnetum&quot; and &quot;Welwitschia&quot; because the megagametophyte is reduced to just a few cells, one of which differentiates into the egg cell. The function of surrounding the gamete is assumed in large part by diploid cells of the megasporangium (nucellus) inside the ovule. Gymnosperms have their archegonium formed after pollination inside female conifer cones (megastrobili).

<doc id="222325" wikidata="Q460338" url="?curid=222325" title="Imperial circle">
<text>During the early modern period, the Holy Roman Empire was divided into imperial circles (; ; singular: &#x27;,&#x27; ), administrative groupings whose primary purposes were the organization of common defensive structure and the collection of imperial taxes. They were also used as a means of organization within the Imperial Diet and the Imperial Chamber Court. Each circle had a circle diet, although not every member of the circle diet would hold membership of the Imperial Diet as well.

Six imperial circles were introduced at the Diet of Augsburg in 1500. In 1512, three more circles were added, and the large Saxon Circle was split into two, so that from 1512 until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in the Napoleonic era, there were ten imperial circles. The Crown of Bohemia, the Swiss Confederacy and Italy remained unencircled, as did various minor territories which held imperial immediacy.

==Formation==
Initially the 1500 Diet of Augsburg set up six imperial circles as part of the Imperial Reform:
* the Bavarian Circle
* the Franconian Circle
* the Saxon Circle
* the Swabian Circle
* the Upper Rhenish Circle
* the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle

Originally, the territories held by the Habsburg dynasty and the electors remained unencircled. In 1512, the Diet at Trier and Cologne organized these lands into three more circles:
* the Austrian Circle, including the Habsburg territories inherited by Maximilian I
* the Burgundian Circle, including the patrimony of Maximilian&#x27;s late wife, Mary of Burgundy
* the Electoral Rhenish Circle, including the ecclesiastical Electorates of Mainz, Cologne and Trier, and the secular Electorate of the Palatinate.
Also, the Saxon Circle was divided into:
* the Lower Saxon Circle
* the Upper Saxon Circle, including the Electorates of Saxony and Brandenburg

Although the empire lost several western territories after the secession of the Seven United Netherlands in 1581 and during the French annexations of the 1679 Peace of Nijmegen, the ten circles remained largely unchanged until the early 1790s, when the French Revolutionary Wars brought about significant changes to the political map of Europe.

Some of the circles were &quot;de facto&quot; controlled by a powerful noble house. The Austrian Circle corresponded almost exactly with the Habsburg hereditary lands. The Burgundian Circle encompassed the territory controlled by the Spanish Habsburgs (Franche-Comte and the Habsburg Netherlands). The Bavarian Circle mostly consisted of the Wittelsbach Duchy of Bavaria plus its satellites. The Upper Saxon Circle was dominated by the electorates of Saxony (plus its satellite Ernestine duchies) and Brandenburg.

== Responsibilities ==
The Imperial Circles were extremely important in the administration of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1747, Friedrich Carl Moser noted that &quot;the preservation of the imperial system depends largely upon . . . the western imperial circles.&quot; Some historians go even farther, like Hanns Hubert Hofmann, who suggests that &quot;all real state-like functions of the Reich lay exclusively with the circles, not the diet.&quot;

At first, starting as elective districts in 1500, the powers of the Imperial Circles gradually expanded. In 1512 they became responsible for enforcing decrees of the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;, the Imperial Chamber Court. In 1530, the were made responsible for mobilizing contingents of the &quot;Reichsarmee&quot;, and by 1555, they were responsible for protecting the public peace within the Empire. In 1559, the began to regulate imperial coinage.

The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 also drew upon the first attempts at local organization in the circles, particularly in the Swabian Circle. It created a fixed constitution for the circles and gave them authority to keep civil and religious peace in their territories. The princes in each circle met in local assemblies called the &quot;kriestags&quot;, and as such, the circles became a substitute for imperial bureaucracy. After 1555, several circles became effective governmental bodies, especially in Swabia, Franconia, and Lower Saxony. Not only did they carry out orders from the Imperial Diet and Courts, but they also enacted their own legislation. Examples of such include economics, police, and military affairs.

By 1648, some of the Imperial Circles, which became dominated by one or two major powers, began to lose their function. The Austrian and Burgundian circles, both dominated by possessions of the Habsburgs, never developed full constitutions in the first place. Both Saxon circles (for example the Upper Saxon Circle was dominated by Brandenburg and Saxony) stopped convening by 1683, and the Bavarian circle only met on occasion to decide military measures.

==Unencircled territories==

A number of imperial territories remained unencircled, notably the lands of the Bohemian crown, the Old Swiss Confederacy and most of the Italian territories.
Besides these, there were also a considerable number of minor territories which retained imperial immediacy, such as individual Imperial Villages, and the lands held by individual Imperial Knights.

<text>Western Digital Corporation is an American data storage company headquartered in San Jose, California. Established in 1970, the company is one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of hard disk drives (HDDs).

==History==
===1970s===
Western Digital was founded on April 23, 1970, by Alvin B. Phillips, a Motorola employee, as General Digital Corporation, initially a manufacturer of MOS test equipment. It was originally based in Newport Beach, California, shortly thereafter moving to Santa Ana, California, and would go on to become one of the largest technology firms headquartered in Orange County. It rapidly became a specialty semiconductor maker, with start-up capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant Emerson Electric. Around July 1971, it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product, the &quot;WD1402A&quot; UART.

During the early 1970s, the company focused on making and selling calculator chips, and by 1975, Western Digital was the largest independent calculator chip maker in the world. The oil crisis of the mid-1970s and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer, Bowmar Instrument, changed its fortunes, however, and in 1976 Western Digital declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After this, Emerson Electric withdrew their support of the company. Chuck Missler joined Western Digital as chairman and chief executive in June 1977, and became the largest shareholder of Western Digital.

In 1973, Western Digital established its Malaysian plant, initially to manufacture semiconductors.

Western Digital introduced several products during the late 1970s, including the &quot;MCP-1600&quot; multi-chip, microcoded CPU. The MCP-1600 was used to implement DEC&#x27;s LSI-11 system, the WD16, and their own Pascal MicroEngine microcomputer which ran the UCSD p-System Version III and UCSD Pascal. However, the WD integrated circuit that arguably drove Western&#x27;s forward integration was the &quot;FD1771&quot;, one of the first single-chip floppy disk drive formatter/controllers, which could replace significant amounts of TTL logic.

===1980s===
The FD1771 and its kin were Western Digital&#x27;s first entry into the data storage industry; by the early 1980s, they were making hard disk drive controllers, and in 1983, they won the contract to provide IBM with controllers for the PC/AT. That controller, the &quot;WD1003&quot;, became the basis of the ATA interface (which Western Digital developed along with Compaq and Control Data Corporation&#x27;s MPI division, now owned by Seagate Technology), starting in 1986. Throughout most of the 1980s, the family of controllers based on the WD1003 provided the bulk of Western Digital&#x27;s revenues and profits, and for a time generated enormous corporate growth.

Much of the mid-to-late 1980s saw an effort by Western Digital to use the profits from their ATA storage controllers to become a general-purpose OEM hardware supplier for the PC industry. As a result, Western Digital purchased a number of hardware companies. These included graphics cards (through its Paradise Systems subsidiary, purchased 1986, which later became Western Digital Imaging), core logic chipsets (by purchasing Faraday Electronics Inc. in 1987), SCSI controller chips for disk and tape devices (by purchasing ADSI in 1986), networking (&quot;WD8003&quot;, &quot;WD8013&quot; Ethernet and &quot;WD8003S&quot; StarLAN). They did well (especially Paradise, which produced one of the best VGA cards of the era), but storage-related chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers. In 1986, they introduced the &quot;WD33C93&quot; single-chip SCSI interface, which was used in the first 16-bit bus mastering SCSI host adapter, the &quot;WD7000 &quot;FASST&quot;&quot;; in 1987 they introduced the &quot;WD37C65&quot;, a single-chip implementation of the PC/AT&#x27;s floppy disk controller circuitry, and the grandfather of modern super I/O chips; in 1988 they introduced the &quot;WD42C22 &quot;Vanilla&quot;&quot;, the first single-chip ATA hard disk controller.

1988 also brought what would be the biggest change in Western Digital&#x27;s history. That year, Western Digital bought the hard drive production assets of PC hardware maker Tandon; the first products of that union under Western Digital&#x27;s own name were the &quot;Centaur&quot; series of ATA and XT attachment drives.

===1990s===


By 1991, things were starting to slow down, as the PC industry moved from ST-506 and ESDI drives to ATA and SCSI, and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards. That year saw the rise of Western Digital&#x27;s &quot;Caviar&quot; drives, brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems.

Eventually, the successful sales of the Caviar drives resulted in Western Digital starting to sell some of its divisions. Paradise was sold to Philips, and since disappeared. Its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to SMC Networks and its SCSI chip business went to Future Domain, which was later bought out by market leader Adaptec. Around 1995, the technological lead that the Caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies, especially Quantum Corp., and Western Digital fell into a slump.

In 1994, Western Digital began producing hard drives at its Malaysian factory, employing 13,000 people.

Products and ideas of this time did not go far. The &quot;Portfolio&quot; drive (a form factor model, developed with JT Storage) was a flop, as was the SDX hard disk to CD-ROM interface. Western Digital&#x27;s drives started to slip further behind competing products, and quality began to suffer; system builders and PC enthusiasts who used to recommend Western Digital above all else, were going to the competition, particularly Maxtor, whose products had improved significantly by the late 1990s.

In an attempt to turn the tide in 1998, Western Digital recruited the help of IBM. This agreement gave Western Digital the rights to use certain IBM technologies, including giant magneto-resistive (GMR) heads and access to IBM production facilities. The result was the &quot;Expert&quot; line of drives, introduced in early 1999. The idea worked, and Western Digital regained respect in the press and among users, even despite a recall in 2000 (which was due to bad motor driver chips). Western Digital later broke ties with IBM.

===2000s===


In 2001, Western Digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ATA hard disk drives with 8 MiB of disk buffer. At that time, most desktop hard disk drives had 2 MB of buffer. Western Digital labeled these 8 MB models as &quot;Special Edition&quot; and distinguished them with the &quot;JB&quot; code (the 2 MB models had the &quot;BB&quot; code). The first 8 MB cache drive was the 100 GB WD1000JB, followed by other models starting with 40 GB capacity. Western Digital advertised the JB models for cost-effective file servers. In October 2001, Western Digital restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.101 and the reclassification of Connex and SANavigator results as discontinued operations.

In 2003, Western Digital acquired most of the assets of bankrupt one-time market leading magnetic hard drive read-write head developer Read-Rite Corporation for $95 million. In the same year, Western Digital offered the first 10,000 rpm Serial ATA HDD, the WD360GD &quot;Raptor&quot;, with a capacity of 36 GB and an average access time of less than six milliseconds. Soon, the 74 GB WD740GD followed, which was also much quieter. In 2004, Western Digital redesigned its logo for the first time since 1997, with the design of new logo focusing on the company&#x27;s initials (&quot;WD&quot;). In 2005, Western Digital released a 150 GB version, the WD1500ADFD, which was also available in a special version with a transparent window enabling the user to see the drive&#x27;s heads move over the platters while the drive read and wrote data (Raptor X, WD1500AHFD). The biggest capacity 3,5 inch Raptor is the WD1600ADFD, with 160 GB of disk space. , the Western Digital Raptor drives have a five-year warranty, making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers, where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure.

In 2006, Western Digital introduced its My Book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact book-like design. On October 7, 2007, Western Digital released several editions of a single 1 TB hard drive, the largest in its My Book line.
In 2007, Western Digital acquired magnetic media maker Komag. Also in the same year, Western Digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives. This allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time. Western Digital also started to produce the energy efficient GP (Green Power) range of drives.

In 2007, Western Digital announced the WD GP drive touting rotational speed &quot;between 7200 and 5400 rpm&quot;, which is technically correct while also being misleading; the drive spins at 5405 rpm, and the Green Power spin speed is not variable. WD GP drives are programmed to unload the heads whenever idle for a very short period of time. Many Linux installations write to the file system a few times a minute in the background. As a result, there may be 100 or more load cycles per hour, and the 300,000 load cycles rating of a WD GP drive may be exceeded in less than a year.

On April 21, 2008, Western Digital announced the next generation of its 10,000 rpm SATA WD Raptor series of hard drives. The new drives, called WD VelociRaptor, featured 300 GB capacity and platters enclosed in the IcePack, a mounting frame with a built-in heat sink. Western Digital said that the new drives are 35 percent faster than the previous generation. On September 12, 2008, Western Digital shipped a 500 GB notebook hard drive which is part of their Scorpio Blue series of notebook hard drives.

On January 27, 2009, Western Digital shipped the first 2 TB internal hard disk drive. On March 30, 2009, they entered the solid-state drive market with the acquisition of Siliconsystems, Inc. Its acquisition was unsuccessful, and few years later Western Digital discontinued all solid-state storage products based on Siliconsystems design (&quot;SiliconEdge&quot; and &quot;SiliconDrive&quot; families of SSDs and memory cards), but its inventions was used later in development of various other solid-state storage products, with larger developments going on after 2016 acquisition of SanDisk.

On July 27, 2009, Western Digital announced the first 1 TB mobile hard disk drive, which shipped as both a Passport series portable USB drive as well as a Scorpio Blue series notebook drive.

In October 2009, Western Digital announced the shipment of first 3 TB internal hard disk drive, which has 750 GB-per-platter density with SATA interface.

===2010s===
In March 2011, Western Digital agreed to acquire parts of the storage unit of Hitachi, HGST, for about $4.3 billion of which $3.5 billion was paid in cash and the rest with 25 million shares of Western Digital.

In 2011, Western Digital established an R&amp;D facility at its Malaysian plant at a cost of 1.2 billion US dollars.

In March 2012, Western Digital completed the acquisition of HGST and became the largest traditional hard drive manufacturer in the world. To address the requirements of regulatory agencies, in May 2012 Western Digital divested assets to manufacture and sell certain 3.5-inch hard drives for the desktop and consumer electronics markets to Toshiba, in exchange for one of its 2.5-inch hard drive factories in Thailand.

In December 2013, Western Digital stopped manufacturing parallel ATA hard disk drives for laptops (2.5-inch form factor) and desktop PCs (3.5-inch form factor). Until that time, they were last hard disk manufacturer to produce PATA hard disk drives. Furthermore, they were the only manufacturer that had 250 GB and 320 GB in 2.5-inch form factor.

In February 2014, Western Digital announced a new &quot;Purple&quot; line of hard disk drives for use in video surveillance systems, with capacities from 1 to 4 TB. They feature internal optimizations for applications that involve near-constant disk writing, and &quot;AllFrame&quot; technology which is designed to reduce write errors.
In October 2015, after being required to operate the company autonomously from WD, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a decision allowing the company to begin integrating HGST into its main business, but under the condition that it maintain the HGST brand and sales team for at least two more years. The HGST brand was phased out in 2018, and since then, all HGST-branded products were rebranded to Western Digital.

In May 2016, Western Digital acquired SanDisk for US$19 billion. In the summer of 2017, Western Digital licensed the Fusion-io/SanDisk ION Accelerator software to One Stop Systems.

In 2016, HGST closed its Malaysian plant.

In April 2017, Western Digital moved its headquarters from Irvine, California to HGST&#x27;s headquarters in San Jose, California.

In August 2017, Western Digital bought cloud storage provider Upthere, with the intention to continue building out the service.

In September 2017, Western Digital acquired Tegile Systems, maker of flash memory storage arrays. Western Digital rebranded Tegile as IntelliFlash and sold it to DataDirect Networks in September 2019.

In October 2017, Western Digital shipped the world&#x27;s first 14 TB HDD, the helium-filled HGST Ultrastar Hs14.

In December 2017, Western Digital reached an agreement with Toshiba about the sale of the jointly owned NAND production facility in Japan.
In June 2018, Western Digital acquired Wearable, Inc., a small company based in the Chicago area that produced the SanDisk Wireless Drive and SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick, which were derived from Wearable Inc.’s AirStash wireless server platform.

In May 2018, Toshiba reached an agreement with the Bain consortium about the sale of that chip unit.

In July 2018, Western Digital announced their plan to close their hard disk production facility in Kuala Lumpur to shift the company towards flash drive production, leaving the company with just two HDD production facilities in Thailand. The company ranked 158th on the 2018 Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.

In June 2019, Kioxia experienced a power cut at one of its factories in Yokkaichi, Japan, resulting in the loss of at least 6 exabytes of flash memory, with some sources estimating the loss as high as 15 exabytes. Western Digital used (and still uses) Kioxia&#x27;s facilities for making its own flash memory chips.

===2020s===

In November 2020, Western Digital produced a new consumer SSD, the WD Black SN850 1TB. Using a proprietary NVMe version 1.4 controller (&quot;G2&quot;), it is reported to outperform Samsung&#x27;s 980 Pro 1TB as well as other, new-to-market SSDs containing the Phison E18 controller that arrived after the SN850 became available. The only higher-performing SSD at that time was Intel&#x27;s Optane line, which is a non-consumer, workstation/server-based SSD with a cost of over five times the SN850.

In June 2021, users reported that their My Book Live NAS drives, which were discontinued products last manufactured in 2013, had been erased, leading to the company advising that the devices be disconnected from the internet.

In August 2021, Western Digital and Japanese memory-chip supplier Kioxia (formerly Toshiba Memory) began working out the details of a merger to be finalized in September 2021. In October of the same year, it became clear that the merger talks stalled.

In February 2022, Western Digital and Kioxia reported that contamination issues have affected the output of their flash memory joint-production factories, with WD admitting that at least 6.5 exabytes of memory output being affected. The Kiakami and Yokkaichi factories in Japan stopped producing due to the contamination.

WD experienced a cyberattack breaching the company&#x27;s systems on March 23, 2023. On April 2, the company proactively took some services offline, including My Cloud, to examine the extent of the intrusion. The attackers allegedly exfiltrated around 10 TB of data from the company, including customer information, and demanded a ransom of &quot;minimum 8 figures&quot; to not publish the data.

Merger talks with Kioxia resumed in 2023, but was called off after Kioxia&#x27;s largest shareholder Bain Capital and indirect shareholder SK Hynix declared their opposition to the deal in October.

On February 24, 2025, Western Digital spun off its flash memory business as Sandisk Corporation, leaving WD solely focused on hard disk drives; the spin-off would effectively reverse Western Digital&#x27;s earlier acquisition of SanDisk, but would also include flash storage product lines that were previously sold under the WD brand.

==Products==

Western Digital&#x27;s offerings include hard drives for personal computers, security surveillance systems, video game consoles, network-attached storage (NAS), and set-top boxes. Western Digital sells datacenter hardware and software including an enterprise-class Ultrastar product line that was previously sold under the HGST brand. 

Its storage product lines are divided into brands based on colors, based on their intended use case:
WD Purple hard drives are designed for write-heavy workloads, such as security cameras. These drives feature AllFrame technology, which attempts to reduce video frame loss, time limited error recovery, and support for the ATA streaming command set.

External hard drives are sold under the My Passport, My Book, WD Elements, and Easystore brands. Western Digital external hard drives with encryption software (sold under the My Passport brand) have been reported to have severe data protection faults and to be easy to decrypt. After first offering the Western Digital Media Center in 2004 (which was actually only a storage device), Western Digital offered the WD TV series of products between 2008 and 2016. The WD TV series of products functioned as a home theater PC, able to play videos, images, and music from USB drives or network locations.

Western Digital offers the My Cloud series of products, which function as home media servers. In September 2015, Western Digital released My Cloud OS 3, a platform that enables connected HDDs to sync between PCs and mobile devices.

Through Western Digital&#x27;s acquisition of Upthere, the company offers personal cloud storage through the Upthere Home app and UpOS operating system.

===Former products===

==Corporate affairs==
Western Digital Capital is Western Digital&#x27;s investment arm. It has contributed funding for data technology companies such as Elastifile and Avere Systems.

===Lawsuits===
Lawsuits have been filed against various manufacturers including Western Digital, related to the claimed capacity of their drives. The drives are labelled using the convention of 103 (1,000) bytes to the kilobyte, resulting in a perceived capacity shortfall when reported by most operating systems, which tend to use 210 (1,024) bytes to the kilobyte.

While Western Digital maintained that they used &quot;the indisputably correct industry standard for measuring and describing storage capacity&quot;, and that they &quot;cannot be expected to reform the software industry&quot;, they agreed to settle in March 2006, with a $30 refund to affected customers in the form of backup and recovery software of the same value.

In May 2020, Western Digital was sued for using shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology in its WD Red line of consume NAS drives without explicitly informing consumers. The lawsuit alleged that SMR technology is not suitable for the advertised use of the drives in a RAID array. Seagate, another data storage company and a direct competitor of Western Digital, stated that SMR is not suitable for NAS use and that Seagate uses only conventional magnetic recording (CMR) in its NAS-oriented products. In June 2020, in response to the controversy, Western Digital announced that it would adopt the &quot;Red Plus&quot; brand for drive models that utilize CMR; the &quot;WD Red&quot; brand would be used primarily for drives utilizing SMR, and Western Digital would promote these drives as primarily being for low-intensity, small office/home office use cases.

<text>Kasinadhuni Viswanath (19 February 1930 – 2 February 2023) was an Indian film director, screenwriter, lyricist and actor who predominantly worked in Telugu cinema. One of the greatest auteurs of Indian cinema, he received international recognition for his works, and is known for blending parallel cinema with mainstream cinema. He was honuored with the &quot;Prize of the Public&quot; at the &quot;Besançon Film Festival of France&quot; in 1981. In 1992, he received the Andhra Pradesh state Raghupathi Venkaiah Award, and the civilian honour Padma Shri for his contribution to the field of arts. In 2016, he was conferred with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest award in Indian cinema. He is popularly known as &quot;Kalatapasvi.&quot;

Viswanath started his film career as an audiographer and over sixty years, he has directed 53 feature films in a variety of genres, including central themes based on performing arts, visual arts, aesthetics, melodrama, and poetry. Viswanath&#x27;s filmography is known for addressing the issues of caste, colour, disability, gender discrimination, misogyny, alcoholism and socio-economic challenges through liberal arts medium.

Viswanath&#x27;s classic blockbusters &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; (1980) and &quot;Sagara Sangamam&quot; (1983) were featured among CNN-IBN&#x27;s &quot;100 greatest Indian films of all time&quot;. His directorial works &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; and &quot;Saptapadi&quot; (1981) fetched the National Film Awards for Best Popular Film for Providing Wholesome Entertainment and Best Feature Film on National Integration, respectively. &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot;, was featured at the 8th IFFI, the Tashkent Film Festival, the Moscow International Film Festival, and the Besançon Film Festival.

Viswanath&#x27;s &quot;Swathi Muthyam&quot; (1986) was India&#x27;s official entry to the 59th Academy Awards. &quot;Swathi Muthyam&quot;, &quot;Sagara Sangamam&quot; and &quot;Sirivennela&quot; (1986), were featured at the Asia-Pacific Film Festival. &quot;Swayamkrushi&quot; (1987) was screened to special mention at the Moscow International Film Festival. &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot;, &quot;Sagara Sangamam&quot;, &quot;Sruthilayalu&quot; (1987), &quot;Swarnakamalam&quot; (1988), and &quot;Swathi Kiranam&quot; (1992) were featured in the Indian Panorama sections of IFFI, Ann Arbor Film Festival, and AISFM Film Festival respectively.

Viswanath is a recipient of five National Film Awards, seven state Nandi Awards, ten Filmfare Awards South, and a Filmfare Award in Hindi. His directorial works which are produced by Poornodaya Movie Creations were screened to special mention at the Moscow International Film Festival; such films were dubbed into Russian language and have been theatrically released in Moscow.

== Early life ==
Viswanath was born on 19 February 1930 in a Telugu family to Kasinadhuni Subramanyam and Kasinadhuni Saraswathy (Saraswathamma) in Repalle of Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. His ancestral roots come from Pedapulivarru, Andhra Pradesh, a small village on the banks of River Krishna. Viswanath studied Intermediate from Guntur Hindu College, and holds a BSc degree from Andhra Christian College of Andhra University. He began his career as a sound recordist at Vauhini Studios in Madras, where his father was an associate. There, he apprenticed under the guidance of A Krishnan, who was the Head of Sound Engineering at Vauhini. Viswanath and A Krishnan developed a close rapport and later after the former made the transition into film direction, he would always bounce ideas off the latter. Viswanath made his entry into film direction at Annapurna Pictures under Adurthi Subba Rao and K. Ramnoth. He wished to work as an assistant to director K. Balachander and Bapu.

== Career ==
During his early career, Viswanath was associated with Adurthi Subba Rao on National Award-winning films such as &quot;Mooga Manasulu&quot; (1964) and &quot;Doctor Chakravarty&quot; (1964). Viswanath scripted &quot;Sudigundalu&quot; (1968), and directed works such as &quot;Aatma Gowravam&quot; (1965), &quot;O Seeta Katha&quot; (1974) and &quot;Jeevana Jyothi&quot; (1975) which garnered the state Nandi Awards, and were screened at the Asian and African film Festival at Tashkent.

In 1951 he started as an assistant director in the Telugu-Tamil Film &quot;Pathala Bhairavi&quot; (1951). In 1965, Viswanath debuted as a director with Telugu film &quot;Aatma Gowravam&quot; (1965), which won the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film of the year. Viswanath followed it up with drama films &quot;Chelleli Kapuram&quot; (1971), &quot;Sarada&quot; (1973), &quot;O Seeta Katha&quot; (1974) and &quot;Jeevana Jyoti&quot; (1975) which are women-centric films. It was in &quot;Siri Siri Muvva&quot; (1976) that the artistic touch in his craft first became visible.

&quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; (1980) highlights the neglect of traditional Indian music under the increasing influence of western music. The film brings out the grandeur of Carnatic music, the traditional South Indian music towards the end. Bhaskaran, a media and film researcher from Chennai has documented, in his study of South Indian music culture, how &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot; contributed to the revival of Carnatic music in a big way. The film broke many commercial records by running for over one year in cinemas. In a recent study published in &quot;Journal of Dance, Movements &amp; Spiritualities&quot; published by &quot;Intellect Group&quot; of the United Kingdom, C. S. H. N. Murthy, a media and film studies scholar from India, has demonstrated how Viswanath&#x27;s filmography embraces a wide spectrum of characters that include mentally and physically challenged subjects as well, like the film &quot;Sarada&quot; (1973), which exploits a psychologically deranged woman, &quot;Swathi Muthyam&quot; (1986), which exploits an autistic man&#x27;s humanism, &quot;Sirivennela&quot; (1986) which revels in situations between deaf and dumb characters, and &quot;Kalam Marindi&quot; (1972), which dwells on characters stuck in a caste-based society.

Film researcher, C. S. H. N. Murthy observed that Viswanath&#x27;s films offer a pathway towards inclusiveness, affecting positive spiritual change at both personal and social levels. Situating the content in the broad arena of de-westernizing media studies, through immersive and culturally embedded perspectives, Murthy endeavoured to offer modern and postmodern dimensions in Viswanath&#x27;s films.

=== Films with social issues ===
Viswanath has made many films dealing with a wide range of human and social issues: &quot;Saptapadi&quot;, &quot;Sirivennela&quot;, &quot;Sutradharulu&quot;, &quot;Subhalekha&quot;, &quot;Sruthilayalu&quot;, &quot;Subha Sankalpam&quot;, &quot;Aapadbandhavudu&quot;, &quot;Swayam Krushi&quot;, and &quot;Swarnakamalam&quot; have lead characters representing different strata of society, meticulously etched to suit the larger picture.

In &quot;Saptapadi&quot;, he decries the evils of untouchability and the caste system. In &quot;Subhodayam&quot; and &quot;Swayam Krushi&quot; he emphasizes the dignity and respectability of manual labor. In &quot;Subhalekha&quot;, he deals, in a humorous way, with the dowry system – one of the major evils in today&#x27;s society. While &quot;Sutradharulu&quot; urges present-day society to recognize the need to adopt the ideals of non-violence, &quot;Swati Kiranam&quot; depicts the harm that can be caused by the basic instincts of envy and anger in a man, however accomplished he may be.

In spite of the nature of these subjects, they are presented in a subtle manner with an imaginative storyline, with just the right amount of emphasis on the intended message. Yet Viswanath&#x27;s films were never offbeat cinema, but wholesome entertainers those elevated the lead actors&#x27; image. He is a director with social-conscious mind and who believes cinema can bring out desirable changes in society if presented in a format liked by a cross-section of audience.

=== Association with Poornodaya Creations ===
Edida Nageswara Rao founded &quot;Poornodaya Movie Creations&quot;, which encouraged Viswanath to make aesthetic films. Poornodaya has produced several of Viswanath&#x27;s films like &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot;, &quot;Swatimutyam&quot;, &quot;Saagarasangamam&quot;, &quot;Sutradharulu&quot;, and &quot;Aapadbandhavudu&quot;. Most of these films were dubbed into Russian and were screened at the Moscow Film Festival.

=== Hindi cinema ===
Viswanath has also directed Hindi language films such as &quot;Sargam&quot; (1979), &quot;Kaamchor&quot; (1982), &quot;Shubh Kaamna&quot; (1983), &quot;Jaag Utha Insan&quot; (1984), &quot;Sur Sangam&quot; (1985), &quot;Sanjog&quot; (1985), &quot;Eeshwar&quot; (1989), &quot;Sangeet&quot; (1992) and &quot;Dhanwan&quot; (1993). Some of these films (especially his collaboration with actress Jaya Prada) have been super hits at the box office.

=== Acting ===

In Sanskrit &quot;Kamal&quot; means &quot;lotus&quot;, but it was rumoured that his name originated with a friend of his father (Yaakob Hassan, a Muslim freedom fighter who was imprisoned along with Kamal&#x27;s father by the British).

Haasan began his political journey from late President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam&#x27;s residence and his memorial at Rameswaram. His party contested in 37 seats in 2019 Indian general election and lost. Makkal Needhi Maiam&#x27;s vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election was 3.72% (in the seats it contested).

He unsuccessfully contested the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election from Coimbatore South and lost to BJP Mahila Morcha President Vanathi Srinivasan by a narrow margin.

==Awards and honours==
Haasan received, in 1990, the Padma Shri, and, in 2014, the Padma Bhushan for his contributions to Indian cinema. At age six, he won the President&#x27;s gold medal for Best Child Actor for his debut film, &quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot;. He is tied with Mammootty for the second most Best Actor National Film Awards with three. He won a National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil for producing the 1992 Tamil film, &quot;Thevar Magan&quot;. He has a record 20 Filmfare Awards in five languages; after his last award, in 2000, he wrote to the organisation requesting no further awards. In 2003, his films &quot;Hey Ram&quot;, &quot;Pushpak&quot;, &quot;Nayakan&quot; and &quot;Kuruthipunal&quot; were showcased in the &quot;Director in Focus&quot; category at the Rotterdam Film Festival. In 2004, &quot;Virumaandi&quot; won the inaugural Best Asian film award at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan).

In 2005, Sathyabama Deemed University awarded Haasan an honorary doctorate. He received the Chevalier Sivaji Ganesan Award for Excellence in Indian Cinema at the inaugural Vijay Awards in 2006. He received the Living Legend Award in 2007 from FICCI. In 2010, the United Progressive Alliance government organised a retrospective of his films. Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said the actor was unique, since his films broke regional and language barriers. That year, the government of Kerala honoured him for 50 years in Indian cinema during statewide Onam celebrations in Thiruvananthapuram.

Haasan received the Kalaimamani Award from the government of Tamil Nadu in 1979. Other honours include Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, Nandi, Screen and Vijay Awards, including four awards for his performance in &quot;Dasavathaaram&quot;. In 2009 he was appointed chairman of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Media and Entertainment Business Conclave, organised by FICCI&#x27;s entertainment division. He is on the academic advisory council for ISFM (International school of Film+Media), and was the first Indian actor invited aboard an American ship as a special friend of the US. In April 2013 he received an award on behalf of Indian cinema from Chris Brown, executive vice-president for conventions and business operations of the National Association of Broadcasters, as part of the New York Festivals International Film &amp; TV Awards. He is one of 20 film celebrities recognised by Coca-Cola India with the launch of the 24th edition of the &quot;Limca Book of Records&quot; in 2013. Recently honoured with S. S. Vasan Award for his lifetime achievement in film industry by Ananda Vikatan.

== Legacy ==
Mani Ratnam who directed Haasan in &quot;Nayakan&quot;, has said that there are many things he can do that no other actor can. Veteran actor Nagesh called Haasan the best actor he had ever seen. His contributions to the film industry have been praised by his contemporaries, including Mammootty, Mohanlal, Prithviraj Sukumaran, Sridevi, Amitabh Bachchan, Venkatesh, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan. Younger actors (Suriya and Madhavan) and filmmakers (Bala, Ameer and Gautham Menon) have been inspired by him.

Hollywood filmmaker Barrie M. Osburne called Haasan&#x27;s knowledge of literature, history and films &quot;encyclopedic&quot;, and Ang Lee said he was stunned by his brilliance and knowledge of films. Some of his films were inspired from Hollywood films.

&#x27;The Week&#x27;, in its 13 September 1992 edition, reported that Chiranjeevi charged Rs. 12.5 million per film, which was the highest remuneration for an Indian actor at the time. In 1994, Haasan became the first Indian actor to charge 15 million per film.

==Controversies==
In 2015, Haasan was criticised by the-then Tamil Nadu Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam, who stated that Haasan was &quot;confused&quot; and had &quot;blabbered&quot;, unaware of the ground reality for his statement on the government&#x27;s response to rain relief efforts. Haasan was also criticised by &quot;Nayakan&quot; producer Muktha Srinivasan for his article in &quot;The Hindu&quot; taking unnecessary credit for that film. Directors like Bharathan, who was irked by the unnecessary interferences of Kamal during the filming of &quot;Thevar Magan&quot;, and Balachandra Menon, who criticized Kamal for making his film, &quot;Kanden Seethaiyai&quot;, shelved by leaving the project, were some of the filmmakers who had rifts with Kamal. Sibi Malayil was supposed to direct the film Gunaa. But when he understood that Kamal Haasan would take the decisions regarding the making of film, Sibi withdrew from the project.

Haasan has been accused of self-indulgence, and has been criticised for sexually explicit scenes and themes, offending religious sentiments and superficiality on social issues depicted in his films. There have also been complaints about his obsession with perfection, which may have caused some of his films to run over budget. He was also accused of kissing actress Rekha Harris without her consent in a scene during the shooting of &quot;Punnagai Mannan&quot;. Many, including singer Chinmayi Sripaada, consider it as sexual harassment. His former partner Gautami had said that Kamal Haasan hasn&#x27;t paid her salary dues since 2016. She also accused Haasan of hurting her film prospects by preventing her from working with others. In November 2017, Haasan said that right-wing Hindus have started employing extremism to propagate their communal agenda.

<doc id="222348" wikidata="Q674415" url="?curid=222348" title="Kamal (navigation)">
<text>A kamal, often called simply &quot;khashaba&quot; (wood in Arabic), is a celestial navigation device that determines latitude. The invention of the kamal allowed for the earliest known latitude sailing, and was thus the earliest step towards the use of quantitative methods in navigation. It originated with Arab navigators of the late 9th century, and was employed in the Indian Ocean from the 10th century. It was adopted by Indian navigators soon after, and then adopted by Chinese navigators some time before the 16th century.

==Description==
 Because Polaris is currently close to the celestial pole, its elevation is a good approximation of the latitude of the observer. The kamal consists of a rectangular wooden card about , to which a string with several equally spaced knots is attached through a hole in the middle of the card. The kamal is used by placing one end of the string in the teeth while the other end is held away from the body roughly parallel to the ground. The card is then moved along the string, positioned so the lower edge is even with the horizon, and the upper edge is occluding a target star, typically Polaris because its angle to the horizon does not change with longitude or time. The angle can then be measured by counting the number of knots from the teeth to the card, or a particular knot can be tied into the string if travelling to a known latitude.

==Make your own kamal==
it is not necessary to follow a certain standard or calculation to make your own kamal; all you need is piece of wood, string and help of a sextant or any angle measuring device for the first calibration of your personal kamal. Choose any object, preferably Polaris. Take the angle reading with the sextant, for example 24. Then take a reading with the kamal, for example 15cm as the length of the string to the board, therefore 15cm is equal to 24 degrees. You can keep making different readings the same way for different objects until you have your own standard of measurements. Helpful tip - make a calibration card and print it on the kamal board itself, for example 30cm=45 degrees, and 20cm=30 degrees.

The knots were typically tied to measure angles of one finger-width. When held at arm&#x27;s length, the width of a finger measures an angle that remains fairly similar from person to person. This was widely used (and still is today) for rough angle measurements, an angle known as &quot;issabah إصبع&quot; in Arabic or a &quot;zhi&quot; 指 in Chinese (both meaning &#x27;finger&#x27;). By modern measure, this is about 1 degree, 36 minutes, and 25 seconds, or just over 1.5 degrees. It is equal to the arcsine of the ratio of the width of the finger to the length of the arm. In Chinese navigation, the unit of &quot;jiao&quot; 角 is also used to represent a quarter 指 (an angle of 24 minutes 6 seconds).

Due to the limited width of the card, the kamal was only really useful for measuring Polaris in equatorial latitudes, where Polaris remains close to the horizon. This fact may explain why it was not common in Europe. For these higher-latitude needs somewhat more complex devices based on the same principle were used, notably the cross-staff and backstaff.

The kamal is still a tool recommended for use in sea kayaking. In such an application, it can be used for estimating distances to land. The distance can be calculated from the formula

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the distance to the object, formula_3 is the size of the object observed, formula_4 is the distance from the kamal to the observer&#x27;s eye, and formula_5 is the size of the kamal.

<text>Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy is a classification of computer architectures, proposed by Michael J. Flynn in 1966 and extended in 1972. The classification system has stuck, and it has been used as a tool in the design of modern processors and their functionalities. Since the rise of multiprocessing central processing units (CPUs), a multiprogramming context has evolved as an extension of the classification system. Vector processing, covered by Duncan&#x27;s taxonomy, is missing from Flynn&#x27;s work because the Cray-1 was released in 1977: Flynn&#x27;s second paper was published in 1972.

==Classifications==
The four initial classifications defined by Flynn are based upon the number of concurrent instruction (or control) streams and data streams available in the architecture. Flynn defined three additional sub-categories of SIMD in 1972.
===Single instruction stream, single data stream (SISD)===

A sequential computer which exploits no parallelism in either the instruction or data streams. Single control unit (CU) fetches a single instruction stream (IS) from memory. The CU then generates appropriate control signals to direct a single processing element (PE) to operate on a single data stream (DS) i.e., one operation at a time.

Examples of SISD architectures are the traditional uniprocessor machines like older personal computers (PCs) (by 2010, many PCs had multiple cores) and mainframe computers.

===Single instruction stream, multiple data streams (SIMD)===

A single instruction is simultaneously applied to multiple different data streams. Instructions can be executed sequentially, such as by pipelining, or in parallel by multiple functional units.
Flynn&#x27;s 1972 paper subdivided SIMD down into three further categories: 
* Array processor – These receive the one (same) instruction but each parallel processing unit has its own separate and distinct memory and register file.
* Pipelined processor – These receive the one (same) instruction but then read data from a central resource, each processes fragments of that data, then writes back the results to the same central resource. In Figure 5 of Flynn&#x27;s 1972 paper that resource is main memory: for modern CPUs that resource is now more typically the register file.
* Associative processor – These receive the one (same) instruction but in each parallel processing unit an &quot;independent&quot; decision is made, based on data &quot;local&quot; to the unit, as to whether to perform the execution or whether to skip it. In modern terminology this is known as &quot;predicated&quot; (masked) SIMD.

==== Array processor ====

The modern term for an array processor is &quot;single instruction, multiple threads&quot; (SIMT). This is a distinct classification in Flynn&#x27;s 1972 taxonomy, as a subcategory of SIMD. It is identifiable by the parallel subelements having their own independent register file and memory (cache and data memory). Flynn&#x27;s original papers cite two historic examples of SIMT processors: SOLOMON and ILLIAC IV.

Nvidia commonly uses the term in its marketing materials and technical documents, where it argues for the novelty of its architecture. SOLOMON predates Nvidia by more than 60 years.

The Aspex Microelectronics Associative String Processor (ASP) categorised itself in its marketing material as &quot;massive wide SIMD&quot; but had &quot;bit-level&quot; ALUs and bit-level predication (Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy: associative processing), and each of the 4096 processors had their own registers and memory (Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy: array processing). The Linedancer, released in 2010, contained 4096 2-bit predicated SIMD ALUs, each with its own content-addressable memory, and was capable of 800 billion instructions per second. Aspex&#x27;s ASP associative array SIMT processor predates NVIDIA by 20 years.

==== Pipelined processor ====

At the time that Flynn wrote his 1972 paper many systems were using main memory as the resource from which pipelines were reading and writing. When the resource that all &quot;pipelines&quot; read and write from is the register file rather than main memory, modern variants of SIMD result. Examples include Altivec, NEON, and AVX. 

An alternative name for this type of register-based SIMD is &quot;packed SIMD&quot; and another is SIMD within a register (SWAR). When predication is applied, it becomes associative processing (below)

==== Associative processor ====

The modern term for associative processor is &quot;predicated&quot; (or masked) SIMD. Examples include AVX-512.

Some modern designs (GPUs in particular) take features of more than one of these subcategories: GPUs of today are SIMT but also are Associative i.e. each processing element in the SIMT array is also predicated.

===Multiple instruction streams, single data stream (MISD)===

Multiple instructions operate on one data stream. This is an uncommon architecture which is generally used for fault tolerance. Heterogeneous systems operate on the same data stream and must agree on the result. Examples include the Space Shuttle flight control computer.

===Multiple instruction streams, multiple data streams (MIMD)===

Multiple autonomous processors simultaneously execute different instructions on different data. MIMD architectures include multi-core superscalar processors, and distributed systems, using either one shared memory space or a distributed memory space.

==Diagram comparing classifications==
These four architectures are shown below visually. Each processing unit (PU) is shown for a uni-core or multi-core computer:
==Further divisions==
, all of the top 10 and most of the TOP500 supercomputers are based on a MIMD architecture.

Although these are not part of Flynn&#x27;s work, some further divide the MIMD category into the two categories below, and even further subdivisions are sometimes considered.

===Single program, multiple data streams (SPMD)===

Multiple autonomous processors simultaneously executing the same program (but at independent points, rather than in the lockstep that SIMD imposes) on different data. Also termed &quot;single process, multiple data&quot; - the use of this terminology for SPMD is technically incorrect, as SPMD is a parallel execution model and assumes multiple cooperating processors executing a program. SPMD is the most common style of explicit parallel programming. The SPMD model and the term was proposed by Frederica Darema of the RP3 team.

===Multiple programs, multiple data streams (MPMD)===

Multiple autonomous processors simultaneously operating at least two independent programs. In HPC contexts, such systems often pick one node to be the &quot;host&quot; (&quot;the explicit host/node programming model&quot;) or &quot;manager&quot; (the &quot;Manager/Worker&quot; strategy), which runs one program that farms out data to all the other nodes which all run a second program. Those other nodes then return their results directly to the manager. An example of this would be the Sony PlayStation 3 game console, with its SPU/PPU processor.

MPMD is common in non-HPC contexts. For example, the make build system can build multiple dependencies in parallel, using target-dependent programs in addition to the make executable itself. MPMD also often takes the form of pipelines. A simple Unix shell command like &quot;ls | grep &quot;A&quot; | more&quot; launches three processes running separate programs in parallel with the output of one used as the input to the next.

These are both distinct from the explicit parallel programming used in HPC in that the individual programs are generic building blocks rather than implementing part of a specific parallel algorithm. In the pipelining approach, the amount of available parallelism does not increase with the size of the data set.
