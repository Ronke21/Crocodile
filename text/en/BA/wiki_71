<text>Windsurfing is a wind-propelled water sport that is a combination of sailing and surfing. It is also referred to as &quot;sailboarding&quot; and &quot;boardsailing&quot;, and emerged in the late 1960s from the Californian aerospace and surf culture. Windsurfing gained a popular following across Europe and North America by the late 1970s and had achieved significant global popularity by the 1980s. Windsurfing became an Olympic sport in 1984.

Newer variants include windfoiling, kiteboarding and wingfoiling. Hydrofoil fins under the board allow the boards to safely lift out of the water and fly silently and smoothly above the surface even in lighter winds.

Windsurfing is a recreational, family friendly sport, most popular at flat water locations around the world that offer safety and accessibility for beginner and intermediate participants. Technique and equipment have evolved over the years.

Major competitive disciplines on unified World Tour include Slalom, Wave and Freestyle. Increasingly, new technology &quot;foiling&quot; with high speed foil racing is replacing traditional &#x27;fin&#x27; racing events and the IQfoil class is the new Olympic windsurfing racing class for France in 2024.

==History==
The earliest known instance of windsurfing was by Peter Chilvers, when he created the first modern sailboard and tested it on Hayling Island in 1958, he is credited as being the &quot;Godfather of Windsurfing&quot;. During the 1980s a lawsuit was filed against Chilvers &amp; Tabur Marine by Windsurfing International who disputed Pete’s patent. The court eventually ruled in favour of Tabur Marine as they saw that although Windsurfing International’s design was slightly different it was Pete’s original that had all the main parts that are familiar today. The case set important precedents for future patent law. 

Windsurfing&#x27;s popularity saw explosive growth in the 1970s and 1980s. Initially in Europe, then in North America. The sport began to take off in popularity around 1972 and by the end of the 1970s it was the fastest growing sport in the world. Originally, all windsurfing boards were &quot;long boards&quot;. This type of board went relatively slower through the water, but worked well in low wind conditions. Light air, long board windsurfing was enjoyed by a wide range of participants including families with young children.

During the 1980s a global community consisting of equipment designers, manufacturers, athletes, travel professionals and journalists worked together to propel windsurfing forward. Innovation allowed for the development of high quality lighter and stiffer planing short boards, introducing foot straps, harnesses and more stable sails. These innovations further expanded the sport by making it faster, more radical and more exciting for the top end, and significantly more accessible at the entry level with lighter easier equipment.

Windsurfing shattered the world speed sailing record, entered the Olympics and became lauded as, &quot;The fastest growing sport in the world.&quot;

The radical growth curve had to level out eventually and Windsurfing&#x27;s retail momentum plateaued with the arrival of newer action sports in 90&#x27;s. Closely related action sports such as mountain biking, snowboarding, stand up paddle boarding (SUP) and kite boarding all directly competed for popularity with windsurfing. Many windsurfing schools closed, or switched to teaching kite boarding and currently teach mostly wing foiling. After some lean years in the 2000s, the sport has seen a steady revival, first through the explosion of foiling., and more recently with global consolidation, restructuring, and an exciting new unified World Tour.

==The inventors==

Modern windsurfing, as a sport and recreational activity, did not emerge until the latter half of the 20th century. The earliest version of a sailboard design utilizing a freely articulating sail on top of a board was created in 1962 by American Newman Darby. Independently, engineer Jim Drake invented and co-patented the version we all know today and called it Windsurfing- a new new concept in sailing.

Long before this modern moment, there were small scale sailing craft that have used wind as the driving force, many of them sourced to the Polynesians who have been riding the wind and waves for centuries. Early accounts suggest island peoples were undertaking day trips over oceans standing upright on a solid board with a vertical sail. In the early 19th century, people in logging communities around western Lake Michigan were purportedly fixing sails to logs as part of log float control and for recreation.

In 1948, 20-year-old Newman Darby was the first to conceive the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a universal joint so that he could control his small catamaran—the first rudderless sailboard ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail fore and aft. Darby filed for a patent but lacked the funds to resubmit. However, he is widely recognized as its inventor as well as the first to conceive, design, and build a sailboard with a universal joint. In his own words, Darby experimented throughout much of the 1950s and 1960s and it was not until 1963 that an improved sailboard with a conventional stayed sloop rig sail arrangement made it more stable than the one built in 1948. S. Newman Darby created his first product for a wider market in 1964 that he called the &quot;Darby sailboard&quot; on the Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, United States.

While Darby&#x27;s &quot;sailboard&quot; incorporated a pivoting rig, it was &quot;square rigged&quot; or &quot;kite rigged&quot; and was subject to the associated limitations. Unlike the modern windsurfer design, Darby&#x27;s sailboard was operated &quot;back winded&quot;, with the sailor&#x27;s back to the lee side of a kite-shaped sail. This is a much less efficient and less dynamic sailing position and opposite of how a modern windsurfer is operated. Darby&#x27;s article stated that &quot;you can learn to master a type of maneuvering that&#x27;s been dead since the age of the picturesque square riggers&quot;. He began selling his sailboards in 1964. The main focus of his company, Darby Industries, was to sell plans such that any school-age child could build one for under $50. Rather than building personal wealth, his focus was to introduce youth to the sport of sailing in even very shallow water. A promotional article by Darby was published in the August 1965 edition of &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine. Darby died in 2016 reportedly feeling pleased with the recognition he received for having created an early version of the sailboard.

Twelve-year-old Peter Chilvers is also cited for inventing a kind of sailboard in England in 1958.
Stanford educated aeronautical engineer Jim Drake and fellow aeronautical engineer Fred Payne conceived and designed a sail powered surfboard in 1962. Their version differed from Darby&#x27;s in many significant ways. The sailor stood upright on a large surfboard while holding directly onto the windward side of a small triangular sail. Originally, they designed it to be propelled by a hand held wing rather than an attached, masted sail. Soon they decided a universal joint attaching a movable sail was more practical.

After learning of Drake&#x27;s revolutionary sailing concept, one of Drake&#x27;s family friends, a businessman named Hoyle Schweitzer, became interested in marketing Drake&#x27;s new invention. As a businessman, Schweitzer imagined the profit potential and encouraged Drake to build a functional prototype for product testing. Later, when Drake&#x27;s prototype worked, he helped Drake to patent the idea. From the outset, the two men were motivated by different forces. Drake conceptualized, engineered, built and tested the first windsurfer. Schweitzer, while not directly involved in the invention, helped by organizing the business details of patenting, marketing and selling Drake&#x27;s new craft. As a partnership, Drake came up with the original concept and Schweitzer marketed and sold it. Both men&#x27;s names appear on the patent.

Years later, in 2002, when the Professional Windsurfing Association (PWA) inducted both Drake and Schweitzer into the Windsurfing Hall of Fame, they called Drake &quot;The Father of Windsurfing&quot; for his role as inventor and egalitarian figure head throughout his lifetime, and called Schweitzer &quot;the man who brought windsurfing to the masses&quot; based on his efforts to promote the Windsurfer brand&#x27;s popularity. It was a brief but productive collaboration between a talented engineer and a motivated businessman that together created the modern sport of windsurfing. Drake has stated in various interviews that he recognizes Darby and Chilvers as early sailboard pioneers and sees himself as the sports &quot;re-inventor&quot;.

== Drake&#x27;s first prototype, the Windsurfer name ==

Drake is known historically as one of the world&#x27;s top aeronautical engineers. He was also an expert craftsman in his spare time. He combined both skills to conceive and build the world&#x27;s first windsurfer prototype. First, he carefully engineered a mathematical simulation of his concept based on the physics of windsurfing. He then crafted nearly all of the windsurfer prototype components by hand in his Santa Monica, California home garage in January 1967. He built the wishbone boom, daggerboard and mast foot from laminated strips of teak wood. He custom designed and built a wood press jig for shaping the curve into the wishbone boom. The universal joint was built by reconfiguring a commercially available sailboat swivel joint constructed from heavy duty marine stainless steel with additional teflon components. Drake engineered the custom sail, which was made from Dacron sail cloth and cut and sewn by sail maker Bob Broussard into a triangular Bermuda rig. The custom board Drake engineered required a greater amount of displacement volume for floatation than was found in a traditional surfboard so an extra large custom built foam blank was constructed by Gordon &quot;Grubby&quot; Clark of Clark foam and shaped by Jim Drake and Gary Seaman at the Con Surfboard factory in Santa Monica, California. A repurposed hollow fiberglass mast was taken from a small &quot;Flipper&quot; racing dingy rig.

To gather the needed materials, Drake carefully instructed Schweitzer what raw materials to purchase such as an extra large foam blank to build the board and a hollow fiberglass mast for the sail. Drake completed construction of the prototype in his own garage during his spare time within a few months. 
Drake&#x27;s question came down to simple operation of how a standing person could control both the power of the sail as well as the direction of the craft without a rudder. Drake discovered that one&#x27;s ability to rotate the sail&#x27;s position relative to the board could allow control of both power and direction. Experimenting with a rotational design, he invented the concept for the universal joint. Drake completed his engineering concept with a wishbone boom, a daggerboard, mast, mast foot, triangular sail and fin. Interestingly, because Drake always envisioned in his mind the sailor standing on the board with the sail in their hands, he originally forgot to include a rope, now called an uphaul, which allows the sailor to pull the sail from the water. His first day on the water was made more difficult without this essential item, but by the second day he had invented that part as well.

On May 21, 1967, Jim Drake, along with his wife Wendy and daughter Stephanie, went to Marina del Rey&#x27;s Jamaica Bay to make history with the world&#x27;s first modern sailboard.

Returning to Marina del Rey one week later, this time with the skeg and uphaul, Drake succeeded at sailing the board the way he designed it to be used. With his confidence buoyed from multiple days of practice in the protected bay, Drake next took his sailboard onto the open ocean at Will Rogers State Beach in Santa Monica, California. Drake subsequently taught Schweitzer how to windsurf and soon the sport was launched.

Originally Drake and Schweitzer wanted to name their new sailboard concept &quot;Skate&quot; (SK8), however changed the name to &quot;Baja Board&quot; in early 1968. Schweitzer was marketing a prototype of the Baja Board in Seattle, when Bert Salisbury stopped his car to have a look, and commented: &quot;Gee I have the perfect name for it! Windsurfing!&quot; The name was soon changed to Windsurfer, sold by the company Windsurfing International.

The details of Jim Drake&#x27;s original windsurfing concept were published in 1969 by Drake&#x27;s employer at the time, the RAND Corporation, in a technical paper written and presented by him titled Windsurfing - A New Concept in Sailing.&quot; Further details can be read in published interviews. Despite forty years of subsequent development, the design is still remarkably similar to today&#x27;s windsurfing equipment, and the word &quot;windsurfer&quot; has become synonymous with the sport itself.

==The sport&#x27;s first company==
Jim Drake and Hoyle Schweitzer together started the sport&#x27;s first company, Windsurfing International, in late 1968 out of Drake&#x27;s Santa Monica, California home. Both men were employed full time outside of their startup windsurfing business and so windsurfing was little more than an experimental hobby for them at that time. Drake and his wife Wendy, along with Schweitzer and his wife Diane worked closely together in their spare time to create a marketable framework for the new sport. Drake and Schweitzer collaborated informally as friends rather than legally bound business partners, as no formal business partnership was ever signed between them. Unexpectedly, Drake was temporarily relocated 2000 miles away to design innovative rocket planes at The Pentagon. Around this same time, Schweitzer lost his job as a computer software salesman.

While Drake was away for two years immersed in engineering work on the other side of the country, Schweitzer began manufacturing and selling Windsurfers, as well as incorporating the company Windsurfing International and collected licensing fees on over 100,000 boards in Europe without ever informing or including Drake. Schweitzer concealed from Drake the somewhat large profits he was beginning to make from selling the boards Drake had invented. Observers close to the situation believe it was always Schweitzer&#x27;s plan to keep Drake uniformed of the large profit potential long enough to misrepresent and under value the real worth of the patent so that Schweitzer could buy out Drake&#x27;s half of the patent for as little as possible. When Drake later discovered Schweitzer&#x27;s unethical and dishonest actions he was deeply confused and angered. Drake, who trusted Schweitzer and his family, was shocked that his friend would deceive him in this unkind way. Drake originally was not interested in forfeiting his half of the patent. However, Schweitzer and his attorneys would continue for 5 years to aggressively pressure Drake to sell his half of the patent to Windsurfing International in order for Schweitzer to secure a lucrative monopoly on all future royalties. 

Windsurfing International registered the term &quot;Windsurfer&quot; as a trademark at the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1970. Windsurfing International Inc. created a popular one-design racing class, which was influenced by the desire to provide a fleet of racers with a uniformly constructed &quot;boat,&quot; so that rider skill, rather than equipment choice, would determine competitive results. The first Windsurfer Class World Championship regatta took place in San Diego, California in 1973. The Windsurfer Class fleet was based the success of the Laser and Hobie Cat classes. Each Windsurfer had an identical computer-cut sail, a technology new at that time and pioneered by Ian Bruce.

==Patent disputes==
On March 27, 1968, Jim Drake, an aeronautical engineer, and Hoyle Schweitzer, a businessman filed the very first windsurfing patent, which was granted by the USPTO in 1970.

Through the seventies, and early eighties windsurfing was the fastest growing sport on earth. Schweitzer aggressively protected his patent around the world through Sub-licensing the rights to anyone who wanted to manufacture and sell sailboards. Windsurfing International&#x27;s usurious royalty fee charges, which its competitors were forced to pay, were so high that many observers felt it needlessly limited the growth of the sport. Mr. Schweitzer claimed this was to promote his brand and the Windsurfer One Design racing class, but most believed it was so he could maximize his own profits. The sport underwent very rapid growth however, particularly in Europe after the sale of a sub-license sold to Ten Cate Sports in the Netherlands. In 1975 Ten Cate Sports sold 45,000 boards in Europe.

At the same time, Schweitzer also sought to defend his patent rights vigorously against unauthorized manufacturers. This led to a host of predating windsurfer-like devices being presented to courts around the world by companies disputing Windsurfing International&#x27;s rights to the invention.

In 1979, Schweitzer licensed Brittany, France-based company Dufour Wing, which was later merged with Tabur Marine – the precursor of Bic Sport. Europe was now the largest growing market for windsurfers, and the sub-licensed companies – Tabur, F2, Mistral – wanted to find a way to remove or reduce their royalty payments to Windsurfing International.

Tabur lawyers found prior art, in a local English newspaper which had published a story with a picture about Peter Chilvers, who as a young boy on Hayling Island on the south coast of England, assembled his first board combined with a sail, in 1958. This board used a universal joint, one of the key parts of the Windsurfing International&#x27;s patent. They also found stories published about the 1948 invention of the sailboard by Newman Darby and his wife Naomi in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

In &quot;Windsurfing International Inc. v Tabur Marine (GB) Ltd. 1985 RPC 59&quot; with Tabur backed financially by French sailing fan Baron Marcel Bich, British courts recognized the prior art of Peter Chilvers. It did not incorporate the curved wishbone booms of the modern windsurfer, but rather a &quot;straight boom&quot; that became curved in use. The courts found that the Schweitzer windsurfer boom was &quot;merely an obvious extension&quot;. This court case set a precedent for patent law in the United Kingdom, in terms of inventive step and non-obviousness; the court upheld the defendant&#x27;s claim that the Schweitzer patent was invalid, based on film footage of Chilvers. Schweitzer then sued the company in Canada, where the opposition team again financially backed by Bic included Chilvers and Jim Drake, and Schweitzer lost again. After the cases, no longer obliged to pay Windsurfing International any royalty payments, the now renamed Bic Sport became one of the world&#x27;s larger producers of windsurfing equipment, with an annual production of 15,000 boards.

There is no evidence that Schweitzer or Drake had knowledge of any prior inventions similar to theirs. Drake accepted in retrospect that, although he can be credited with the invention, he was &quot;probably no better than third,&quot; behind mid-west based Newman Darby and Englishman Peter Chilvers. The battle over the origin story of the sport would go on to cause much legal grief for the global sporting phenomenon for much of the 1980s.

In 1983, Schweitzer sued. Swiss board manufacturer Mistral and lost. Mistral&#x27;s defense hinged on the work of US inventor Newman Darby, who by 1965 conceived the &quot;sailboard&quot;: a hand-held square rigged &quot;kite&quot; sail on a floating platform for recreational use.

Eventually US courts recognized the Schweitzer windsurfer as an obvious step from Darby&#x27;s prior art. Schweitzer had to reapply for a patent under severely limited terms, and finally it expired in 1987. Shortly thereafter, having lost its license royalty income, Windsurfing International ceased operations.

In 1984, Australian courts determined a patent case: &quot;Windsurfing International Inc &amp; Anor v Petit &amp; Anor&quot; (also part reported in 3 IPR 449 or [1984] 2 NSWLR 196), which attributed the first legally accepted use of a split boom to an Australian boy, Richard Eastaugh. Between the ages of ten and thirteen, from 1946 to 1949, aided by his younger brothers, he built around 20 galvanized iron canoes and hill trolleys which he equipped with sails with split bamboo booms. He sailed these in a sitting position and not as a windsurfer standing up, near his home on the Swan River in Perth. The judge noted that, &quot;Mr Eastaugh greatly exaggerated the capacity of his galvanised iron canoes to sail to windward&quot; and that, &quot;There is no corroboration of Mr Eastaugh&#x27;s experiences by any other witness. Neither of his brothers or his father was called&quot;.

It is acknowledged in the courts that the separate Eastaugh (1946–1949), Darby (1965) and Chilvers (1958) inventions pre-dated the Schweitzer/Drake patent (1968).

By the late 1980s the sport was massive and in the midst of a full-blown marketing and legal battle between the original market in the US, and the exploding European markets. This epic legal battle laid the ground for a still running rivalry between the European and American hemispheres.

=== Trademarks ===
Windsurfing International briefly claimed trademark rights with respect to the word &quot;windsurfer&quot;. While this was registered in the United States for some years, it was not accepted for registration in many jurisdictions as the word was considered too descriptive. Registration was ultimately lost in the United States for the same reason. Eventually the sport became known widely as either sailboarding or windsurfing.

==Equipment==
Windsurfers are often classified as either shortboards or longboards. Longboards are usually longer than 3 meters, with a retractable daggerboard, and are optimized for lighter winds or course racing. Shortboards are less than 3 meters long and are designed for planing conditions.

While windsurfing is possible under a wide range of wind conditions, most intermediate and advanced recreational windsurfers prefer to sail in conditions that allow for consistent planing with multi-purpose, not overly specialized, free-ride equipment. Larger (100 to 140 liters) free-ride boards are capable of planing at wind speeds as low as if rigged with an adequate, well-tuned sail in the six to eight square meter range. The pursuit of planing in lower winds has driven the popularity of wider and shorter boards, with which planing is possible in wind as low as , if sails in the 10 to 12 square meter range are used.

Modern windsurfing boards can be classified into many categories: The original &quot;Windsurfer&quot; board had a body made out of polyethylene filled with PVC foam. Later, hollow glass-reinforced epoxy designs were used. Most boards produced today have an expanded polystyrene foam core reinforced with a composite sandwich shell, that can include carbon fiber, kevlar, or fiberglass in a matrix of epoxy and sometimes plywood and thermoplastics. Racing and wave boards are usually very light (5 to 7 kg), and are made out of carbon sandwich. Such boards are very stiff, and veneer is sometimes used to make them more shock-resistant. Boards aimed at the beginners are heavier (8 to 15 kg) and more robust, containing more fiberglass.
*Beginner boards: (Sometimes called funboards) these often have a daggerboard, are almost as wide as Formula boards, and have plenty of volume, hence stability.
*Freeride: Boards meant for comfortable recreational cruising (mostly straight-line sailing and occasional turning) at planing speed (aka blasting), mainly in flat waters or in light to moderate swell. They typically fall into the volume range of 90 to 170 liters. The so-called freeride sailing movement diverged from course racing as more recreational sailors chose to sail freely without being constrained to sailing on courses around buoys.
*Racing longboards: Internationally recognised One Design Classes such as the WINDSURFER Class, Mistral One Design, or the old Olympic RS:X class race boards, and the new 2024 Olympic Class iQFoil.
*Formula Windsurfing Class: Shorter boards up to one meter in width, for use in Formula Windsurfing races. See below for a more detailed description.
*Slalom boards: In the past, the key feature of slalom boards was merely speed, but it has been proven that maneuverability and ease of use are as important as speed in order to get you around the slalom course faster, and therefore modern slalom boards are shortboards aimed at top speed, maneuverability and ease of use. 
*Speed boards: In essence an extremely narrow and sleek slalom board, built for top speed only.
*Freestyle boards: Related to wave boards in terms of maneuverability, these are wider, higher volume boards geared specifically at performing acrobatic tricks (jumps, rotations, slides, flips and loops) on flat water. Usually 80 to 110 liters in volume, and about 203 to 230 centimeters in length, with widths frequently in excess of 60 centimeters. Freestyle boards began to diverge more noticeably in design from wave boards in the early part of the 2000 decade, as aerial tricks (the Vulcan, Spock, Grubby, Flaka, and related New School maneuvers, almost all involving a jump-and-spin component) became the predominant part of the freestyle repertoire, superseding Old School moves, in which the board did not leave contact with the water.
*Wave boards: Smaller, lighter, more maneuverable boards for use in breaking waves. Characteristically, sailors on wave boards perform high jumps while sailing against waves, and they ride the face of a wave performing narrow linked turns (bottom turns, cutbacks, and top-turns) in a similar way to surfing. Wave boards usually have a volume between 65 and 105 liters, with a length between 215 and 235 centimeters, and 50 to 60 centimeters in width. A general rule is for a sailor to use a wave board whose volume in liters is about the same as the sailor&#x27;s weight in kilograms – more volume providing additional flotation for sailing in light winds, and less for high winds, where less volume is needed to achieve planing. In recent years, the average width of wave boards has increased slightly, as the length has shrunk, while the range of volume has been maintained the same more or less—according to board designers this makes wave boards easier to use under a wider range of conditions by sailors of differing abilities. The most common sizes of sails used with wave boards are in the range of 3.4 to 6.0 square meters, depending on the wind speed and the weight of the sailor.

Sails
Modern windsurfing sails are often made of monofilm (clear polyester film), dacron (woven polyester) and mylar. Areas under high load may be reinforced with kevlar.

Two designs of a sail are predominant: camber induced and rotational. Cambered sails have 1–5 camber inducers - plastic devices at the ends of battens which cup against the mast. They help create a rigid aerofoil shape for faster speed and stability, but at the cost of maneuverability and how light the sail feels. The trend is that racier sails have camber inducers while wave sails and most recreational sails do not. The rigidity of the sail is also determined by a number of &quot;battens&quot;.

Beginners&#x27; sails often do not have &quot;battens&quot;, so they are lighter and easier to use in light winds. However, as the sailor improves, a battened sail will provide greater stability in stronger winds.

Rotational sails have &quot;battens&quot; which protrude beyond the back aspect of the mast. They flip or &quot;rotate&quot; to the other side of the mast when tacking or jibing, hence the rotation in the name. Rotational sails have an aerofoil shape on the leeward side when powered, but are nearly flat when sheeted out (unpowered). In comparison with cambered sails, rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight, but are easier to handle when maneuvering. Rotational sails are usually lighter and easier to rig.

A windsurfing sail is tensioned at two points: at the tack (by downhaul), and at the clew (by outhaul). There is a set of pulleys for downhauling at the tack, and a grommet at the clew. Most shape is given to the sail by applying a very strong downhaul, which by design bends the mast. The outhaul tension is relatively weak, mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail&#x27;s angle of attack.

The sail is tuned by adjusting the downhaul and the outhaul tension. Generally, a sail is trimmed more (flatter shape) for stronger winds. More downhaul tension loosens the upper part of the leech, allowing the top of the sail to twist and &quot;spill&quot; wind during gusts, shifting the center of effort (strictly, the center of pressure) down. Releasing downhaul tension shifts the center of effort up. More outhaul lowers the camber/draft, making the sail flatter and easier to control, but less powerful; less outhaul results in more draft, providing more low-end power, but usually limiting speed by increasing aerodynamic resistance.

The disciplines of windsurfing (wave, freestyle, freeride) require different sails. Wave sails are reinforced to survive the surf, and are nearly flat when depowered to allow riding waves. Freestyle sails are also flat when depowered, and have high low-end power to allow quick acceleration. Freeride sails are all-rounders that are comfortable to use and are meant for recreational windsurfing. Race sails provide speed at the expense of qualities like comfort or maneuverability.

The size of the sail is measured in square meters and can be from 3 m2 to 5.5 m2 for wave sails and 6 m2 to 15 m2 for race sails, with ranges for freestyle and freeride sails spanning somewhere between these extremes. Learning sails for children can be as small as 0.7 m2 and race sails up to 15 m2.

Associated Equipment
*Mast
*Boom
*Fin (similar shape to a surfboard fin but is usually stronger for windsurfing)
*Universal joint (elastic joints are more common, but some are mechanical)
*Harness and Harness lines
*Wet suit/dry suit
*Footwear
*Helmet
*Personal flotation device
*Travel gear – sail bags, board bags, car racks
*Safety gear: line, distress strobe light, whistle, marine VHF radio

==Technique==
A sailboard is powered and controlled by the coordinated movements of the sail about its uni-joint and of the sailor around the board. This is achieved by balancing the weight of the sailor against the wind pressure in the sail, while adjusting both factors relative to the board. Learning this involves the development of reflexes and &quot;muscle memory&quot; similar to the process of learning to ride a bicycle. These skills are typically and optimally done on large, buoyant boards in light winds on flat water. Depending on wind conditions and the skill or intentions of the rider, at some point the sailboard will begin planing, resulting in a rapid increase in speed. This higher speed requires the learning of new skills as the apparent wind changes and the board becomes steerable like a surfboard.

===Learning and skill progression===
Learning is a strenuous activity with many falls into the water, climbs back onto the board and repeating. The time taken to reach the point of significant enjoyment varies greatly.

===Youth===
Windsurfing is suitable for children as young as 5, with several board and sail brands producing &quot;Kids Rigs&quot; to accommodate these short and light weight windsurfers. In some countries, organisations exist to provide entry into the sport in a semi-formal or club-style environment (i.e. The RYA&#x27;s Team 15 scheme). Robert (Robby) Naish took up the fledgling sport of windsurfing at the age of 11, and in 1976 won his first overall World Championship title at the age of 13.

===Light winds===
The board moves through the water – much like a sailing boat does – using an extendable centreboard (if available) and fin or skeg for stability and lateral resistance. The centreboard is retracted at broad points of sail, again similarly to a sailing boat, to allow for jibing control. In these conditions windsurf boards also tack and jibe like a sailing boat.

Directional control is achieved by moving the rig either forward (turning away from the wind) or aft (turning towards the wind). When jibing, the clew of the sail is let around and allowed to rotate out and around the mast.

Fall recovery: The rider climbs onto the board, grabs the pulling rope (&quot;uphaul&quot;), makes sure the mast foot is placed between his/her two feet, pulls the sail about one third out of the water, lets the wind turn the sail-board combination until he/she has the wind right in the back, pulls the sail all the way out, places the &quot;mast hand&quot; (hand closest to the mast) on the boom, pulls the mast over the center line of the board, places the &quot;sail hand&quot; (hand furthest from the mast) on the boom, then pulling on it to close the sail and power it.

===Strong winds===

In planing conditions a harness is typically worn to more efficiently use the rider&#x27;s weight to counter the force in the sail. As the wind increases, the rider continues to sheet the sail, the fin generates more lift, and the board gains speed, transitioning onto a &quot;plane&quot;. The volume of board in the water (&quot;displacement&quot;) decreases, and the rider moves rearward, stepping into the footstraps for improved control. When planing, the board skims on the surface rather than displacing water as it moves. Planing can be achieved at different wind speeds depending on the rider&#x27;s weight, sail and fin size, wave conditions, and rider ability. With modern equipment planing can normally be achieved at a wind speed of around . The transition from displacement motion to planing requires a jump in energy, but once planing, water resistance decreases dramatically. This means that it is possible to continue to plane, although the wind has dropped below a level that would be required to transition to plane. A board in plane can be much smaller than a board moving by displacement (thereby gaining an advantage in gear weight and board control). Lateral resistance to the wind is provided by the fin alone (generating more lift at higher speeds) and a centreboard is no longer used (smaller boards do not have one). A fin generates lift, transferring a strong load to the board, and so is usually constructed of carbon fiber for accurate shape and strength. A low-pressure area develops on the windward side of the fin, which can lead to cavitation, leading to a sudden loss of lift, called &quot;spin-out&quot; (equivalent to &quot;stalling&quot; in flight terminology). Ideal planing conditions for most recreational riders is of wind, but experts can windsurf in much windier conditions. Planing is considered one of the most exhilarating aspects of the sport.

Steering is mainly achieved by changing the center of lateral resistance located along the daggerboard or fin through rotating the sail either fore and aft. Unlike fixed mast sail a boat, windsurfing is rudderless and uses the universal joint to allow steering the board with the sail alone. Jibing is done at full speed (a so-called &quot;carve jibe&quot;, &quot;power jibe&quot; or &quot;planing jibe&quot;), whereby the rider turns downwind by leaning the sail forward, sheeting and applying pressure to the inside rail. Leaning into the turn much like a snowboarder making a toe-side turn. Pressure is released from the sail as the board turns downwind, allowing for the sail to be jibed. Tacking is turning around going upwind, and at higher speed has become an advanced maneuver, requiring quick movements and good balance. A heel-side turn while planing (called a &quot;cut-back&quot;) is usually only executed in wave riding.

Water-start: In strong winds it is difficult to uphaul the sail (pulling it out of the water while standing on the board) so &quot;waterstarting&quot; is necessary. This is done (while water treading) by positioning the mast perpendicular to the wind, lifting the luff out of the water to allow the wind to catch the sail, and then having the sail pull the sailor onto the board. As the sail becomes powered, it is then trimmed to bring the rider, board, and sail back onto a plane. Occasionally a rider may be unable to waterstart if the wind has dropped. If this happens the rider can wait for a gust and &quot;pump&quot; the sail to get back on the board. If this becomes hopeless uphauling the sail will be necessary.

==Racers==

===Long-board classes===

===Olympic class===
Olympic Sailing included Olympic Boardsailing as a demonstration Sport, this test event was sailed on the Windglider fun board at the Olympic Games of 1984. Olympic Boardsailing was given full Sport status with the Lechner at the 1988 Olympic Games. sailing events at the Summer Olympics A Women&#x27;s Olympic Lechner 390 Boardsailing Class of Sailing was added the Summer of 1992. 
* The Olympic Games from 1896 did not include any women specific class of sailing until 1988. The Boardsailing Class officially began the year of 1988 with only a Men&#x27;s Olympic Lechner Boardsailing Class. The Barcelona Games of 1992 was significant to the history of Women in Sport, when the Olympic Women&#x27;s Boardsailing Class began in Spain on the Mediterranean Sea.*
The first three classes were: Windglider(demo), Division II(men only), Lechner A-390 (Women Class &amp; Men&#x27;s Class) and the Mistral One Design Class. The Mistral had a worldwide organization with Mistral Schools to learn windsurfing. This manufacturer had a range of boards from short boards, wave boards, slalom boards, fun boards and race boards.
The Summer of 1992 the Olympic Mistral One Design was selected as versatile for youth, women and men. This gear was particularly ideal for a broad wind range from five knots to thirty-five knots of wind. 
Olympic Windsurfing involves &#x27;One Design&#x27; boards, each sailor windsurfing with the identical board design, daggerboards, fins and sails. The equipment is specifically selected to allow racing in a wide range of sailing conditions. The former Mistral Olympic class was better for youth, women and light weight men. Many women changed classes of Olympic Sailing when the gear was changed from Mistral to RSX. The next class was favoured by middle weight and heavy weight men with the shift to a significantly larger sail size. The Neil Pryde RS:X was used for the first time in the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2024 the new Olympic Class windsurfer used advanced foil technology with the iQFoil one design class.

===One Design Racing classes===
These offer hugely popular class racing around the world thanks to relatively low cost, the same gear design is competitive for many years with no class changes. The pro gear in contrast has rapid design change as often as every six months, only with sponsorship is constant upgrading practical. The steady constant of the one design is fun for recreation, the introduction to competition that allows intermediate windsurfers to race on the same gear design as the best athletes from the Olympic Class. These one design classes are the most social of all racing classes. The most popular one design classes are: the original WINDSURFER class, the long running Mistral One Design, the Youth development class Bic-Techno and the rapidly expanding new iQFoil.

===Formula class===
Formula windsurfing has developed over the last 15 years in order to facilitate high-performance competition in light and moderate winds. Formula is now a class of windsurfing boards controlled by World Sailing that has the principal characteristic of a maximum 1m width. They have a single fin of maximum length 70 cm and carry sails up to 12.5 m2. Class rules allow sailors to choose boards produced by multiple manufacturers, as long as they are certified as Formula boards and registered with ISAF, and use fins and sails of different sizes. With the sail, fin and board choices, the equipment is able to be tailored to suit sailors of all body shapes and formula windsurfing presents one of the fastest course-racing sailing craft on the water. Formula Windsurfing is popular in many locations around the globe with predominantly light winds and flat water.

Large sails in combination with the &#x27;wide-style&#x27; design allow planing in very low wind conditions as well as control and usability in high winds and bigger sea conditions. Non-planing sailing is very difficult with this design and racing is only conducted with a strict wind minimum in place. Formula boards are used on &quot;flat water&quot; as opposed to coastal surf, but racing is still held in windy conditions involving swell and chop. In 2008, a Formula Windsurfing Grand-Prix World Tour began, with events in Europe and South America complementing the single-event World Championships as a professional tour for the Formula class.

Formula boards have excellent upwind and downwind ability, but are not as comfortable on a beam reach unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and downwind legs, or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.

===Raceboard class===
Raceboards are longer windsurf boards with a daggerboard and movable mast rail allowing the sailor to be efficient on all points of sail. Excellent upwind ability is combined with good reaching and even downwind ability typically sailed in an Olympic triangle course. Whilst in decline in manufacture since the advent of shortboard course racing (which evolved into Formula) there remains some models in production and most notably the IMCO One Design remains popular amongst amateur racing clubs.

===Short-board classes===

===Slalom===
Slalom is a high-speed race. Typically there are two sorts of slalom courses.
*Figure of eight: All of the course should on a beam reach with two floating marks that have to be jibed around.
*Downwind: More than two marks are laid and sailors sail a downwind course – jibing around each mark only once.
Slalom boards are small and narrow, and require high winds. Funboard class racing rules require winds of for the slalom event to take place.

===Ocean Slalom Marathon===
There are 3 major Ocean Slalom Marathons in the world: The Defi-Wind in France, The Lancelin Ocean Classic in Western Australia, and the Hatteras Marathon in the USA.

===Super X===
This discipline is a cross between freestyle and slalom. Competitors race on a short downwind slalom course, must duck jibe on all turns, and are required to perform several tricks along the way. Competitors are required to wear protective equipment. The Super X discipline was short lived and is now largely unpracticed; it reached its peak in the early 2000s,

===Speedsailing===
Speedsailing takes place in several forms. The International Speed Windsurfing Class (ISWC) organizes (under the umbrella of World Sailing) competitions in various locations around the world known for conditions suitable for good speeds. The events are made up of heats sailed on a 500m course. The average of each sailor&#x27;s best 2 speeds on the 500m course, which is typically open for 2 hours per heat, is their speed for that heat. As such it is possible for the sailor with the outright fastest time not to win the heat if his second best time pulls his average down. Points are given for the placings in the heats and the overall event winner is the sailor with the best point score (again not necessarily the fastest sailor). Likewise points are given for places in the events and at the last event a World Speedsurfing Champion is crowned.

On record attempts controlled by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) competitors complete timed runs on a 500m or 1 nautical mile (1,852m) course. The current 500m record (for Windsurfers) is held by French windsurfer Antoine Albeau. The women&#x27;s 500m Record is held By Zara Davis, from England, also in Luderitz. The Men&#x27;s nautical mile record is held by Bjorn Dunkerbeck and the women&#x27;s mile record is held by Zara Davis both set in Walvis Bay, Namibia

With the advent of cheap and small GPS units and the website www.gps-speedsurfing.com, Speedsurfers have been able to organise impromptu competitions amongst themselves as well as more formal competitions such as the European Speed Meetings and Speedweeks/fortnights in Australia. With over 5000 sailors registered it is possible for windsurfers all over the world to compare speeds.
===Indoor===

&quot;In 1990 indoor windsurfing was born with the Palais Omnisports de Paris – Bercy making its spectacular debut. It was during this first indoor event that Britain&#x27;s Nik Baker, from the south coast, flourished and went on to add a whopping x6 Indoor World Championships to his name&quot;.

Indoor windsurfing competitions are held, especially in Europe, during winter. Powerful fans lined up along the side of a large pool, propel the windsurfers. Indoor competition disciplines include slalom style races and ramp jumping competitions. It is extremely dangerous because the pool is barely one meter deep and is surrounded by concrete.

World Champion Jessica Crisp has had arguably the worst injury in the history of the indoor events when, during a warm up session jumping the ramp, she snapped her leg and had to have emergency surgery in a French hospital. This was at the height of her professional career and fame across Europe.

The most famous indoor champions include Robert Teriitehau, Jessica Crisp, Robby Naish, Nick Baker, Eric Thieme, and Nathalie LeLievre.

==Riders==

===Wavesailing===
Wave sailing took off during the rapid development of windsurfing on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Maui. It can be seen as comprising two distinct (but related) parts, wave riding and wave jumping.

A typical wave contest will score two jumps going out and two wave rides coming in. A high scoring heat would consist of a double clean forward rotating jump, a high one foot backward rotating jump, a long wave ride with flowing bottom turns, radical top turns, a series of aerials and a 360 aerial manoeuvre on the face of the waves such as a &#x27;goiter&#x27;, &#x27;taka&#x27;, wave 360, planing forward or clean flowing back-loop. Depending on the conditions at the location, some competitions will focus more on jumping while others focus more on the wave-riding aspects.

The most famous wave riding locations on earth include: Ho&#x27;okipa on the north shore of Maui, Diamond Head on Oahu, Klitmøller in Denmark, Pozo and Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Cabo Verde off the north west coast of Africa, Moulay in Morocco, Margaret River in Western Australia, Pacasmayo in Peru, Topocalma in Chile, and Omaezaki in Japan.

The World Cup Wavesailing competitions crown the professional world champions each year. One of the most prestigious events in the windsurfing world is called The Aloha Classic at Ho&#x27;okipa Beach on the north shore of Maui, Hawaii.

The Aloha Classic held at Ho&#x27;okipa Beach Park on the north shore of Maui, takes place each year in late October and early November for the best wind and wave conditions and it is common to have 15–20 foot wave faces during the contest. Since 2011 the event has been run by the International Windsurfing Tour (IWT)[3] as the Grand Final of the IWT Wave Tour. The IWT is the Hawaiian-based organisation for the wave riders of the Asia Pacific hemisphere. The Aloha Classic has often been the final event of the Professional Windsurfers Association (PWA)[4] crowning the PWA Wave World Champions.

===Wave riding===
Wave riding is a form of surfing with the extra speed and power afforded by the sail. It is strongly connected to its roots in surfing in style and culture. It involves the rider performing a series of bottom turns, top turns, and cutbacks whilst riding an unbroken wave back to the shore. Top wave sailors are able to incorporate aerial moves into their wave riding and will use overhanging wave lips to launch themselves out in front of the wave in spectacular giant aerials.

===Wave jumping===
Wave jumping involves stunts of varying levels of difficulty which are performed after the rider has jumped from the peak of an unbroken wave. These are commonly referred to as aerial moves and include both forward rotation and backward rotations. The rider and his equipment rotate, doing single and double rotations and jumps where the sailor contorts his or her body and equipment. Recent innovations have included combining moves whilst airborne and, for the first time in 2008, one professional sailor, Ricardo Campello, has made attempts at a triple forward loop during a 2008 PWA competition.

=== Big wave riding ===
At the most extreme end of the sport is big wave riding which means riders on waves faces over 30 feet high. The most popular place for this is on the north shore of Maui at place called Pe&#x27;ahi to the local Hawaiians, and known as JAWS to the rest of the world. The biggest waves here can be up to 60 foot faces. It breaks only in the winter months from late October to March. Other famous big wave locations include Nazaré in Portugal. Famous contemporary big wave riders include Kai Lenny, Marcilio Browne, Robby Swift, Sarah Hauser, Jason Polakow, and Robby Naish. The inaugural Big Wave Challenge annojunced the first ever winners in this category on April 10, 2020.

===Storm riding===
The most famous storm riding event is known as The Red Bull Storm Chase. It occurs only when there is a massive storm forecast with winds over 60 knots and giant waves over 20 feet. It is an invitational event and is extremely dangerous. The most recent winner was West Australian Jaeger Stone.

===Freestyle===

Freestyle is a timed event which is judged. The competitor who has the greatest repertoire, or manages to complete most stunts, wins. Freestyle is about show and competitors are judged on their creativity. Both the difficulty and the number of tricks make up the final score. Sailors who perform tricks on both tacks (port and starboard), and perform the tricks fully planing score higher marks. High scoring moves include Shifty (Shaka Pushloop), Double Air-Culo, Air-Kabikuchi, Air-Skopu and double Power-Moves, for example Air-Funnel Burner and Double Culo. The latest freestyle windsurfing is well documented and gets constantly updated on Continentseven. For novice windsurfers, low-wind freestyle tricks are an appropriate start, such as sailing backwards with the fin out of the water, or transitioning from a sailing stance to sitting on the board while continuing to sail.

===Big air===
Competitors compete to see who can record the highest jump or maneuver. A 3D accelerometer is worn to measure and record heights of the jumps. Xensr is a manufacturer of 3D accelerometers and promoter of the Big Air competition. It is a popular discipline on the Columbia River near the town of Hood River, Oregon, USA.

==In popular culture==
Due to the popularity of the sport in the 1970s, a song &quot;Windsurfin&#x27;&quot; was written by publisher Willem van Kooten and producer Jaap Eggermont. It sold over 200,000 copies and made it to no. 2 in the Netherlands in 1978. It was also a hit in Belgium and Germany.

==Related water sports==
Other watersport variants using a board and wind power include Kiteboarding and Wingsurfing.

Kiteboarding uses a large kite (around 9 to 20qsm) on 20+m lines for wind power. Due to the strong possible upward lift, smaller boards with no significant buoyancy are used.

Wingsurfing or wing foiling uses a hand-held wing, a smaller version of a kite, to replace the sail. To offset the low wind power resulting from the comparatively small wing size (around 3 to 9 sqm), a Foilboard can be used.

Windfoiling mounts in the fin box a hydrofoil which lifts the board off the water and improves speeds due to reduced drag.

<doc id="222367" wikidata="Q629085" url="?curid=222367" title="Multivalued function">
<text>In mathematics, a multivalued function, multiple-valued function, many-valued function, or multifunction, is a function that has two or more values in its range for at least one point in its domain. It is a set-valued function with additional properties depending on context; some authors do not distinguish between set-valued functions and multifunctions, but English Wikipedia currently does, having a separate article for each. 

A &quot;multivalued function&quot; of sets &quot;f : X → Y&quot; is a subset 
:formula_1
Write &quot;f(x)&quot; for the set of those &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot; with (&quot;x,y&quot;) ∈ &quot;Γf&quot;. If &quot;f&quot; is an ordinary function, it is a multivalued function by taking its graph
:formula_2
They are called single-valued functions to distinguish them.

== Distinction from set-valued relations ==

Although other authors may distinguish them differently (or not at all), Wriggers and Panatiotopoulos (2014) distinguish multivalued functions from set-valued relations (also called set-valued functions) by the fact that multivalued functions only take multiple values at finitely (or denumerably) many points, and otherwise behave like a function. Geometrically, this means that the graph of a multivalued function is necessarily a line of zero area that doesn&#x27;t loop, while the graph of a set-valued relation may contain solid filled areas or loops.

== Motivation ==
The term multivalued function originated in complex analysis, from analytic continuation. It often occurs that one knows the value of a complex analytic function formula_3 in some neighbourhood of a point formula_4. This is the case for functions defined by the implicit function theorem or by a Taylor series around formula_4. In such a situation, one may extend the domain of the single-valued function formula_3 along curves in the complex plane starting at formula_7. In doing so, one finds that the value of the extended function at a point formula_8 depends on the chosen curve from formula_7 to formula_10; since none of the new values is more natural than the others, all of them are incorporated into a multivalued function.

For example, let formula_11 be the usual square root function on positive real numbers. One may extend its domain to a neighbourhood of formula_12 in the complex plane, and then further along curves starting at formula_12, so that the values along a given curve vary continuously from formula_14. Extending to negative real numbers, one gets two opposite values for the square root—for example for —depending on whether the domain has been extended through the upper or the lower half of the complex plane. This phenomenon is very frequent, occurring for th roots, logarithms, and inverse trigonometric functions.

To define a single-valued function from a complex multivalued function, one may distinguish one of the multiple values as the principal value, producing a single-valued function on the whole plane which is discontinuous along certain boundary curves. Alternatively, dealing with the multivalued function allows having something that is everywhere continuous, at the cost of possible value changes when one follows a closed path (monodromy). These problems are resolved in the theory of Riemann surfaces: to consider a multivalued function formula_3 as an ordinary function without discarding any values, one multiplies the domain into a many-layered covering space, a manifold which is the Riemann surface associated to formula_3.

==Inverses of functions==

If &quot;f : X → Y&quot; is an ordinary function, then its inverse is the multivalued function
:formula_17
defined as &quot;Γf&quot;, viewed as a subset of &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot;. When &quot;f&quot; is a differentiable function between manifolds, the inverse function theorem gives conditions for this to be single-valued locally in &quot;X&quot;. 

For example, the complex logarithm &quot;log(z)&quot; is the multivalued inverse of the exponential function &quot;ez&quot; : C → C×, with graph
:formula_18
It is not single valued, given a single &quot;w&quot; with &quot;w = log(z)&quot;, we have 
:formula_19
Given any holomorphic function on an open subset of the complex plane C, its analytic continuation is always a multivalued function. 

==Concrete examples==
*Every real number greater than zero has two real square roots, so that square root may be considered a multivalued function. For example, we may write formula_20; although zero has only one square root, formula_21.
*Each nonzero complex number has two square roots, three cube roots, and in general &quot;n&quot; &quot;n&quot;th roots. The only &quot;n&quot;th root of 0 is 0.
*The complex logarithm function is multiple-valued. The values assumed by formula_22 for real numbers formula_7 and formula_10 are formula_25 for all integers formula_26.
*Inverse trigonometric functions are multiple-valued because trigonometric functions are periodic. We have formula_27 As a consequence, arctan(1) is intuitively related to several values: /4, 5/4, −3/4, and so on. We can treat arctan as a single-valued function by restricting the domain of tan &quot;x&quot; to – a domain over which tan &quot;x&quot; is monotonically increasing. Thus, the range of arctan(&quot;x&quot;) becomes . These values from a restricted domain are called &quot;principal values&quot;.
* The antiderivative can be considered as a multivalued function. The antiderivative of a function is the set of functions whose derivative is that function. The constant of integration follows from the fact that the derivative of a constant function is 0.
*Inverse hyperbolic functions over the complex domain are multiple-valued because hyperbolic functions are periodic along the imaginary axis. Over the reals, they are single-valued, except for arcosh and arsech.

These are all examples of multivalued functions that come about from non-injective functions. Since the original functions do not preserve all the information of their inputs, they are not reversible. Often, the restriction of a multivalued function is a partial inverse of the original function.

== Branch points ==

Multivalued functions of a complex variable have branch points. For example, for the &quot;n&quot;th root and logarithm functions, 0 is a branch point; for the arctangent function, the imaginary units &quot;i&quot; and −&quot;i&quot; are branch points. Using the branch points, these functions may be redefined to be single-valued functions, by restricting the range. A suitable interval may be found through use of a branch cut, a kind of curve that connects pairs of branch points, thus reducing the multilayered Riemann surface of the function to a single layer. As in the case with real functions, the restricted range may be called the &quot;principal branch&quot; of the function.

==Applications==
In physics, multivalued functions play an increasingly important role. They form the mathematical basis for Dirac&#x27;s magnetic monopoles, for the theory of defects in crystals and the resulting plasticity of materials, for vortices in superfluids and superconductors, and for phase transitions in these systems, for instance melting and quark confinement. They are the origin of gauge field structures in many branches of physics.

<text>The American Physical Society (APS) is a not-for-profit membership organization of professionals in physics and related disciplines, comprising nearly fifty divisions, sections, and other units. Its mission is the advancement and diffusion of knowledge of physics. It publishes more than a dozen scientific journals, including the prestigious &quot;Physical Review&quot; and &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year. It is a member society of the American Institute of Physics. Since January 2021, it is led by chief executive officer Jonathan Bagger.

==History==
The American Physical Society was founded on May 20, 1899, when thirty-six physicists gathered at Columbia University for that purpose. They proclaimed the mission of the new Society to be &quot;to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics&quot;, and in one way or another the APS has been at that task ever since. In the early years, virtually the sole activity of the APS was to hold scientific meetings, initially four per year. In 1913, the APS took over the operation of the &quot;Physical Review,&quot; which had been founded in 1893 at Cornell University, and journal publication became its second major activity. The &quot;Physical Review&quot; was followed by &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot; in 1929 and by &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; in 1958. Over the years, &quot;Phys. Rev.&quot; has subdivided into five separate sections as the fields of physics proliferated and the number of submissions grew.

In more recent years, the activities of the society have broadened considerably. Stimulated by the increase in federal funding in the period after the Second World War, and even more by the increased public involvement of scientists in the 1960s, the APS is active in public and governmental affairs, and in the international physics community. It also conducts extensive programs in education, science outreach (specifically physics outreach), and media relations. Fourteen divisions and eleven topical groups covering all areas of physics research. Six forums reflect the interests of its fifty thousand members in broader issues, and nine sections organized by geographical region.

In 1999, APS Physics celebrated its centennial with the biggest-ever physics meeting in Atlanta. In 2005, APS took the lead role in United States participation in the World Year of Physics, initiating several programs to broadly publicize physics during the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein&#x27;s annus mirabilis. Einstein@Home, one of the projects APS initiated during World Year of Physics, is an ongoing and popular distributed computing project.

===Name confusion and change proposal===
During the summer of 2005, the society conducted an electronic poll, in which the majority of APS members preferred the name &quot;American Physics Society&quot;. The poll became the motivation for a proposal of a name change promised in the leadership election that year. For legal reasons, the planned name change was eventually abandoned by the APS Executive Board.

To promote public recognition of APS as a physics society, while retaining the name American Physical Society, the APS Executive Board adopted a new logo incorporating the phrase &quot;&quot;APS Physics&quot;.&quot;

APS introduced a new logo to replace the &quot;APS Physics&quot; logo on November 1, 2022.

== Units ==
The American Physical Society has 47 units (divisions, forums, topical groups and sections) that represent the wide range of interests of the physics community.

=== Divisions ===
* Astrophysics (DAP)
* Atomic, Molecular &amp; Optical Physics (DAMOP): The objective of the division is the promotion of the fundamental research on atoms, simple molecules, electrons and light, and their interactions. Historically, this is the oldest division of the American Physical Society. It was created in 1943. The division manages a number of prestigious awards for AMO scientists at various stages of their careers, such as the Davisson-Germer Prize in Atomic or Surface Physics, Rabi Prize in AMO Physics, Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in AMO Physics, Herbert P. Broida Prize, etc. It also organizes annual DAMOP Meetings attended by many leading AMO researchers, both from the United States and abroad.
* Biological Physics (DBIO): With over 2,000 members, the division is the second largest learned society in the world devoted to biological physics, following the Biophysical Society. The objective of the division is the advancement and dissemination of knowledge on the broad interface of physics and biology. This includes studying biological phenomena with physics tools and identifying new physics questions within biological contexts. The division supports a program of over 600 (as of 2016) presentations at the annual March Meeting of the APS, on topics ranging from protein biophysics, to neuroscience and evolution. It promotes research and development of biological physics, enhanced the standing of the field, and recognizes important contributions to the field, such as by awarding the Max Delbruck Prize in biological physics.
* Chemical Physics (DCP)
* Computational Physics (DCOMP): The division has more than 2,000 members, and the objective of the division is the advancement and dissemination of knowledge regarding the use of computers in physics research and education. This includes, among other areas, their application to experiments, theory, and education as well as the application of physics to the development of computer technology. This division provides to its members an opportunity for coordination and a forum for discussion and communication. In addition, the division promotes research and development in computational physics; enhances prestige and professional standing of its members; encourages scholarly publication; and promotes international cooperation in these activities.

==Programs==

===Physics Teacher Education Coalition===
The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) is a joint project of the American Physical Society and the &quot;American Association of Physics Teachers&quot;, which helps universities transform their physics teacher education programs into national models. PhysTEC-supported sites develop their physics teacher preparation programs by implementing a set of key components that project leaders have identified as critical to success in physics teacher preparation. The broader coalition is a national network of institutions committed to developing and promoting excellence in physics and physical science teacher preparation.

===Bridge program===
The APS Bridge Program aims to increase the number of underrepresented minority students that earn doctoral degrees in physics. The program names doctoral and master&#x27;s degree-granting institutions as Bridge Sites and awards them National Science Foundation funding to prepare post-baccalaureate students for doctoral studies through additional coursework, mentoring, research, application coaching, and GRE preparation.

===Scholarship for Minority Undergraduate Physics Majors===
Formerly called the APS Corporate Sponsored Scholarship Program for Minority Undergraduate Students Who Major in Physics, this scholarship was established in 1980 with the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented minorities receiving bachelor&#x27;s degrees in physics. The program provides funding and mentoring to talented students.

===Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics===
APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics are three-day regional conferences for undergraduate physics majors. The conferences aim to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas.

===Career center===
The &quot;APS Careers in Physics&quot; website is a gateway for physicists, students, and physics enthusiasts to obtain information about physics jobs and careers.

<text>Sadguru Tyagaraja Swami (Telugu: సద్గురు త్యాగరాజ స్వామి; 4 May 1767 – 6 January 1847), also known as Tyagayya, and in full as Kakarla Tyagabrahmam, was a saint and composer of Carnatic music, a form of Indian classical music. Tyagaraja and his contemporaries, Shyama Shastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar, are regarded as the Trinity of Carnatic music. Tyagaraja composed thousands of devotional compositions, most in Telugu and in praise of Rama, many of which remain popular today. However, only 720 of these are in vogue. Of special mention are five of his compositions called the &quot;Pancharatna Kritis&quot; ( &quot;five gems&quot;), which are often sung in programs in his honour. Tyagaraja composed &quot;Utsava Sampradaya Krithis&quot; ( Festive ritual compositions), which are often sung to accompany temple rituals and Divya Nama Sankeertanas ( Divine name compositions) which are sung as a part of concerts and in daily life.

Tyagaraja lived through the reigns of four kings of the Maratha dynasty – Tulaja II (1763–1787), Amarasimha (1787–1798), Serfoji II (1798–1832) and Sivaji II (1832–1855), although he served none of them.

==Biography==
Tyagaraja was born Kakarla Tyagabrahmam in 1767 to a Telugu Vaidiki Mulakanadu Brahmin family in Tiruvarur in present-day Tiruvarur District of Tamil Nadu. There is a school of thought led by musicologist B. M. Sundaram that contests this and proposes Tiruvaiyaru as his birthplace. He is a famous musician and his family name &#x27;Kakarla&#x27; indicates that they were originally migrants from the village of the same name in the Cumbum taluk of Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh. His family belonged to the Smarta tradition and Bharadvaja gotra. Tyagaraja was the third son of his parents, and Panchanada Brahmam and Panchapakesha Brahmam were his elder brothers. He was named Tyagabrahmam/Tyagaraja after Tyagaraja, the presiding deity of the temple at Thiruvarur, the place of his birth. Tyagaraja&#x27;s maternal uncle was Giriraja Kavi. Giriraja Kavi was a poet and musician. Giriraja was born in Kakarla village, Cumbum taluk in Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh. He is believed to have belonged to the Kasalanadu sect. Tyagaraja&#x27;s maternal grandfather was named Kalahastayya, but was frequently addressed as Veena Kalahastayya as he was a noted veena player. Tyagaraja learned to play the veena in his childhood from Kalahastayya. After Kalahastayya&#x27;s death Tyagaraja found &quot;Naradeeyam&quot;, a book related to music. Tyagaraja hero-worshipped the celestial sage Narada; a reference to this is Tyagaraja&#x27;s krithi &quot;Vara Nārada&quot; (rāga Vijayaśrī, Ādi tāḷam). Legend has it that a hermit taught him a mantra invoking Narada, and Tyagaraja, meditating on this mantra, received a vision of Narada and was blessed with the book &quot;Svarārnavam&quot; by the sage. During his last days, Tyagaraja took vows of Sannyasa.

Sri Tyagaraja took siddhi on a Pushya Bahula Panchami day, 6 January 1847, at the age of 79, a day after he was initiated into the order of Advaita Dasanami sanyasis. His last composition before his siddhi was &quot;Giripai Nelakonna&quot; (raga Sahana, Adi talam). He was interred on the banks of the Kaveri river at Thiruvaiyaru the very next day.

==Musical career==
Tyāgarāja began his musical training at an early age under Sonti Venkata Ramanayya, a music scholar, after the latter heard his singing and was impressed by the child prodigy. Tyagaraja regarded music as a way to experience God&#x27;s love. His compositions focused on expression, rather than on the technicalities of classical music. He also showed a flair for composing music and, in his teens, composed his first song, &quot;Namo Namo Raghavayya&quot;, in the Desika Todi ragam and inscribed it on the walls of the house. His compositions are mainly of a devotional (&quot;bhakti&quot;) or philosophical nature. His songs feature himself usually either in an appeal to his deity of worship (primarily the Avatar Rama), in musings, in narratives, or giving a message to the public. He has also composed krithis in praise of Krishna, Shiva, Shakti, Ganesha, Muruga, Saraswati, and Hanuman.

Sonti Venkataramanayya informed the king of Thanjavur of Tyagaraja&#x27;s genius. The king sent an invitation, along with many rich gifts, inviting Tyagaraja to attend the royal court. Tyagaraja, however, was not inclined towards a career at the court, and rejected the invitation outright. He was said to have composed the krithi &quot;Nidhi Chala Sukhama&quot; (నిధి చాల సుఖమా) ( &quot;Does wealth bring happiness?&quot;) on this occasion.
He spent most of his time in Thiruvaiyaru, though there are records of his pilgrimages to Thirumala and Kanchipuram. When he was in Kanchipuram, he met Upanishad Brahmayogin at the Brahmendral Mutt at Kanchipuram.
Tyagaraja, who was immersed in his devotion to Rama and led a spartan way of life, did not take any steps to systematically codify his vast musical output. Rangaramanuja Iyengar, a leading researcher on Carnatic music, in his work &quot;Kriti Manimalai&quot;, has described the situation prevailing at the time of the death of Tyagaraja. It is said that a major portion of his incomparable musical work was lost to the world due to natural and man-made calamities. Usually, Tyagaraja used to sing his compositions sitting before deity manifestations of Lord Rama, and his disciples noted down the details of his compositions on palm leaves. After his death, these were in the hands of his disciples, then families descending from the disciples. There was not a definitive edition of Tyagaraja&#x27;s songs.

The songs he composed in pure Telugu were widespread in their popularity because of the ease with which they could be sung in those days. Musical experts such as Kancheepuram Nayana Pillai, Simizhi Sundaram Iyer and Veenai Dhanammal saw the infinite possibilities for imaginative music inherent in his compositions and they systematically notated the songs available to them. Subsequently, researchers like K. V. Srinivasa Iyengar and Rangaramanuja Iyengar made an enormous effort to contact various teachers and families who possessed the palm leaves. K. V. Srinivasa Iyengar brought out &quot;Adi Sangita Ratnavali&quot; and &quot;Adi Tyagaraja Hridhayam&quot; in three volumes. Rangaramanuja Iyengar published &quot;Kriti Mani Malai&quot; in two volumes. He also composed songs in Sanskrit.

Furthermore, Musiri Subramania Iyer, the doyen of Bhava Sangitam, had a vast collection of books in his library. T. K. Govinda Rao, his disciple, brought out a volume of Tyagaraja&#x27;s songs in English and Devanagari script. T. S. Parthasarathy, a leading scholar on Tyagaraja, published the text and meaning of Tyagaraja&#x27;s songs. There are also many less comprehensive publications in Telugu.

About 720 songs remain of the 24,000 songs said to have been composed by him; however, scholars are skeptical about numbers like these, as there is no biographical evidence to support such claims.
In addition to nearly 720 compositions (kritis), Tyagaraja composed two musical plays in Telugu, the &quot;Prahalada Bhakti Vijayam&quot; and the &quot;Nauka Charitam&quot;. &quot;Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam&quot; is in five acts with 45 &quot;kritis&quot; set in 28 ragas and 138 verses, in different metres in Telugu. &quot;Nauka Charitam&quot; is a shorter play in one act with 21 &quot;kritis&quot; set in 13 &quot;ragas&quot; and 43 verses. The latter is the most popular of Tyagaraja&#x27;s operas, and is a creation of the composer&#x27;s own imagination and has no basis in the Bhagavata Purana. Tyagaraja also composed a number of simple devotional pieces appropriate for choral singing.

The 20th-century Indian music critic K. V. Ramachandran wrote: &quot;Tyagaraja is an indefatigable interpreter of the past... but if with one eye he looks backward, with the other he looks forward as well. Like Prajapati, he creates his own media and adores his Rama not alone with jewel-words newly fashioned, but also with jewel-[like]-music newly created. It is this facet of Tyagaraja that distinguishes him from his illustrious contemporaries.&quot; In other words, while Tyagaraja&#x27;s contemporaries were primarily concerned with bringing to audiences the music of the past, Tyagaraja also pioneered new musical concepts at the same time.

==Remembrance==
&quot;Tyagaraja Aradhana&quot;, the commemorative music festival is held every year in Thiruvaiyaru in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, during the months of January to February in Tyagaraja&#x27;s honor. This is a week-long festival of music where various Carnatic musicians from all over the world converge at his resting place. On the Pushya Bahula Panchami, thousands of people and hundreds of Carnatic musicians sing the five Pancharatna Kritis in unison, with the accompaniment of a large bank of accompanists on veenas, violins, flutes, nadasvarams, mridangams and ghatams.

A sports complex in New Delhi, Thyagaraj Sports Complex, was named after him. A crater on the planet Mercury was named after Tyagaraja in 1976.

==In popular culture==

===Films on Tyagaraja (biographical)===
Apart from references to his works, using the &quot;kirtanas&quot; as songs, two films were made on his life. V. Nagayya made a biographical epic on Tyagaraja titled &quot;Tyagayya&quot; in 1946 which is still treated as a masterpiece of Telugu cinema. In 1981, Bapu–Ramana made &quot;Tyagayya&quot; with J. V. Somayajulu in the lead role. Another attempt is being made by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao to picturise Tyagaraja&#x27;s life. Apart from these, &quot;Bombay Gnanam&quot; made a short film known as &quot;Endaro Mahanubavulu&quot; on Tyagaraja. The short film was released on 27 February 2021, on the 174th Tyagaraja Aradhana festival.

=== Raga on Tyagaraja (Musical scale) ===
Carnatic kriti &#x27;Sri Ramachandram Bhajami&#x27; in raga &#x27;Sri Tyagaraja&#x27; created and composed by named after Saint Tyagaraja sung by Priyadarshini was released on 10 January 2023 at SriTyagaraja Samadhi during 176th Tyagaraja Aradhana festival

==Compositions==
The term &quot;Pancharatna&quot; in Sanskrit means &quot;five gems&quot;: The Pancharatnas are known as the five finest gems of Carnatic music. All of the Pancharatnas are set to the adi talam. So far as Pancharatnas are concerned, a stable text has been handed over by the earlier musicians to the present day. All the compositions of Tyagaraja show the way for the systematic development of the respective ragas. In the Pancharatnas, Tyagaraja offers parameters as to how to systematically and scientifically develop a raga. The two fundamental conditions that must be satisfied for the systematic development of a raga are the arrangement of the svaras in the natural order of arohanam, and the avarohanam of the ragas so as to satisfy the sound principles of harmony and continuity. Pancharatnas satisfy these scientific principles. The Pancharatnas are composed in perfect sarvalaghu svaras.

* The first Pancharatna kriti is Jagadanandakaraka, sung in the raga Nata. It is composed in Sanskrit. It praises Rama as the source of all joy in the universe. Originally, there were only six charanams for the song. When the disciples examined the song, it contained ninety names of Rama in Sanskrit. The disciples requested Tyagaraja to slightly expand the song by adding two charanas containing eighteen more names of Rama. The saint acceded to the request of the disciples and that is the reason why the song Jagadanandakaraka contains three mudras containing the name of Tyagaraja while the other four songs contain only one mudra each.
* The next is Duduku gala in the raga gaula set to adi talam. It is composed in Telugu. In this song, Tyagaraja takes the blame upon himself for all the misdeeds of men and ruminates on who would come and save him from this deplorable situation.
* The third is Saadhinchene in the raga Arabhi, set to adi talam. It is composed in Telugu. In this song, Tyagaraja lovingly criticizes Krishna for his cleverness in getting what he wants to be done.
* The fourth kriti, Kana Kana Ruchira is in the raga Varaali set to adi talam. It is composed in Telugu. In this song, Tyagaraja describes the infinite beauty of Rama.
* The fifth Pancharatna kriti is the Endaro Mahanubhavulu in the sri raga. It is composed in Telugu. It is said that a great musician from Kerala, Shatkala Govinda Maaraar, visited Tyagaraja and performed before him. Tyagaraja was enchanted with his performance and then was born Endaro Mahanubhavulu, regarded to be a great work of Carnatic music.

No discussion of the Tyagaraja&#x27;s Ghana raga Pancharatna can ignore the corresponding Panchabhuta mudras embedded in the 5 kritis by the Tyagaraja.

Pancha Bhuta refer to the five fundamental elements according to Hindusim - Jala, Agni, Vayu, Akasha and Bhu i.e. Water, Fire, Wind, Sky and Earth.

The Pancha Bhuta within the Tyagaraja&#x27;s Ghana raga Pancharatna was discovered in 2023.

Other compositions by Tyagaraja include Samajavaragamana in the hindolam raga, Adamodigaladhe in the charukesi raga, Raju vedale in the hanumatodi raga, Ninne nammi nanura in the todi raga, Kamalapthakula in the brindavana saranga raga, Kshira sagara shayana in the devagandhari raga, Marubalka kunna vemira ma manoramana in the Sriranjani raga, and Nagumomu kanaleni in the abheri raga.

<text>The tables contain the prime factorization of the natural numbers from 1 to 1000.

When &quot;n&quot; is a prime number, the prime factorization is just &quot;n&quot; itself, written in bold below.

The number 1 is called a unit. It has no prime factors and is neither prime nor composite.

== Properties ==
Many properties of a natural number &quot;n&quot; can be seen or directly computed from the prime factorization of &quot;n&quot;.
*The multiplicity of a prime factor &quot;p&quot; of &quot;n&quot; is the largest exponent &quot;m&quot; for which &quot;pm&quot; divides &quot;n&quot;. The tables show the multiplicity for each prime factor. If no exponent is written then the multiplicity is 1 (since &quot;p&quot; = &quot;p&quot;1). The multiplicity of a prime which does not divide &quot;n&quot; may be called 0 or may be considered undefined.
*Ω(&quot;n&quot;), the prime omega function, is the number of prime factors of &quot;n&quot; counted with multiplicity (so it is the sum of all prime factor multiplicities).
*A prime number has Ω(&quot;n&quot;) = 1. The first: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 . There are many special types of prime numbers.
*A composite number has Ω(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; 1. The first: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21 . All numbers above 1 are either prime or composite. 1 is neither.
*A semiprime has Ω(&quot;n&quot;) = 2 (so it is composite). The first: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34 .
*A &quot;k&quot;-almost prime (for a natural number &quot;k&quot;) has Ω(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;k&quot; (so it is composite if &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1).
*An even number has the prime factor 2. The first: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 .
*An odd number does not have the prime factor 2. The first: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 . All integers are either even or odd.
*A square has even multiplicity for all prime factors (it is of the form &quot;a&quot;2 for some &quot;a&quot;). The first: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144 .
*A cube has all multiplicities divisible by 3 (it is of the form &quot;a&quot;3 for some &quot;a&quot;). The first: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728 .
*A perfect power has a common divisor &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1 for all multiplicities (it is of the form &quot;am&quot; for some &quot;a&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;m&quot; &gt; 1). The first: 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 . 1 is sometimes included.
*A powerful number (also called squareful) has multiplicity above 1 for all prime factors. The first: 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72 .
*A prime power has only one prime factor. The first: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 . 1 is sometimes included.
*An Achilles number is powerful but not a perfect power. The first: 72, 108, 200, 288, 392, 432, 500, 648, 675, 800, 864, 968 .
*A square-free integer has no prime factor with multiplicity above 1. The first: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 . A number where some but not all prime factors have multiplicity above 1 is neither square-free nor squareful.
*The Liouville function λ(&quot;n&quot;) is 1 if Ω(&quot;n&quot;) is even, and is -1 if Ω(&quot;n&quot;) is odd.
*The Möbius function μ(&quot;n&quot;) is 0 if &quot;n&quot; is not square-free. Otherwise μ(&quot;n&quot;) is 1 if Ω(&quot;n&quot;) is even, and is −1 if Ω(&quot;n&quot;) is odd.
*A sphenic number has Ω(&quot;n&quot;) = 3 and is square-free (so it is the product of 3 distinct primes). The first: 30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154 .
*&quot;a&quot;0(&quot;n&quot;) is the sum of primes dividing &quot;n&quot;, counted with multiplicity. It is an additive function.
*A Ruth-Aaron pair is two consecutive numbers (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;+1) with &quot;a&quot;0(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;0(&quot;x&quot;+1). The first (by &quot;x&quot; value): 5, 8, 15, 77, 125, 714, 948, 1330, 1520, 1862, 2491, 3248 . Another definition is where the same prime is only counted once; if so, the first (by &quot;x&quot; value): 5, 24, 49, 77, 104, 153, 369, 492, 714, 1682, 2107, 2299 .
*A primorial &quot;x&quot;# is the product of all primes from 2 to &quot;x&quot;. The first: 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, 30030, 510510, 9699690, 223092870, 6469693230, 200560490130, 7420738134810 . 1# = 1 is sometimes included.
*A factorial &quot;x&quot;! is the product of all numbers from 1 to &quot;x&quot;. The first: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600 . 0! = 1 is sometimes included.
*A &quot;k&quot;-smooth number (for a natural number &quot;k&quot;) has its prime factors ≤ &quot;k&quot; (so it is also &quot;j&quot;-smooth for any &quot;j&quot; &gt; &quot;k&quot;).
*&quot;m&quot; is smoother than &quot;n&quot; if the largest prime factor of &quot;m&quot; is below the largest of &quot;n&quot;.
*A regular number has no prime factor above 5 (so it is 5-smooth). The first: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 .
*A &quot;k&quot;-powersmooth number has all &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is a prime factor with multiplicity &quot;m&quot;.
*A frugal number has more digits than the number of digits in its prime factorization (when written like the tables below with multiplicities above 1 as exponents). The first in decimal: 125, 128, 243, 256, 343, 512, 625, 729, 1024, 1029, 1215, 1250 .
*An equidigital number has the same number of digits as its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 .
*An extravagant number has fewer digits than its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 .
*An economical number has been defined as a frugal number, but also as a number that is either frugal or equidigital.
*gcd(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) (greatest common divisor of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;) is the product of all prime factors which are both in &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; (with the smallest multiplicity for &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;).
*&quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime (also called relatively prime) if gcd(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = 1 (meaning they have no common prime factor).
*lcm(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) (least common multiple of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;) is the product of all prime factors of &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot; (with the largest multiplicity for &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;).
*gcd(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) × lcm(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot;. Finding the prime factors is often harder than computing gcd and lcm using other algorithms which do not require known prime factorization.
*&quot;m&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot; (also called &quot;m&quot; divides &quot;n&quot;, or &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;m&quot;) if all prime factors of &quot;m&quot; have at least the same multiplicity in &quot;n&quot;.
The divisors of &quot;n&quot; are all products of some or all prime factors of &quot;n&quot; (including the empty product 1 of no prime factors).
The number of divisors can be computed by increasing all multiplicities by 1 and then multiplying them.
Divisors and properties related to divisors are shown in table of divisors.

<text>Tallapaka Annamacharya () (09 May 1408 – 23 February 1503), also popularly known as Annamayya, was a Telugu musician, composer, and a Hindu saint. He is the earliest known Indian musician to compose songs called &quot;samkirtanas.&quot; His devotional samkirtanas were in the praise of Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu. Annamayya is said to have composed as many as 32,000 samkirtanas (songs) in the praise of Venkateswara of which only about 12,000 are available today. He wrote the highest number of Kirtanas of all time in the praise of Lord Vishnu The musical form of the kirtana songs that he composed, which are still popular among Carnatic music concert artists, have strongly influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. His compositions are classified as Adhyatma (spiritual) and Sringara (romantic). Annamacharya is remembered for his saintly life, as one of the greatest musicians and is honoured as a great devotee of Vishnu by devotees and saintly singers. He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era.

He is believed to have been the avatar of Nandaka, the sword of Vishnu. He is widely regarded as the &quot;Andhra Pada kavitā Pitāmaha&quot; (Grandfather of Telugu song-writing).

==Personal life==
Tallapaka Annamacharya was born on Vaishakha Shuddha Pournami in the year Sarwadhari (22 May 1408) in Tallapaka, Near Rajampeta Mandalam, a village in present-day Annamayya district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Even though his parents belonged to the Nandavarika Niyogi Brahmin community of Smarta tradition, he accepted initiation into Vaishnavism and became a Vaishnava of the Ramanuja Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya initiated by the Jeeyar of Ahobila Mutt which follows the vadakalai tradition. His wife, Timmakka, had written &quot;Subhadra Kalyanam&quot;, and is considered the first female poet in Telugu literature. Their son, Pedda Tirumalacharya, and grandson, Tallapaka Chinnayya, were also composers and poets. The Tallapaka compositions are considered to have dominated and influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. Annamacharya lived for 95 years until Phalguna Bahula (Krishna) Dvadashi (12th day after full moon) in the year Dhundhubhi (4 April 1503).

==Literary career==
Annamayya is said to have composed as many as 32,000 samkirtanas (songs) on the praise of Venkateswara of which only about 12,000 are available today. He is also the author of musical treatise called &quot;Samkirthana lakshanamu&quot;.

Annamayya considered his compositions as floral offerings to Venkateswara. In the poems, he praises the deity, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the deity, confesses the devotee&#x27;s failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateswara. His songs are classified into the Adhyatma (spiritual) and Shringara (romantic) &quot;samkirtanas&quot; genres. His songs in the &quot;Sringara&quot; genre worship Venkateswara by describing the romantic adventures of Venkateswara and his consort Alamelu, while others describe the &quot;bhakti&quot; of his devotees.

In his later keertanas, he espouses subjects such as morality, dharma and righteousness. He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his samkirtanas explaining that the relationship between God and humans is the same irrespective of the latter&#x27;s colour, caste and financial status, in his songs &quot;&quot;Brahmaṃ Okkatē Paraḥbrahmamokkatē&quot; and &quot;ē kulajuḍainanēmi evvaḍainanēmi&quot;. His prodigious literary career earned him a place among the all-time greats of Telugu literature.

== Legacy ==

While he enjoyed popularity in his days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries. Mentioned in 1849, they were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Venkateswara temple at Tirumala, just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room. An English translation of 150 of these verses was published in 2005.

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, also known as TTD, has been endeavouring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions. In the year 1950, The State Government of Andhra Pradesh created a committee and appointed the musician late Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna as its head. He set music to over 800 compositions of Annamacharya. He was the &quot;Āsthāna Gāyaka&quot; of the Tirumala temple at Tirupati for two decades. He is regarded as a legend for rendering devotional music in classical style, especially the Annamacharya Sankirtanas. He was also an acclaimed poet, singer, and musicologist. In 1979, the singer Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi&#x27;s album Balaji Pancharatna Mala came up with Annamacharya keerthanas like Vande Vasudevam, Bhavamulona, Sriman Narayana and many more.

Shobha Raju is the first recipient of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams scholarship in 1976 to study and set a trend for the propagation of Annamacharya&#x27;s compositions, and was also chosen as the first exclusive artiste for the propagation of Tallapaka&#x27;s compositions in 1978. Her first audio album, &quot;Vēnkatēśvara Gīta Mālika&quot;&quot; is globally popular among the Telugu community. She is the founder of Annamacharya Bhavana Vahini (ABV) in 1983, which is located in Hyderabad, India. She has been awarded Padmashri by the Government of India, in 2010 in recognition of her efforts to promote Annamayya Compositions. Garimella Balakrishna Prasad, a Carnatic music exponent and the Asthana Vidwan of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has set tune to more than six hundred songs written by Annamacharya, gave audio recordings for TTD, published books with musical notations and conducted classes, teaching the songs to make them more popular.

In 1994, reputed Bharathanatyam artist Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala, also the daughter-in-law of the singer Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao, for the first time produced and presented a mammoth dance production as a tribute to the divine composer titled &quot;Annamaiyah&quot;. Rare and popular songs were woven into a story format and music by stalwarts was set to action. This production was inaugurated by the former President of India R. Venkatraman and Bharat Ratna-winning singer M. S. Subbulakshmi and later that year for the Tirumala Brahmotsavam. In 2009, a DVD of the production was launched which included several places visited by the saint himself.

A Telugu film named &quot;Annamayya&quot; was made on him by K. Raghavendra Rao in 1997. It starred Nagarjuna in the lead role as Annamacharya and also featured Suman as Venkateswara and Bhanupriya as Goddess Padmavati in important roles.

In 2017, one of Annamayya&#x27;s compositions, Brahmam Okate, became a YouTube sensation. As of early 2019, this video alone (produced by Kuldeep M. Pai) has garnered over 11 million views and made the child singers Sooryagayathri and Rahul Vellal household names for their flawless rendering of the classic keerthana. Professional singers P. Unnikrishnan and Sreeranjini Kodampally have their performances of the composition on YouTube.

<text>Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) is an independent government trust in India managed by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The trust primarily oversees the operations and finances of the richest and the most visited religious center Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala. It is also involved in various social, religious, literary and educational activities. TTD is headquartered at Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, India and employs about 16,000 people. 

Srivani trust was set up by TTD in 2019 to promote Sanātana Dharma by constructing temples in SC-ST-BC habitations, renovating ancient temples, and providing funds under Dhup-Deepa-Naivedyam Scheme to those temples facing financial difficulty. By January 2023, TTD has taken up construction of 2,068 temples in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Pondicherry and Karnataka.

The total net worth of the organization in 2024 is (), making it the richest Hindu temple board in the world.

==Establishment and legislative setting==
TTD was established in 1932 as a result of the TTD Act of 1932. According to the act administration of the temple was vested in a committee of seven members and overseen by a paid commissioner appointed by the Government of Madras Presidency. Advising the committee were two advisory councils – one composed of priests and temple administrators to aid the committee with the operations of the Tirumala temple, and another composed of farmers for advice on Tirumala&#x27;s land and estate transactions.

The Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institution and Endowments Act (1969), sections 85 to 91, expanded the provisions of TTD. The number of trustees was expanded from five to eleven with compulsory representation from certain communities. Apart from the responsibilities defined in the previous act, Devasthanam was obliged to promote the study of Indian languages and propagate Hindu dharma by research, teaching, training and literature creation.

The A.P. Charitable &amp; Hindu Religious Institutions &amp; Endowments Act (1987) superseded the 1979 act. The Board of Trustees&#x27; membership was expanded from a maximum of eleven to fifteen and the hereditary rights of temple priests and their right to garner a share of the hundi proceeds were abolished. After increased pressure from the priests over a long period, the Andhra Pradesh government made an amendment to the act in 2006, to discontinue these two controversial clauses. It is mandatory for non-Hindus visiting the temple to sign a declaration form before entering the temple, stating that they have faith in the presiding deity, Lord Venkateswara.

==Temples under TTD administration==

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams trust primarily manages the administration of Lord Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala. It also manages many other temples in Tirupati and all around the world. The temples include both historical and new temples which were constructed by TTD itself.

==TTD Chairman&#x27;s==


==Departments==
TTD has almost all the responsibilities that a government has, including departments for production (laddus), engineering (dams and roads), water supply, human resources, transport, procurement and marketing, finance and accounting, public relations, information technology, forest and gardens, educational institutions and hospitals, revenue and general administration.

==Services==
TTD provides various services for pilgrims to Tirumala and Tirupati, including bus services, food and accommodation. It maintains the queue management system, facilitates head tonsure and distribution of laddu. It runs information and ticketing centers in the major towns and cities across the country. It maintains various marriage halls, degree colleges, junior colleges and high schools. Sri Venkateswara Central Library and Research Centre (SVCLRC), established by TTD in 1993, houses approximately 40,000 volumes of books, mainly on religion and philosophy. The Research Wing works towards studying and publishing material related to the Hindu religion, produces authentic papers on original sanskrit texts, and provide translations of major Hindu works in various languages, including Telugu. 

Dharma Prachara Parishad was established to propagate the Hindu dharma. TTD also helps promote the age-old cultural heritage of India, in the areas of traditional sculpture and architecture, temple renovation and reconstructions and restoration of Hindu sculptures. Complex queueing algorithms and emerging technologies have been evaluated and implemented to manage the huge crowds with Tata Consultancy Services designing and implementing the software and hardware infrastructure for queue management along with other companies.

TTD has released a schedule for every month tickets release.
===Annaprasadam===
The food offerings as &quot;Annaprasadams&quot; are being undertaken by TTD in a massive way in the Matrusri Tarigonda Vengamamba Annaprasadam Complex, donated by Matrsuri Tarigonda Ananta Koti Raju at Tirumala, in all the waiting queue lines and compartments of Vaikuntam Queue Complex I and II, footpath routes, etc.

Donations given by devotees equal nearly ₹13 crore every month. Auctions of human hair fetched a revenue of 150 crores in 2011 and 203 crores in 2012. Temple admission ticket sales fetched a revenue of $25 million in 2007. Laddu, a confectionery, is offered as Lord&#x27;s prasadam. TTD has procured machines from MICO BOSCH to automate the manufacture of laddus. Sale of laddus fetched a revenue of staggering $10 million in 2007.

<text>Linnik&#x27;s theorem in analytic number theory answers a natural question after Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions. It asserts that there exist positive &quot;c&quot; and &quot;L&quot; such that, if we denote p(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;d&quot;) the least prime in the arithmetic progression

:formula_1

where &quot;n&quot; runs through the positive integers and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are any given positive coprime integers with 1 ≤ &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot; − 1, then:

: formula_2

The theorem is named after Yuri Vladimirovich Linnik, who proved it in 1944. Although Linnik&#x27;s proof showed &quot;c&quot; and &quot;L&quot; to be effectively computable, he provided no numerical values for them.

It follows from Zsigmondy&#x27;s theorem that p(1,&quot;d&quot;) ≤ 2&quot;d&quot; − 1, for all &quot;d&quot; ≥ 3. It is known that p(1,&quot;p&quot;) ≤ L&quot;p&quot;, for all primes &quot;p&quot; ≥ 5, as L&quot;p&quot; is congruent to 1 modulo &quot;p&quot; for all prime numbers &quot;p&quot;, where L&quot;p&quot; denotes the &quot;p&quot;-th Lucas number. Just like Mersenne numbers, Lucas numbers with prime indices have divisors of the form 2&quot;kp&quot;+1.

== Properties ==

It is known that &quot;L&quot; ≤ 2 for almost all integers &quot;d&quot;.

On the generalized Riemann hypothesis it can be shown that

: formula_3

where formula_4 is the totient function,
and the stronger bound

: formula_5
has been also proved.

It is also conjectured that:

: formula_6 

== Bounds for &quot;L&quot; ==
The constant &quot;L&quot; is called Linnik&#x27;s constant and the following table shows the progress that has been made on determining its size.

Moreover, in Heath-Brown&#x27;s result the constant &quot;c&quot; is effectively computable.

<text>Tirumala or Tirumalai is a spiritual place in Tirupati district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is one of the neighbourhoods of the Tirupati city. The town is a part of Tirupati Urban Development Authority and located in Tirupati (urban) mandal of Tirupati revenue division. 
The town is strictly vegetarian. It is a hill town where Tirumala Venkateswara Temple is located, a popular shrine of Vishnu. Vishnu was considered to reside here with his full power, as in Vaikuntha, and thus the place was also called &#x27;Bhuloka Vaikuntha&#x27;.
== Etymology ==

The word Tirumala is of Dravidian origin, specifically from the Tamil language. The term “Tiru” means sacred or holy, and “Mala” means mountain or hill. The prefix &quot;Tiru&quot; (or &quot;Thiru&quot;) is a widely recognized Tamil word meaning &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;holy,&quot; and is used in many South Indian place names.

==Geography==
Tirumala is located above sea level and covers an area of approximately . Surrounding the hills are seven peaks of Seshachalam range, Eastern Ghats namely Seshadri, Neeladri, Garudadri, Anjanadri, Vrushabadri, Narayanadri, and Venkatadri. The temple of Venkateswara is on the seventh peak (Venkatadri).

At the 12 km (7.5 mi) point on the Tirupati – Tirumala Ghat road, there is a major discontinuity of stratigraphic significance that represents a period of remarkable serenity in the geological history of the Earth. This is referred to as the Eparchaean Unconformity. This unconformity separates the Nagari Quartzite of the Proterozoic from the granite of the Archean, representing a time gap of 800 Mya. In 2001, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) declared the Eparchaean Unconformity to be one of the 26 &quot;Geological Monuments of India&quot;.

Silathoranam, a natural arch and a distinctive geological wonder is located in Tirumala Hills at a distance of from Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. The arch measures in width and metres in height and is eroded out of quartizite of Cuddapah Supergroup of Middle to Upper Proterozoic (1600 to 570 Mya) by weathering agents such as water and wind.

=== Climate ===

Tirumala has a humid subtropical climate designated Cwa, with dry winters under the Köppen climate classification. As the hill shrine is situated amidst the hills, the temperature will go below 10 degrees in winter. Summers are not as hot here, especially compared to Tirupati. The southwest monsoon season starts from June, but rains are not heavy. Occasionally, thunderstorms form and downpours may persist for hours. Pertaining to orographic relief, the northeast monsoon remains active over the region for 2 months. It causes flooding. The highest 24-hour rainfall on record was on 23 November 2005, followed by on 9 November 2015.

==Legend==

<text>The numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), also known as the noombat or walpurti, is an insectivorous marsupial. It is diurnal and its diet consists almost exclusively of termites.

The species was once widespread across southern Australia, but is now restricted to several small colonies in Western Australia. It is therefore considered an endangered species and protected by conservation programs. Numbats were recently re-introduced to fenced reserves in South Australia and New South Wales. The numbat is the faunal emblem of Western Australia.

== Taxonomy ==
The numbat genus Myrmecobius is the sole member of the family Myrmecobiidae, one of four families that make up the order Dasyuromorphia, the Australian marsupial carnivores.

The species is not closely related to other extant marsupials; the current arrangement in the order Dasyuromorphia places its monotypic family with the diverse and carnivorous species of Dasyuridae. Genetic studies have shown the ancestors of the numbat diverged from other marsupials between 32 and 42 million years ago, during the late Eocene.

Two subspecies have been described, but one of these—the rusty coloured Myrmecobius fasciatus rufus Finlayson, 1933,—has been extinct since at least the 1960s, and only the nominate subspecies (&quot;M. fasciatus fasciatus&quot;) is extant. The population described by Finlayson occurred in the arid central regions of South Australia, and he thought they had once extended to the coast. The separation to subspecies was not recognised in the national census of Australian mammals, following W. D. L. Ride and others. As its name implies, &quot;M. fasciatus rufus&quot; had a more reddish coat than the surviving population. Only a very small number of fossil specimens are known, the oldest dating back to the Pleistocene, and no other species from the same family have been identified.

The following is a phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genome sequences:
Placement of the family within the order of dasyuromorphs may be summarised as
* Order Dasyuromorphia
** Family Thylacinidae
** Family Dasyuridae (72 species in 20 genera)
** Family Myrmecobiidae
*** Genus Myrmecobius
**** Species Myrmecobius fasciatus
** Family †Malleodectidae

The common names are adopted from the extant names at the time of English colonisation, &quot;numbat&quot;, from the Nyungar language of southwest Australia, and &quot;walpurti&quot;, the name in the Pitjantjatjara dialect. The orthography and pronunciation of the Nyungar name is regularised, following a survey of published sources and contemporary consultation that resulted in the name noombat, pronounced noom&#x27;bat.

Other names include banded anteater and marsupial anteater.

==Description==

The numbat is a small, distinctively-striped animal between long, including the tail, with a finely pointed muzzle and a prominent, bushy tail about the same length as its body. Colour varies considerably, from soft grey to reddish-brown, often with an area of brick red on the upper back, and always with a conspicuous black stripe running from the tip of the muzzle through the eye to the base of the small, round-tipped ear. Between four and eleven white stripes cross the animal&#x27;s hindquarters, which gradually become fainter towards the midback. The underside is cream or light grey, while the tail is covered with long, grey hair flecked with white. Weight varies between .

Unlike most other marsupials, the numbat is diurnal, largely because of the constraints of having a specialised diet without having the usual physical equipment for it. Most ecosystems with a generous supply of termites have a fairly large creature with powerful forelimbs bearing heavy claws. Numbats are not large, and they have five toes on the fore feet, and four on the hind feet. However, like other mammals that eat termites or ants, the numbat has a degenerate jaw with up to 50 very small, nonfunctional teeth, and although it is able to chew, rarely does so, because of the soft nature of its diet. Uniquely among terrestrial mammals, an additional cheek tooth is located between the premolars and molars; whether this represents a supernumerary molar tooth or a deciduous tooth retained into adult life is unclear. As a result, although not all individuals have the same dental formula, in general, it follows the unique pattern: 

Like many ant- or termite-eating animals, the numbat has a long and narrow tongue coated with sticky saliva produced by large submandibular glands. A further adaptation to the diet is the presence of numerous ridges along the soft palate, which apparently help to scrape termites off the tongue so they can be swallowed. The digestive system is relatively simple, and lacks many of the adaptations found in other entomophagous animals, presumably because termites are easier to digest than ants, having a softer exoskeleton. Numbats are apparently able to gain a considerable amount of water from their diets, since their kidneys lack the usual specialisations for retaining water found in other animals living in their arid environment. Numbats also possess a sternal scent gland, which may be used for marking their territories.

Although the numbat finds termite mounds primarily using scent, it has the highest visual acuity of any marsupial, and, unusually for marsupials, has a high proportion of cone cells in the retina. These are both likely adaptations for its diurnal habits, and vision does appear to be the primary sense used to detect potential predators.

==Distribution and habitat==
Numbats were formerly widely distributed across southern Australia, from Western Australia to north-western New South Wales. However, their range has significantly decreased since the arrival of Europeans, and the species has survived only in two small patches of land in the Dryandra Woodland and the Tone-Perup Nature Reserve, both in Western Australia.

Today, numbats are naturally found only in areas of eucalypt forest, but they were once more widespread in other types of semiarid woodland, spinifex grassland, and in terrain dominated by sand dune. There are estimated to be fewer than 1,000 left in the wild.

After measures aimed at excluding feral cats, the number of numbats trapped during annual population surveys in the Dryandra Woodland had increased to 35 by November 2020, after recording just 10 in 2019 and 5 in 2018. There had not been so many numbats recorded since 36 were recorded in the 1990s.

The species has been successfully reintroduced into three fenced, feral predator-proof reserves in more varied environments; Yookamurra Sanctuary in the mallee of South Australia, Scotia Sanctuary in semi-arid NSW, and Western Australia&#x27;s Mount Gibson Sanctuary. Reintroduction began at large fenced reserves in Mallee Cliffs National Park in NSW in December 2020, and on South Australia&#x27;s Eyre Peninsula in 2022.

Attempted reintroductions of the species to fenced reserves in two other areas – one in the South Australian arid zone, near Roxby Downs, and the other in the northernmost part of its former range, at Newhaven Sanctuary in the Northern Territory – both failed.

There are plans to reintroduce the species to a managed and semi-fenced area of the southern Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, as part of the Marna Banggara (formerly Great Southern Ark) project.

==Ecology and habits==

Numbats are insectivores and subsist on a diet of termites (of the genera &quot;Heterotermes&quot;, &quot;Coptotermes&quot;, &quot;Amitermes&quot;, &quot;Microcerotermes&quot;, &quot;Termes&quot;, &quot;Paracapritermes&quot;, &quot;Nasutitermes&quot;, &quot;Tumulitermes&quot;, and &quot;Occasitermes&quot;). An adult numbat requires up to 20,000 termites each day. The only marsupial fully active by day, the numbat spends most of its time searching for termites. It digs them up from loose earth with its front claws and captures them with its long, sticky tongue. Despite its banded anteater name, it apparently does not intentionally eat ants; although the remains of ants have occasionally been found in numbat excreta, these belong to species that themselves prey on termites, so were presumably eaten accidentally, along with the main food. Known native predators include various reptiles and raptors, such as the carpet python, sand goanna, wedge-tailed eagle, collared sparrowhawk, brown goshawk, and the little eagle. They are also preyed upon by invasive red foxes and feral cats.

Adult numbats are solitary and territorial; an individual male or female establishes a territory of up to 1.5 square km (370 acres) early in life, and defends it from others of the same sex. The animal generally remains within that territory from then on; male and female territories overlap, and in the breeding season, males will venture outside their normal home ranges to find mates.

While the numbat has relatively powerful claws for its size, it is not strong enough to get at termites inside their concrete-like mounds, and so must wait until the termites are active. It uses a well-developed sense of smell to locate the shallow and unfortified underground galleries that termites construct between the nest and their feeding sites; these are usually only a short distance below the surface of the soil, and vulnerable to the numbat&#x27;s digging claws.

The numbat synchronises its day with termite activity, which is temperature dependent: in winter, it feeds from midmorning to midafternoon; in summer, it rises earlier, takes shelter during the heat of the day, and feeds again in the late afternoon. Numbats are able to enter a state of torpor, which may last up to fifteen hours a day during the winter months.

At night, the numbat retreats to a nest, which can be in a log or tree hollow, or in a burrow, typically a narrow shaft long which terminates in a spherical chamber lined with soft plant material: grass, leaves, flowers, and shredded bark. The numbat is able to block the opening of its nest, with the thick hide of its rump, to prevent a predator being able to access the burrow.

Numbats have relatively few vocalisations, but have been reported to hiss, growl, or make a repetitive &#x27;tut&#x27; sound when disturbed.

==Reproduction==
Numbats breed in February and March (late austral summer), normally producing one litter a year. They are able to produce a second if the first is lost. Gestation lasts 15 days, and results in the birth of four young. Unusual for marsupials, female numbats have no pouch, although the four teats are protected by a patch of crimped, golden hair and by the swelling of the surrounding abdomen and thighs during lactation.

The young are long at birth. They crawl immediately to the teats and remain attached until late July or early August, by which time they have grown to . They are long when they first develop fur, the patterning of the adult begins to appear once they reach . The young are left in a nest or carried on the mother&#x27;s back after weaning, becoming fully independent by November. Females are sexually mature by the following summer, but males do not reach maturity for another year.

==Conservation status==

At the time of European colonisation, the numbat was found across western, central, and southern regions of Australia, extending as far east as New South Wales and Victorian state borders and as far north as the southwest corner of the Northern Territory. It was at home in a wide range of woodland and semiarid habitats. The deliberate release of the European red fox in the 19th century, however, is presumed to have wiped out the entire numbat population in Victoria, NSW, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and almost all numbats in Western Australia. By the late 1970s, the population was well under 1,000 individuals, concentrated in two small areas not far from Perth, at protected areas of the Dryandra forest and at Perup.

The population recognised and described as a subspecies by Finlayson, &quot;M. fasciatus rufus&quot;, is presumed to be extinct.

The first record of the species described it as beautiful, and its popular appeal led to its selection as the faunal emblem of the state of Western Australia and initiated efforts to conserve it from extinction.

The two small Western Australia populations apparently were able to survive because both areas have many hollow logs that may serve as refuge from predators. Being diurnal, the numbat is much more vulnerable to predation than most other marsupials of a similar size: its natural predators include the little eagle, brown goshawk, collared sparrowhawk, and carpet python. When the Western Australia government instituted an experimental program of fox baiting at Dryandra (one of the two remaining sites), numbat sightings increased by a factor of 40.

An intensive research and conservation program since 1980 has succeeded in increasing the numbat population substantially, and reintroductions to fox-free areas have begun. Perth Zoo is very closely involved in breeding this native species in captivity for release into the wild. Despite the encouraging degree of success so far, the numbat remains at considerable risk of extinction and is classified as an endangered species.

Since 2006, Project Numbat volunteers have helped to save the numbat from extinction. One of Project Numbat&#x27;s main objectives is to raise funds that go towards conservation projects, and to raise awareness through presentations held by volunteers at schools, community groups and events.

Numbats can be successfully reintroduced into areas of their former range if protected from introduced predators.

==Early records==

The numbat first became known to Europeans in 1831. It was discovered by an exploration party exploring the Avon Valley under the leadership of Robert Dale. George Fletcher Moore, who was a member of the expedition, drew a picture in his diary on 22 September 1831, and recounted the discovery:

and the following day:

The first classification of specimens was published by George Robert Waterhouse, describing the species in 1836 and the family in 1841.

&quot;Myrmecobius fasciatus&quot; was included in the first part of John Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot;, issued in 1845, with a plate by H. C. Richter illustrating the species.

<text>Bagan (, ; formerly Pagan) is an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mandalay Region of Myanmar. From the 9th to 13th centuries, the city was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom, the first kingdom that unified the regions that would later constitute Myanmar. During the kingdom&#x27;s height between the 11th and 13th centuries, more than 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2200 temples and pagodas survive.

The Bagan Archaeological Zone is a main attraction for the country&#x27;s nascent tourism industry.

==Etymology==
Bagan is the present-day standard Burmese pronunciation of the Burmese word &quot;Pugan&quot; (), derived from Old Burmese &quot;Pukam&quot; (). Its classical Pali name is &quot;Arimaddanapura&quot; (, lit. &quot;the City that Tramples on Enemies&quot;). Its other names in Pali are in reference to its extreme dry zone climate: &quot;Tattadesa&quot; (, &quot;parched land&quot;), and &quot;Tampadīpa&quot; (, &quot;bronzed country&quot;). The Burmese chronicles also report other classical names of &quot;Thiri Pyissaya&quot; (; ) and &quot;Tampawaddy&quot; (; ).

==History==

===9th to 13th centuries===


According to the royal chronicles, Bagan was founded in the second century CE, and fortified in 849 by King Pyinbya, 34th successor of the founder of early Bagan. Western scholarship however holds that Bagan was founded in the mid-to-late 9th century by the Mranma (Burmans), who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the Nanzhao Kingdom. It was among several competing Pyu city-states until the late 10th century when the Burman settlement grew in authority and grandeur.

From 1044 to 1287, Bagan was the capital as well as the political, economic and cultural nerve center of the Bagan Empire. Over the course of 250 years, Bagan&#x27;s rulers and their wealthy subjects constructed over 10,000 religious monuments (approximately 1000 stupas, 10,000 small temples and 3000 monasteries) in an area of in the Bagan plains. The prosperous city grew in size and grandeur, and became a cosmopolitan center for religious and secular studies, specializing in Pali scholarship in grammar and philosophical-psychological (&quot;abhidhamma&quot;) studies as well as works in a variety of languages on prosody, phonology, grammar, astrology, alchemy, medicine, and legal studies. The city attracted monks and students from as far as India, Sri Lanka and the Khmer Empire.

The culture of Bagan was dominated by religion. The religion of Bagan was fluid, syncretic and by later standards, unorthodox. It was largely a continuation of religious trends in the Pyu era where Theravada Buddhism co-existed with Mahayana Buddhism, Tantric Buddhism, various Hindu (Saivite, and Vaishana) schools as well as native animist (&quot;nat&quot;) traditions. While the royal patronage of Theravada Buddhism since the mid-11th century had enabled the Buddhist school to gradually gain primacy, other traditions continued to thrive throughout the Pagan period to degrees later unseen.

Bagan&#x27;s basic physical layout had already taken shape by the late 11th century, which was the first major period of monument building. A main strip extending for about 9 km along the east bank of the Irrawaddy emerged during this period, with the walled core (known as &quot;Old Bagan&quot;) in the middle. 11th-century construction took place throughout this whole area and appears to have been relatively decentralized. The spread of monuments north and south of Old Bagan, according to Hudson, Nyein Lwin, and Win Maung, may reflect construction at the village level, which may have been encouraged by the main elite at Old Bagan.

The peak of monument building took place between about 1150 and 1200. Most of Bagan&#x27;s largest buildings were built during this period. The overall amount of building material used also peaked during this phase. Construction clustered around Old Bagan, but also took place up and down the main strip, and there was also some expansion to the east, away from the Irrawaddy.

By the 13th century, the area around Old Bagan was already densely packed with monuments, and new major clusters began to emerge to the east. These new clusters, like the monastic area of Minnanthu, were roughly equally distant – and equally accessible – from any part of the original strip that had been defined in the 11th century. Construction during the 13th century featured a significant increase in the building of monasteries and associated smaller monuments. Michael Aung-Thwin has suggested that the smaller sizes may indicate &quot;dwindling economic resources&quot; and that the clustering around monasteries may reflect growing monastic influence. Bob Hudson, Nyein Lwin, and Win Maung also suggest that there was a broadening of donor activity during this period: &quot;the religious merit that accrued from endowing an individual merit was more widely accessible&quot;, and more private individuals were endowing small monuments. As with before, this may have taken place at the village level.

Both Bagan itself and the surrounding countryside offered plenty of opportunities for employment in various sectors. The prolific temple building alone would have been a huge stimulus for professions involved in their construction, such as brickmaking and masonry; gold, silver, and bronze working; carpentry and woodcarving; and ceramics. Finished temples would still need maintenance work done, so they continued to boost demand for both artisans&#x27; services and unskilled labor well after their construction. Accountants, bankers, and scribes were also necessary to manage the temple properties. These workers, especially the artisans, were paid well, which attracted many people to move to Bagan. Contemporary inscriptions indicate that &quot;people of many linguistic and cultural backgrounds lived and worked&quot; in Bagan during this time period. 
Bagan&#x27;s ascendancy also coincided with a period of political and economic decline in several other nearby regions, like Dvaravati, Srivijaya, and the Chola Empire. As a result, immigrants from those places likely also ended up moving to Bagan, in addition to people moving there from within Myanmar.

The Pagan Empire collapsed in 1287 due to repeated Mongol invasions (1277–1301). Recent research shows that Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. According to Michael Aung-Thwin, a more likely explanation is that the provincial governors tasked with defending against Mongol incursions were so successful that they became &quot;the new power elite&quot;, and their capitals became the new political centers while Bagan itself became a backwater. In any case, something during this period caused Bagan to decline. The city, once home to some 50,000 to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The city formally ceased to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the Myinsaing Kingdom became the new power in Upper Burma.

===14th to 19th centuries===

Bagan survived into the 15th century as a human settlement, and as a pilgrimage destination throughout the imperial period. A smaller number of &quot;new and impressive&quot; religious monuments still went up to the mid-15th century but afterward, new temple constructions slowed to a trickle with fewer than 200 temples built between the 15th and 20th centuries. The old capital remained a pilgrimage destination but pilgrimage was focused only on &quot;a score or so&quot; most prominent temples out of the thousands such as the Ananda, the Shwezigon, the Sulamani, the Htilominlo, the Dhammayazika, and a few other temples along an ancient road. The rest—thousands of less famous, out-of-the-way temples—fell into disrepair, and most did not survive the test of time.

For the few dozen temples that were regularly patronized, the continued patronage meant regular upkeep as well as architectural additions donated by the devotees. Many temples were repainted with new frescoes on top of their original Pagan era ones, or fitted with new Buddha statutes. Then came a series of state-sponsored &quot;systematic&quot; renovations in the Konbaung period (1752–1885), which by and large were not true to the original designs—some finished with &quot;a rude plastered surface, scratched without taste, art or result&quot;. The interiors of some temples were also whitewashed, such as the Thatbyinnyu and the Ananda. Many painted inscriptions and even murals were added in this period.

===20th century to present===
Bagan, located in an active earthquake zone, had suffered from many earthquakes over the ages, with over 400 recorded earthquakes between 1904 and 1975. A major earthquake occurred on 8 July 1975, reaching 8 MM in Bagan and Myinkaba, and 7 MM in Nyaung-U. The quake damaged many temples, in many cases, such as the Bupaya, severely and irreparably. Today, 2229 temples and pagodas remain.

Many of these damaged pagodas underwent restorations in the 1990s by the military government, which sought to make Bagan an international tourist destination. However, the restoration efforts instead drew widespread condemnation from art historians and preservationists worldwide. Critics were aghast that the restorations paid little attention to original architectural styles, and used modern materials, and that the government has also established a golf course, a paved highway, and built a watchtower. Although the government believed that the ancient capital&#x27;s hundreds of (unrestored) temples and large corpus of stone inscriptions were more than sufficient to win the designation of UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city was not so designated until 2019, allegedly mainly on account of the restorations.

On 24 August 2016, a major earthquake hit Bagan, and caused major damages in nearly 400 temples. The Sulamani and Myauk Guni temples were severely damaged. The Bagan Archaeological Department began a survey and reconstruction effort with the help of the UNESCO. Visitors were prohibited from entering 33 much-damaged temples.

On 6 July 2019, Bagan was officially inscribed as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO, 24 years after its first nomination, during the 43rd session of the World Heritage Committee. Bagan became the second World Heritage Site in Myanmar, after the Ancient Cities of Pyu. As part of the criteria for the inscription of Bagan, the government had pledged to relocate existing hotels in the archaeological zone to a dedicated hotel zone by 2020.

Bagan today is a main tourist destination in the country&#x27;s nascent tourism industry.

==Geography==
The Bagan Archaeological Zone, defined as the area centred around Old Bagan, consisting of Nyaung U in the north and New Bagan in the south, lies in the vast expanse of plains in Upper Burma on the bend of the Irrawaddy river. It is located south-west of Mandalay and north of Yangon.

===Climate===
Bagan lies in the middle of the Dry Zone, the region roughly between Shwebo in the north and Pyay in the south. Unlike the coastal regions of the country, which receive annual monsoon rainfalls exceeding , the dry zone gets little precipitation as it is sheltered from the rain by the Rakhine Yoma mountain range in the west.

Available online climate sources report Bagan climate quite differently.

==Cityscape==


===Architecture===
Bagan stands out for not only the sheer number of religious edifices of Myanmar but also the magnificent architecture of the buildings, and their contribution to Burmese temple design. The artistry of the architecture of pagodas in Bagan proves the achievement of Myanmar craftsmen in handicrafts. The Bagan temple falls into one of two broad categories: the &quot;stupa&quot;-style solid temple and the &quot;gu&quot;-style (ဂူ) hollow temple.

====Stupas====
A &quot;stupa&quot;, also called a pagoda or chedi, is a massive structure, typically with a relic chamber inside. The Bagan &quot;stupas&quot; or pagodas evolved from earlier Pyu designs, which in turn were based on the &quot;stupa&quot; designs of the Andhra region, particularly Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda in present-day south-eastern India, and to a smaller extent to Ceylon. The Bagan-era stupas in turn were the prototypes for later Burmese stupas in terms of symbolism, form and design, building techniques and even materials.

Originally, a Ceylonese &quot;stupa&quot; had a hemispheric body ( &quot;the egg&quot;), on which a rectangular box surrounded by a stone balustrade (&quot;harmika&quot;) was set. Extending up from the top of the &quot;stupa&quot; was a shaft supporting several ceremonial umbrellas. The &quot;stupa&quot; Buddhist cosmos: its shape symbolizes Mount Meru while the umbrella mounted on the brickwork represents the world&#x27;s axis. The brickwork pediment was often covered in stucco and decorated in relief. Pairs or series of ogres as guardian figures (&#x27;bilu&#x27;) were a favourite theme in the Bagan period.

The original Indic design was gradually modified first by the Pyu, and then by Burmans at Bagan where the &quot;stupa&quot; gradually developed a longer, cylindrical form. The earliest Bagan &quot;stupas&quot; such as the Bupaya (c. 9th century) were the direct descendants of the Pyu style at Sri Ksetra. By the 11th century, the &quot;stupa&quot; had developed into a more bell-shaped form in which the parasols morphed into a series of increasingly smaller rings placed on one top of the other, rising to a point. On top the rings, the new design replaced the &quot;harmika&quot; with a lotus bud. The lotus bud design then evolved into the &quot;banana bud&quot;, which forms the extended apex of most Burmese pagodas. Three or four rectangular terraces served as the base for a pagoda, often with a gallery of terra-cotta tiles depicting Buddhist &quot;jataka&quot; stories. The Shwezigon Pagoda and the Shwesandaw Pagoda are the earliest examples of this type. Examples of the trend toward a more bell-shaped design gradually gained primacy as seen in the Dhammayazika Pagoda (late 12th century) and the Mingalazedi Pagoda (late 13th century).

====Hollow temples====
In contrast to the &quot;stupas&quot;, the hollow &quot;gu&quot;-style temple is a structure used for meditation, devotional worship of the Buddha and other Buddhist rituals. The &quot;gu&quot; temples come in two basic styles: &quot;one-face&quot; design and &quot;four-face&quot; design—essentially one main entrance and four main entrances. Other styles such as five-face and hybrids also exist. The one-face style grew out of 2nd century Beikthano, and the four-face out of 7th century Sri Ksetra. The temples, whose main features were the pointed arches and the vaulted chamber, became larger and grander in the Bagan period.

====Innovations====
Although the Burmese temple designs evolved from Indic, Pyu (and possibly Mon) styles, the techniques of vaulting seem to have developed in Bagan itself. The earliest vaulted temples in Bagan date to the 11th century, while the vaulting did not become widespread in India until the late 12th century. The masonry of the buildings shows &quot;an astonishing degree of perfection&quot;, where many of the immense structures survived the 1975 earthquake more or less intact. (Unfortunately, the vaulting techniques of the Bagan era were lost in the later periods. Only much smaller &quot;gu&quot; style temples were built after Bagan. In the 18th century, for example, King Bodawpaya attempted to build the Mingun Pagoda, in the form of spacious vaulted chambered temple but failed as craftsmen and masons of the later era had lost the knowledge of vaulting and keystone arching to reproduce the spacious interior space of the Bagan hollow temples.)

Another architectural innovation originated in Bagan is the Buddhist temple with a pentagonal floor plan. This design grew out of hybrid (between one-face and four-face designs) designs. The idea was to include the veneration of the Maitreya Buddha, the future and fifth Buddha of this era, in addition to the four who had already appeared. The Dhammayazika and the Ngamyethna Pagoda are examples of the pentagonal design.

===Notable cultural sites===


== The walled core of &quot;Old Bagan&quot; ==
The 140-hectare core on the riverbank is surrounded by three walls. A fourth wall, on the western side, may have once existed before being washed away by the river at some point. The Irrawaddy has certainly eroded at least some parts of the city, since there are &quot;buildings collapsing into the river both upstream and downstream from the walled core&quot;.

The walled core called &quot;Old Bagan&quot; takes up only a tiny fraction of the 8,000-hectare area where monuments are found. It is also much smaller than the walled areas of major Pyu cities (the largest, Śrī Kṣetra or Thayekittaya, has a walled area of 1,400 hectares). Altogether, this suggests that &quot;&#x27;Old Bagan&#x27; represents an elite core, not an urban boundary&quot;.

== Outlying sites ==
=== Otein Taung ===
An important outlying site is at Otein Taung, 2 km south of the Ananda temple in the walled city of Old Bagan. The name &quot;Otein Taung&quot; is a descriptive name meaning &quot;pottery hill&quot;; there is another Otein Taung on the north side of Beikthano. The site of Otein Taung at Bagan actually consists of two different mounds separated by 500 meters. Both are &quot;covered with dense layers of fragmented pottery, and with scatters of potsherds visible around and between them&quot;. Local farm fields for crops like maize come right up to the edges of the mounds, and goats and cattle commonly graze on them.

Besides the mounds, there are also about 40 small monuments at Otein Taung, mostly dated to the 13th century. Several of these are clustered around a monastery on the south side of the western mound. There is also a group of monuments arranged in a straight line, which may represent a property boundary or road. Another cluster exists south of the eastern mound, and then there are also randomly scattered monuments in the area between the mounds. Finally, there is a large temple between the two mounds, which was probably built in the 12th century. This temple was restored in 1999.

Otein Taung was excavated by a team led by Bob Hudson and Nyein Lwin in 1999 and 2000. Excavation revealed layers of potash with a fine texture, suggesting that most of the fuel was provided by bamboo and other grasses. Also found were small charcoal fragments, preserved burnt bamboo filaments, and some animal bones and pigs&#x27; teeth. Based on radiocarbon dating, Otein Taung dates from at least the 9th century, which is well before recorded history at Bagan.

The sprinkler pot, or &quot;kendi&quot;, is a very characteristic type of pottery from medieval Myanmar, and over 50 spouts and necks belonging to them were found by archaeologists at Otein Taung. These were all straight, in contrast to the bent spouts found at Beikthano. Also found at Otein Taung are earthenware tubes, about 60 cm long and 40 cm in diameter. Similar pipes have been found at Old Bagan, and they are thought to have been part of toilets.

It is not clear whether Otein Taung represents a large-scale pottery production site or &quot;a huge, and for Bagan unique, residential midden&quot;. Archaeologists did not find any &quot;slumps characteristic of overfiring in a stoneware kiln, [or] any large brick or earth structures suggesting a pottery kiln&quot;, but several &quot;earthenware anvils&quot; were found at the site, as well as a 10-cm-long clay tube that may have been used as a stamp for decorating pots. The anvils are common potters&#x27; tools in South and Southeast Asia: they are held inside a pot while the outside is beaten with a paddle.

If Otein Taung was used as a pottery production site, then it would have had good access to natural clay resources: the Bagan area has clayey subsoil that is &quot;still mined today for brickmaking&quot;. There are four tanks within 500 m of Otein Taung that may have originated as clay pits.

===Museums===

*The Bagan Archaeological Museum: The only museum in the Bagan Archaeological Zone. The three-story museum houses a number of rare Bagan period objects including the original Myazedi inscriptions, the Rosetta stone of Burma.
*Anawrahta&#x27;s Palace: It was rebuilt in 2003 based on the extant foundations at the old palace site. But the palace above the foundation is completely conjectural.

== 3D Documentation with LiDAR ==
The Zamani Project from the University of Cape Town, South Africa, offered its services towards the spatial documentation of monuments in Bagan in response to the destruction of monuments by an earthquake in August 2016. After reconnaissance visit to Bagan and a subsequent meeting at the UNESCO offices in Bangkok in February 2017, the Zamani Project documented 12 monuments in Bagan using LiDAR, during three field campaigns between 2017 and 2018, including Kubyauk-gyi (Gubyaukgyi) (298); Kyauk-ku-umin (154); Tha-peik-hmauk-gu-hpaya (744); Sula-mani-gu-hpaya (Sulamani) (748) Monument 1053; Sein-nyet-ama (1085); Sein-nyet-nyima (1086); Naga-yon-hpaya (1192); Loka-ok-shaung (1467); Than-daw-kya (1592); Ananda Monastery; and the City Gate of old Bagan (Tharabha Gate).

==Transport==
Bagan is accessible by air, rail, bus, car and river boat.

===Air===
Most international tourists fly to the city. The Nyaung U Airport is the gateway to the Bagan region. Several domestic airlines have regular flights to Yangon, which take about 80 minutes to cover the 600 kilometres. Flights to Mandalay take approximately 30 minutes and to Heho about 40 minutes. The airport is located on the outskirts of Nyaung U and it takes about 20 minutes by taxi to reach Bagan.

===Rail===
The city is on a spur from the Yangon–Mandalay Railway. Myanmar Railways operates a daily overnight train service each way between Yangon and Bagan (Train Nos 61 &amp; 62), which takes at least 18 hours. The trains have a sleeper car and also 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.
Between Mandalay and Bagan there are two daily services each way (Train Nos 117,118,119 &amp; 120) that take at least 8 hours. The trains have 1st Class and Ordinary Class seating.

===Buses and cars===
Overnight buses and cars also operate to and from Yangon and Mandalay taking approximately 9 and 6 hours respectively.

===Boat===
An &#x27;express&#x27; ferry service runs between Bagan and Mandalay. Following the Irrawaddy river the fastest ferry takes around 9 hours to travel the 170 kilometres. The service runs daily during peak periods and slower sailings with overnight stops are also available.

==Economy==
Bagan&#x27;s economy is based mainly on tourism. Because of boycotts against the previous military government, the Bagan region&#x27;s tourism infrastructure is still quite modest by international standards. The city has a few international standard hotels and many family-run guesthouses. Bagan is also the center of Burmese lacquerware industry, which to a large degree depends on tourist demand. Much of the lacquerware is destined for souvenir shops in Yangon, and to the world markets. Moreover, the lacquerware-making process itself has become a tourist draw.

==Demographics==
The population of Bagan in its heyday is estimated to be anywhere between 50,000 and 200,000 people. Until the advent of tourism industry in the 1990s, only a few villagers lived in Old Bagan. The rise of tourism has attracted a sizable population to the area. Because Old Bagan is now off limits to permanent dwellings, much of the population reside in either New Bagan, south of Old Bagan, or Nyaung-U, north of Old Bagan. The majority of native residents are Bamar.

==Administration==
The Bagan archaeological zone is part of Nyaung-U District, Mandalay Region.

<text>Allah Rakha Rahman (; born A. S. Dileep Kumar; 6 January 1967) also known by the initialism ARR is an Indian music composer, record producer, singer, songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, and philanthropist known for his works in Indian cinema; predominantly in Tamil and Hindi films, with occasional forays in international cinema. He is a recipient of six National Film Awards, two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, fifteen Filmfare Awards, and eighteen Filmfare Awards South. In 2010, the Government of India conferred him with the Padma Bhushan, the nation&#x27;s third-highest civilian award.

With his in-house studio Panchathan Record Inn, Rahman&#x27;s film-scoring career began during the early 1990s with the Tamil film &quot;Roja&quot;. Following that, he went on to score several songs for Tamil language films, including Mani Ratnam&#x27;s politically charged &quot;Bombay&quot;, the urban &quot;Kadhalan&quot;, &quot;Thiruda Thiruda&quot;, and S. Shankar&#x27;s debut film &quot;Gentleman&quot;. Rahman&#x27;s score for his first Hollywood film, the comedy &quot;Couples Retreat&quot; (2009), won the BMI Award for Best Score. His music for &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008) earned him Best Original Score and Best Original Song (for Jai Ho) at the 81st Academy Awards. He was also awarded Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 2010 Grammy Awards. He is nicknamed &quot;Isai Puyal&quot; (musical storm) and &quot;Mozart of Madras&quot;.

Rahman has also become a humanitarian and philanthropist, donating and raising money for a number of causes and charities. In 2006, he was honoured by Stanford University for his contributions to global music. In 2008, he received Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rotary Club of Madras. In 2009, he was included on the &quot;Time&quot; list of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people. In 2014, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music. He has also received honorary doctorate from Aligarh Muslim University. In 2017, he made his debut as a director and writer for the film &quot;Le Musk&quot;.

==Early life==
Allah Rakha Rahman was born as Dileep Kumar Rajagopala in Madras, Tamil Nadu, on 6 January 1967. His father, R. K. Shekhar from a Vellalar family, was a film score composer and conductor for Tamil and Malayalam films. Rahman began studying piano at age four. He assisted his father in the studio, playing the keyboard.

After his father&#x27;s death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father&#x27;s musical equipment provided his family&#x27;s income. Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi), Rahman, who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family, which led to him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. In an interview in 2012, Rahman said that his mother was summoned and was told to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to the school any more.

Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year, and later joined the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, where he was admitted for his musical talent and formed a band with his high school classmates. However, after discussing it with his mother, he later dropped out of school to pursue a career as a full-time musician. 
Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and Raja) and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue. He mastered the keyboard, piano, synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because it was the &quot;ideal combination of music and technology&quot;.

Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj, and at age 11 began playing in the orchestra of a Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan. He soon began working with other composers, such as M. S. Viswanathan, Vijaya Bhaskar, Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu, Vijay Anand, Hamsalekha and Raj–Koti, accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar on world tours and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music. During his early career, Rahman had assisted many music directors to play keyboard and synthesizer. One of the notable works includes a Malayalam film, Ramji Rao Speaking released in 1989 where Rahman and Sivamani programmed a song called &quot;Kalikalam&quot; for the music director S. Balakrishnan.

=== Conversion to Islam ===
Studying in Madras, Rahman graduated with a diploma in Western classical music from the school. Rahman was introduced to Qadiri &quot;tariqa&quot; when his younger sister was seriously ill in 1984. His mother was a practising Hindu. At the age of 23, he converted to Islam with other members of his family in 1989, changing his name to Allah Rakha Rahman (A. R. Rahman).

==Career==

===Soundtracks===
Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn. He also arranged the jingles for some advertisements that went on to become very popular, including the popular jingle for Titan Watches, in which he used the theme from Mozart&#x27;s Symphony no.25. In 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film, &quot;Roja&quot;.

Rahman&#x27;s film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India, and arguably one of Asia&#x27;s most sophisticated and high-tech studios. Cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for his second film &quot;Yoddha&quot;, a Malayalam film starring Mohanlal and directed by Sivan&#x27;s brother Sangeeth Sivan that released in September 1992.

The following year, Rahman received the National Film Awards (Silver Lotus) award for Best Music Director at the 40th National Film Awards for &quot;Roja&quot;. The films&#x27; score was critically and commercially successful in its original and dubbed versions, led by the innovative theme &quot;Chinna Chinna Aasai&quot;. Rahman followed this with successful scores and songs for Tamil–language films for the Chennai film industry, including Ratnam&#x27;s politically charged &quot;Bombay&quot;, &quot;Thiruda Thiruda&quot; and S. Shankar&#x27;s debut film &quot;Gentleman&quot; (with its popular dance song, &quot;Chikku Bukku Rayile&quot;), the urban &quot;Kadhalan&quot;. Rahman collaborated with director Bharathiraaja on &quot;Kizhakku Cheemayile&quot; and &quot;Karuththamma&quot;, producing successful Tamil rural folk-inspired film songs; he also composed for K. Balachander&#x27;s &quot;Duet&quot;, which had some memorable Saxophone themes. The 1995 film &quot;Indira&quot; and romantic comedies &quot;Mr. Romeo&quot; and &quot;Love Birds&quot; also drew attention.

Rahman attracted a Japanese audience with &quot;Muthu&quot;″s success there. His soundtracks are known in the Tamil Nadu film industry and abroad for his versatility in combining Western classical music, Carnatic and Tamil traditional and folk-music traditions, jazz, reggae and rock music. The soundtrack for &quot;Bombay&quot; sold 15 million copies worldwide, and &quot;Bombay Theme&quot; would later reappear in his soundtrack for Deepa Mehta&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot; and a number of compilations and other media. It was featured in the 2002 Palestinian film &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; and the 2005 Nicolas Cage film, &quot;Lord of War&quot;. &quot;Rangeela&quot;, directed by Ram Gopal Varma, was Rahman&#x27;s Bollywood debut. Successful scores and songs for &quot;Dil Se..&quot; and the percussive &quot;Taal&quot; followed. Sufi mysticism inspired &quot;Chaiyya Chaiyya&quot; from the former film and &quot;Zikr&quot; from his soundtrack album for &quot;Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero&quot; (which featured elaborate orchestral and choral arrangements).

Rahman&#x27;s music for 2008&#x27;s &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; won a Golden Globe and two Academy Awards (a first for an Asian), and the songs &quot;Jai Ho&quot; and &quot;O... Saya&quot; from its soundtrack were internationally successful. His music on 2008&#x27;s Bollywood &quot;Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na&quot; was popular with Indian youth; that year, his score and songs for &quot;Jodhaa Akbar&quot; won critical acclaim, a Best Composer Asian Film Award nomination and IIFA awards for best music direction and score.

In 2010, Rahman composed the original score and songs for the romantic &quot;Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa&quot;, the sci-fi romance &quot;Enthiran&quot; and Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;127 Hours&quot;, composing for the Imtiaz Ali musical &quot;Rockstar&quot;; the latter&#x27;s soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In 2012 Rahman composed for &quot;Ekk Deewana Tha&quot; and the American drama &quot;People Like Us&quot;, and collaborated with director Yash Chopra on &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot;. all were positively received. By the end of the year his music for Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Kadal&quot; topped the iTunes India chart for December. In 2013, Rahman had two releases: &quot;Raanjhanaa&quot; and &quot;Maryan&quot;. Both were successful, with the former nominated for a number of awards and the latter the iTunes India Tamil Album of 2013.

The song was named for the Sanskrit word for non-violence, and lyrically was intended to celebrate the ethnical and spiritual diversity in India. Rahman stated that ahimsa requires courage and strength, and that the song is a celebration of non-violence and peace.

==Musical style and influence==
Skilled in Carnatic music, Western and Hindustani classical music and the Qawwali style of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Rahman is noted for film songs amalgamating elements of these and other genres, layering instruments from different musical idioms in an improvisational style. During the 1980s Rahman recorded monaural arrangements in common with his musical predecessors, K. V. Mahadevan and Vishwanathan–Ramamoorthy. He has also worked as a pianist in Ilaiyaraaja&#x27;s troupe for hundreds of movies. In later years his methodology changed, as he experimented with the fusion of traditional instruments with new electronic sounds and technology.

Rahman&#x27;s musical interests and outlook originate in his love of experimentation. His compositions have an auteuristic use of counterpoint, orchestration and the human voice, melding Indian pop music with a unique timbre, form and instrumentation. With this syncretic style and wide-ranging lyrics, the appeal of Rahman&#x27;s music crosses classes and cultures in Indian society.

His first soundtrack, for &quot;Roja&quot;, was listed on &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; all-time &quot;10 Best Soundtracks&quot; in 2005. Film critic Richard Corliss said that the composer&#x27;s &quot;astonishing debut work parades Rahman&#x27;s gift for alchemizing outside influences until they are totally Tamil, totally Rahman&quot;, and his initial global success is attributed to the South Asian diaspora. Music producer Ron Fair considers Rahman &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great living composers in any medium&quot;.

Director Baz Luhrmann said: 

Rahman introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films. Rahman is one of the best-selling music artists in India, with an estimated 150 million records sold worldwide. On 21 May 2014 Rahman announced that he has partnered with former Black Eyed Peas&#x27; Will.i.am to recreate an early popular track &#x27;Urvashi Urvashi&#x27;. Track is &#x27;Birthday&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Rahman was married to Saira Banu (not to be confused with Indian actress Saira Banu); they have three children: Khatija, Raheema and Ameen. Ameen has sung &quot;NaNa&quot; from &quot;Couples Retreat&quot;, and Khatija has sung &quot;Pudhiya Manidha&quot; from &quot;Enthiran&quot;. Composer G. V. Prakash Kumar is the son of Rahman&#x27;s elder sister, A. R. Reihana. Rahman&#x27;s younger sister, Fathima, heads his music conservatory in Chennai. The youngest, Ishrath, has a music studio. A.R. Rahman is to actor Rahman.

Born into a Hindu family, Rahman converted to Islam when he was in his 20s. After the early death of his father, his family experienced difficult times; Sufism influenced his mother, who was a practising Hindu and, eventually, his family. During the 81st Academy Awards ceremony Rahman paid tribute to his mother: &quot;There is a Hindi dialogue, &quot;mere pass ma hai&quot;, which means &#x27;even if I have got nothing I have my mother here&#x27;.&quot; He said, &quot;&quot; (&quot;All praise to God&quot; in Tamil, a translation from the Quran) before his speech. In February 2020, Rahman was critiqued for his liberal image after Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen raised a question about his daughter wearing a burka.

In November 2024, A.R. Rahman and Saira Banu announced their separation.

==Philanthropy==
Rahman is involved with a number of charitable causes. In 2004 he was appointed as the global ambassador of the Stop TB Partnership, a WHO project. Rahman has supported Save the Children India and worked with Yusuf Islam on &quot;Indian Ocean&quot;, a song featuring a-ha keyboard player Magne Furuholmen and Travis drummer Neil Primrose. Proceeds from the song went to help orphans in Banda Aceh who were affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. He produced the single &quot;We Can Make It Better&quot; by Don Asian with Mukhtar Sahota. In 2008 Rahman opened the KM Music Conservatory with an audio-media education facility to train aspiring musicians in vocals, instruments, music technology and sound design. The conservatory (with prominent musicians on staff and a symphony orchestra) is located near his studio in Kodambakkam, Chennai and offers courses at several levels. Violinist L. Subramaniam is on its advisory board. Several of Rahman&#x27;s proteges from the studio have scored feature films. In 2009, he founded Sunshine Orchestra with a vision to introduce India&#x27;s first symphony orchestra where economically and socially deprived children get free music education by the KM Music Conservatory. He composed the theme music for a 2006 short film for The Banyan to aid poor women in Chennai.

In 2008 Rahman and noted percussionist Sivamani created a song, &quot;Jiya Se Jiya&quot;, inspired by the Free Hugs Campaign and promoted it with a video filmed in a number of Indian cities for a cause. In 2017, he announced one heart foundation which would support people from music industry. Rahman announced &quot;Ta Futures&quot;, a collaborative culture project that would curate and celebrate the sounds of Tamil Nadu.
In 2019, Rahman performed a Sufi Benefit Concert at the annual New York gala of Pratham, one of the largest non-governmental organisations in India, which focuses on the provision of quality education to India&#x27;s underprivileged children. Rahman and his ensemble performed the full dinner concert on a pro-bono basis. Afterward, he wrote on Twitter that his &quot;long time dream of performing #Sufimusic for human causes came true&quot; and thanked attendees for their respect and generosity.

<text>Dasyuromorphia (, meaning &quot;hairy tail&quot; in Greek) is an order comprising most of the Australian carnivorous marsupials, including quolls, dunnarts, the numbat, the Tasmanian devil, and the extinct thylacine. In Australia, the exceptions include the omnivorous bandicoots (order Peramelemorphia) and the marsupial moles (which are insectivorous but are very different and are now accorded an order of their own, Notoryctemorphia). Numerous South American species of marsupials (orders Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata, and Microbiotheria) are also carnivorous, as were some extinct members of the order Diprotodontia, including extinct kangaroos (such as &quot;Ekaltadeta&quot; and &quot;Propleopus)&quot; and thylacoleonids, and some members of the partially extinct clade Metatheria and all members of the extinct superorder Sparassodonta.

The order contains four families: one, the Myrmecobiidae, with just a single living species (the numbat), two with only extinct species (including the thylacine and &quot;Malleodectes&quot;), and one, the Dasyuridae, with 73 extant species.

==Characteristics==
Unlike herbivores, which tend to become highly specialized for particular ecological niches and diversify greatly in form, carnivores tend to be broadly similar to one another, certainly on the level of gross external form. Just as Northern Hemisphere carnivores like cats, mongooses, foxes and weasels are much more alike in structure than, for example, camels, goats, pigs and giraffes, so too are the marsupial predators constrained to retain general-purpose, look-alike forms—forms which mirror those of placental carnivores. The names given to them by early European settlers reflect this: the thylacine was called the &quot;Tasmanian tiger&quot; or &quot;Tasmanian wolf&quot;, quolls were called &quot;native cats&quot; or &quot;native foxes&quot;, and so on.

The primary specialisation among marsupial predators is that of size: prior to the massive environmental changes that came about with the arrival of humans about 50,000 years ago, there were several very large carnivores, none of them members of the Dasyuromorphia and all of them now extinct. Those that survived into historical times ranged from the wolf-sized thylacine to the tiny long-tailed planigale which at 4 to 6 grams is less than half the size of a mouse. Most, however, tend towards the lower end of the size scale, typically between about 15 or 20 grams and about 2 kilograms, or from the size of a domestic mouse to that of a small domestic cat.

<text>The katar is a type of push dagger from the Indian subcontinent. The weapon is characterized by its H-shaped horizontal hand grip which results in the blade sitting above the user&#x27;s knuckles. Unique to the Indian subcontinent, it is the most famous and characteristic of Indian daggers. Ceremonial katars were also used in worship.

== Etymology ==
Having originated in South India, the weapon&#x27;s earliest name-form was likely the Tamil (). It is alternatively known in Tamil as () which means &quot;stabbing blade&quot;. This was adapted into Sanskrit as () or .

Other regional names for the weapon include () in Kannada, () in Telugu, () in Malayalam, () in Marathi, , () in Panjabi, and kirat Dewan language|(chhuiket) in Nepal () or in Hindi.

==History==
The katar was created in Southern India, its earliest forms being closely associated with the 14th-century Vijayanagara Empire. It may have originated with the &quot;mustika&quot;, a method of holding a dagger between the middle and index finger still used in kalaripayattu and gatka today. The real name of this is &quot;Kidaari&quot; is from the ancient Tamil warfare class of weapons. Kidaari derived from the term &quot;Kedayam Ari&quot; meaning the &quot;Shield Splitter&quot; in Tamil. The name indicates this weapon being used to break shields and armor. The weapon was used by many ethnic Tamil infantry units aka &quot;Kaalatpadai&quot;. This falls under the &quot;mushtikai&quot; class of Indian weapon system. &quot;Mushti&quot; means the fingers closed and &quot;kai&quot; means arm. 

A Tamil king would be gifted with a golden Kidari as a token of loyalty from the Kaalatpadai General. It was worn as a symbol of respect by the king to the soldiers who lay down their lives for him in war without any hesitation. Later Chhatrpati Shivaji Maharaj was gifted with a Kidaari during his conquest to Tamil Nadu. A specific type of dagger might have been designed for this, as &quot;maustika&quot; is described vaguely as a &quot;fist dagger&quot; in the arsenal list of Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak. One of the most famous groups of early katar come from the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom of the 17th century. Katar dating back to this period often had a leaf- or shell-like knucklebow curving up from the top of the blade to protect the back of the hand. This form is today sometimes called a &quot;hooded katara&quot; but the knuckleguard was discarded altogether by the later half of the 17th century. As the weapon spread throughout the region it became something of a status symbol, much like the Southeast Asian kris or the Japanese katana. Princes and nobles were often portrayed wearing a katar at their side. This was not only a precaution for self-defense, but also meant to show their wealth and position. Mughal nobility would even hunt tigers with a katar.

Some modern katar designs may include single-shot pistols built into either side of the weapon. In the 18th century, some traditional katar were refurbished with this innovation. The katar ceased to be in common use by the 19th century, though they were still forged for decorative purposes. During the 18th and 19th century, a distinctive group of katar were produced at Bundi in Rajasthan. They were ornately crafted and their hilts were covered in gold foil. These katar were shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Crystal Palace, London. Since then, the weapon has sometimes been mistakenly referred to in English as a &quot;Bundi dagger&quot;.

==Appearance==
The basic katar has a short, wide, triangular blade. Its peculiarity lies in the handle which is made up of two parallel bars connected by two or more cross-pieces, one of which is at the end of the side bars and is fastened to the blade. The remainder forms the handle which is at right angle to the blade. Some handles have long arms extending across the length of the user&#x27;s forearm. The handle is generally of all-steel construction and may be gilded or otherwise decorated. 

The blade, typically measuring in length, is usually cut with a number of fullers. Most katar have straight blades, but in south India they are commonly wavy. South Indian blades are often made broad at the hilt and taper in straight lines to the point, and elaborately ribbed by grooves parallel to the edges. Occasionally the blades are slightly curved. Some blades are forked into two points, and one decorative variation includes a hollow outer blade which hinges open to expose a smaller blade inside.
The Indian nobility often wore ornamental katar as a symbol of their social status. The hilts may be covered in enamel, gems, or gold foil. Similarly, figures and scenes were chiselled onto the blade. Sheaths, generally made from watered steel, were sometimes pierced with decorative designs. The heat and moisture of India&#x27;s climate made steel an unsuitable material for a dagger sheath, so they were covered in fabric such as velvet or silk. Some katar served as a sheath to fit one or two smaller ones inside.

==Techniques==
Because the katar&#x27;s blade is in line with the user&#x27;s arm, the basic attack is a direct thrust identical to a punch, although it could also be used for slashing. This design allows the fighter to put their whole weight into a thrust. The sides of the handle could be used for blocking but it otherwise has little defensive capability. As far back as the 16th century, there was at least one fighting style which focused on fighting with a pair of katar, one in each hand.

<text>William Charles Fitch (May 19, 1932 – February 2, 2022) was an American professional basketball coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He developed multiple teams into playoff contenders and won an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics in 1981. Before entering the professional ranks, he coached college basketball at the University of Minnesota, Bowling Green State University, the University of North Dakota, and his alma mater, Coe College. Fitch&#x27;s teams twice qualified for the NCAA tournament. He won the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013, and was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. Christopher Gerhman portrayed him in Winning Time.

==Early life==
William Charles Fitch was born on May 19, 1932, in Davenport, Iowa. He attended Wilson in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he excelled in basketball.

==College career==
Fitch attended Coe College from 1950 to 1954.

==Coaching career==
===Creighton (1956–1958)===
Fitch was an assistant coach at Creighton from 1956 to 1958.

===Coe (1958–1962)===
Fitch coached Coe from 1958 to 1962.

===North Dakota (1962–1967)===
Fitch led North Dakota to three NCAA Division II men&#x27;s basketball tournaments, including a Final Four appearance in 1966.

===Bowling Green (1967–1968)===
At Fitch&#x27;s only season with Bowling Green, the Falcons reached the 1968 NCAA University Division basketball tournament after winning the Mid-American Conference title with an 18–7 record and 10–2 in conference play.

===Minnesota (1968–1970)===
In Fitch&#x27;s two seasons at Minnesota, Fitch coached the Golden Gophers to 12–12 and 13–11.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1970–1979)===
Fitch was the first head coach hired by the expansion Cleveland Cavaliers on March 19, 1970, for their inaugural 1970–71 season. In that season, the Cavaliers went 15–67. The Cavaliers did not have a season as bad as that one until the 1981–82 season, which also garnered 15 wins. The team gradually rose in wins for the next two years, winning 32 in his third season, although they slipped slightly the following year. In his first four years, they finished last each time in the Central Division.

His fifth season (1974–75) resulted in marked improvement as the Cavs won 40 games while finishing third, their first season without a last-place finish. By this point, the team had a clear leader in its #1 draft pick from 1971, Austin Carr. He had become the leading scorer for the team, but a serious knee injury curtailed Cleveland&#x27;s hopes for a playoff berth.

The following season of 1975–76 was the pinnacle of his career with Cleveland. The team, now fabled as &quot;The Miracle of Richfield&quot;, was led by team captain Carr, scoring small forward Campy Russell, shooting guard Bobby &quot;Bingo&quot; Smith, and a supporting cast of largely unknown players such as starting center Jim Chones, and an aging Nate Thurmond. The team won 49 games (a team record for 13 seasons) and the Central Division title. They defeated the Washington Bullets in seven games to advance to the Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics, with Chones being sidelined by a broken foot in practice two days before the conference finals. The Cavaliers did not win another playoff series until 1992. Fitch was awarded the NBA Coach of the Year Award at the end of the season.

Fitch led the team to two more playoff berths, although they did not win either series. After a 30–52 record for the 1978–79 season, he resigned on May 21, 1979.

===Boston Celtics (1979–1983)===
On May 23, 1979, Fitch was hired by the Boston Celtics, taking over for Dave Cowens, who had coached them to a 29–53 record as a player-coach the previous season. His first season in 1979–80 was also the first for Larry Bird. A former drill instructor in the U. S. Marine Corps, the coach was lauded by Bird for his intense practices and discipline. Fitch helped lead the Celtics to 61 wins along with an Atlantic Division title. In the playoffs that year, the Celtics were defeated in the Conference Finals to the Philadelphia 76ers in five games. Fitch won his second Coach of the Year Award after the season.

In his second season, the Celtics drafted Kevin McHale and acquired Robert Parish, both through a trade with the Golden State Warriors. Fitch&#x27;s team won 62 games along with a second Atlantic title. They went on to beat the Houston Rockets in six games to win the 1981 NBA Finals, Boston&#x27;s first title since 1976.

Fitch led the Celtics to a third consecutive Atlantic Division title in 1981–82 while winning 63 games, although the team lost in the Conference Finals to the 76ers in seven games. The 1982–83 team dropped in wins (from 63 to 56) while finishing second in the Atlantic Division, and were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in four games. On May 27, 1983, he resigned from the Celtics. Fitch cited Harry T. Mangurian Jr.&#x27;s announcement that he was selling the team due to difficulties with Delaware North (the owners of the Boston Garden) as the last straw, despite Fitch having three years left on his contract.

===Houston Rockets (1983–1988)===
On June 1, 1983, Fitch was hired by the Houston Rockets, taking over for Del Harris, who had managed the team to 14 wins the previous season. The 1983–84 Houston Rockets season also happened to be the first season with Ralph Sampson on the team. The team won 29 games that season. The next season was the season in which the Rockets drafted Hakeem Olajuwon, and the team responded with 48 wins and a playoff berth, although they were beaten in five games by the Utah Jazz. His third season was his best season with the team as they won the Midwest Division title along with the Western Conference title after beating the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. They met Fitch&#x27;s old team, the Celtics. Boston beat the team in six games to win the Finals. Fitch&#x27;s following two seasons led to playoff berths, although they did not advance past the Conference Semi-finals. Fitch was fired on June 6, 1988.

===New Jersey Nets (1989–1992)===
On August 21, 1989, Fitch was hired by the New Jersey Nets, replacing Willis Reed, who had gone 26–56 the previous season. The team acquired Sam Bowie on draft day in order to try and start a rebuilding process, although the team went 17–65 for the season, the fewest wins for the Nets since joining the NBA. Fitch gradually raised the team up, acquiring Derrick Coleman, Dražen Petrović, and Terry Mills helping the team qualify for a playoff berth in the 1991–92 New Jersey Nets season. The team went to the playoffs with a losing record of 40–42, sixth-best in the 14 team Eastern Conference. They lost in the First Round to Fitch&#x27;s old team, the Cavaliers in four games. On May 12, 1992, he resigned as coach of the team.

===Los Angeles Clippers (1994–1998)===
On July 28, 1994, Fitch was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers, replacing Bob Weiss, who had gone 27–55 the previous year. In four seasons with the team, he could not reverse the tide of a franchise that had gone on a downward spiral since making the playoffs in consecutive seasons in 1992 and 1993. However, he led them to a playoff berth once, doing so in the 1996–97 season (the last playoff berth for the team until 2006), although they were swept in the First Round by the Jazz. They made the playoffs despite going 36–46, qualifying by just two games. The following season was a disaster, with the team finishing 17–65, the worst season since finishing with that same record in the 1994–95 season. Two days after the season ended, Fitch was fired on April 20, 1998. Fitch&#x27;s most losses record in NBA history with 1,106 losses a record stood for five years until Lenny Wilkens broke his mark during the 2002–03 season while coaching for the Toronto Raptors. Wilkens&#x27; NBA coaching career finished with 1,155 losses after he announced his retirement from coaching on January 22, 2005.

Fitch coached at four universities: the University of Minnesota, Bowling Green State University, the University of North Dakota, and his alma mater, Coe College.

During his 25-year pro coaching career, Fitch was often hired in an attempt to improve failing teams. Although Fitch currently ranks tenth among NBA coaches in all-time number of victories (with 944), he is also ranked second in all-time losses (with 1,106) behind Lenny Wilkens. In 1996, Fitch was named one of the Top 10 Coaches in NBA History. In 2016, Fitch was honored with an honorary bench by the Hall of Fame, which surrounds a statue of James Naismith along with other granite benches in honor of great coaches, all made possible through a $150,000 donation by Rick Carlisle.

==Personal life and death==
Fitch was born in Davenport, Iowa, on May 19, 1932. He attended Coe College, where he played basketball and baseball and graduated in 1954 with a degree in physical education.

Fitch died in Lake Conroe, Texas, on February 2, 2022, at the age of 89.

<text>Legislative assembly is the name given in some countries to either a legislature, or to one of its houses.

The name is used by a number of countries, including member-states of the Commonwealth of Nations and other countries. It is also used by their sub-national divisions, such as the Indian states and union territories, Australian states and Canadian provinces.

==Legislative assemblies in the Commonwealth==
Legislative assemblies in modern-day Commonwealth countries, either as national or sub-national parliaments, are in most cases an evolution of one of the legislative chambers of the previous colonial parliaments, whether the full legislature or a lower house. In a number of jurisdictions, the name House of Assembly is used instead. It is one of the main names used in everyday speech for parliament in many countries.

===Australia===
Three of the six Australian states style their lower houses as &quot;Legislative Assemblies&quot;; in South Australia and Tasmania, they are styled as &quot;Houses of Assembly&quot;. The unicameral parliaments of Queensland and the two self-governing territories also style their legislature as &quot;Legislative Assemblies&quot;. Queensland originally had a Legislative Council as its upper house, in line with the other states, until it was abolished leaving it the only state with a sole chamber of parliament.

The previously self-governing Norfolk Island had its own &quot;Legislative Assembly&quot; until it was abolished and replaced with a Regional Council in 2015.

Members of these assemblies are referred to as MLAs (WA, ACT, NT) and MPs (NSW, QLD, VIC, SA, TAS). Previously, MLA and MHA have been used in states that now use MP.

===Canada===
In Canada, seven of the ten provinces and all three of the territories style their legislatures as &quot;legislative assemblies&quot;. All are unicameral. Manitoba was the first to abolish its Legislative Council in 1876. British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador abolished their Councils before becoming provinces. There was no Council for Alberta when it was created in 1905.
The Legislative Assembly of Quebec was renamed the Quebec National Assembly as part of the abolition of the Legislative Council of Quebec on December 31, 1968.

===India===
In India, the lower house or the only house of the State Legislatures are called Legislative Assemblies. The same name is also used for the only house of the legislatures of three of the eight union territories, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry. The upper house in states with a bicameral legislature are called Legislative Councils. Members of the former are called MLAs, and those of the latter are called MLCs.

===Other Commonwealth countries and British Overseas Territories===
* State legislative assemblies of Malaysia 
* Legislative Assembly of Samoa
* Legislative Assembly of Tonga
* Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands

===Former legislative assemblies===
* In Mauritius, the unicameral parliament was known as the legislative assembly until 1992, when, following the establishment of a republic, it was renamed the National Assembly
* Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada (1791–1838)
* Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada (1791–1841)
* Legislative Assembly (British Guiana) (1961–1964)
* Central Legislative Assembly of British India–1947

==Legislative assemblies outside the Commonwealth==
Legislative Assembly is the name given to some national legislatures (or one of the houses of the national legislature) of the sovereign nations of:

* Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia
* Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica
* Legislative Assembly of El Salvador

Former assemblies include:

* National Legislative Assembly of Thailand (2014)
* National Legislative Assembly (South Sudan)
* Legislative Assembly of Kyrgyzstan
* Legislative Assembly of Revolutionary France

Legislative bodies of the United States include:
* North Dakota Legislative Assembly 
* Oregon Legislative Assembly
* Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico

The legislatures of the States of Brazil are called &quot;legislative assembly&quot;, as are the legislatures of the two insular autonomous regions of Portugal, Azores (the Legislative Assembly of the Azores) and Madeira (the Legislative Assembly of Madeira), and the regional councils of three Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Marche and Umbria). In Mexico, the legislative branch of government of Mexico City is the Legislative Assembly of Mexico City.

The Legislative Assembly of Macau is the organ of the legislative branch of the Macau Special Administrative Region.

<text>Crypto-anarchy, crypto-anarchism, cyberanarchy or cyberanarchism is a political ideology focusing on the protection of privacy, political freedom, and economic freedom, the adherents of which use cryptographic software for confidentiality and security while sending and receiving information over computer networks. In his 1988 &quot;Crypto Anarchist Manifesto&quot;, Timothy C. May introduced the basic principles of crypto-anarchism, encrypted exchanges ensuring total anonymity, total freedom of speech, and total freedom to trade. In 1992, he read the text at the founding meeting of the cypherpunk movement. Most Crypto-anarchists are anarcho-capitalists but some are anarcho-mutualists.

== Terminology ==

The prefix &quot;crypto-&quot; originates from the Ancient Greek word kruptós, meaning &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;secret&quot;. This differs from its use in terms like &#x27;crypto-fascist&#x27; or &#x27;crypto-Jew&#x27; where it signifies that an identity is concealed from the world; rather, many crypto-anarchists are open about their anarchism and promotion of tools based in cryptology.

==Motives==
One motive of crypto-anarchists is to defend against surveillance of computer networks communication. Crypto-anarchists try to protect against government mass surveillance, such as PRISM, ECHELON, Tempora, telecommunications data retention, the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, Room 641A, the FRA and so on. Crypto-anarchists consider the development and use of cryptography to be the main defense against such problems.

A 2022 study examined whether crypto-anarchism can be a useful tool in addressing socio-political issues. Their findings revealed that crypto-anarchism does not have a significant influence on actual politics, but studying it can be useful for creating political movements geared toward Internet users.

==Anonymous trading==
Bitcoin is a currency generated and secured by peer-to-peer networked devices that maintain a communal record of all transactions within the system that can be used in a crypto-anarchic context. Adrian Chen, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, says the idea behind Bitcoin can be traced to &quot;The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto&quot;. Silk Road was an example of an illegal drug market on which Bitcoin was the only accepted currency.

Assassination Market was a Tor-based darknet market operated by a self-described crypto-anarchist going by the pseudonym Kuwabatake Sanjuro.

In &quot;The Cyphernomicon&quot;, Timothy C. May suggests that crypto-anarchism qualifies as a form of anarcho-capitalism: 

Another quote in &quot;The Cyphernomicon&quot; defines crypto-anarchism. Under the title &quot;What is Crypto Anarchy?&quot;, May writes:

== Virtual and Network States ==
A network state is a theoretical community of users—called “subscriber citizens”—connected via the internet, who accumulate enough capital, territory, or political clout to achieve diplomatic recognition as a state.

For crypto-anarchists, creating such a virtual or network state to increase freedom and reduce physical coercion has been a consistent talking point since at least 1992, when Timothy May initially discussed a version of these ideas in his article, &quot;Libertaria in Cyberspace&quot;. May said:This is the most compelling advantage of &quot;Crypto Libertaria&quot;: an arbitrarily large number of separate &quot;nations&quot; can simultaneously exist. This allows for rapid experimentation, self-selection, and evolution. If folks get tired of some virtual community, they can leave. The cryptographic aspects mean their membership in some community is unknown to others (vis-a-vis the physical or outside world, i.e., their &quot;true names&quot;) and physical coercion is reduced.In his 1999 book, &quot;Virtual States&quot;, cypherpunk Jerry Everard explored these ideas through the lens of Foucauldian philosophy, especially in the context of discourse formation. His discourse analysis focused on the interrelationship between objects and statements describing the state. He acknowledged the state exists as a monopoly on violence in relation to its subjects. In other words, the state enjoys a power imbalance between itself and its citizenry.

Everard formulated the idea of disaggregating various elements of the nation state while considering what voluntarily procured &quot;virtual states&quot; in a market environment would look like. He suggests that virtual states based in cyberspace will take over the “goods and services economy” aspect of the state apparatus. In the final treatment, he did not believe the &quot;state&quot; would face an extinction-level event, only that its power may be diminished in some areas but strengthened in others.

Technologist, angel investor, and former Coinbase CTO, Balaji Srinivasan, has fully fleshed out the idea of network states. In his 2022 book, &quot;The Network State: How to Start Your Own Country&quot;, he details how a non-territorial affiliation of like-minded individuals could join to enact a covenant to share, build, and distribute power in the form of a network state. Srinivasan articulated the definition concisely:A network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states.He furnished a fuller, more complex articulation as well:A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.The &quot;moral innovation&quot; piece of Srinivasan&#x27;s crypto-anarchist articulation underlies the goal of a network state. His motivation is to align ideologies more cohesively, disrupt political infighting, and institute a freer human future. Throughout the book, he expresses the problems with traditional nation states and emphasizes their territorial, coercive nature. In the section on Nation States, he says, &quot;(&quot;State&quot;) refers to the entity that governs these people, that commands the police and the military, and that holds the monopoly of violence over the geographic area that the nation inhabits.&quot;

In one prominent section, Srinivasan argues for a modern variation of Frederick Jackson Turner&#x27;s Frontier Thesis. He makes the case that frontiers throughout history have been open, uncontested territories allowing exploration, experimentation, and settlement. In his modern take on the thesis, cyberspace represents the crypto-anarchist new frontier for social creativity and growth. It is only through these new frontiers, he claims, can people secure greater sovereignty and build saner, more voluntary governance mechanisms.

The Frontier Thesis is reminiscent of John Perry Barlow&#x27;s famous, &quot;A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace&quot;, where he eschews the domination of nation states by comparing cyberspace to a frontier inhabited by the &quot;virus&quot; of freedom.

== Criticism ==
Some scholars criticize that Crypto-anarchism is referencing the term &quot;Anarchism&quot; in its regards to freedom as a primary value in them, whereas the political thoughts of Crypto-anarchism are closer tied to Libertarianism as to Anarchism:However, it is different in the case of crypto-anarchism. It is a thought and activity not based on anarchism of the turn of the 20th century, in which the idea of freedom had a social dimension. Freedom in anarchism of that time was treated as a value manifested in and towards other people, rather than in competition between individuals. Crypto-anarchism therefore has a different – libertarian – genesis, and libertarianism is not treated by social anarchists as anarchism. Nevertheless, the idea of freedom can be treated as a primary value in crypto-anarchism, and although it would be realised in the virtual world, it could also be realised in the real world.

<doc id="222428" wikidata="Q507980" url="?curid=222428" title="Hōnen">
<text>, also known as Genkū, was the founding figure of the , the first independent branch of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism. 

Hōnen became a Tendai initiate at an early age, but grew disaffected and sought an approach to Buddhism that all people of all classes and genders could follow, even during the current Age of Dharma Decline. After reading Shandao&#x27;s Commentary on the &quot;Amitāyus Contemplation Sūtra&quot;, Hōnen devoted himself to attaining birth in the pure land of Amitābha Buddha (Amida) through the practice of &quot;recitation of the Buddha&#x27;s name&quot; (Jp: nembutsu) and to spreading this teaching among all people.

Hōnen gathered a wide array of followers and attracted numerous critics. He taught them all the simple practice of reciting &quot;Namo Amida Butsu&quot; while entrusting oneself to Amida&#x27;s universal vow power. Hōnen&#x27;s Pure Land teaching was very popular among laypersons, and was a major influence on the Buddhism of the Kamakura period. He was the first Japanese author to have his writings in Chinese and Japanese printed in the history of Japanese Buddhism.

After receiving many criticisms of Hōnen from various rival traditions and following an incident at court, Emperor Tsuchimikado exiled Hōnen and his followers in 1207. Hōnen was eventually pardoned and allowed to return to Kyoto, where he stayed for a short time before his death. Hōnen was a teacher to Shinran, the founder of Jōdo Shinshū, the other major Japanese Pure Land tradition. As such, he is also considered the Seventh Patriarch in the Shinshū tradition. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Hōnen was born to a prominent family in the city of Kume in Okayama, Mimasaka Province. His father was Uruma no Tokikuni, a province official who headed up policing in the area. According to legend, his mother is a descendant of the Hata clan. Hōnen was originally named Seishimaru after the bodhisattva Seishi (Sanskrit: Mahāsthāmaprāpta). In 1141 Hōnen&#x27;s father was assassinated by Sada-akira, an official sent by Emperor Horikawa to govern the province. It is believed that Tokikuni&#x27;s last words to his son were &quot;Don&#x27;t hate the enemy but become a monk and pray for me and for your deliverance.&quot;

Fulfilling his father&#x27;s wishes, Hōnen was initiated into his uncle&#x27;s monastery at the age of nine. From then on, Hōnen lived his life as a monk, and at thirteen, ordained to study at the primary Tendai temple in Mount Hiei near Kyoto. Clerics at Mt. Hiei took the bodhisattva vows and then undertook 12 years of training, a system developed by the Tendai founder, Saichō. While at Mt. Hiei, Hōnen studied under Genkō (源光), Kōen (皇円) and later, with Eikū (叡空). Under Kōen he was officially ordained as a Tendai priest, while under Eikū he received the name Hōnen-bō Genkū (法然房源空). In speaking of himself, Hōnen often referred to himself as Genkū, as did his close disciples. 

=== Departure from Mt. Hiei ===

In 1150, Hōnen left Mt. Hiei for the more peaceful temple of Kurodani, seeking to live in seclusion. Hōnen eventually grew dissatisfied with the teachings at Mt. Hiei. At the age of 24, Hōnen then went to study at the city of Saga, then Nara, and stayed at such temples at Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji. Still not satisfied, he returned to the libraries of Mt. Hiei and studied further. During this time, Hōnen was deeply affected by the contrast between the suffering of the common people and the lives of elite Buddhist monks and their ornate temples. He began to seek a path that would allow all people to liberation, not just the elites and the monks. 

During this period, Hōnen is said to have studied the Chinese Buddhist canon five times. He was deeply impressed when, at the age of forty three, he read the &quot;Commentary on the Meditation Sutra&quot; () by the Chinese Pure Land master Shandao (613-681). He was particularly struck by the following passage:To recite intently and single-mindedly the name of Buddha Amitabha while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, without regard for the length of time; to engage without cessation in the recitation of nembutsu for life: This is called the rightly established practice because it is in accordance with the essential vow of Buddha Amitabha. This commentary persuaded Hōnen to believe that the &quot;nembutsu&quot; (ch: nianfo, the faithful recitation of Amida Buddha&#x27;s name), was all one needed to enter Amitābha&#x27;s pure land and attain Buddhahood. Previously, nianfo was recited along with other practices, but Shandao was the first to propose that &quot;only&quot; nianfo was necessary. This new appreciation and understanding prompted Hōnen to leave Mt. Hiei in 1175 and to focus on the single-minded practice of nembutsu.

=== A rising figure in the capital ===
Hōnen relocated to the district of Ōtani in Kyoto (the capital of Japan at the time), where he began to teach the simple recitation of the nembutsu to crowds of laymen and women, establishing a considerable following. Hōnen taught that through this simple practice, all people could attain Buddhahood in the pure land. One did not need to become a monk or meditate intensively, just say the name of the Buddha with faith. 

During this time, the conflict between the Minamoto and the Taira clans (which would culminate in the Genpei war of 1180-1185) plunged the nation into chaos. Many people flocked to the capital seeking refuge and Hōnen&#x27;s teaching of universal salvation through the nembutsu became very appealing. During this time, he also traveled around the Kansai region, and he likely also encountered various nembutsu hijiri (nembutsu holy people) who may have influenced his thought. 

Hōnen&#x27;s teaching attracted all sorts of people, from samurai like Kumagai Naozane, to merchants, prostitutes, robbers, and other elements of society normally excluded from Buddhist practice. Hōnen was a man of recognition in Kyoto, and many priests and nobleman allied with him and visited him for spiritual advice. The increasing popularity of his teachings drew criticism from noted contemporaries as Chikai, Myōe and Jōkei among others, who argued against Hōnen&#x27;s sole reliance on nembutsu as a means of rebirth in a pure land. This led to a public debate (known as the Ohara Controversy) in 1186 between Hōnen and some monks representing other schools. Hōnen&#x27;s popularity rose after this debate and he gained more followers. 
In 1190, Hōnen was granted the great honor of being invited to give a series of lectures on the Pure Land sutras at the national temple of Tōdai-ji in Nara. After these lectures, he became even more popular, giving further lectures in Kyoto, including public talks which drew large crowds. He was also invited to give lectures at the court of the imperial regent (kampaku) Kujō Kanezane (1149–1207), who then became a follower of Hōnen. At the behest of Kanezane, Hōnen reworked his lectures into his magnum opus, the &quot;Senchakushū,&quot; which outlines his main teachings&quot;.&quot; 

As Hōnen&#x27;s teaching became popular and spread throughout the nation, some individuals began to interpret the teachings in more radical and unexpected ways, including forms of antinomianism and criticisms of other traditions. In 1204, the Tendai monks at Mt. Hiei implored the head priest of Tendai to ban the teachings of exclusive nembutsu and to banish any adherents from their principality.

In 1205 the temple of Kōfuku-ji, located in Nara, implored Emperor Toba II to sanction Hōnen and his followers. The temple provided the emperor with nine charges alleging unappeasable differences with the so-called eight schools. Hōnen&#x27;s detractors cited examples of his followers, such as Gyoku and Kōsai, who supposedly committed vandalism against Buddhist temples, intentionally broke the Buddhist precepts, or caused others to intentionally turn away from established Buddhist teachings.

Richard Bowring condenses these charges into two general forms. First is the nature of a single practice. Hōnen&#x27;s emphasis on the single practice of nembutsu denied the usefulness of all other Buddhist practices. The sole emphasis on Amitābha was also coupled with discouraging the traditional worship of the kami. The second charge was that Hōnen placed the most lowly layperson on equal footing with the wisest monk, rendering the entire monastic establishment as useless.

In response, Hōnen and his followers agreed to sign the , which called for restraint in moral conduct and in interactions with other Buddhist sects, promising not to criticize or insult the teachings of other sects.

=== Exile and the final years ===

The clamour surrounding Hōnen&#x27;s teachings dissipated for a time until 1207, though the monks of other sects continued to critique his teaching. In this year, regent Kanezane died, and then Emperor Gotoba implemented a ban against exclusive nembutsu. This ban was sparked by an incident where two of Hōnen&#x27;s most prominent followers held a nembutsu retreat which was attended by various figures, including two court ladies. Hōnen&#x27;s disciples were accused of using nembutsu practice as a coverup for sexual liaisons. As part of the ban, Hōnen (now eighty) and some of his disciples, including Bencho and Shinran, were exiled to Shikoku, while four disciples, were executed. This is known as the of 1207. Hōnen is said to have responded:
While Hōnen and some key disciples were exiled to Tosa province, his movement in Kyoto remained strong. While in exile, Hōnen spread the teachings to the people he met - fishermen, prostitutes, and the peasantry. The emperor soon rescinded the exile however, though Hōnen only returned to Kyoto in 1211. In 1212, the following year, Hōnen died in Kyoto, but was able to compose the a few days before he died.

=== Character ===
The Japanese Jodo Shu Research Institute describes Hōnen&#x27;s personality as a &quot;strict&quot; but &quot;bold innovator&quot; who was &quot;introspective and self-critical&quot; and &quot;concerned with solving the problems of daily life rather than worrying about doctrinal matters&quot;. On the latter point Hōnen expressed unusual concern over the spiritual welfare of women, regardless of social status. As a consequence the role of women in the Jōdo-shū sects has often been greater than in some other Japanese Buddhist traditions.

Hōnen is also known to have been skilled in attaining nembutsu samadhi and the visions that often comes with it. He is also said to have had various visions in dreams, including a well recorded vision of Shandao. His visions are recorded in a work called &quot;Sammai Hottoku Ki (A Record of Receiving Samadhic Revelation),&quot; recorded by Genchi. 

About himself Hōnen reportedly said:

== Works ==
=== &quot;Senchakushū&quot; ===
Hōnen&#x27;s main work expounding his Pure Land doctrine is the &quot;Senchaku Hongan Nenbutsushū&quot; (&quot;Collection of Selections on Nenbutsu and the Original Vow&quot;, 選択本願念仏集, &quot;Senchakushū&quot; for short), written in 1198 at the request of his patron Lord Kujō Kanezane (1148–1207). The document was not widely distributed by Hōnen&#x27;s request until after his death. However, it was copied and distributed among Hōnen&#x27;s close disciples, including by Shinran, who made his own copy. 

When Hōnen was exiled in 1207, his disciples in Kyoto worked to have the text printed (using traditional woodblock printing). The carving of the blocks was completed in 1211 and the first copied were then printed and distributed publicly. This was the first printing of the text of a Japanese Buddhist author and it caused another uproar among other Buddhist schools. In 1227, the monks of the Tendai school attacked the print shop, and destroy the printing blocks. In 1239, Hōnen&#x27;s followers then re-carved the blocks so they could reprint the text again.

=== Other ===
Another key document from Hōnen is his last testament, the &quot;Ichimai-kishōmon&quot; (一枚起請文) or &quot;One-Sheet Document&quot;, which is a short encapsulation of this basic teaching and is often recited in services today. 

Most of Hōnen&#x27;s teachings and writings (which were not published in his lifetime) were collected by his disciples after his death into four main collections. They include writings in classical Chinese and in Japanese. The collections are:

* The Collected Teachings of Kurodani-shōnin (&quot;Eminent monk of Kurodani&quot;): The Chinese Anthology (ten fascicles)
* The Collected Teachings of Kurodani-shōnin: The Japanese Anthology (five fascicles)
* The Supplement to the Collected Teachings of Kurodani-shōnin: The Chinese Anthology (one fascicle)
* The Supplement to the Collected Teachings of Kurodani-shōnin: The Japanese Anthology (two fascicles)
There are also other works attributed to Hōnen that as not part of these traditional collections. Scholars debate the authenticity of these secondary works. One example is the &quot;Biography of Honen Shonin (Honen Shonin denki,&quot; also called &quot;Daigo-bon&quot; for short) discovered at Daigo-ji temple in 1917. This work contains numerous texts attributed to Hōnen which were written or directly transcribed by Hōnen&#x27;s disciple Seikan-bo Genchi.

== Teaching ==
The teachings of Hōnen are informed primarily by the Chinese Pure Land tradition, especially the work of key Chinese Pure Land masters like Tanluan, Daochuo, Shandao and Huaigan. Hōnen himself lists these figures as Pure Land patriarchs in his &quot;Jōdo goso den.&quot; Hōnen was also influenced by the Tendai school background in which he trained as a monk. The work of Genshin was also important for Hōnen, as he was a Japanese Tendai monk who focused on Pure Land practice. 

Out of all of these, Shandao is clearly the central figure for Hōnen, who writes in his &quot;Senchakushū:&quot; &quot;Shandao&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Meditation Sutra&quot; is the guidebook to the Western Pure Land. It should be regarded as the eyes and feet of nembutsu devotees.&quot; Hōnen goes even further than this, writing once again in the &quot;Senchakushū&quot; that &quot;Shandao was a manifestation of Amida...his written works are Amida Buddha&#x27;s direct preaching. If one desires to copy his &quot;Commentary on the&quot; &quot;Meditation Sutra&quot;, it should be done according to the method prescribed for copying the Buddhist sutras.&quot;

=== Relying on the Buddha&#x27;s power ===
Hōnen’s teachings present a path designed not for religious elites but for ordinary individuals. His doctrine centers on attaining rebirth in the pure land through a personal connection with Amida Buddha and a reliance of his other power (Jp. &quot;tariki&quot;). In contrast to the traditional Buddhist emphasis on achieving nirvana through individual effort or &quot;self-power&quot; (&quot;jiriki&quot;), Hōnen focuses on reciting Amida’s name (nembutsu), a simple faith based practice that offers liberation to all types of people. 

The basic premise behind Hōnen&#x27;s teaching is an existential honesty and humility regarding our limitations to reach Buddhahood. For Hōnen, most, if not all people, cannot attain awakening through the Mahayana practices based on self-effort (the perfections, meditation, etc). This is because most people are deluded and fallible &quot;bombus&quot; (common foolish people filled with defilements). Hōnen certainly believed that about himself, even though he had spent years in monastic training. Since ordinary people lack the ability to liberate themselves, their only other option is to have faith in the salvific power of the Buddha Amitabha. Thus Hōnen argued that we should turn to the easy practice of nembutsu (the faithful recitation of the Buddha&#x27;s name in the phrase: &quot;Namo Amida Butsu,&quot; &quot;Homage to Amida Buddha&quot;) and completely rely on the power of the Buddha to liberate us from this world into the pure land after death. 

This attitude of reliance on other power also serves to dissolve our attachments to our sense of self and its capacities. This is something which Hōnen believed was found in all those who practice the paths which rely self-power and individual effort. Apart from this, Hōnen also believed that the practice which relies on nembutsu and the Buddha&#x27;s power was even more important in his current era. This is because he believed that the world had entered the age of Dharma decline (Jp: mappo) in which traditional self-power methods were no longer effective for most people. 

=== Nembutsu ===
Hōnen&#x27;s teachings on the nembutsu are briefly summarized in his final work, the One-Sheet Document, in which Hōnen also states that he has &quot;no other teaching than this&quot;. This short text containing the core of Hōnen&#x27;s teaching states that the nembutsu is not a kind of meditation, nor does it require studying or understanding. Instead:

For Hōnen, the nembutsu is a gift by Amida Buddha which has the power to establish a karmic relationship between the devotee and the Buddha and his pure land. Hōnen believed that the nembutsu was &quot;chosen&quot; or &quot;selected&quot; (jp. &quot;senchaku&quot;) by the Buddha himself as the primary practice, infusing it with all his power and merit. Furthermore, for Hōnen, the nembutsu is really the Buddha himself in sonic form, and thus to say the nembutsu and hear it is to manifest and experience a nirmāṇakāya of the Buddha Amida.

=== The &quot;selection&quot; of the nembutsu === 

Hōnen&#x27;s teaching focuses on the nembutsu as the practice chosen by Amida Buddha, the “selected nenbutsu of the original vow” (senchaku hongan nenbutsu), seeing it as the central and most important Buddhist practice. The reason that the Buddha chose this practice and infused it with his power is that the compassion of the Buddha is so great that he wishes all beings to succeed. Therefore, he will promote the practice that is easiest and most accessible for the greatest number of beings. 

Hōnen writes in the &quot;Senchakushū&quot; that since the nembutsu is easy to practice in comparison to other Buddhist practices, it is the most universal practice taught by the Buddha, whose compassion seeks the soteriological “equality” (byōdō) of birth in the pure land for all people. Furthermore, he writes:Because the nenbutsu is easy (to practice), it is open to all [people]. Because the manifold practices are difficult [to master], they are not open to the diverse [human] capacities. However, was it not [the aim of Amida&#x27;s] Fundamental Vow (hongan) to abandon the difficult and take up the easy [practices] in order to enable all sentient beings to attain birth in equality? If the Fundamental Vow required to make Buddha images or to build stupas, poor and destitute [people] certainly would have to give up hope for birth. However, the rich and noble people are few and the poor and low people are extremely numerous. If the Fundamental Vow required wisdom and high intelligence, the foolish and dull certainly would have to give up hope for birth...If the Fundamental Vow would have required the various practices [mentioned] above, the people being able to attain birth would be few and those not attaining birth would be numerous. However, Amida Nyorai, when long ago he was the monk Dharmākara, being moved by compassion of equality in order to grasp all [people] comprehensively, did not make the Fundamental Vow for birth by requiring the various practices such as making Buddha statues or building stupas. He made the Fundamental Vow requiring only the one practice of reciting the nenbutsu. Thus, the main reason that the Buddha chose the nembutsu as the supreme practice was that the vast majority of people are poor, uneducated, defiled, unwise and forced by circumstances to violate the precepts (for example, for fishermen and so on). If liberation depended solely on difficult and time consuming practices, most would not be liberated. Therefore, Amida Buddha compassionately chose to make birth in his pure land contingent on the most accessible practice, making liberation truly open for all beings. This revolutionary idea goes against the traditional assumption that the Buddha&#x27;s most important and effective practices were the most complex and difficult ones to put into practice (i.e. the most elite practices). 

While other schools of Buddhism organized their doctrinal classifications based on which sutra or teaching they believed was the most profound, Hōnen focused on the universal ease and accessibility of the nembutsu as the criterion for it being the highest practice. Since the nembutsu was effective for all kinds of people and in all ages (even in the current Age of Dharma decline), Hōnen argued that it was the supreme teaching of the Buddha. However, Hōnen still believed that the nembutsu was not only the most accessible practice, but that it was also the superior practice and the most effective. This is because, for Hōnen, the nembutsu contained within it Amitabha Buddha&#x27;s power, bodhicitta (mind of awakening), and all of his merits and enlightenment, as well as the entire Buddhist teaching (the three truths).

=== Equality ===
Hōnen taught that all people could attain birth in the pure land through nembutsu, where they could become Buddhas easily by learning directly from the Buddha Amitabha. This included all women, the uneducated lower classes and even the most evil people who had committed the worst deeds. This universality and inclusiveness made his teachings extremely popular among all classes of people. According to Hōnen, this was all possible through the Buddha&#x27;s power and “great compassion of equality” (byōdō no daihi) which embraces and accommodates all human capabilities and conditions. Hōnen partially derived his views on the equality of all people in the nembutsu from Shandao, who writes in his commentary that &quot;the essence of [Amida] Buddha’s mind is compassion, and with this great compassion of equality he grasps all [sentient beings] universally&quot;. 

Hōnen met all sorts of people in his life including fishermen, prostitutes and samurai, and he recommended nembutsu to all of them. He taught that even if they could not stop acting in immoral ways now, the nembutsu would ensure their birth in the pure land. For example, Hōnen replied to a prostitute that if she could not give up her current work, &quot;then keep reciting nembutsu just as you are...In fact, women like you are the most welcome guests of Amida’s Vow&quot;. Hōnen was also particularly concerned with religious discrimination against women, who were not allowed in numerous holy mountains or temples, and were limited by various taboos around childbirth and menstruation. For Hōnen, when it came to birth in the pure land, women were just as capable as men, and traditional taboos did not matter. 

According to Hōnen, what really mattered was saying nembutsu with faith. One&#x27;s status as a priest, monk, ascetic, or noble being did not matter much. When it came to practice, he emphasized simple and easy actions that all classes could perform, and de-emphasized expensive and lavish ceremonies and offerings. Regarding religious institutions, he also promoted the idea that laypeople and ordained monks were equal in the practice of nembutsu. Thus, he writes &quot;the merits of a holy man’s nenbutsu and the worldly person’s nenbutsu are the same; there is no difference whatsoever.&quot; This indicates the radically universal and democratic nature of Hōnen&#x27;s teaching, which threatened the influence and power of the other schools and the basic idea of the monastic and priestly hierarchy. 

Furthermore, if laypersons were said to have just as much potential to attain the pure land and thus Buddhahood, then the status and authority of monks as mediators of Buddhism for laypersons would become much less important. The empowerment of laypersons as agents of their own liberation can be seen in a letter of Hōnen which recommends that the recipient (who asked about the importance of a spiritual advisor) should: “abandon the thought [wish] for an ordinary person as spiritual advisor and rely on Buddha as spiritual guide.&quot; For Hōnen, the power of the nembutsu also extended to supernatural protection from spirits (yōkai), kami and demons. This apotropaic power had previously been granted only to religious specialists like Shinto priests, Onmyōdō specialists and Buddhist monks, but now, Hōnen had given it to all people who would recite the nembutsu. According to Martin Repp, all of this entailed a clear &quot;decisive shift&quot; from the traditional view that laypersons require the guidance and mediation of a religious professional to the &quot;new approach of direct agency by an ordinary religious individual.&quot; This threat to their power is part of the reason that many monastic elites, who relied on the support of the populace to maintain their powerful monastic complexes and land holdings, opposed Hōnen&#x27;s teaching to fiercely. 

Hōnen&#x27;s soteriological egalitarianism even extended to the pure land itself. He de-emphasized the doctrine of the nine classes of birth, which held that more virtuous people would be born in higher levels of the pure land and evil people in the lowest ones. Hōnen saw this teaching as a skillful means which helped prevent laziness and immorality among people, but was not ultimately true. He argued that once birth in the pure land was attained, beings would experience “birth in equality” (byōdō ni ōjō) into a land which had no hierarchy at all. 

=== Sincere faith ===
A key element of Hōnen&#x27;s teaching is that one needed to approach the practice of nembutsu with the right attitude. Hōnen cautioned against the mistaken belief that birth in the pure land depends on the sheer number of times one recites the nembutsu or other self efforts. Such a view reflects a reliance on self-power (jiriki), which is unsuitable for ordinary beings (bonpu) living in this degenerate age. Instead, Hōnen emphasized that what truly matters is the depth of faith and sincerity in reciting the nembutsu, rather than any other effort on our part. Whether one chants it a hundred, a thousand, or even a million times, the crucial element is the earnestness with which one entrusts oneself to Amida’s compassion. This genuine reliance on Amida’s power leads to the establishment of unwavering faith, ensuring rebirth in the Pure Land. 

Hōnen described this essential faith using Shandao&#x27;s concept of the triple mind (sanjin), which are necessary for attaining birth in the pure land. These qualities, also called the mind at peace (anjin) by Hōnen, are: 

# The Utterly Sincere Mind (shijōshin) – The wholehearted belief that one will be born in the pure land through nembutsu practice, trusting in Amida Buddha’s vow and promise.
# The Profound Mind (jinshin) – A deep and reflective faith that includes both an understanding of ourselves as bombu (a defiled commoner) and an unshakable trust in Amida&#x27;s saving power.
# The Mind That Dedicates Merit and Resolves to Be Born in the Pure Land (ekō hotsuganshin) – The firm resolve to dedicate the accumulated merit of nembutsu recitation toward birth in the pure land, with the unwavering conviction that Amida’s vow will ensure this outcome.

=== Constant repetition of nembutsu ===
Regarding the practice of nembutsu, Hōnen recommended extensive and continuous recitation of the nembutsu. He recommended that one may begin with attempting to accumulate ten thousand repetitions per day (&quot;and then go on to twenty, thirty, fifty, sixty or even a hundred thousand&quot;), in order to avoid laziness. Hōnen also wrote that a helpful practice was to perform nembutsu retreats (&quot;betsuji nembutsu&quot;) once in a while to help us maintain focus and enthusiasm in the nembutsu, a practice recommended by Shandao and Genshin. During these retreats (which traditionally last for seven days), the recitation itself can be undertaken for six or twelve hours at a time. When practicing in a group, participants should take turns to ensure continuous recitation.

Part of the reason that Hōnen recommended constant repetition of the nembutsu seems to be that he believed the nembutsu could eradicate all one&#x27;s bad karma as well as having the power of making pure karma for one&#x27;s future birth in the pure land and one&#x27;s future enlightenment. Thus he writes: lifelong practice [of nenbutsu] means constantly generating pure causation (jōin o nasu) from first arousing the aspiration for enlightenment to [the realization of] enlightenment without ever backsliding. Of course, this generation of merit was not based on one&#x27;s self-power, but one the power that Amida Buddha had himself imbued into the nembutsu. 

Another important reason for Hōnen&#x27;s promotion of extensive repetition of nembutsu was his belief that this practice established a strong devotional bond between the practitioner and Amida Buddha. Thus, chapter 2 of the &quot;Senchakushū&quot; states: &quot;those who cultivate the right and assisting practices become extremely intimate and familiar with Amida Buddha.&quot;

Furthermore, Hōnen also held that the recitation of the nembutsu could lead to a state of samadhi (meditative absorption), just like other forms of Buddhist meditation. This &quot;nembutsu samadhi&quot; was a heightened religious experience in which one may even have a vision of the Buddha and the pure land. Hōnen considered this samadhi experience as important for legitimating the authority of a Buddhist teacher. 

A major dispute arose among Hōnen&#x27;s followers over two positions: once-calling (Jp: &quot;ichinengi&quot;) and many-calling (&quot;tanengi&quot;). Once calling held that since you only needed to recite nenbutsu once to be liberated there was no need to accumulate many recitations, while many-calling held that you needed to recite nenbutsu as much as possible (tens of thousands of times a day even). Hōnen promoted sustained practice as taught by many-calling, though he also said that one could be saved by even a few recitations (but this was not an excuse to abandon practice). Thus, Hōnen gave the following advice on the nembutsu regarding this issue:

=== Other practices ===
Since the nembutsu is the chosen practice, the &quot;Rightly Established Practice&quot; (&quot;shojo no go&quot;), all other practices were seen by Hōnen as merely supportive or secondary. For Hōnen if one wanted to attain birth in the pure land, one only needed to recite the name of Amitabha with faith. Hōnen taught that meditation, study, keeping precepts, or other practices were not necessary and thaat nembutsu should be one&#x27;s priority. Through nembutsu (even just a few recitations), Hōnen believed that even the most unethical people would be born in the pure land. Thus, Hōnen writes:When I consider these matters carefully, I wish to urge that anyone who desires to quickly escape from the cycle of birth-and-death should, of the two types of the excellent teaching, temporarily cease the practices of the Holy Path and select the practices of the Pure Land. (T. 2608, 83:18c-19a) Because of his reliance on a single simple practice, Hōnen&#x27;s teaching was widely criticized as &quot;exclusive&quot; and as neglecting basic Buddhist ethics and bodhicitta. 

However, Hōnen still practiced meditative nembutsu, kept the bodhisattva precepts, shunned meat and alcohol, and continued to perform rituals, monastic ordinations and study texts. Thus, even if Hōnen saw other practices as unnecessary, he did not teach that one should completely abandon them, since they could still support one&#x27;s nenbutsu practice. For example, keeping the precepts was important since it was a way to prevent the accumulation of bad karma, which could become a hindrance to one&#x27;s practice. 

The &quot;Senchakushū&quot; gives three main reasons for why the Buddha taught numerous other practices in the sutras aside from the nembutsu: (1) the myriad practices were taught so beings would set them aside and take refuge in the nembutsu; (2) they were taught to guide beings to the nembutsu; (3) they were taught to explain the two paths fully (path sages and easy path). 

For Hōnen, one&#x27;s relationship with other practices was defined by one&#x27;s relationship with the nembutsu and one&#x27;s faith. He held that at first, one needed to make a choice to focus exclusively on the nembutsu (Amida&#x27;s chosen practice) and set aside all other practices. Once one had become firmly and faithfully established in this practice however, one could reintroduce other auxiliary (&quot;jogo&quot;) Pure Land practices (such as bodhicitta, and the other five main practices as defined by Shandao) to support one&#x27;s nembutsu practice. Hōnen clearly states this in Chapter 12 of the &quot;Senchakushū,&quot; where he accepts that any of the thirteen contemplations taught in the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot; and all of the elements of the three pure acts (including the precepts), can contribute to birth in the pure land. 

Furthermore, once one had attained firm faith, other &quot;different good practices helpful to the nembutsu&quot; (&quot;irui no&quot; &quot;jogo&quot;) may also be resumed as well. What distinguished these secondary practices at this stage was not their content (they remain the same practices), but whether one had attained the Firm Establishment of Faith (&quot;ketsujo ojoshin&quot;), i.e. the triple mind or the peaceful mind (anjin). This is because, once one has firm faith in the Buddha&#x27;s power and the nembutsu, one&#x27;s attitude towards the secondary practices changes. That is to say, one stops viewing them through the lens of self-power and so one can resume them as aids to the nembutsu. 

This relationship between the nembutsu and the secondary practices is described by Hōnen as follows: If one has the heart of the nembutsu then going about daily activities, engaging in various other practices like making offerings or meditating, and getting involved in social welfare activities is something one should do. However, if these activities become the center of one&#x27;s life and the nembutsu auxiliary, then one should re-prioritize one&#x27;s life. (&quot;Tsuneni osei rarekeru okotoba&quot;, SHZ., 493)Thus, the process of &quot;selecting&quot; (senchaku) the nembutsu and setting aside other practices is not one of total and permanent exclusivity, but instead includes the later re-appropriation of the secondary practices once one has attained true faith. At this stage of re-appropriation, the auxiliary and miscellaneous practices are seen not just as mere aids, but as expressions of the nembutsu (which contains all practices). This helps explain why Hōnen continued to perform many other practices alongside the nembutsu throughout his life. 

=== Amida and the pure land ===
Hōnen also taught that there were kinds of relationship between Amida and sentient beings: 

* intimate karmic relations (shin-en): This refers to how Amida calls out to all sentient beings and how Amida listens and perceives to those who say the nembutsu. 
* close karmic relations (gen-in): This refers to how, when sentient beings desire to see the Buddha, Amida will respond to this desire and appear to them 
* superior karmic relations (zojo-en): This refers to how those who recite the nembutsu are purified of all their bad karma. Then, at their death, Amida and his assembly of bodhisattvas will arrive to welcome them to the pure land.
Hōnen’s conception of the pure land closely aligns with that of Shandao and is characterized by three key aspects. First, he believed that the pure land was established through the power of Amida, with the fundamental purpose of saving &quot;all&quot; deluded beings. Second, Hōnen emphasized how, even if individuals enter the pure land while still filled with defilements, these will be eliminated upon arrival through Amida&#x27;s grace. Third, Hōnen maintained that the pure land was a real realm with divine forms and characteristics. Recognizing that ordinary beings tend to perceive reality in concrete terms and cling to form, Amida Buddha meets them where they are, and leads them to a pure land filled with beautiful forms. In this way, Hōnen rejected the notions of a purely symbolic or psychological view of the pure land.

== Influence ==
Hōnen had a profound influence on later Buddhist figures both within Pure Land traditions and beyond. His advocacy of a single chosen practice based on Shandao&#x27;s Pure Land Buddhism marked a significant departure from the more complex practices of the Tendai and Shingon schools toward a more devotional and accessible practice. As noted by scholars like James Foard, Hōnen’s devotional movement eliminated the need for the mediation of a priestly class and made complete Buddhahood easily available to all laypersons. This emphasis on a single accessible practice would become the hallmark of other popular &quot;New Kamakura schools&quot; of Japanese Buddhism, including Dōgen&#x27;s Sōtō school and Nichiren&#x27;s Lotus sutra tradition. 

Hōnen&#x27;s emphasis on faith and practice over scholasticism laid the foundation for later developments in Japanese Pure Land thought and made Pure Land a very appealing form of Buddhism among the masses, one which would eventually overtake the other schools of Japanese Buddhism in popularity in later periods. Hōnen is considered the founder of the Jōdo-shū school. However, during Hōnen&#x27;s life, Jōdo-shū was never separated from the Tendai establishment, and was really only a faction (&quot;ha&quot;) or sub-sect of the Tendai school. After the 14th century however, this faction became a truly independent tradition. 

Among his most direct successors was Shinran (1173–1263), the founder of Jōdo Shinshū (True Pure Land School), who emphasized absolute reliance on Amida’s grace, rejecting the necessity of repeated nembutsu recitation as a self-powered practice. Ippen (1239–1289), another Pure Land reformer, took Hōnen’s teachings in a different direction, promoting ecstatic recitation and proselytizing through the Ji-shū movement. Even within other schools like Shingon, Kegon, Hosso and Tendai, Hōnen’s legacy and the popularity of the nembutsu contributed to ongoing debates about practice, faith, nembutsu and the pure land (often serving as a key opponent to define their orthodoxy). This reflects his enduring impact on Japanese Buddhism as a whole. 

Hōnen’s influence can be seen in the ideas of numerous later figures of these traditions, including: 

* numerous monks of the Shinsei branch of Tendai, including Hōdō (who promoted recitative nembutsu), 
* the Kegon monk Gyōnen who wrote a history of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan focusing on Hōnen&#x27;s lineage, the &quot;Jōdo Hōmon Genrushō&quot;. 
* The Shingon monks Jōhen and Dōhan who taught an esoteric form of nembutsu.

Hōnen&#x27;s influence extended into secular culture as well, as can be seen from his appearance in numerous works of Japanese literature such as &quot;Tale of the Heike, Mirror of the East (Azuma kagami),&quot; and &quot;Essays in Idleness&quot; (&quot;Tsurezuregusa&quot;). 

=== Disciples ===
By 1204 Hōnen had a group of disciples numbering around 190. This number is derived from the number of signatures found on , a guideline for rules of conduct in the Jōdo Shū community to assuage concerns by other groups. Some of his most important disciples include:

* Benchō (1162–1238), founder of the Chinzei branch of Jōdo-shū, one of the largest and most influential branches of the school. Often called Shōkō, he was one of the monks exiled in 1207 (to Chinzei, Kyushu.) and was a supporter of the &quot;tanengi&quot; (many calling) position. 
* Genchi (1183–1238), Hōnen&#x27;s personal attendant, and close friend of Benchō.
* Shōkū (1147–1247), founder of the Seizan (West Mountain) branch of Jōdo-shū, another one of the larger and most influential branches. He was not exiled like other disciples and was able to continue to establish the Pure Land school in the Kyoto area.
* Kōsai (1163–1247), promoted a version of the controversial &quot;single-recitation&quot; (&quot;ichinengi&quot;) teaching of Jōdo-shū. Chinzei-ha sources claim that he was expelled from Hōnen&#x27;s community by Hōnen. But it&#x27;s likely these claims are later sectarian fabrications of the Chinzei sect, since earlier sources from other traditions do not mention this. 
* Hōhombō Gyōkū, another proponent of &quot;ichinengi&quot; doctrine. Exiled to Sado in 1207. 
* Shinran (1173–1263), founder of the Jōdo Shinshū branch of Pure Land Buddhism. He also supported the idea that one single recitation could lead to birth in the pure land as long as one had shinjin (true faith). He was exiled to Echigo Province in 1207.
* Ryūkan (1148–1227), who taught that many-calling and once-calling were both true.
*Chōsai (1184–1266), founder of the &quot;Shōgyōhongangi&quot; branch of Jōdo-shū which believed that all Buddhist practices can lead to rebirth in the Pureland.
* Rensei (1141–1208), formerly a notable samurai named Kumagai no Jirō Naozane who had fought at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani and killed the Heike leader Taira no Atsumori. 

A number of disciples went on to establish branches of Pure Land Buddhism, based on their interpretations of Hōnen&#x27;s teachings.

=== Criticisms ===
Hōnen faced many fierce criticisms from various quarters. Tendai and Shingon monks accused Hōnen of dismissing traditional Buddhist practices such as the precepts, esoteric rituals, and scholarly study. His emphasis on &quot;nembutsu&quot; was seen as overly simplistic and as a rejection of the broader Buddhist path, including a rejection of bodhicitta, the foundation of Mahayana Buddhism. Critics also argued that Hōnen’s teaching of salvation through &quot;nembutsu&quot; alone might lead to moral laxity and some feared that laypeople and monks alike would neglect proper conduct. 

In response these concerns, Hōnen clarified in various writings, including the &quot;Seven Point Pledge&quot; (&quot;Shichikajō seikai&quot;) he and his students signed together, that he did not reject morality and other Buddhist practices, even if his teaching entailed a focus on the nembutsu. Hōnen also explicitly rejected a misinterpretation of his teaching called “encouragement of evil conduct” (zōaku muge), which was the idea that one can abandon and violate the Buddhist precepts without concern, since Amida will save us anyways. He also told all his followers not to criticize the practices of other schools. Indeed, even though Hōnen believed that the nembutsu was the most effective way to attain Buddhahood, he did not believe that other practices were useless. He held that they could possibly also lead to liberation for some, but that this was not certain, unlike the nembutsu. 

In spite of all this, numerous figures wrote texts critiquing Hōnen&#x27;s teaching, including Myōe who wrote &quot;Zaijarin&quot; (&quot;Breaking the Circle of Heresy&quot;), and Jōkei, the monk who also authored the Kofukuji Petition to ban Hōnen&#x27;s teaching. Dōgen, the founder of Sōtō Zen, likewise criticized Hōnen&#x27;s teaching as &quot;completely wrong&quot;, claiming that repetition of the nembutsu was &quot;worthless-like a frog in a spring field croaking night and day.&quot; Myōe&#x27;s most forceful criticism was that Hōnen’s teaching abandoned the generation of bodhicitta (the mind aimed at awakening for the sake of all beings), which is the foundation of all Mahayana Buddhism. While Hōnen did not ignore bodhicitta in his works, he seems to have held that it was not possible to generate it through self-power, and so one should focus on nembutsu first. In response to these critiques, Hōnen’s students also offered their rebuttals and wrote various responses. Perhaps the most famous of these is Shinran&#x27;s &quot;Kyōgyōshinshō&quot;, which has been considered a kind of rebuttal to Myōe&#x27;s critiques and affirmed that the true faith (shinjin) in Amida was none other than bodhicitta. 

Some figures even slandered Hōnen. For example, Jien, the Tendai Abbot of Mount Hiei, claimed that Hōnen suffered from demonic possession. Likewise, Nichiren claimed that Hōnen&#x27;s nembutsu teaching would lead people to hell in his &quot;Treatise on Nembutsu and Eternal Hell&quot; (&quot;Nembutsu muken jigoku sho&quot;). Myōe wrote that since Hōnen abandoned bodhicitta, he &quot;was despicable, no better than a sentient rock, a priest who is no longer Buddhist, the devil’s messenger&quot;.

Hōnen’s doctrine also led to social and political concerns among rival schools. By asserting that all people, regardless of social status or religious training, could attain salvation simply through &quot;nembutsu&quot;, his teachings undermined the social support and authority of both the Buddhist monastic establishment and the ruling elites who patronized traditional schools. This, as well as a groundswell of conversions from older schools to the nembutsu school, is why there was such a strong political opposition to Hōnen’s pure land movement.

<text>The Algarve (, ; ) is the southernmost NUTS II region of continental Portugal. It has an area of with 467,495 permanent inhabitants and incorporates 16 municipalities (&quot;concelhos&quot; or &quot;municípios&quot; in Portuguese).

The region has its administrative centre in the city of Faro, where both the region&#x27;s international airport and public university, the University of Algarve, are located. The region is the same as the area included in the Faro District and is subdivided into two zones, one to the West (Barlavento) and another to the East (Sotavento). Tourism and related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve&#x27;s summer economy. Production of food which includes fish and other seafood, as well as different types of fruit and vegetables such as oranges, figs, plums, carob pods, almonds, avocados, tomatoes, cauliflowers, strawberries, and raspberries, are also economically important in the region.

Although Lisbon surpasses the Algarve in terms of tourism revenue, the Algarve is still, overall, considered to be the biggest and most important Portuguese tourist region, having received an estimated total of 4.2 million tourists in 2017. Its population triples in the peak holiday season due to seasonal residents. Due to the high standards of quality of life, mainly regarding safety and access to public health services, as well as due to cultural factors and considerably good weather conditions, the Algarve is becoming increasingly sought after, mostly by central and northern Europeans, as a permanent place to settle. Several studies and reports have concluded that the Algarve is among the world&#x27;s best places to retire. 

The Algarve is the fourth most developed Portuguese region–in 2019, it was placed fourth out of seven regions with a human development index (HDI) of 0.847 (Portugal&#x27;s HDI average was 0.864 in 2019). With a GDP per capita at 85.2% of the European Union average, it has the second highest purchasing power in the country only behind the Lisbon Metropolitan Area.

==History==

===Pre-Roman times===
Human presence in southern Portugal dates back to the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. The presence of megalithic stones in the area of Vila do Bispo, Lagos, Alcoutim and elsewhere in the region attests to this presence.

At around the year 1000 BC, the Phoenicians founded the city of Cádiz, and, subsequently, coastal ports along the Algarve coast. Olissipo (Lisbon) is believed to be of Phoenician origin. By the time of the Carthaginians, Portus Hannibalis – located in what is today either the city of Portimão or the town of Alvor in the Algarve – is named after Hannibal Barca.
The Cynetes, as they were known in Greek, Conii, in Latin, were established by the sixth century BC in the region of the Algarve (called Cyneticum). Their ethnic and linguistic origins remain widely disputed, although, due to geographical proximity, it is possible that they were related both to Tartessos and the Celtici, seeing that Conii, the likely designation they used to describe themselves, is derived of the Proto-Celtic kwon (&#x27;dog&#x27;). These Indo-European tribes, Celtic or pre-Celtic, created a settlement in Lacóbriga (today&#x27;s Lagos) in the year 1899 BC.

===Roman period===

The Algarve region came under Roman control after Fabius Maximus Servilianus defeated the Lusitanians and the Turduli in the context of the Lusitanian War, as was the case of much of the Iberian Peninsula, which was absorbed into the Roman Republic in the second century BC. Cyneticum (in reference to the Cynetes who inhabited the region), as it was then called, became integrated into Hispania Ulterior and into Lusitania afterwards, being under Roman influence for around 600 years (from 200 BC till 410 AD), having thus adopted Latin as the official language, as well as Roman cultural, political, architectonic, religious, and economic tenets.

Seeing that during this time traveling through the land was dangerous, its geography meant that Cyneticum was of crucial importance as a passageway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, connecting countless Roman ports to several provinces, mainly in other parts of Hispania, Gaul and Britannia. This meant that the region experienced a great level of prosperity accrued through an expansion of its trading and commercial capabilities, mainly from the production and commercialization of olive oil and garum, products very much sought after throughout the Roman Empire.
As Christianity rose in popularity, becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire under Constantine the Great, Cyneticum, following the same tendency of the rest of the Roman provinces, made the transition from a polytheistic society into a monotheistic one. The region made a gradual changeover into Christianity, as Pagan and Animistic religions became obsolete under this new cultural influence. Roman Emperor Theodosius I, himself a native of the Iberian Peninsula, would come to prohibit Paganism in 381. The Roman Temple of Milreu, originally dedicated to Venus, transformed later on into a Paleochristian temple, is an example of the religious changes that took place in this period.

Many Roman ruins, both in the form of temples, countryside villas (of which more than 30 were found in the Algarve), public baths, bridges, salting and fish-processing facilities and mosaics are widespread all over the region, notably in Vila do Bispo, Lagos, Portimão, Quarteira, Faro, Olhão, Tavira and in other areas, illustrating the strong contributions that Roman culture as a whole made to the Algarve.

===Medieval period===

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Visigoths, a Germanic tribe originally from Scandinavia but who had spread into Eastern Europe, occupied the Iberian Peninsula around the year 500. With the death of Amalaric in 531, the original dynastic shape of the Visigoths came to an end, and out of the fusion of the Roman and Germanic components a new Iberian identity came into being. The Visigothic Kingdom was thus founded in 542, with Toledo as its capital. Practicing Arianism at first, a large portion of the Visigoths eventually adopted Catholicism to secure their position in the region. In 552, the Algarve was conquered by the Byzantine Empire and, in 571, Liuvigild managed to secure the region for the Visigothic Kingdom once again, which lasted until the year 711 (which was the starting date of the Umayyad conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom), and comprised most of the Iberian Peninsula and parts of modern France.
When the Moors conquered Lagos in 716, it was renamed Zawaia. Faro, which the Christian residents had called Santa Maria, was renamed Faaron, from , named after a local Muslim chieftain. Due to the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the region was called Gharb Al-Andalus: &quot;Gharb&quot; means &quot;the west&quot;, while &quot;al-Andalus&quot; is the Arabic name for the Iberian Peninsula. As the westernmost region to be conquered by the Moors, the coveted lands of the Algarve, in this corner of Europe, became for a while the end goal of the Muslim Empire&#x27;s expansionist policy. With the advent of Moorish rule in the eighth century, Faro, called Ossonoba by then, retained its status as the most important town in the southwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula. In the 9th century, after a revolt led by Yahia Ben Bakr who was succeeded in office by his son, Bakr Ben Yahia, it became the capital of a short-lived autonomous princedom and was fortified with a ring of defensive walls. At this time, in the 10th century, the name Santa Maria began to be used instead of Ossonoba. By the 11th century, the town was known as &quot;Santa Maria Ibn Harun&quot;. During the Moorish era (9-12th century), Silves was a major stronghold, and the town prospered greatly as the capital of the region. In the mid-13th century, during the Reconquista, the Kingdom of Portugal took over the region in a series of successful military campaigns against the Moors. &quot;Al-Gharb&quot; became the Kingdom of Algarve, and the non-assimilated Muslim Moors who didn&#x27;t flee the region would be expelled in 1496 not only in the Algarve but in all of Portugal. As the southernmost region to be conquered by the Portuguese, the coveted territory had become for a while the end goal of the Kingdom of Portugal&#x27;s expansionist policy known as Reconquista and by itself one of the reasons behind the foundation of Portugal. There were subsequent Moorish attempts to recapture the region, without success.

King Afonso III of Portugal started calling himself King of Portugal and the Algarve. The most outstanding fact of his reign was indeed the definitive conquest of the Algarve. Silves was taken from its last Muslim ruler Ibn Afan by Paio Peres Correia, Grand-Master of the Order of Santiago in 1242 and Tavira was also taken in the same year after Alentejo and most of the coast of the Algarve (then part of a historical region called Gharb al-Andalus by the Muslims of Iberian Peninsula) had already fallen in 1238. In March 1249, the city of Faro was conquered. From this date, Afonso III became the first Portuguese king to use the title King of Portugal and the Algarve. The friars of Sant&#x27;Iago and Calatrava played a decisive role, and were entrusted with the task of concluding the conquest. The conquest of the Algarve led, however, to serious disagreements with the Kingdom of Castile. Peace was initially achieved with the marriage of King Afonso III to Beatrice of Castile, illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile (after the pope had annulled the marriage to Matilda II because she was sterile), but the problem was only definitively solved by the Treaty of Badajoz, of 16 February 1267. By this treaty it was defined that the Guadiana river, from the confluence of the Caia until the mouth, would be the Portugal-Castile border. 

After 1471, with the conquest of several territories in the Maghreb – the area considered an extension of the Algarve – Afonso V of Portugal began fashioning himself &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarves&quot;, referring to the European and African possessions (Algarves is the plural word of Algarve and means the Algarve plus all the overseas territories that Portugal would conquer abroad further south). The over five centuries-long Moorish rule over the Algarve (and Alentejo), left their mark and added to a unique blend of architectonic, gastronomical and artistic features like the traditional Algarve corridinho, a folk dance found in this southernmost region of Portugal. In the 15th century, Prince Henry the Navigator based himself near Lagos and conducted various maritime expeditions which established the colonies that comprised the Portuguese Empire. Also from Lagos, Gil Eanes set sail in 1434 to become the first seafarer to round Cape Bojador in West Africa. The voyages of discovery brought Lagos fame and fortune. Trade flourished and Lagos became the capital of the historical province of Algarve in 1577 and remained so until the fabled 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

===Modern times===

After the destructive effects of an earlier major earthquake in 1722, the 1755 earthquake damaged many areas in the Algarve and an accompanying tsunami destroyed or damaged coastal fortresses, while coastal towns and villages were heavily damaged except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of Ria Formosa lagoon. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. For many Portuguese coastal regions, including the Algarve, the destructive effects of the tsunami were more disastrous than those of the earthquake itself.
Prior to the independence of Brazil, &quot;United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves&quot; (1815–1822) was an official designation for Portugal which also alluded to the Algarve. After the independence of Brazil in 1822, Portuguese monarchs continued to use the title of &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarves&quot; until the proclamation of the First Portuguese Republic in 1910.

In 1807, while Jean-Andoche Junot led the first Napoleonic invasion in the north of Portugal, the Algarve was occupied by Spanish troops under Manuel Godoy. Beginning in 1808, and after subsequent battles in various towns and villages, the region was the first to drive out the Spanish occupiers. During the Portuguese Civil War (1828–1834), several battles took place in the region, especially the battle of Cape St. Vicente and the battle of Sant’Ana, between liberals and Miguelites (antiliberal absolutists). Remexido was the guerrilla Algarvian leader who stood with the Miguelite absolutists for years, until he was executed in Faro in 1838. As the first canned fish undertaking in the country, the Vila Real de Santo António plant of the company Conservas Ramirez (founded in 1853) became the cradle of the sector in Portugal. Vila Real de Santo António and other places in coastal Algarve thrived on the growth of the fishing industry, which included the processing of species of tuna and sardine.

Cork as a material used by people is a very old product. Throughout times, Portugal became the world&#x27;s largest producer of cork, with the Algarve and some areas of the neighboring Portuguese region of Alentejo producing world-renowned high-quality cork (50% of the world&#x27;s cork production comes from Portugal, and cork is one of the country&#x27;s main exports in modern times, but large-scale use of the material by the Portuguese goes back to the 14th century, when Portuguese explorers used cork in the construction of their ships because one of the properties of cork is that it does not rot). At one time, between the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, São Brás de Alportel, in Sotavento Algarvio, was the center of cork production in the Algarve, with 80 factories in operation, but gradually the industry moved to the center and northern regions of Portugal, and only a few cork factories remained in São Brás de Alportel municipality. Starting in the late 19th century, Silves Municipality, in Barlavento Algarvio, used to be another area with a large production of the valuable cork and that industry would prosper until the 1930s (by 2010, the cork industry had disappeared in the area but Silves had a museum showing how cork was harvested and processed in the old days when it was a major center of that industry, a museum opened in 1999 that in 2001 won the prestigious award for Best Museum of Industry in Europe). The establishment of the First Portuguese Republic in 1910 marked the end of the almost nominal Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve.

By the 1950s, as air traveling became more accessible, the Mediterranean Basin increasingly developed into a hot-spot for international tourism. Regions such as the Algarve benefited economically from this trend.
In the Algarve, from 1962 to 1966 and beyond, the mutation of tourism is visible in the new tourist accommodation developments. Hotels play a secondary role, in favor of apartment buildings, extended villas (some with golf course, many with swimming pool) and village complexes. After years of planning and construction work in progress, the Faro International Airport was inaugurated on 11 July 1965, by the President of the Republic Américo Tomás. The access road, between the national road EN125 and the newly built airport, was also opened to the public at the same time. However, tourism services were unprepared for this rapid change. The formation of an accommodation supply outside the framework of tourism legislation and the incapacity of public regulation of the tourism supply begins and would be a reality until the 1990s. This somewhat chaotic tourism boom made the tourist industry the biggest contributor to the economy of Algarve and the largest employer in the region. Starting as a fast-paced tourism urbanization hotspot between the 1960s and 1990s, the Algarve had morphed itself into a seasonal metropolis by the 2010s.

During the process, the Algarve has remained anyway a fairly exotic region for Portuguese citizens from other regions in mainland Portugal due to its Mediterranean climate, unique foods, architecture and geographical location – in modern times many Portuguese residing in other parts of the country traditionally spend their summer break or own a holiday home in Algarve. The state-run University of Algarve was founded in January 1979 and for the Fall 2021 semester had about 9,000 students enrolled. Its medical school opened in 2009. In 1991, the construction of the A22 motorway (also known as &quot;Via Infante de Sagres&quot;, named so after Henry the Navigator) which crosses the Algarve from west to east began and by 2003 it was fully completed. It connects Lagos in western Algarve to the Guadiana International Bridge over the Portugal-Spain international river border in eastern Algarve.

==Geography==

The Algarve is located in the southernmost area of continental Portugal and the southwesternmost area of the Iberian Peninsula and mainland Europe, covering an area of . It borders to the north with the Alentejo region (Alentejo Litoral and Baixo Alentejo), to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean, and to the east the Guadiana River marks the border with Spain. The highest point is located northwest in the Monchique mountains, with a maximum altitude of on Pico da Fóia.

The western part of the Algarve is known as Barlavento and the east as Sotavento. The name is undoubtedly due to the prevailing wind on the south coast of the Algarve but the historical origin of these divisions is uncertain and quite remote. Barlavento and Sotavento both have eight municipalities and one main city (Faro in Sotavento and Portimão in Barlavento).

The region is also home to the Ria Formosa Lagoon, a nature reserve of over and a stopping place for hundreds of different species of birds. This system of barrier islands communicates with the sea through six inlets. The length of the south-facing coastline is roughly . Beyond the westernmost point of Cape St. Vincent it stretches a further to the north. The coastline is notable for picturesque limestone caves and grottoes by the sea, particularly around Lagos, Portimão, Lagoa and Albufeira, which are accessible by powerboat.

Researchers agree that the Lisbon metropolitan area and the Algarve are the two regions in mainland Portugal most at risk of experiencing earthquakes and tsunamis strong enough to cause catastrophic loss of human life and infrastructure. Two earthquakes in the 18th century were the last time such catastrophic events occurred in the Algarve – the 1722 Algarve earthquake and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

===Climate===
The Algarve as a whole is one of the warmest places of Southern Europe, with an Atlantic influenced Mediterranean climate, it has mild wet winters and warm to very hot, dry summers. It is overall the sunniest region in Europe, with annual sunshine values ranging from 2600 h in the Monchique Range, to values well above 3100 h on the southern coast.

Generally, winter sees only subtle differences in daily maxima along the coast, mostly between , though temperatures as high as have been recorded. Conversely, overnight lows are higher in the west, with Sagres and Vila do Bispo averaging , whilst to the east, averages are lower and is more common. Temperatures very rarely fall below freezing (&lt; ). On the interior, nights are usually cooler, averaging .

Summer sees its highest average temperatures in the east, where the maxima ranges from in the coast and in the interior. Daily temperatures in the Vicentine Coast are much cooler, usually maxima, consequence of the strong upwelling western Portugal experiences. The Algarvian interior can get very hot in the summer, temperatures above are not uncommon. Overnight lows are often independent on the location, around in most of the Algarve.
The Algarve gets between of precipitation per year on average. December is the wettest month and July is the driest. The overall precipitation is determined mostly by the precipitation received in the winter (summers are very dry in most of the region). It has its highest values in the mountainous interior, and its lowest on the far east (in the Guadiana Valley) and the southwest (Sagres Point and Cape St. Vincent).

Sea-surface temperatures in the Algarve are generally cool, though milder than the remaining west-facing coasts of Portugal. Around the Sagres Point, the upwelling phenomena further decreases surface ocean temperatures. In the winter, both western and southern coasts average sea-surface temperatures of around . In the summer, it rises to around , with their highest in September; however, southern coastal waters near the Gulf of Cádiz tend to have slightly higher temperatures on average than the western Vicentine Coast.

===Human geography===

About 450,000 permanent inhabitants (90 residents per km2) live in the area, although this figure increases to over a million people at the height of summer, due to an influx of tourists. The Algarve has several cities, towns, and villages; the region&#x27;s capital is the city of Faro, while other cities include Albufeira, Lagoa, Lagos, Loulé, Olhão, Portimão, Quarteira, Silves, Tavira, and Vila Real de Santo António, in addition to various summer retreats such as Vilamoura, Praia da Rocha, Armação de Pêra, Alvor, Monte Gordo, Alcoutim, and Sagres.

Before 2004, the Faro District was the administrative unit governing the Algarve. In 2004, the Greater Metropolitan Area of the Algarve was formed, which was converted into an intermunicipal community in 2008. The Algarve is also a NUTS II and NUTS III statistical region. The intermunicipal community of the Algarve is subdivided into 16 municipalities:

Between 2001 and 2020, the Algarve was the only Portuguese region where an increase in the number of newborns was reported (4,164 babies in 2001; 4,323 babies in 2020; a rise of 3.8%). 25% of those newborns had a foreign mother. Mostly Brazilian mothers, but also a rising number of Indian, Nepalese and Pakistani mothers together with a sizable, already established former trend of Romanian, Ukrainian and Moldovan mothers.

==Economy==

The Algarve&#x27;s human development index (HDI) stands at 0.847 (2019) while Portugal&#x27;s HDI average is 0.864 (2019) and Lisbon Metropolitan Area&#x27;s is 0.901 (2019) – it is the 4th most developed region of Portugal out of seven regions. However, with a GDP per capita at 85.2% of the European Union average, the Algarve has the second highest purchasing power in the country, standing only behind Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Agricultural products of the region include fig, almond, orange, carob, olive, avocado and cork oak. Horticulture is important and the region&#x27;s landscape is known for the large areas of land covered with greenhouses which are used to that end. Several types of fruit and veggies such as tomatoes, cauliflowers, strawberry and raspberry, are commercially grown and exported. Fishing and aquaculture are important activities in the coastal area of the Algarve, with sardines, squids, soles, cyprinids, gilt-head bream, and various seafood, including oysters and the grooved carpet shell, being the major products. The Algarve&#x27;s wines are also renowned. Four wines in the region have Protected Designation of Origin (&quot;Denominação de Origem Controlada&quot; – DOC): Lagoa DOC, Lagos DOC, Portimão DOC, and Tavira DOC. Food processing, including value added products (traditional, local raw agricultural products that have been modified or enhanced to have a higher market value than before) such as innovative fig, orange, almond and carob-based products, cement (CIMPOR has a major cement plant in Loulé) and construction are the main industries. Cork, having an historical industrial tradition in Silves and São Brás de Alportel municipalities since the 19th century but in decline by the 1930s, is still used as a material for the production of several items by newer industries that make products ranging from cork stoppers to fashionware. Pelcor, headquartered in São Brás de Alportel, is the first luxury brand of fashion and lifestyle accessories in cork skin combining design, innovation and sustainability.
Tourism-related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve&#x27;s economy during summer. The Algarve&#x27;s economy has always been closely linked to the sea. Fishing and fish processing have been an important activity since ancient times. This is atested by archeological evidence of garum production in Algarve during the Roman era. The oldest fish canning factory of Portugal was that of Conservas Ramirez established by Sebastian Ramirez in Vila Real de Santo António, Eastern Algarve in 1853, but the long-established fish canning industry entered in decline in the region due to a scarcity of tuna and sardines in Algarve&#x27;s waters because they were the main raw materials used by the industry. Similarly to what happened to the declining Algarvean cork industry in the 1930s, many companies folded and others moved to Northern Portugal in the process. However, successful fish canning industry persists with a number of factories like those of Conserveira do Sul and others. Coincidentally, with this decline in fish canning in the region, since the 1960s the Algarve has embraced tourism which has become its most important economic activity. Faro International Airport located 4 km from downtown Faro, the administrative center of the region of the Algarve in Portugal, was constructed during the 1960s and inaugurated in 1965. In 2019, the airport reached a record-breaking 9 million passengers handled a year.
With the increase in life quality and purchasing power of the Algarve&#x27;s population, many shopping malls have been constructed since the 1990s and 2000s. An Ikea, the first in the Algarve, opened in Loulé, at the time one of the only five in Portugal. In 2017, the Algarve was the Portuguese region that experienced the biggest economic growth, an increase of 4.6% of its GDP.

With potential for solar power generation, the Algarve is becoming an international hotspot for large solar farming projects. The largest such project in Portugal and one of the largest unsubsidised solar power plants in Europe at the time, was inaugurated in Alcoutim in 2021.

Due to its all-year mild weather, beaches, cities, sites, landscapes and accommodation, as well as its public safety record and cost-effective prices, the region became in the 21st century one of the most attractive areas for filming, chosen by both low budget Indie film productions and large players in the film industry from Portugal and abroad.

===Development===

The Algarve has been experiencing a strong development since the beginning of the 1960s, initially due to the need to accommodate its foreign visitors. The region started the construction of an airport in the early 1960s, followed by better infrastructure of other types, mainly roads, sanitation, power grids, telecommunications, hospitals, and housing. Private investors, with the support of the region&#x27;s municipalities, also began the construction of a variety of hotels, resorts, golf courses (which are considered to be some of the best in Europe), and villas.

All this led to a large development in the region, especially for the locals, who had previously lived in harsher circumstances. Today, the Algarve is amongst the regions in Portugal with the best quality of life. Due to the austerity measures introduced in 2011, tolls were placed on the main motorway that crosses the region (the A22 motorway which is also officially known as &quot;Via do lnfante&quot;) to offset the expense of its maintenance. The University of Algarve, a state-run university founded in 1979, has been an important source of innovation and entrepreneurship for the whole region and plays a role as a major driving force of economic growth and development in the Algarve.

===Tourism and attractiveness for expats===

In the 1960s, the Algarve became a popular destination for tourists, mainly from the United Kingdom which still is the origin of the largest group of foreigners in the Algarve. It has since become a common destination for people from Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy,and the US not only as tourists who visit the Algarve but also as residing expats who settle in the region and buy property there. The Algarve&#x27;s mild climate and hours of sunshine per year have attracted interest from Portuguese and other European people wishing to have a holiday home or residence in the region. Being a region of Portugal, and therefore in the European Union, any EU citizen has the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality in the Algarve. Algarve-based publications and newspapers are written in English specifically for this community. 

The Brazilian community in the Algarve is the second largest expat community in the region after the British, followed by important numbers of Ukrainian, Romanian, Moldovan, Indian, Nepalese, Sinhalese, Bangladeshi and Pakistani people who arrived there to work in retail, hospitality industry, construction, agriculture and manufacturing. In the late 2010s, the Algarve saw a high increase in Canadian, American and Australian tourists too. In the Algarve, the expatriate population from high income economies include a large number of pensioners, namely from countries like the UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden and the US. Portuguese people from other parts of the country also visit the region in large numbers, especially in the peak of the summer (July and August) and a sizable number of Portuguese citizens residing in other Portuguese regions, including retired people, own a holiday home in the Algarve. Several international studies have concluded that the Algarve is among the world&#x27;s best places to retire.

Tourist attractions in the region include its beaches, Mediterranean climate, safety, cuisine, and relatively low prices. The Algarve region has garnered international acclaim, winning the World&#x27;s Leading Beach Destination title twice, in 2020 and 2021, and being named Europe&#x27;s Leading Beach Destination nine times between 2012 and 2022, as recognized by the World Travel Awards™. Well-known beaches in the Algarve include Praia da Luz, Praia da Rocha, Marinha Beach, Armação de Pêra, Praia dos Pescadores, Quarteira, Vale do Lobo, Fuzeta, Barril Beach, Manta Rota and Monte Gordo. A well-known spa town is Caldas de Monchique. In addition to its natural features and beaches, the Algarve has invested in the creation of a network of golf courses.
The Algarve is also popular for religious tourism, notably pilgrimages to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Piety (best known as the Sovereign Mother), a Marian shrine dedicated to the patron saint of Loulé, that attract thousands of pilgrims of the Catholic faith to the city, or minor pilgrimages of faithful Catholics to the site of putative apparitions of Our Lady Mother of Goodness which had supposedly occurred in 1999 near the village of São Marcos da Serra.

Tourism plays an important role in the economy of the Algarve. A large number of seasonal job opportunities are tourism-related and are fulfilled by thousands of locals and immigrants. Due to its seasonal nature, most of the economy relies on the good weather available mostly for only about 5–6 months (characterized by a prolonged lack of rain and temperatures above 25 °C throughout the day), meaning that many Algarvians go unemployed during the low season. Nonetheless, due to the very high monetary income that the high season brings, most people in the Algarve are still able to have comfortable lives even while unemployed. Delivery of superior touristic services and products in a convenient and engaging way, also known as luxury tourism, is also found in several areas across the Algarve. The Golden Triangle, a first among such affluent areas, is located outside of Faro, capital of the Algarve, being known for its luxury resorts and Michelin star restaurants. According to World Travel Awards, the Algarve was Europe&#x27;s leading golf destination in 2013 and 2014. Over 25 top-class courses are located in Algarve, most of which were designed by legendary names such as Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros, Jack Nicklaus, and Christy O&#x27;Connor, Jr. In 2018, the region&#x27;s income from tourism was over a billion euros; the number of visitors totaled 4.2 million. Tourism contributed €1.08 billion to the economy in that year.

====Accommodation====

Accommodation in the Algarve ranges from high-rise resorts in places such as Albufeira, Vilamoura, Praia da Rocha and Armação de Pêra to apartment rental, bed and breakfast, hostels and traditional guesthouses located in small towns and villages, both inland and alongside the Algarve coast. Over the years, tourists with less acquisitive power started to visit the Algarve in large numbers and steering away from expensive resorts, opting instead for more affordable touristic establishments such as vacation rentals, guesthouses, and hostels. Besides affordability, a higher flexibility in rules and conditions, good overall location, as well as a greater hospitality and interaction with guests, are often cited as some of the appealing factors of these accommodations. Throughout the Algarve, local accommodation, as its colloquially known, employs over 20 thousand people in more than 32 thousand legal establishments and generates an estimated 980 million Euros yearly. The vast majority of tourists who seek this type of accommodation are British, Portuguese and French, but an exponential increase in tourists from Germany, Spain, the Benelux and Brazil has also been seen.

Camping, motorhoming and caravaning are also options for travelers and tourists in general across the Algarve. Both free and paid motorhome areas, suitable car parks and camping parks can be found around the entire region to this end. However, the Portuguese police forces may regularly patrol the areas where these activities are forbidden and can fine transgressors.

====Criticism====

Although international tourism and a generally high receptivity to globalism, economic globalization and foreign direct investment have brought a relatively high level of prosperity and development to the region, many personalities criticize the environmental impacts, the high cost of living and the eradication of the Algarve&#x27;s cultural and traditional characteristics that such outside influence has brought. Algarve native Fernando Silva Grade (1955–2019), a nationally renowned plastic artist and activist with a licentiate degree in biology awarded by the University of Lisbon in 1983, in his 2014 book &quot;O Algarve Tal como o Destruímos&quot; (loose translation: The Algarve as we destroyed it), vehemently opposed the proliferation of the mass tourism and construction sectors, which, in his opinion, eroded large portions of a world unique coastline, degraded and destroyed Algarve&#x27;s traditional architecture, along with the peaceful and slow-paced way of life that were once ubiquitous throughout the region. He further went on to criticize the inapt attitudes of politicians and city halls which continuously fail to preserve this legacy.

Other critics underline the over-dependency of the Algarve on tourism and the &quot;sun and beach&quot; modality of tourism in particular, the one mostly advertised by local and national authorities and, thus, most widespread. They accentuate the saturation of beach-side resorts that leave other types of tourist establishments, such as the ones dedicated to nature and health, with little occupancy. These critics also stress that overcrowdedness, filthiness and pollution are the consequences of this lack of diversity in the Algarve&#x27;s tourism industry. In addition, due to international mass tourism, some areas of the Algarve are drug dealing and prostitution hotspots, including luxury prostitution and male prostitution, performed mostly by foreign sex workers.

The England-inspired, England-reliant tourist product of the Algarve since the 1960s is a source of criticism in Portugal to the point that the Algarve region has been compared to a colony of the English. Portuguese tourists perceive their status as tourists in the Portuguese region of Algarve as being constantly challenged by the extreme Anglophilia of the Algarvian people and its tourist offer.

==Culture==

The region of the Algarve has a rich ethnographic heritage, with centuries-old customs, traditions and historical heritage. The Algarve is a cultural and historical point of interest all year round, but at particular times, such as Easter, Christmas, or even Spring, together with its gastronomic delicacies, the Algarve region has an old, multifaceted legacy that also shaped its regional cultural identity within Portugal. The Algarve is a place that gathers many settlements, from prehistoric times, to Phoenician, Roman, Visigothic, Arab and Christian Reconquista times, there are several testimonies that left a little piece of themselves, to form the Algarve of today. Since the menhirs and megalithic monuments like the Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar and the Menhirs of Lavajo that prove the presence of the first humans of its history, also the Romans left the testimonies of their presence and culture. The Roman Ruins of Milreu in Estói, the Roman ruins of Cerro da Vila in Vilamoura or the Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada in Mexilhoeira Grande, are good examples of Roman vestiges in the Algarve, being some of them equipped with a dedicated interpretive center to tell their story. The Islamic occupation period from which a great heritage remains, present in various aspects of the Algarve culture beginning with the name of the region since the word &quot;Algarve&quot; goes back to the Arabic word &quot;al-Gharb&quot; meaning West (from ), including castles and fortresses, vestiges of a unique ribat, the Ribat of Arrifana, as well as alcarias, and some churches that were adapted from ancient mosques, in addition to strong influences in popular architecture, also left its mark. Vila Real de Santo António, to the far east of the region, near Spain, is the best Algarve example of the strong legacy that the Marquis of Pombal left in Portuguese urban planning after the great earthquake of 1755.

The Algarve dialect is a dialect of Portuguese spoken in the Algarve. It is closely related to Alentejan Portuguese and expresses the region&#x27;s peculiar way of life, its traditional sayings, as well as its well-known and highly colorful curses, idioms, proverbs, and expressions. It bears the influences of Arabic, archaic Portuguese and the southern variant of Castillian. Until the end of the 20th century it was ubiquitous but afterwards it became less common among younger generations who live near the coastal strip and the main urban centers. In any case, a majority of people in some places of the Algarve besides the sparsely populated, ageing hilly interior, like areas of Lagos, Portimão, Albufeira, Loulé, Faro, Olhão, Tavira and Vila Real de Santo António coastal municipalities, still speak the dialect employing its characteristic, strong accent on a daily basis.

The most striking symbol of the traditional Algarve architecture is undoubtedly the chimney, which reflected the individuality of the owner of the house and showed off his possessions. No two chimneys were alike, and the more intricate the design, the more expensive the work. Examples of these symbols of popular art and technical skill can be seen in the Algarve&#x27;s rural hinterland, in the most affluent dwellings. The &quot;platibanda&quot; (platband) is another characteristic feature of the Algarve&#x27;s architectural heritage. It is an elegant decorative strip that lines the facades and hides the roof or cladding, ornamented with geometric shapes and colors. It contrasts with the white of the whitewash and matches the colored bars that frame doors and windows. The four-sloped, or scissor truss are typical of aristocratic cities, and denote a strong Eastern aesthetic influence, which traveled along with silks and spices. 

They are associated with Tavira, the princess of the Gilão, a well-preserved architectural gem and once a port of great strategic importance. They also exist in Faro, but their presence is residual today. In the western Algarve the winds blow from the Atlantic coast and, in its interior, there is the mountain climate. Here the houses are generally simpler, less sophisticated, built in masonry of mud or stone, and unadorned, only whitewashed. These simple rural houses are also found, in their charming simplicity, in the Caldeirão mountain range. On the coast, it is frequent the construction of açoteias, roof terraces of Arabic inspiration that were used to watch the sea, waiting for the boats returning from their fishing trips. It was also in these private spaces that fruit and fish were dried, and that people rested on hot summer nights. Olhão is the ex-libris of this architecture of pure and clean lines, deserving the nickname of cubist city, with its buildings clustered in cubes in a sinuous plan, direct influence of the architecture of Morocco.

Corridinho is the traditional dance of the Algarve bearing some resemblance to the polka and mazurka. The corridinho is a form of Portuguese folk dance whose the origin is unclear and believed older, although it gained popularity in the 1800s. 

The Algarve is also famous for its pottery and ceramics, particularly hand-painted pottery and &quot;azulejos&quot;, which are painted, tin-glazed ceramic tiles. Numerous ceramics and pottery outlets are open throughout the Algarve, including a number of potteries established by foreign artists interested in the old tradition of Algarve pottery. For working potteries and ceramics workshops, the main (or best-known) pottery centers are located in Almancil, Loulé, Porches and Silves, but many other Algarve ceramic and pottery workshops and shops are found across the entire Algarve region. Other representative handicraft activities of the Algarve are the &quot;empreita&quot;, a braid of fine palm leaf rolled up in the most diverse shapes, and the basketry, resulting from the technique of weaving the cane and the wicker, with such perfection that makes the Algarve basketry famous in the Portuguese south.

The Algarve gastronomy dates back to the historical times of the Roman and Arabic presence, constituting, along with the climate of the region, one of the main points of tourist interest. The ingredients used reflect the fresh flavors of the sea and the pleasant and strong aromas of the countryside. From the &quot;arroz de lingueirão&quot; rice with razor clams from Faro, the grilled sardines from Portimão to the sweets &quot;Dom Rodrigos&quot; from Lagos, there are dishes and delicacies for all tastes. The town of Monchique stands out in this chapter because it is known for its pork production, proof of which are the well-known sausages made with pork meat (sausage, morcela black pudding, farinheira and chouriço) and presunto hams, exhibited annually at the Feira dos Enchidos and Feira do Presunto, respectively. The typical &quot;aguardente de medronho&quot; (arbutus berry brandy) produced in this region both artisanally and industrially, is also a very well known fruit brandy in the region. The liqueurs made with regional products are also sought after. Those include ginjinha (sour cherry liqueur) and amêndoa amarga (bitter almond liqueur).

Old fig and almond-based sweets and desserts as well as newer carob-based products; a plethora of fish and seafood dishes near the coast; and pork and chicken dishes from inland Algarve, are among the most typical elements of its regional cuisine. Cataplana; frango de churrasco like that known as &quot;frango de churrasco à la Guia&quot;; caldeirada; Portuguese tuna steak &#x27;Algarve style&#x27;; a variety of seafood dishes which may contain various shellfish like clams, mussels, crab and shrimp; grilled sardines; Algarve style stuffed and fried squid; marzipan; and xarém are some of the typical regional culinary specialties in the Algarve. Carne de porco à alentejana, which is named after the neighboring region of Alentejo, is speculated by some to have its roots in the Algarve region because the clams are much more popular as food in seaside cities, towns and villages like those of the Algarve rather than in places far from the ocean. It may be an example of fusion cuisine between pork dishes of inner Alentejo where pig farming is extensive and seafood dishes of coastal Algarve where shellfish abound.

Although Loulé hosts the largest carnival in the Algarve, every town and village in the Algarve has its own party. It usually starts with a children&#x27;s parade through the streets on the first day, where the little ones march, walk or dance in dresses and masks. People gather in the streets to cheer on the children. In most villages there are dances every night in the village halls. The dancing starts early and ends late, with no breaks in the local carnival music that entertains people of all ages. Cities and towns also organize street parties, with local dancers, some as young as 6 years old, dressed up in their national costumes, entertaining everyone with their traditional instruments and complicated dance steps. Others organize parades with music, fanfares, floats, and local groups dressed up in all kinds of costumes – from the simplest to the most elaborate. Everyone joins in clapping and stamping their feet, always celebrating and cheering. Candy and streamers are thrown towards the crowd that stretches along the streets, reminding them that this is a time for feasting and celebration

In the western Algarve, the Barlavento, in Odiáxere, there are 5 days of entertainment, parades and music. Lagos and Sagres also offer plenty of entertainment during the festivities. In the Central and Eastern Algarve, the Sotavento – besides the big event in Loulé – Quarteira, São Brás, Olhão, Moncarapacho, Tavira and Vila Real de Santo António all organize festivals and corsos in their own way, smaller in size but equally lively and joyful. Although the festivities in the Algarve are now heavily based on the samba style of Brazilian Carnival, the old tradition of playing pranks is still present. Stylishly dressed student girls tour shopping malls, bars, cafes and the streets, singing their satirical songs about the government, politicians and world events.

Every year in August the city of Silves organizes a medieval fair which incorporates Muslim Algarve and Reconquista themes, celebrating the region&#x27;s conjoint Muslim and Christian cultural heritage. The fair attracts an average of 100 - 150 thousand visitors during its 10 day run, and it is Algarve&#x27;s most visited medieval fair.

==Fauna and flora==

The coastal seafaring people of the Algarve bred the Portuguese Water Dog. From there the breed expanded to all around Portugal&#x27;s coast, where they were taught to herd fish into fishermen&#x27;s nets, retrieve lost tackle or broken nets, and act as couriers from ship to ship, or ship to shore. This dog breed is now a distinctive dog breed of both Portugal and the Algarve region in particular. 
 A wild cat formerly at risk of extinction, the Iberian lynx (&quot;Lynx pardinus&quot;) used to populate five distinct areas in Portugal: the Algarve region, Serra da Malcata (Centro Region), Serra de São Mamede (Alentejo Region), Vale do Guadiana (the Portuguese section of Guadiana River) and Vale do Sado (Sado River). The southern strip of Portugal, the Algarve region, was the area with the greatest concentration, occupying an area of about 650 square kilometres between the Monchique, Caldeirão and Espinhaço de Cão mountain ranges. In the early 21st century there was a move to reintroduce them in Portugal by breeding them in captivity, from animals brought from Spain.

A paradise for bluefin tuna fishing, the Algarve in Portugal witness each year the migration of bluefin tuna that runs in front of the coasts of Olhão. The sea waters in this region are also populated by various whales, dolphins and porpoises at different times throughout the year. The most common species are the common dolphin (&quot;Delphinus delphis&quot;) and bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;). On the Ria Formosa Natural Park one can find unique species in Portugal and most of Europe such as the chameleon, a reptile that in Portugal only exists in the Algarve, and one of the largest populations of seahorses in the world.
The Algarve is divided into three regions: the Litoral – the southern coast with its beaches; the Barrocal – the northern interior and the Serra de Monchique in the northwest and the Serra do Caldeirão in the northeast. The vegetation of the northern Algarve is divided into forests, hilly terrain, scrubland, fertile land and pastures with mountain springs and streams, lakes and waterfalls.

The south is dominated by the typical vegetation of Ria Formosa lagoon and dune system. Regarding flora in the south of Algarve, there are two main features: on one hand, the marshes – areas submerged by high tide and uncovered at low tide – with its halophytic vegetation (vegetation that tolerates high saline levels, lack of soil oxygen and long periods of emersion). 

On the other hand, the dune flora – species adapted to strong winds, excessive salinity and high permeability of the soils – which presents species as the &quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot;, the &quot;Armeria maritima&quot;, the &quot;Aster tripolium&quot;, the &quot;Pancratium maritimum&quot; and the &quot;Otanthus maritimus&quot;. At the mouth of the Espiche River near Armação de Pera and Albufeira an area of wetland called the Salgados Lagoon fed by the waters of that river is found. The Salgados Lagoon has been classified as an IBA (Important Bird Area). Further west, near Alvor, one can find the Ria de Alvor (Alvor Estuary) located between the towns of Lagos and Portimão, covering 1,700 hectares with a mix of habitats of brushwood, forest and agricultural land, comprising the estuary, dunes, marshes and salt-pans. On the west and southwestern tip of coastal Algarve, there is the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park, another natural park of the Algarve which extends further north along the Portuguese coast to the Alentejo region.
Cultivars like the &quot;Prunus dulcis&quot;, &quot;Ficus carica&quot; and &quot;Citrus × sinensis&quot; are regarded as typical in the region and are widespread across the Algarve landscape but the most relevant wild tree and shrub species of Algarve include:
*Cork Oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;): In the past, it was one of the dominant species of flora in the Algarve region. More common in the Caldeirão and Monchique mountains, it was also present on the coast of the eastern Algarve. Rare or absent in the Northeast Algarve and Lower Guadiana (municipalities of Alcoutim and Castro Marim), and the Algarve Barrocal. The number of specimens of the species has fallen dramatically due to fires, prolonged periods of drought and the &quot;cork oak disease&quot;. Historically, it has been economically important for cork extraction activity.
*Holm Oak (&quot;Quercus rotundifolia&quot;): Dominates the tree stratum in the Algarve Barrocal, Northeast and Baixo Guadiana (concelhos of Alcoutim and Castro Marim). Common in the Caldeirão mountain range, especially in the easternmost parts of the range The species was cultivated to harvest acorns; its wood was highly prized.
*Monchique Oak (&quot;Quercus canariensis&quot;): Its presence is recorded in the Serra de Monchique and in the municipality of Odemira, but it is possible that in the past it was present in the Serra do Caldeirão. It is almost extinct in Portugal due to forest fires and the expansion of eucalyptus and maritime pine.
*Chestnut Tree (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;): In the past, there was a large chestnut grove in the Monchique mountains. It was the first chestnut to reach the markets. It has also been recorded that this species was present in the hills of Tavira in the 18th century. Considering the existence of chestnut groves in the Serra de Aracena, it is possible that centuries ago chestnut trees were common in the wetter areas of the Algarve hills.
*Carob Tree (&quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;): It is debatable whether this is an introduced or an indigenous species. The species is cultivated on the coast and in the barrocal. When conditions are favorable, it can reach large dimensions. In the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, the carob tree began to be cultivated in the highlands but productivity in that sub-region is very low. Portugal is the largest producer of carob pods and the region of the Algarve is by far the greatest producer of this product.
*Poplar (&quot;Populus alba&quot;): It is probably the most common poplar in the Algarve. It occurs on the coast, especially in the eastern Algarve, forming galleries in water courses or groves in valleys. Great ornamental value, in favorable conditions can reach large dimensions
*Oak-Bark (&quot;Quercus faginea alpestris&quot;): This tree is very rare in the region due to anthropogenic action. It may have been common in the past, in the barrocal and the mountains of the windward side (Barlavento).
*Black oak (&quot;Quercus pyrenaica&quot;): It is likely that this species was present in the highest and coldest points of the Algarve hills. The black oak occurs in Andalusia, in Spain, at lower latitudes. The natural occurrence of the black oak in Portugal is recorded in Baixo Alentejo, near the Monchique mountains.
*Strawberry Tree (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;): This shrub is common in the mountains of the municipalities of Tavira, São Brás de Alportel, Loulé, Silves and Monchique. Absent in the Northeast Algarve. Under favorable conditions can reach 15 meters It is often associated with species of the genus Quercus, but in the past there may have been woods consisting only of strawberry trees. It is the source of medronho, a traditional fruit brandy.
*Alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;): It occurs in riparian galleries, in permanent watercourses. It can reach 30 meters. A rare species in the Algarve, the alder can be found in the Serra de Monchique.
*Ash (&quot;Fraxinus angustifolia&quot;): It occurs especially in the eastern Algarve, especially in the valleys of the Almargem, Asseca and Beliche streams. It is possible that in the past it formed dense forests around the region&#x27;s large streams. Due to the recent abandonment of agriculture, the species is regenerating in some parts of the Algarve region.
*Loendro (&quot;Nerium oleander&quot;): Forms galleries in temporary watercourses in the mountains, especially in the eastern Algarve Very common shrub in the region
*Myrtle (&quot;Myrtus communis&quot;): Shrub or small tree, with medicinal interest It occurs in some parts of the eastern mountains, but it could have been much more common in the past. As with other species of the eastern hills, the myrtle was removed due to the wheat harvest. Many specimens were also lost in 21st century&#x27;s wildfires.
*Wild Olive (&quot;Olea europaea sylvestris&quot;): A medium-sized shrub or tree (up to 15 m), common on abandoned agricultural land on the coast or in the Barrocal It can reach a longevity of 2000 years.
*Terebinth (&quot;Pistacia terebinthus&quot;): Small tree or shrub Rare, only occurs in the Eastern Algarve
*Poplar (&quot;Populus nigra&quot;): Less common than Populus alba A few isolated specimens occur scattered throughout the Algarve region, near the main streams.
*Aroeira (&quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot;): Shrub or rarely small tree, it occurs in bushes, in warmer areas of the barrocal and the coast of Algarve A very common species in the region
*Wild pear (&quot;Pyrus bourgaeana&quot;): Shrub or small tree This species is often associated with the cork oak and the holm oak in the Serra do Caldeirão.

==Education==
State-run and private education institutions cover all the educational needs of the Algarve&#x27;s population from kindergarten to university education. Primary and secondary education schools from grade 1 to grade 12, including a number of international schools (examples include Aljezur International School, Deutsche Schule Algarve, International School São Lourenço, Nobel International School Algarve, Vale Verde International School and Vilamoura International School), as well a wide network of state-run and private kindergartens are in the Algarve and in particular at the most densely populated littoral strip. The University of Algarve, headquartered in Faro, with an extension in Portimão, is a public university which awards undergraduate, integrated master, master and doctorate degrees in fields ranging from biomedical sciences, landscape architecture, agronomy or marine biology to economics, psychology, sociology or languages, literatures and cultures. The population of the Algarve is also served by two private higher education institutions (Instituto Piaget in Silves and Instituto Superior Manuel Teixeira Gomes in Portimão).

==Sports==
Sports clubs in the Algarve include several football teams (S.C. Olhanense, Portimonense S.C., S.C. Farense, Imortal de Albufeira, Louletano D.C., C.F. Esperança de Lagos, etc.) which play in the Portuguese football league system. S.C. Farense and Portimonense S.C. are the most successful football clubs in the Algarve and usually compete in one of the two main top-tier professional football leagues in Portugal. The Algarve Cup, an invitational tournament for national teams in women&#x27;s association football hosted by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is held annually in the Algarve since 1994.

Cycling is a popular sport in Portugal and the region of Algarve has long-established, noteworthy professional cycling teams which compete in the Volta a Portugal and other major cycling events. The Volta ao Algarve is the oldest and most popular road bicycle racing competition in the Algarve region. The most successful of those professional cycling teams of the Algarve in the UCI Continental Tour are Louletano Desportos Clube and Clube de Ciclismo de Tavira.

The Almond Blossom Cross Country (Portuguese: Cross Internacional das Amendoeiras em Flor) is an annual international cross country running competition first organized in 1977 which takes place in Albufeira, in early March. It is one of the IAAF permit meetings which serve as qualifying events for the IAAF World Cross Country Championships.

There are numerous open-water swimming events throughout the year as well as tennis. The Algarve is also home to some of the world&#x27;s most renowned golf-courses.
Algarve International Circuit, a motorsport venue, is located in the region.

Due to the strong Nortada winds blowing through the South coast of Portugal, the Algarve is a summer holiday destination for windsports. Sailing, windsurfing and especially kitesurfing have a large and growing community in the Algarve. The nature of the Algarve coastline offers a mix of flat water lagoons such as those of the Ria Formosa Nature Park, or the waves of Sagres and the South-west coast.

Many kitesurfing spots dot the Algarve coastline.

<text>The Khmer Empire was a Hindu-Buddhist empire in Southeast Asia, centered on hydraulic cities in what is now northern Cambodia. Known as Kambuja (; ) by its inhabitants, it grew out of the former civilization of Chenla and lasted from 802 to 1431. Historians call this period of Cambodian history the Angkor period, after the empire&#x27;s most well-known capital, Angkor. The Khmer Empire ruled or vassalised most of Mainland Southeast Asia and stretched as far north as southern China. 

The beginning of the Khmer Empire is conventionally dated to 802, when Khmer prince Jayavarman II declared himself &quot;chakravartin&quot; (, a title equivalent to &#x27;emperor&#x27;) in the Phnom Kulen mountains. Although the end of the Khmer Empire has traditionally been marked with the fall of Angkor to the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1431, the reasons for the empire&#x27;s collapse are still debated amongst scholars. Researchers have determined that a period of strong monsoon rains was followed by a severe drought in the region, which caused damage to the empire&#x27;s hydraulic infrastructure. Variability between droughts and flooding was also a problem, which may have caused residents to migrate southward and away from the empire&#x27;s major cities.

The site of Angkor is perhaps the empire&#x27;s most notable legacy, as it was the capital during the empire&#x27;s zenith. The majestic monuments of Angkor, such as Angkor Wat and the Bayon, bear testimony to the Khmer Empire&#x27;s immense power and wealth, impressive art and culture, architectural technique, aesthetic achievements, and variety of belief systems that it patronized over time. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor, during its peak in the 11th to the 13th centuries, was the most extensive pre-industrial urban complex in the world.

== Etymology ==
Modern scholars often refer to the Empire as the &quot;Khmer Empire&quot; () or the &quot;Angkorian Empire&quot; (), the latter after the capital Angkor.

The Empire referred to itself as &quot;Kambuja&quot; (; ; ) or &quot;Kambujadeśa&quot; (; ; ), names which were pre-modern predecessors to the modern &quot;Kampuchea&quot;.

==Historiography==
No written records of the Angkor period have survived other than stone inscriptions. Current knowledge of the historical Khmer civilization is derived primarily from:
* Archaeological excavation, reconstruction and investigation
* Stone inscriptions (the most important of which are foundation steles of temples), which report on the political and religious deeds of the kings
* Reliefs in a series of temple walls with depictions of daily life, market scenes, military marches, and palace life
* Reports and chronicles of Chinese diplomats, traders, and travelers

==History==

===Formation and growth===

====Reign of Jayavarman II====

According to an inscription in the Sdok Kok Thom temple, around 781 the Khmer prince Jayavarman II established Indrapura as the capital of his domain. It was located in Banteay Prey Nokor, near today&#x27;s Kampong Cham. After returning to his home in the former kingdom of Chenla, he quickly built up his influence and defeated a series of competing kings. In 790 he became king of an empire called &quot;Kambuja&quot; by the Khmer. He then moved his court northwest to Mahendraparvata, far inland north from the great lake of Tonlé Sap.

Jayavarman II (reigned 802–835) is widely regarded as the king who set the foundations of the Angkor period. Historians generally agree that this period of Cambodian history began in 802, when Jayavarman II conducted a grandiose consecration ritual on the sacred Mount Mahendraparvata, now known as Phnom Kulen. At the ritual, which was taken from the Hindu tradition, Jayavarman II proclaimed himself as &quot;chakravartin&quot; (from Sanskrit, commonly translated as &quot;universal ruler&quot;; Old Khmer: &quot;Kamraten jagad ta Raja&quot;) and &quot;devaraja&quot; (from Sanskrit, ). He also declared Kambuja&#x27;s independence from a place inscriptions call &quot;Java&quot;.

Historians debate whether &quot;Java&quot; means the Indonesian island of Java, Champa or a different location. According to an older established interpretation, Jayavarman II was a prince who lived at the court of Sailendra in Java and brought back to Cambodia the art and culture of the Javanese Sailendran court (such as the concept of a &quot;devaraja&quot;). This classical theory was criticized by modern scholars such as Claude Jacques and Michael Vickery, who noted that the Khmer used the term &quot;chvea&quot; to describe the Chams, their neighbors to the east. But in 2013 Arlo Griffiths refuted these theories and convincingly demonstrated that in almost all cases the inscriptions mention Java they refer to the island of Java in the Indonesian archipelago.

Jayavarman&#x27;s political career began in Vyadhapura (likely the modern-day ruins of Banteay Prey Nokor) in eastern Cambodia. Moreover, many early temples on Phnom Kulen show Cham (e.g. Prasat Damrei Krap) as well as Javanese influences (e.g. the primitive &quot;temple-mountain&quot; of Aram Rong Cen and Prasat Thmar Dap), even if their asymmetric distribution seems typically Khmer.

In the following years, Jayavarman II extended his territory and established a new capital, Hariharalaya, near the modern-day town of Roluos. He thereby laid the foundation of Angkor, which was to arise some to the northwest. Jayavarman II died in 835 and was succeeded by his son Jayavarman III. Jayavarman III died in 877 and was succeeded by Indravarman I.

The successors of Jayavarman II kept extending the territory of Kambuja. Indravarman I (reigned 877–889) managed to expand the kingdom without wars and initiated extensive building projects, which were enabled by the wealth gained through trade and agriculture. Foremost were the temple of Preah Ko and irrigation works. Indravarman I developed Hariharalaya further by constructing Bakong circa 881. Bakong in particular bears striking similarities to the Borobudur temple in Java, which suggests that it may have served as the prototype for Bakong. There were at the time exchanges of travellers and missions between Kambuja and the Sailendras in Java, which brought to Cambodia not only ideas, but also technical and architectural details.

====Establishment of Yasodharapura====
Indravarman I was followed by his son Yasovarman I (reigned 889–915), who established a new capital, Yasodharapura– the first city of the larger Angkor area. The city&#x27;s central temple was built on Phnom Bakheng, a hill which rises around 60 m above the plain on which Angkor sits. The East Baray, a massive water reservoir measuring , was also created under the reign of Yasovarman I.

At the beginning of the 10th century, the empire fractured. Jayavarman IV moved the capital to Lingapura (now known as Koh Ker), some northeast of Angkor. Only when Rajendravarman II ascended to the throne (reigned 944–968) was the royal palace returned to Yasodharapura. He once again took up the extensive building schemes of the earlier kings and established a series of Hindu temples in the Angkor area, such as Pre Rup and the East Mebon, a temple located on an artificial island in the center of the East Baray. Several Buddhist temples and monasteries were also built. In 950, the first war took place between Kambuja and the kingdom of Champa to the east (in what is now central Vietnam).

The son of Rajendravarman II, Jayavarman V, reigned from 968 to 1001, after establishing himself as the new king over the other princes. His rule was a largely peaceful period, marked by prosperity and a cultural flowering. He established a new capital slightly west of his father&#x27;s and named it Jayendranagari; its state temple, Ta Keo, was to the south. At the court of Jayavarman V lived philosophers, scholars, and artists. New temples were also established; the most important of these were Banteay Srei, considered one of the most beautiful and artistic of Angkor, and Ta Keo, the first temple of Angkor built completely of sandstone.

A decade of conflict followed the death of Jayavarman V. Three kings reigned simultaneously as antagonists to each other until Suryavarman I (reigned 1006–1050) ascended to the throne by taking the capital Angkor. His rule was marked by repeated attempts by his opponents to overthrow him and military conflicts with neighboring kingdoms. Suryavarman I established diplomatic relations with the Chola dynasty of south India early in his rule. 

In the first decade of the 11th century, Kambuja came into conflict with the kingdom of Tambralinga in the Malay Peninsula. After surviving several invasions from his enemies, Suryavarman requested aid from the powerful Chola emperor Rajendra I against Tambralinga. After learning of Suryavarman&#x27;s alliance with Chola, Tambralinga requested aid from the Srivijaya king Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. This eventually led to Chola coming into conflict with Srivijaya. The war ended with a victory for Chola and Kambuja, and major losses for Srivijaya and Tambralinga. The two alliances had religious nuance, as Chola and Kambuja were Hindu Shaivite, while Tambralinga and Srivijaya were Mahayana Buddhist. There is some indication that, before or after the war, Suryavarman I gifted a chariot to Rajendra I to possibly facilitate trade or an alliance. 

Suryavarman I&#x27;s wife was Viralakshmi, and following his death in 1050, he was succeeded by Udayadityavarman II, who built the Baphuon and West Baray. In 1074, conflict arose between Harshavarman III, the younger brother and successor of Udayadityavarman II, and the Champa king Harivarman IV.

===Golden age of Khmer civilization ===
The Greater Angkor Region had a population of approximately 700,000 to 900,000 at its peak in the 13th century CE. This population made Angkor one of the most populous cities of the medieval world.

====Reign of Suryavarman II and Angkor Wat====
The 12th century was a time of conflict and brutal power struggles. Under Suryavarman II (reigned 1113–1150) the empire united internally and Angkor Wat, dedicated to the god Vishnu, was built over a period of 37 years. In the east, Suryavarman II&#x27;s campaigns against Champa and Dai Viet were unsuccessful, though he sacked Vijaya in 1145 and deposed Jaya Indravarman III. The Khmers occupied Vijaya until 1149, when they were driven out by Jaya Harivarman I. In 1114, Suryavarman II sent a mission to Chola and presented a precious stone to the Chola emperor Kulottunga I.

Another period followed in which kings reigned briefly and were violently overthrown by their successors. Finally, in 1177 the capital was raided and looted in a naval battle on the Tonlé Sap lake by a Cham fleet under Jaya Indravarman IV, and Khmer king Tribhuvanadityavarman was killed.

====Reign of Jayavarman VII and Angkor Thom====
King Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181–1219) was generally considered Cambodia&#x27;s greatest king. He had already been a military leader as a prince under the previous kings. After Champa had conquered Angkor, he gathered an army and retook the capital. He consequently ascended to the throne and continued to wage war against Champa for another 22 years, until the Khmer defeated the Chams in 1203 and conquered large parts of their territory. According to Chinese sources, Jayavarman VII added Pegu to the territory of the Khmer Empire in 1195.

Jayavarman VII stands as the last of the great kings of Angkor, not only because of his successful military campaign against Champa, but also because he was not a tyrannical ruler in the manner of his immediate predecessors. He unified the empire and carried out noteworthy building projects. The new capital, now called Angkor Thom (), was built. In the center, the king (himself a follower of Mahayana Buddhism) had constructed as the state temple the Bayon, with towers bearing faces of the boddhisattva Avalokiteshvara, each several meters high, carved out of stone. Further important temples built under Jayavarman VII were Ta Prohm for his mother, Preah Khan for his father, Banteay Kdei, and Neak Pean, as well as the reservoir of Srah Srang. An extensive network of roads was laid down connecting every town of the empire, with rest-houses built for travelers and a total of 102 hospitals established across his realm.

====Reign of Jayavarman VIII====
After the death of Jayavarman VII, his son Indravarman II (reigned 1219–1243) ascended to the throne. Like his father, he was a Buddhist, and he completed a series of temples begun under his father&#x27;s rule. As a warrior he was less successful. In 1220, under mounting pressure from the increasingly powerful Đại Việt and its ally Champa, the Khmer withdrew from many of the provinces previously conquered from the Chams.

Indravarman II was succeeded by Jayavarman VIII (reigned 1243–1295). In contrast to his predecessors, Jayavarman VIII was a follower of Hindu Shaivism and an aggressive opponent of Buddhism, destroying many Buddha statues in the empire and converting Buddhist temples to Hindu temples. Kambuja was threatened externally in 1283 by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. Jayavarman VIII avoided war with general Sogetu (sometimes known as Sagatu or Sodu), the governor of Guangzhou, China, by paying annual tribute to the Mongols, starting in 1285. Jayavarman VIII&#x27;s rule ended in 1295 when he was deposed by his son-in-law Srindravarman (reigned 1295–1309). The new king was a follower of Theravada Buddhism, a school of Buddhism that had arrived in Southeast Asia from Sri Lanka and subsequently spread through most of the region.

In August 1296, the Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan arrived in Angkor and recorded, &quot;In the recent war with the Siamese, the country was utterly devastated&quot;. He remained at the court of Srindravarman until July 1297. He was neither the first nor the last Chinese representative to visit Kambuja. His stay is notable, however, because Zhou later wrote a detailed report on life in Angkor. His portrayal of the empire is today one of the most important sources of understanding historical Angkor. Alongside the descriptions within several great temples (the Bayon, the Baphuon, Angkor Wat), his account informs us that the towers of the Bayon were once covered in gold; the text also offers valuable information on the everyday life and habits of the inhabitants of Angkor.

===Decline===
By the 14th century, Kambuja had suffered a long, arduous, and steady decline. Historians have proposed different causes for the decline: the religious conversion from Vishnuite-Shivaite Hinduism to Theravada Buddhism that affected social and political systems, incessant internal power struggles among Khmer princes, vassal revolt, foreign invasion, plague, and ecological breakdown.

For social and religious reasons, many aspects contributed to the decline of Kambuja. The relationship between the rulers and their elites was unstable– among the 27 rulers of Kambuja, eleven lacked a legitimate claim to power, and violent power struggles were frequent. Kambuja focused more on its domestic economy and did not take advantage of the international maritime trade network. The input of Buddhist ideas also conflicted with and disturbed the state order built under Hinduism.

====Conversion from Hinduism to Buddhism====
The last Sanskrit inscription is dated 1327 and describes the succession of Indrajayavarman by Jayavarmadiparamesvara. Historians suspect a connection with the kings&#x27; adoption of Theravada Buddhism: the kings were no longer considered &quot;devarajas&quot; (god kings) and there was therefore no need to erect huge temples to them, or rather to the gods under whose protection they stood. The retreat from the concept of the &quot;devaraja&quot; may also have led to a loss of royal authority and thereby to a lack of workers. The water-management apparatus also degenerated, meaning that harvests were reduced by floods or drought. While previously three rice harvests per year were possible– a substantial contribution to the prosperity and power of Kambuja– the declining harvests further weakened the empire.

Looking at the archaeological record, however, archaeologists noticed that not only were the structures ceasing to be built, but the Khmer&#x27;s historical inscription was also lacking from the 14th to 17th centuries. With this lack of historical content, there is very limited archaeological evidence to work with. However, archaeologists have been able to determine that the sites were abandoned and then reoccupied later by different people.

====Foreign pressure====
The Ayutthaya Kingdom arose from a confederation of three city-states on the Lower Chao Phraya basin (Ayutthaya-Suphanburi-Lopburi). From the fourteenth century onward, Ayutthaya became Kambuja&#x27;s rival. Angkor was besieged by the Ayutthayan king Uthong in 1352, and following its capture the next year, the Khmer king was replaced with successive Siamese princes. Then in 1357, the Khmer king Suryavamsa Rajadhiraja retook the throne. In 1393, the Ayutthayan king Ramesuan besieged Angkor again, capturing it the next year. Ramesuan&#x27;s son ruled Kambuja for a short time before being assassinated. Finally, in 1431, the Khmer king Ponhea Yat abandoned Angkor as indefensible, and moved to the Phnom Penh area.

The new center of the Kambuja was in the southwest, at Oudong near present-day Phnom Penh. However, there are indications that Angkor was not completely abandoned. One line of Khmer kings may have remained there, while a second moved to Phnom Penh to establish a parallel kingdom. The final fall of Angkor would then be due to the transfer of economic– and therewith political– significance, as Phnom Penh became an important trade center on the Mekong. Severe droughts and ensuing floods were considered one of the contributing factors to its fall. The empire focused more on regional trade after the first drought.

====Ecological breakdown====
Ecological failure and infrastructural breakdown is an alternative theory regarding the end of Kambuja. Scientists working on the Greater Angkor Project believe that the Khmers had an elaborate system of reservoirs and canals used for trade, transportation, and irrigation. The canals were used for harvesting rice. As the population grew there was more strain on the water system. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, there were also severe climatic changes impacting the water management system.

Periods of drought led to decreases in agricultural productivity, and violent floods due to monsoons damaged the infrastructure during this vulnerable time. To adapt to the growing population, trees were cut down from the Kulen hills and cleared out for more rice fields. That created rain runoff carrying sediment to the canal network. Any damage to the water system would have enormous consequences.

====Plague====
The plague theory, which suggests a severe epidemic outbreak may have hit the heavily populated Angkor and contributed to the fall of the empire, has been reconsidered. By the 14th century, the Black Death had affected Asia, as the plague first appeared in China around 1330 and reached Europe around 1345. Most seaports along the line of travel from China to Europe felt the impact of the disease, which might have had a severe impact on life throughout Southeast Asia. Possible diseases include bubonic plague, smallpox, and malaria.

====Angkor after the 15th century====
There is evidence for a further period of use of Angkor after the 15th century. Under the rule of Khmer king Barom Reachea I (reigned 1566–1576), who temporarily succeeded in driving back Ayutthaya, the royal court was briefly returned to Angkor. Inscriptions from the 17th century testify to Japanese settlements alongside those of the remaining Khmer. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondayu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year in Angkor in 1632. However, in the following decades the Japanese community was absorbed into the local Khmer community, owing to a lack of new Japanese arrivals and thus little possibility of renewing their community.

==Culture and society==
Much of what is known about Kambuja comes from the bas-reliefs of Angkor&#x27;s temples and the first-hand accounts of Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan (&quot;The Customs of Cambodia&quot;), which provide information on 13th-century Cambodia and earlier. The bas-reliefs, such as those in the Bayon, describe everyday life in the ancient Khmer kingdom, including scenes of palace life, naval battles on the river and lakes, and common scenes of the marketplace.

===Economy and agriculture===
The ancient Khmers were a traditional agricultural community, relying heavily on rice farming. The farmers, who formed the majority of the kingdom&#x27;s population, planted rice near the banks of the lake or river, in the irrigated plains surrounding their villages, or in the hills when the lowlands were flooded. The rice paddies were irrigated by a massive and complex hydraulics system, including networks of canals and &quot;barays&quot;, or giant water reservoirs. This system enabled the formation of large-scale rice farming communities surrounding Khmer cities. Sugar palm trees, fruit trees, and vegetables were grown in the orchards by the villages, providing other sources of agricultural produce such as palm sugar, palm wine, coconut, various tropical fruits, and vegetables.

Located by the massive Tonlé Sap lake, and also near numerous rivers and ponds, many Khmer people relied on fresh water fisheries for their living. Fishing gave the population their main source of protein, which was turned into &quot;prahok&quot;– dried or roasted or steamed fish paste wrapped in banana leaves. Rice was the main staple along with fish. Other sources of protein included pigs, cattle, and poultry, which were kept under the farmers&#x27; houses, which were elevated on stilts to protect them from flooding.

The marketplace of Angkor contained no permanent buildings; it was an open square where the traders sat on the ground on woven straw mats and sold their wares. There were no tables or chairs. Some traders might be protected from the sun with a simple thatched parasol. A certain type of tax or rent was levied by officials for each space occupied by traders in the marketplace. The trade and economy in the Angkor marketplace were mainly run by women.

Zhou Daguan&#x27;s description of the women of Angkor:

The role of women in the trade and economy of Kambuja suggests that they enjoyed significant rights and freedom. Their practice of marrying early may have contributed to the high fertility rate and huge population of the kingdom.

===Society and politics===

Kambuja was founded upon extensive networks of agricultural rice farming communities. A distinct settlement hierarchy is present in the region. Small villages were clustered around regional centres, such as the one at Phimai, which in turn sent their goods to large cities like Angkor in return for other goods, such as pottery and foreign trade items from China. The king and his officials were in charge of irrigation management and water distribution, which consisted of an intricate series of hydraulics infrastructure, such as canals, moats, and massive reservoirs called &quot;barays&quot;.

Society was arranged in a hierarchy reflecting the Hindu caste system, where the commoners– rice farmers and fishermen – formed the large majority of the population. The kshatriyas– royalty, nobles, warlords, soldiers, and warriors– formed a governing elite and authorities. Other social classes included brahmins (priests), traders, artisans such as carpenters and stonemasons, potters, metalworkers, goldsmiths, and textile weavers, while on the lowest social level were slaves.

The extensive irrigation projects provided rice surpluses that could support a large population. The state religion was Hinduism but influenced by the cult of Devaraja, elevating the Khmer kings as possessing the divine quality of living gods on earth, attributed to the incarnation of Vishnu or Shiva. In politics, this status was viewed as the divine justification of a king&#x27;s rule. The cult enabled the Khmer kings to embark on massive architectural projects, constructing majestic monuments such as Angkor Wat and the Bayon to celebrate the king&#x27;s divine rule on earth.

The King was surrounded by ministers, state officials, nobles, royalties, palace women, and servants, all protected by guards and troops. The capital city of Angkor and the Khmer royal court are famous for grand ceremonies, with many festivals and rituals held in the city. Even when travelling, the King and his entourages created quite a spectacle, as described in Zhou Daguan&#x27;s accounts. Zhou Daguan&#x27;s description of a royal procession of Indravarman III is as follows:

Zhou Daguan&#x27;s description of the Khmer king&#x27;s wardrobe:

Khmer kings were often involved in series of wars and conquests. The large population of Angkor enabled the empire to support large free standing armies, which were sometimes deployed to conquer neighbouring princedoms or kingdoms. Series of conquests were led to expand the empire&#x27;s influence over areas surrounding Angkor and Tonle Sap, the Mekong valley and delta, and surrounding lands. Some Khmer kings embarked on military conquests and war against neighbouring Champa, Dai Viet, and Thai warlords. Khmer kings and royal families were also often involved in incessant power struggle over successions or rivalries over principalities.

===Military===

According to Zhou Daguan, who stayed in Yaśodharapura from 1296 to 1297, the Sukhothai Kingdom laid waste to Khmer lands in repeated wars. According to Zhou, the Khmer soldiers fought naked and barefoot, wielding only lance and shield. They did not use bows and arrows (though, in some instances, they used them in naval warfare), trebuchets, body armour, or helmets. When Sukhotai attacked, ordinary people were ordered to face them without strategy or preparation. The Khmer had double bow crossbows mounted on elephants, which Michel JacqHergoualc&#x27;h suggests were elements of Cham mercenaries in Jayavarman VII&#x27;s army.

In terms of fortifications, Zhou described Angkor Thom&#x27;s walls as being long in circumference with five gateways, each with two gates, surrounded by a large moat spanned by bridges. The walls, which formed an exact square, were made of stone and so tightly packed that no weeds grew from them. The walls were around 6–7 meters in height and sloped from the inside, thick enough to contain chambers, but with no battlements and only a single stone tower on each of the four sides. Guards operated them, but dogs were not allowed on the walls. According to an oral tradition told to Henri Mouhot, Kambuja had a standing army of 5 to 6 million soldiers.

===Culture and way of life===

Zhou Daguan&#x27;s description of Khmer houses:

Houses of farmers were situated near the rice paddies on the edge of the cities. The walls of the houses were made of woven bamboo, with thatched roofs, and they were on stilts. A house was divided into three rooms by woven bamboo walls. One was the parents&#x27; bedroom, another was the daughters&#x27; bedroom, and the largest was the living area. Sons slept wherever they could find space. The kitchen was at the back or in a separate room. Nobles and kings lived in the palace and much larger houses in the city. They were made of the same materials as the farmers&#x27; houses, but the roofs were wooden shingles and had elaborate designs as well as more rooms.

Zhou Daguan reported that locals do not produce silk or have the ability to stitch and darn with a needle and thread.

The common people wore a sampot where the front end was drawn between the legs and secured at the back by a belt. Nobles and kings wore finer and richer fabrics. Women wore a strip of cloth to cover the chest, while noble women had a lengthened one that went over the shoulder. Men and women wore a Krama. Along with depictions of battle and the military conquests of kings, the basreliefs of the Bayon depict the mundane everyday life of common Khmer people, including scenes of the marketplace, fishermen, butchers, people playing a chess-like game, and gambling during cockfighting.

===Religion===
The main religion was Hinduism, followed by Buddhism in popularity. Initially, the kingdom revered Hinduism as the main state religion. Vishnu and Shiva were the most revered deities, worshipped in Khmer Hindu temples. Temples such as Angkor Wat are actually known as &quot;Phitsanulok &quot; (&quot;Vara Vishnuloka&quot; in Sanskrit) or the realm of Vishnu, to honor the posthumous King Suryavarman II as Vishnu.

Hindu ceremonies and rituals performed by Brahmins (Hindu priests), usually only held among the ruling elites of the king&#x27;s family, nobles, and the ruling class. The empire&#x27;s official religions included Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism until Theravada Buddhism prevailed, even among the lower classes, after its introduction from Sri Lanka in the 13th century.

===Art and architecture===

Zhou Daguan&#x27;s description on the Angkor Royal Palace:

Kambuja produced numerous temples and majestic monuments to celebrate the divine authority of Khmer kings. Khmer architecture reflects the Hindu belief that the temple was built to recreate the abode of Hindu gods, Mount Meru, with its five peaks and surrounded by seas represented by ponds and moats. The early Khmer temples built in the Angkor region and the Bakong temple in Hariharalaya (Roluos) employed stepped pyramid structures to represent the sacred temple-mountain.

Khmer art and architecture reached their aesthetic and technical peak with the construction of the majestic temple Angkor Wat. Other temples are also constructed in the Angkor region, such as Ta Phrom and the Bayon. The construction of the temple demonstrates the artistic and technical achievements of Kambuja through its architectural mastery of stone masonry.

==Relations with regional powers==

During the formation of the empire, the Khmer had close cultural, political, and trade relations with Java and with the Srivijaya Empire that lay beyond Khmer&#x27;s southern seas. In 851 a Persian merchant named Sulaiman al-Tajir recorded an incident involving a Khmer king and a Maharaja of Zabaj. He described the story of a Khmer king who defied the power of Maharaja of Zabaj. It was said that the Javanese Sailendras staged a surprise attack on the Khmers by approaching the capital from the river. The young king was later punished by the Maharaja, and subsequently the kingdom became a vassal of the Sailendra dynasty.

Zabaj is the Arabic form of Javaka and might refer to Java or Srivijaya. The legend probably describes the predecessor or initial stage of the Kambuja under Javanese dominion. The Legend of the Maharaja of Zabaj was later published by the historian Masoudi in his 947 book, &quot;Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems.&quot; The Kaladi inscription of Java ( 909) mentioned &quot;Kmir&quot; (Khmer people or Cambodian) together with &quot;Campa&quot; (Champa) and &quot;Rman&quot; (Mon) as foreigners from mainland Southeast Asia who frequently came to Java to trade. The inscription suggests a maritime trade network had been established between Kambuja and Java (Mdang kingdom).

In 916 CE, Arab historian Abu Zaid Hasan recorded in a lengthy chronicle that the young, inexperienced king of Khmer, is hostile to Java. When the hostility becomes state policy and is known publicly, the king of Java attacked and captured the Khmer king. He was beheaded and the head brought to Java. The king of Java ordered the minister of Khmer Empire to seek the successor. After being cleaned and embalmed, the head of the king was put in a vase and sent to the new Khmer king.

Throughout its history, the empire also was involved in series of wars and rivalries with the neighbouring kingdoms of Champa, Tambralinga, and Đại Việt– and later in its history with Siamese Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. The Khmer Empire&#x27;s relations with its eastern neighbor Champa was exceptionally intense, as both sides struggled for domination in the region. The Cham fleet raided Angkor in 1177, and in 1203 the Khmer managed to push back and defeat Champa.

Arab writers of the 9th and 10th century hardly mention the region for anything other than its perceived backwardness, but they considered the king of Al-Hind (India and Southeast Asia) one of the four great kings in the world. The ruler of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty is described as the greatest king of Al-Hind, but even the lesser kings of Al-Hind including the kings of Java, Pagan Burma, and the Khmer kings of Cambodia are invariably depicted by the Arabs as extremely powerful and as being equipped with vast armies of men, horses, and often tens of thousands of elephants. They were also known to have been in possession of vast treasures of gold and silver. The Khmer rulers established relations with the Chola dynasty of South India.

The Khmer Empire seems to have maintained contact with Chinese dynasties; spanning from the late Tang period to the Yuan period. The relations with the Yuan dynasty was of great historical significance, since it produced &quot;The Customs of Cambodia&quot; (), an important insight into the Khmer Empire&#x27;s daily life, culture and society. The report was written between 1296 and 1297 by the Yuan diplomat Zhou Daguan, sent by Temür Khan of Yuan dynasty to stay in Angkor.

Beginning in the 13th century, Khmer&#x27;s relations with the Siamese were difficult and bitter, resulting in rivalry and hostility for centuries. In August 1296, Zhou Daguan recorded that in the recent war with the Siamese, the country was utterly devastated. This report confirmed that by the late 13th century, the Siamese warlords had revolted and disrupted the Khmer empire&#x27;s hegemony, starting Siam&#x27;s rise. By the 14th century, the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom became the Khmer empire&#x27;s formidable rival, as Angkor was besieged and captured twice by Ayutthayan Siamese invaders in 1353 and 1394. Being the successor to the former Khmer dependency of Lavo (Lopburi), Ayutthaya also inherited traditions of Khmer prestige and statecraft. Unlike earlier Tai polities that had a relatively flat hierarchy, Ayutthaya adopted Angkor&#x27;s more complex social stratification, the deification of kings &quot;(Devaraja)&quot; as well as Khmer honorifics and elaborate Brahmanic rituals. Specialist staff in early Ayutthaya, like scribes, court Brahmans, jurists, chamberlains, accountants, physicians and astrologers, usually came from the Khmer-speaking elites of city-states in the eastern Chaophraya Basin that had been under the influence of the Khmer Empire.

In the 1300s, the Lao prince Fa Ngum was exiled to live in the royal court of Angkor. His father-in-law, the King of Cambodia, gave him a Khmer army to create a buffer state in what is now Laos. Fa Ngum conquered local principalities and established the Kingdom of Lan Xang. With the assistance of Khmer scholars, Fa Ngum introduced Theravada Buddhism and the culture of the Khmer Empire to the region.

A Javanese source, the Nagarakretagama canto 15, composed in 1365 in the Majapahit Empire, claimed Java had established diplomatic relations with &quot;Kambuja&quot; (Cambodia) together with &quot;Syangkayodhyapura&quot; (Ayutthaya), &quot;Dharmmanagari&quot; (Negara Sri Dharmaraja), &quot;Rajapura&quot; (Ratchaburi) and &quot;Singhanagari&quot; (Songkla), &quot;Marutma&quot; (Martaban or Mottama, Southern Myanmar), &quot;Champa&quot;, and &quot;Yawana&quot; (Annam). This record describes the political situations in Mainland Southeast Asia in the mid-14th century; although the Cambodian polity still survived, the rise of Siamese Ayutthaya had taken its toll. Finally, the empire fell, marked by the abandonment of Angkor for Phnom Penh in 1431, caused by Siamese pressure.

<doc id="222434" wikidata="Q2298491" url="?curid=222434" title="Table of divisors">
<text>The tables below list all of the divisors of the numbers 1 to 1000.

A divisor of an integer &quot;n&quot; is an integer &quot;m&quot;, for which &quot;n&quot;/&quot;m&quot; is again an integer (which is necessarily also a divisor of &quot;n&quot;). For example, 3 is a divisor of 21, since 21/7 = 3 (and therefore 7 is also a divisor of 21).

If &quot;m&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot;, then so is −&quot;m&quot;. The tables below only list positive divisors.

== Key to the tables ==

*&quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the number of positive divisors of &quot;n&quot;, including 1 and &quot;n&quot; itself
*σ(&quot;n&quot;) is the sum of the positive divisors of &quot;n&quot;, including 1 and &quot;n&quot; itself
*&quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the sum of the proper divisors of &quot;n&quot;, including 1 but not &quot;n&quot; itself; that is, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = σ(&quot;n&quot;) − &quot;n&quot;
*a deficient number is greater than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &lt; &quot;n&quot;
*a perfect number equals the sum of its proper divisors; that is, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;
*an abundant number is lesser than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; &quot;n&quot;
*a highly abundant number has a sum of positive divisors that is greater than any lesser number; that is, σ(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; σ(&quot;m&quot;) &quot;for every positive integer m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;. Counterintuitively, the first seven &quot;highly abundant&quot; numbers are not &quot;abundant&quot; numbers.
*a prime number has only 1 and itself as divisors; that is, &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 2
*a composite number has more than just 1 and itself as divisors; that is, &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; 2
*a highly composite number has a number of positive divisors that is greater than any lesser number; that is, &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; &quot;d&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) &quot;for every positive integer m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;. Counterintuitively, the first two &quot;highly composite&quot; numbers are not &quot;composite&quot; numbers.
*a superior highly composite number has a ratio between its number of divisors and itself raised to some positive power that equals or is greater than any other number; that is, &quot;there exists some ε such that&quot; formula_1 &quot;for every other positive integer m&quot;
*a primitive abundant number is an &quot;abundant&quot; number whose proper divisors are all &quot;deficient&quot; numbers or they are &quot;abundant&quot; numbers with no abundant proper divisors
*a weird number is an &quot;abundant&quot; number that is not semiperfect; that is, &quot;no subset of the proper divisors of n sum to n&quot;

<text>Taha al-Hashimi (; born 1888, died 1961) was an Iraqi politician and served as Prime Minister of Iraq in 1941.

==Biography==
Al-Hashimi was born in Baghdad in 1888. After his religious education he attended a primary school. He graduated from a military secondary school in 1903. Then he attended the Military College in Istanbul and graduated in 1906. Following his graduation he joined the Ottoman army as an officer. He became a captain in 1909 after completing his studies at the General Staff College.

Al-Hashimi served briefly as the prime minister of Iraq for two months, from 1 February 1941, to 2 May 1941. He was appointed prime minister by the regent, &#x27;Abd al-Ilah, following the first ouster of the pro-Axis government of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani during World War II. When Abdul-Illah fled the country, fearing an assassination attempt, Hashimi resigned, and the government reverted to Gaylani. His brother, Yassin, was the Iraqi prime minister in 1924 and in 1936.

<doc id="222438" wikidata="Q3336983" url="?curid=222438" title="Basque nationalism">
<text>Basque nationalism ( ; ; ) is a form of nationalism that asserts that Basques, an ethnic group indigenous to the western Pyrenees, are a nation and promotes the political unity of the Basques, today scattered between Spain and France. Since its inception in the late 19th century, Basque nationalism has included movements supportive of Basque independence.

Basque nationalism, spanning three different regions in two states (the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in Spain, and the French Basque Country in France), is &quot;irredentist in nature&quot; as it favours political unification of all the Basque-speaking provinces.

==History==

===Fueros and Carlism===

Basque nationalism is rooted in Carlism and the loss, by the laws of 1839 and 1876, of the Ancien Régime relationship between the Spanish Basque provinces and the crown of Spain. During this period, the reactionary and the liberal brand of the pro-&quot;fueros&quot; movement pleaded for the maintenance of the fueros system and territorial autonomy against the centralizing pressures from liberal or conservative governments in Madrid. The Spanish government suppressed the &quot;fueros&quot; after the Third Carlist War.

The fueros were the native decision making and justice system issued from consuetudinary law prevailing in the Basque territories and Pyrenees. They are first recorded in the Kingdom of Navarre, confirming its charter system also across the western Basque territories during the High Middle Ages. In the wake of Castile&#x27;s conquest of Gipuzkoa, Álava and Durango (1200), the fueros were partially ratified by the kings of Castile and acted as part of the Basque legal system dealing with matters regarding the political ties of the Basque districts with the crown. The Fueros guaranteed the Basques a separate position in Spain with their own tax and political status. While its corpus is extensive, prerogatives contained in them set out for one that Basques were not subject to direct levee to the Castilian army, although many volunteered.

===Sabino Arana===
The native Basque institutions and laws were abolished in 1876 after the Third Carlist War (called the Second in the Basque context), and replaced by the Basque Economic Agreements. The levelling process with other Spanish regions disquieted the Basques. According to Sabino Arana&#x27;s views, the Biscayan (and Basque) personality was being diluted in the idea of an exclusive Spanish nation fostered by centralist authorities in Madrid. Arana was inspired by his brother Luis, a co-designer of the Basque flag &quot;ikurriña&quot; (1895), and a major nationalist figure after Sabino&#x27;s death (1903).

Arana felt that not only the Basque personality was endangered but also its former religious institutions, like Church or the Society of Jesus, which still often spoke in Basque to its parishioners, unlike school or administration. Sabino characterized Catholicism as a sort of shelter for Basque personality. This became a point of contention with other personalities holding like views and clustering around Arana&#x27;s manifesto &quot;Bizkaya por su independencia&quot; (1892). Later industrialist and prominent Basque nationalist Ramon de la Sota dismissed Sabino&#x27;s positions of Catholicism as inherent to the national issue.

In 1893, the Gamazada popular uprising erupted in Navarre against the breach by the Spanish government of several foundations of the treaties ending the Carlist Wars (1841, 1876). Arana eagerly supported the Navarrese outbreak by travelling to the territory and participating. The widespread protest in Navarre sparked solidarity in Biscay. In 1893, after a support meeting held in Gernika attended by pro-&quot;fueros&quot; personalities, a group led by Arana overtly blamed Spain for the current state of matters, going on to set a Spanish flag ablaze. This rebellion, called the &quot;Sanrocada&quot;, is held as the beginning of political Basque nationalism.

In 1895, the Basque Nationalist Party was founded around Arana (PNV in its Spanish acronym, EAJ in Basque). His nationalism shifted from a focus on Biscay to the rest of Basque territories. The program of Arana was specified as follows:

By the end of the 19th century, Arana differed clearly from the Carlists, his initial background. He accompanied his views with an ideology centred on the purity of the Basque race and its alleged moral supremacy over other Spaniards (a derivation of the system of &quot;limpieza de sangre&quot; of Modern-Age Spain), and deep opposition to the mass-immigration of other Spaniards to the Basque Country. The immigration had started after the Industrial Revolutions boom of manufacturing related to the ore exportation to England and privatization of communal lands and exploitations (mines) as the &quot;fueros&quot; were lost.

Arana died in 1903 months after releasing a controversial manifesto renouncing his former tenets while in prison for supporting Cuban independence, and just months after the Basque leader congratulated US president Theodore Roosevelt for its support to Cuba. The nature of that document is still subject to discussion. Luis Arana took the reins of the Basque Nationalist Party.

In the early 20th century, Basque nationalism, developed from a nucleus of enthusiasts (non-native Basque speakers themselves) in Bilbao to incorporate the agrarian Carlists in Biscay, and Gipuzkoa. The seeds of Seminal Basque nationalism bloomed also in Navarre and Álava early on (Aranzadi, Irujo, Agirre, etc.) on the heat of the &quot;Gamazada&quot; (1893-1894).

===Modern history===

The movement survived without major problems the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera under the guise of cultural and athletic associations. The Basque Nationalist Party split in the early 20s, and &quot;Comunión Nacionalista Vasca&quot; was created. Basque nationalists allied with Carlism in support of the Catholic Church as a barrier against leftist anti-clericalism in most of the Basque provinces, although alliances started to change with the coming of the Second Spanish Republic (1931).

By the start of the Second Spanish Republic, a small cluster of secularist Basque nationalists had sown the seeds of the EAE-ANV, while PNV clung to its traditionalist Catholicism. However, failure by a Carlist faction to back up the Basque statute in 1932 and the radicalization of their anti-Republican discourse, opened the Basque nationalists to new alliances with Republican and leftist parties, gradually shifting to a Christian-Democrat position willing to some sort of compromise with the left.

In 1936, the main part of the Christian-Democrat PNV sided with the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War. The promise of autonomy was valued over the ideological differences, especially on the religious matter, and PNV decided to support the legal republican government. After stopping the far-right military rebels in Intxorta (Biscay-Gipuzkoa border), autonomy was achieved in October 1936. A republican autonomous Basque government was established, with José Antonio Agirre (PNV) as Lehendakari (president) and ministers from the PNV and other republican parties (mainly leftist Spanish parties).

However, in 1937, roughly halfway through the war, Basque troops, then under control of the Autonomous Basque Government surrendered in an action brokered by the Basque church and the Vatican in Santoña to the Italian allies of General Franco on condition that the Basque heavy industry and economy was left untouched.

For many leftists in Spain, the surrender of Basque troops in Santoña (Santander) is known as the &quot;Treason of Santoña&quot;. Many of the nationalist Basque soldiers were pardoned if they joined the Francoist army in the rest of the Northern front. Basque nationalists submitted, went underground, or were sent to prison, and the movement&#x27;s political leaders fled. Small groups escaped to the Americas, France and Benelux, of which only a minority returned after the restoration of democracy in Spain in the late seventies, or before.

During World War II, the exiled PNV government attempted to join the Allies and settled itself in New York to gain American recognition and support, but soon after the war finished, Franco became an American ally in the context of the Cold War, depriving the PNV of any chance of power in the Basque Country.

===Political violence and devolved autonomy===
In 1959, young nationalists (abertzaleak) founded the separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA; &quot;Basque Homeland and Liberty&quot;). Its activism—paintings, pitching Basque flags, pamphlets—escalated into violence after shocking revelations emerged of torture practised by Spanish police on Basque activists during repression in the mid 1960s. By that time, ETA was adopting a Marxist revolutionary theory. Inspired by movements like those of Fidel Castro in Cuba and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, the group aimed to establish an independent socialist Basque Country through violence. ETA&#x27;s first confirmed assassinations occurred in 1968, thereafter including violence, even killing, as a practice—theory of action-repression-action. At an ideological level, instead of race, the organization stressed the importance of language and customs.

When Spain re-emerged as a democracy in 1978, autonomy was restored to the Basques, who achieved a degree of self-government without precedent in modern Basque history. Thus, based on the &quot;fueros&quot; and their Statute of Autonomy, Basques have their own police corps and manage their own public finances. The Basque Autonomous Community has been led by the nationalist and Christian Democratic PNV since it was reinstated in the early 1980s, except in the period 2009–2012, when the PSE-EE led the regional government. The left-wing Basque independentist EH Bildu has been the main opposition party since its formation in 2012.

In Navarre, traditionally, Basque nationalism did not manage to reach the government of the autonomous community, the latter being usually controlled by the Navarrese regionalists of the UPN, often with the support of the PSN, but Basque nationalist parties ran many small and medium-sized town councils, where most ethnic basques and basque speakers are located. In 2015, Uxue Barkos became the first Basque nationalist president of Navarre with her coalition Geroa Bai, which includes the PNV, and since 2019 has been part of subsequent PSN governments. EH Bildu has also notably grown its influence in the region, taking over the mayoralty of Pamplona in 2023, and being key in the Navarrese parliament.

Although France is a centralized state, Abertzaleen Batasuna, a Basque nationalist party, maintained a presence in some municipalities through local elections until late 2000s. In 2007, the Basque nationalist electoral coalition and later political party Euskal Herria Bai was formed. They obtained regional representation in 2015, and in 2024 they obtained one seat in the National Assembly, as a part of the New Popular Front.

<text>Star Fleet Battles (SFB) is a tactical board wargame set in an offshoot of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; setting called the Star Fleet Universe. Originally created in 1979 by Stephen V. Cole, it has had four major editions. The current edition is published by Amarillo Design Bureau as &quot;Star Fleet Battles, Captain&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

&quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; is a ship-to-ship warfare simulation game, which uses cardboard counters to represent the ships, shuttles, seeking weapons, terrain, and information on a hexagonal map. It is a game system for two or more players (there are some solitaire scenarios). Typically, a player will have one ship in a game, though they can control an entire fleet, if they can keep track of the paperwork and options involved; multiple players can play as teams, with each team splitting up the work of running a squadron or fleet, or a &#x27;free-for-all&#x27; fight can be run. Ships represented in the game are typically starships from such classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; powers as the Federation, Romulan Star Empire, Klingon Empire, or purely Star Fleet Universe creations such as the Hydran Kingdom or Interstellar Concordium.

The game system uses an impulse-based turn system, which is a departure from the traditional I-Go You-Go alternating system used by most wargames. A ship&#x27;s speed determines how often and when it can move based on a 32 impulse movement chart. Generally, a unit only moves one hex at a time, making 32 the maximum &#x27;speed&#x27; in the game. Similar systems are used in games such as Steve Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Car Wars&quot; (which uses a 5 phase system) and is designed to more realistically simulate unit movement in an environment where the units can move a great distance in the time needed for non-movement functions (like weapons fire) to occur.

==Overview==

&quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; was based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe as of 1979 and includes elements of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. Federation elements were heavily based on concepts from &quot;The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot;. Unlike the mainstream &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; seems to consider some, but not all of &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, as being a canon material source, thus leading to the inclusion of aliens such as the Kzinti.

Since the first publication of the game, &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe have diverged considerably as the authors of the game and those of the films and television series have basically ignored each other. The resulting divergent world of &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; is known as the &quot;Star Fleet Universe&quot;.

There are several notable games set in this universe, including the video game series &quot;Starfleet Command&quot; (which combines parts of SFU with parts of canon Star Trek), the role-playing game setting &quot;Prime Directive&quot;, (currently available for the &quot;GURPS&quot; and d20 systems), the card game &quot;Star Fleet Battle Force&quot;, and the strategy game &quot;Federation and Empire&quot;, as well as the recently released &quot;Federation Commander&quot;.

The license &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; operates under does not allow for direct reference to the characters and detailed events of the &quot;Original Series&quot;. As such, official material does not include references to Kirk, Spock or use the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; directly, though the latter is included in ship listings. This has not prevented oblique references, such as a comment about the first Gorn-Federation meeting as involving “two young captains who fired first, and faced embarrassing questions later.” Other references are monster scenarios loosely based on the planet killer from &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; and the space amoeba from &quot;The Immunity Syndrome&quot;.

==History==

===Pocket Edition===
&quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; was originally published as a &#x27;pocket-game&#x27; in a ziplock bag as &quot;Task Force Game #4&quot; by Task Force Games in 1979. Steve Cole later recalled:
The design of &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; began during 1975... Jim Brown... and I were playing a lot of &quot;Jutland&quot;... One afternoon I was studying the &quot;Jutland&quot; battle that was in progress on my floor (left from the previous evening) when the [&quot;Star Trek&quot;] re-run of the day came on. I began to consider the possibility of doing a space game on the &quot;Jutland&quot; system. JagdPanther was in operation at the time, and I had vague thoughts that I could somehow get a license for the game.
By the time Jim came by to collect me for dinner, I had a Federation CA and a Klingon D7 fighting it out. In the brief space of an hour long re-run, I had two SSD&#x27;s, the proportional movement system, and the charts for phasers and disruptor bolts. All were to change drastically within a week and were to continue evolving for five years, but the start was made.

The company JagdPanther closed down before &quot;SFB&quot; was finished, but the game was not forgotten, and when Steve Cole and Allen Eldridge decided to start a new company (Task Force Games) &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; was one of several half-finished designs proposed to be published by them.

While the initial format was small, and the number of ships limited, the game was still not &quot;simple&quot;. This was dictated in part by a desire to do the &quot;definitive Star Fleet game&quot;. This meant that it included as much detail as possible from all the source material available. In the mid-70s, this meant the original two series and a number of fan publications. Except for &quot;The Original Series&quot; itself, none of these materials are considered canon today, but at the time, they were all considered fairly authoritative, especially the &quot;Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot; by Franz Joseph, which had originally been blessed by Gene Roddenberry, and from whom Steve Cole got the license to do a &quot;Star Trek&quot; game.

Elements of these almost forgotten fan productions shaped many aspects of the game. The &quot;Technical Manual&quot; itself decided the main functions of the Federation Heavy Cruiser, and what other Federation ships looked like. A set of blueprints (probably those drawn by Michael McMaster in 1975) showed the Klingon D7 as having &quot;more&quot; phasers than the Heavy Cruiser, and disruptors mounted on the engines. The latter became a common feature of Klingon shipbuilding, and the former led to the idea of less powerful phasers for the Klingons. The same blueprints also stated that an older, slightly inferior version of the D7, the D6, was what was sold to the Romulans, and the D7/D6 dichotomy has been at the heart of the Klingon fleet in the game ever since. Two of the novels gave mention of a phaser being mounted on shuttlecraft. This was included, as much to give a reason to use shuttles as anything else. This proved to be the wedge that allowed the introduction of fighters to the game; a feature popular with many players, but also led many to believe that &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; was no longer &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

===Designer&#x27;s Edition===
Later in 1979, &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; was re-released in a boxed set known as the &quot;Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot;. The original plan had been to produce &quot;three interlocking games, all to be published in the &#x27;pocket&#x27; format. When &#x27;completed&#x27; this trilogy would cover the entire system.&quot;

However, the real reason for this plan was that it had been impossible to acquire boxes at an affordable price. When a source of boxes was found, it was decided to do a revised, expanded version instead. The box contained about twice as many ships and scenarios as the original Pocket Edition, and was expanded upon itself by three expansions in the same zip-lock format as the original (named &quot;Star Fleet Battles Expansion #1&quot;, &quot;Expansion #2&quot;, and &quot;Expansion #3&quot;), all of which were reviewed in issues of The Space Gamer.

These expansions rapidly added many new ships and concepts to the system which are parts of it to this day: The Hydrans, Andromedans and Lyrans were introduced as new empires that fielded novel technologies peculiar to themselves. All the races were issued a full complement of ship classes, particularly dreadnoughts, fleet tugs and scouts, which in the Designer Edition only the Federation and Klingons deployed. Notably, only the Klingon Empire built the superheavy &#x27;Battleship&#x27; B10 class (in the Captain&#x27;s Edition Module R5 the other races were presented with conjectural i.e. non-historical battleship designs). Heavy cruisers, the starship class the game was based on, were supplemented by &#x27;wartime construction cruisers&#x27; (simply called &#x27;war cruisers&#x27;), relatively inexpensive substitutes built on light cruiser hulls yet packing the firepower of their larger stablemates. All fleets deployed &#x27;Command Cruisers&#x27; which were heavy cruisers with additional weapons and power, and some races deployed &#x27;Leader&#x27; versions of smaller classes, such as destroyers or frigates. Carrier starships with attack shuttles (usually called fighters) became common throughout the Alpha Quadrant; in the Designer Edition the Attack Shuttle Carrier was unique to the Kzinti Hegemony. In the final years of the General War so-called &#x27;Pseudo-Fighters&#x27; (later renamed &#x27;fast patrol&#x27; ships; but retaining the &#x27;PF&#x27; designation) were expendable &#x27;attrition units&#x27; (like attack shuttles/fighters but larger with their own ship system displays) that operated from tenders, bases, or planets and hunted in flotillas of six. &#x27;X-ships&#x27; or &#x27;up-rated cruisers&#x27; featured altogether new technologies (like fast-loading torpedoes, overloaded phasers, oversize warp engines and high-capacity battery reserve power) based on the new versions of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and Klingon battlecruisers seen in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;.

All races built &#x27;Battle Stations&#x27;, which were upgrades to the Base Stations deployed on territorial borders that were presented in the Pocket Edition (for their Starbases, each race used a modified generic SSD in the Designer Edition). Each race also received auxiliary units that used generic SSDs, such as police ships, freighters, Q-ships, Fleet Repair Docks and minelayers, for which comprehensive mine warfare rules were introduced. Until that point, the only mines were the Romulan-unique “nuclear space mine” (NSM) and the smaller “transporter bomb” (T-bomb) used by all races.

Many things were re-written, and each expansion included new elements that impacted how previous rules interacted, demanding a great deal of errata and making the entire system something of a jumble. &quot;It was clear that issuing yet another &#x27;expansion kit&#x27; that devoted half of its space to correcting previous products was not the answer.&quot;

===Commander&#x27;s Edition===

&quot;Commander&#x27;s Edition&quot; was, effectively, a ground-up rewrite of the rules. The old rule-number system was discarded in favor of a completely new alpha-numeric system. The three Expansions were scrapped and re-packaged. However, other than the new (bigger) reorganized rulebook, the initial 1983 release of the boxed set was mostly unchanged from the &quot;Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, including the box (later printings labeled it &quot;Star Fleet Battles: Volume I&quot;). The separate &quot;Star Fleet Battles Commander&#x27;s Rulebook&quot; was also available for previous owners of &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;, with a &quot;Volume II&quot; following in 1984.

Most of the material (including the new empires) from the Expansions was reorganized and released as &quot;Volume II&quot;. The bulk of the fighter rules were in &quot;Supplement #1&quot;, X-ships (now redone &quot;not&quot; to be based on &quot;ST:TMP&quot; and divided into two &quot;generations&quot;) were in &quot;Supplement #2&quot;, and PFs (now renamed as Fast Patrol ships) were in &quot;Supplement #3&quot;.

From there, &quot;Commander&#x27;s Edition&quot; came out with new products for the next half-decade or so. Two &quot;Reinforcements&quot; packs allowed the purchase of extra counters. &quot;Volume III&quot; added the Interstellar Concordium and the Neo-Tholians, as well as new ships and new concepts (such as heavy fighters). &quot;&quot; magazine was launched as a house organ for Task Force Games, and featured a regular &quot;SFB&quot; section which presented new material like scenarios, rules errata, and input and feedback from players. Similar material was also published in ADB&#x27;s in-house (but widely distributed) Starletter newsletter from 1982.

Of lasting importance was the launch of &quot;Captain&#x27;s Log&quot;, a continuing semi-periodical journal dedicated to &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; that is still running. It was noteworthy that the game developers at ADB were very receptive to input and feedback from SFB gamers. For instance there were complaints that the Hydran Fusion Beam was too weak, and so the game designers changed the rules so that charged Fusion Beams could be held over from turn to turn. Another example was the many complaints that Plasma Torpedoes were too unwieldy to use as seeking weapons, and so the rules were amended to allow Plasma Torpedoes to fire as direct-fire weapons (the Plasma Bolt).

The &#x27;Commander&#x27;s SSD&#x27; (Ship System Display) was introduced. SSDs had just been a half-sheet diagram of the ship&#x27;s systems. Some combined ship classes that were differentiated using shaded boxes which were to be ignored to represent the smaller ship class (for instance the Klingon D6 and D7 cruisers were presented on the same SSD sheet with shaded boxes indicating the phasers and shield boxes that the D6 lacked). The new Commander&#x27;s style SSDs (which did not appear in &quot;Volume I&quot; or &quot;II&quot;) took a full sheet and included extra record-keeping information, such as tracks for drone ammo and shuttles, and firing charts for all the weapons on the ship. A line of nine &quot;Commander&#x27;s SSD Books&quot; were produced, the first few of which were mostly involved presenting new-style SSDs for the older ships, the last several of which had all new material.

During this entire period, there had been a constant stream of Errata, and later Addenda (which amounted to the same thing). For a long time, the vast majority of the mail received was from the top few fanatical &quot;SFB&quot; players, who constantly campaigned for new rules, rules fixes, and rules changes. This became a source of discontent for most of the rest of the players, who did not appreciate a game that changed every few months, and needed a sheaf of notes along with the voluminous rules. However, it was generally believed nearly impossible to repair the damage by properly re-writing and re-integrating such a large and complex system into a new edition before doomsday, especially without bringing the product line to a halt while only new versions of old products were released.

===Doomsday===
For a long time the &#x27;Doomsday Edition&#x27; was a private joke amongst the staff that worked on &quot;SFB&quot;. Then it became a public one. Finally, it became an actual project in 1987, and the &#x27;Doomsday Edition&#x27; was released as &quot;Star Fleet Battles, Captain&#x27;s Edition&quot; in 1990.
The long gestation, however, did give us time to plan an all-new edition. The publisher insisted that we should reorganize the game system into entirely new products. This was necessary to present the material to an entirely new generation of gamers in a more logical format (and to make dealers notice that it was a &quot;new&quot; edition).

The changes were sweeping. There were two boxed sets (in a smaller format than former boxes), the first of which, &quot;Basic Set&quot;, was roughly the same as &quot;Volume I&quot;. The second, &quot;Advanced Missions&quot; was different in that it only introduced new rules and ship types (more ships than any other single product in fact), but stayed with the same selection of basic empires as the first box. Nearly everything else is labeled &quot;Module x&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is a letter (and number, in a series), along with a name, and comes as a booklet of rules and a booklet of SSDs, with a sheet of counters and a color wrapper as the cover. The new empires of &quot;Volume II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; were presented in &quot;Module C1&quot; and &quot;C2&quot;.

Captain&#x27;s Log #8 devoted a substantial amount of space to explanations of exactly what the new edition meant, and how the new products would work. The release of &#x27;Doomsday&#x27; was split into five phases:

:Phase I was the &quot;Basic Set&quot; itself, which had been released before Captain&#x27;s Log #8.

:Phase II included &quot;Advanced Missions&quot;, &quot;C1&quot;, and &quot;C2&quot;. It also included several limited-run products that were meant purely to ease the transition for older players. The main one had the rulebooks from all the Phase I and Phase II products, so veteran players could get all the new rules without having to re-purchase the other parts. These were released in late 1990 and early 1991.

:Phase III was &quot;Module J&quot; and &quot;K&quot;, effectively updates of &quot;Supplement #1&quot; and &quot;#3&quot;. Both of these were released in 1991.

:Phase IV updated the &quot;Commander&#x27;s SSD Books&quot; into &quot;Modules R1-4&quot;. The twelve empires of the previous edition were divided into three groups of four, and their remaining ships were put into &quot;R2-4&quot;; &quot;R1&quot; had generic units and play aids. These were released in 1992. &quot;R1&quot; was actually the last one released, and came after the first of the new &quot;Captain&#x27;s Edition&quot; products.

:Phase V was a promise to continue developing new products once the transition to &quot;Captain&#x27;s Edition&quot; was complete.

And the biggest change was: &quot;We&#x27;ll explain everything, but we won&#x27;t &quot;change&quot; anything!&quot; Doomsday promised an end to addenda. Loopholes might be closed, new things might still be added, but no previous rule would &quot;change&quot; as a result.

===Interregnum===
The new edition was a success, but could not stop the march of time. Wargaming as a whole had been on the decline since about 1980, and Task Force Games joined the list of established gaming companies that did not survive the &#x27;90s. The decline of TFG was gradual, and &quot;SFB&quot; suffered long before the company actually folded:
Ultimately, however, the publisher was battered by market forces, a few bad decisions, and perhaps a lack of focus. The game system more or less disappeared from the market by the end of 1996 when ADB was unable to design new games without being paid for the previous ones. Two years of tedious negotiations were completed in January 1999 and Amarillo Design Bureau, Inc. was born.
Since very early on, the publishing duties and design duties had actually been split, with the Amarillo Design Bureau (ADB) handling all of the product design, while TFG had published, and indicated what they wanted to produce. The end of TFG put everything under one house again, and ADB, Inc. spent some time picking up the pieces of nearly three years without &quot;SFB&quot;. The first order of business, in fact, was to reprint &quot;Basic Set&quot; and &quot;Advanced Missions&quot; which had been out of stock for about three years at this point. While they were at it, all the errata and questions were evaluated, and many sections of the rules were re-written in an effort to make the game clearer. These editions featured new cover colors and a &#x27;1999&#x27; legend at the bottom of the cover to show when they were printed.

The time period between the last products from TFG, and ADB&#x27;s announcement that they had re-secured the rights to the system were not entirely without new material. Bruce Graw published &quot;Star Fleet Times&quot; as an &quot;SFB&quot; newsletter about ten times a year, mostly during what was afterward called &#x27;The Interregnum&#x27;. Its run ended with issue 50 in 2000, as it was considered that the internet served the same purpose (a regular way for the fans to keep in touch) much more efficiently.

===SFBOL and Print On Demand===
Since then, ADB, Inc. has gotten everything back in print, released a number of new products, and has seen the number of SFB players slowly grow again. This is in part due to the fact that it has a strong on-line community, encouraged by the company forum, and the existence of &quot;SFBOL&quot;.

&quot;Star Fleet Battles On-Line&quot; is a subscription online client that allows a person to play &quot;SFB&quot; against other people on the internet. While it does still require a personal understanding of the rules to play, the client does contain all the record-keeping functions of the game, and provides for some easier handling of places that require &#x27;simultaneous&#x27; decisions (which have always been difficult in normal face-to-face play).
&quot;Star Fleet Battles On-Line&quot; was originally developed by Gregg Dieckhaus and Paul Scott of Online Game Systems and is currently maintained and supported by Franz Games, LLC

In the meantime, ADB continues to try to serve the &quot;SFB&quot; community with new products, and new ways to manufacture and distribute products. Currently, they only have to go to a regular printing company for counters and color covers. These are then stockpiled, and when an order comes in, in-house (black-and-white) printers run the interiors, and other in-house machines do the binding and trimming. This &#x27;print on demand&#x27; process allows greater freedom in product releases, and warehouse storage, and all recent products use this system.

==Star Fleet universe==

&quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; has its own background universe giving the stories of ships and empires. This started as the distillation of &quot;Star Trek&quot; lore at the time of SFB&#x27;s creation, but soon started adding its own touches to fill in perceived gaps. The &#x27;SFU&#x27; now diverges sharply from canon &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as the producers ignored anything from fan productions, and SFB&#x27;s own license does not allow them to use any new material from more recent TV or film series. The SFU has re-interpreted several things, and in some places only bears a passing resemblance to the show that gave it birth. The SFU now has a history that covers (in various products) a span of about 130 years.

===Settings===
While everything published for the SFU takes place in the same continuity (other than alternate timeline scenarios), the lore is divided across several settings that have little to no contact with each other. The vast majority of products published for &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; is set in the &#x27;Alpha-Octant&#x27; (sometimes called &#x27;Alpha-Sector&#x27;, but that is actually just a part of the area covered), which includes all the races known from &quot;The Original Series&quot;. Other settings include:
*The Early Years - The era covering the emergence of the various Alpha Octant empires in the dawn of tactical warp starships, including two races (mostly) exclusive to this era, the Carnivons and Paravians. Other settings have subsequently included equivalent Early Years data, such as that seen for the Magellanic races.
*Omega (generally called &#x27;Omega Sector&#x27;, more properly &#x27;Omega-Octant&#x27;): an area just as large as the Alpha-Octant in the Milky Way Galaxy, but with a more varied history, and separated from Alpha by a large void.
*Magellanics: The Small Magellanic Cloud has long been known as the place that the Andromedans staged their invasion of the galaxy from; the recently released &quot;Module C5&quot; presents the history of the indigenous races of the SMC and the initial Andromedan conquest of them.
*Triangulum: an entirely new area, the Triangulum Galaxy, which has only been featured in the &quot;Module E2&quot; playtest pack so far.

==Nature of the galaxy==
In the Star Fleet Universe, the Milky Way Galaxy is divided up into 24 sectors, each named for the letters of the Greek alphabet. Each sector extends from the galactic rim, and inwards to where star density and radiation problems cause ion storms, precluding travel. There are five &#x27;void&#x27; sectors (Epsilon, Iota, Pi, Upsilon and Omega), where star and planet density is low, and which tend to generate large ion storms and radiation clouds, restricting travel from one set of sectors to another. This leads to the sectors in between to be grouped together in (generally) sets of three, termed &#x27;octants&#x27;, as three sectors are one eighth of the rim of the galaxy, and which are sometimes inaccurately referred to as &#x27;sectors&#x27; themselves.

The Storm Zone is unoccupied, as even bases cannot exist there due to the severity of the storms, and ships cannot penetrate the Radiation Zone. The Core of the galaxy has never been explored.

The five areas into which the Voids separate the inhabitable portions of the galaxy are the Alpha Octant, the Sargasso Octant, the Xorkaelian Empire, the Sigma Octant, and the Omega Octant.

===Alpha Octant===

The Alpha Octant is the primary setting of the Star Fleet Universe, being home to the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Star Empire, and all the other empires inherited from other &quot;Star Trek&quot; settings. It extends from the Alpha Sector to the Delta Sector, but only Alpha, Beta and Gamma (more specifically, the area covered by the &quot;Federation and Empire&quot;) have been extensively explored by the major powers of the region.

===Omega Octant===
The Omega Octant runs from the Void in the Omega Sector through the Psi, Chi and Phi Sectors (though Phi is mostly off the detailed Omega map, as Delta is in the Alpha Octant), and is detailed in a series of &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; modules (and a playtest pack for &quot;Federation Commander&quot;). Over two dozen empires have operated in this region; some remain a factor in the Octant throughout the modern era, others rise at an early time only to be crushed or sidelined, while still others only enter the scene at a later point in history. Notable powers include the Mæsron Alliance (a union of several species, like the Federation and ISC; its rise, collapse and renaissance helped define the Octant&#x27;s history), the Trobrin Empire (composed of silicon-based life forms, who consider a &#x27;Silicate Plan&#x27; to rule the galaxy as their only insurance against domination by &#x27;carbonites&#x27;), the Probr Revolution (a species of genetically uplifted salamanders with an anarchist bent, who rose against their creators, then used their technology to forge their own empire), the Drex Unity (A civilization of artificial intelligence who dedicate themselves by defend their creator&#x27;s homeworlds against any threat), the Sigvirion Expansion (a species of living viruses that take over and use other species as their hosts), and the Federal Republic of Aurora (a collection of exiles from several Alpha Octant empires, involuntarily transferred to the Omega Octant and forced to find their own way amidst the warring factions of Omega).

==Other galaxies==

===Andromeda Galaxy===
So far, only one empire has been revealed as originating from M31, but it has made quite an impact on the Star Fleet Universe...

; Andromedan Invaders
: The Andromedans (who were backtracked to a galaxy visible in the Andromeda constellation from Earth) were first contacted in the Alpha Octant in Y166, and in the Omega Octant in Y167; though they had already made their presence felt in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud. In Y188, they launched an all out attack on the Milky Way. They utilise technology unlike any used by known Galactic or Magellanic races, such as Power Absorbers instead of shields, which allow them to use incoming attacks to help power their ships, as well as the devastating Tractor-Repulsor Beam, which can rip enemy vessels apart.

===Small Magellanic Cloud===
The Small Magellanic Cloud (referred to in-setting as the Lesser Magellanic Cloud) is composed of three main regions: the densely populated Core (shrouded by a dense radiation shell), a ring of provinces with &quot;standard&quot; stellar densities, and an outer Fringe region where stars and planets are much fewer and further between. Beyond the Fringe worlds lies the Chomak Cluster, a collection of stars only recently (in astronomical terms) captured by the Cloud&#x27;s gravitational field.

&quot;Module C5&quot; for &quot;SFB&quot; presented five of the Magellanic empires: the Baduvai Imperium, the Eneen Protectorates, the Maghadim Hives, the Uthiki Harmony and the Jumokian Resistance. Others, such as the ancient Chomak Community and the reclusive Yrol Septs, await publication.

In the decades prior to the Andromedan arrival, several wars were waged between the three Magellanic Powers (Baduvai, Eneen and Maghadim), most notably for control of the strategically vital Neutral Worlds. Unfortunately for these empires, the Andromedans eventually sought to conquer the Cloud outright, in order to claim it as an advanced base of operations for their full-scale invasion of the Milky Way Galaxy. In the face of this common threat, the rival powers formed the Triple Pact: a desperate, and ultimately doomed, joint bid for survival. Once Operation Unity succeeded in subduing the Andromedans, the surviving Magellanic forces (which had held out in exile among the Fringe worlds) took to re-building their fallen empires, though it would take a long time for any of them to approach their former glory.

===M81 Galaxy===
The original location of the Tholian Will was M81, a galaxy outside the Local Group. Before the Seltorian revolt, it was controlled completely by the Tholians, with the exception of isolated nebulae from which the Nebuline species helped support M81 piracy. In addition, this galaxy was once home to the Bolosco Merchant Guilds, later found in the Omega Octant.

; The Seltorian Tribunal : After their successful revolt, the Seltorians kept the same basic political structure as the Tholian Will in place, just with themselves in charge. Fearful of an eventual Tholian return, they have sent out large nest ships as mobile bases of operation against any remnants of the Tholians they locate. It is unknown just how many expeditions were sent out, but it is known that one did go to the Andromeda Galaxy (and presumably did not fare well), as well as to the Milky Way.

===The Iridani Cluster===
Adjacent to the Omega Octant of the Milky Way Galaxy, the Iridani Cluster is home to one rather adventurous space-faring race presented in the &quot;SFB Omega&quot;-series modules...

; The Iridani Questors : Otter-like party goers, the Iridani frequently travel to neighbouring galaxies, such as the Milky Way (most notably among the Omega races) and the Small Magellanic Cloud, in single ships (or sometimes in squadrons) performing &quot;Knightly&quot; quests. Their Cluster was conquered by the Andromedans in the Y190s, but there were so many Iridani in the Milky Way that their fleet was able to band together for the greatest Quest of all: the liberation of their home worlds.

===Triangulum Galaxy===
The empires of the Triangulum Galaxy come in two distinct flavors, with a handful of older realms dealing with the consequences of several newly emergent species making their mark on M33. Three of these powers (the Helgardian Protectorate, the Arachnid Worlds of Unions and the Mallaran Empire) were presented in playtest form in &quot;SFB Module E2&quot;, while the Imperium was previewed in &quot;Captain&#x27;s Log #23&quot;. Many other empires are noted as being present in this setting, including the Human Republic (founded by a Terran colony caravan which was displaced from the Milky Way in -Y12). The Triangulum setting awaits formal publication in a &quot;full&quot; published module.

==Game system==

===Gameplay and mechanics===

The &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; game system rests on several fundamental ideas, out of which the rest of the system grows. Part of the perceived difficulty of the game is that all of these are more complicated to explain than to use.

First, the movement system (and turn structure with it) departs from the traditional &#x27;everyone takes a turn in order&#x27; structure used in the vast majority of games. Instead a proportional movement system is used, where a portion of the total movement (termed an &quot;impulse&quot;, 32 of which comprise each game turn) for all players is resolved simultaneously, so that each can see what is happening and respond to it. This avoids the usual problems with moving long distances without any fire or reactions happening, and keeps in mind that everything is moving at the same time. This system produces two important and well-known effects for movement: on impulse #1 of the game turn no units move (starships are restricted to speed 31 or less) and on impulse #32 (the last) all units move. The former instance means that speed-32 seeking weapons one hex from their targets hit automatically without possibility of interception, targets at the range limit of overloaded torpedoes (8 hexes) cannot escape before taking fire, and no ships have opportunity to turn fresh shields toward attackers before they can fire weapons. The latter instance means that even the slowest units in play make a move on the turn&#x27;s final impulse.

Second, it is assumed that while faster than light starships produce prodigious amounts of energy just for the needs of propulsion, there is not enough energy available to perform every possible function simultaneously. Therefore, each ship has to fill out an Energy Allocation form at the beginning of a turn, and &#x27;pay&#x27; for all the functions (such as movement, shields and weapons) that it can then use during the turn. This procedure forces players to plan their actions for the following game turn, because systems left unpowered during the Energy Allocation Phase cannot be used during the turn (there is a rule for Reserve Power which a player can use to power up some systems mid-turn, but this limited power comes from the ship&#x27;s batteries).

And third, each ship has a display of systems (a Ship Systems Display, or SSD) that acts as a schematic diagram of a particular ship in play. Each class in the game has an individualized SSD, and most expansions revolve around providing new classes and &#x27;variants&#x27; of ships to the game, with new SSDs. These displays consist of check-off boxes for all the ship&#x27;s structure and systems (shields in all six directions, systems and hull damage, how much power the engines produce, how many transporters there are, etc. checked off when damaged) in the general layout of the ship, along with general reference information for that ship (tracks to check off use for weapons in limited supply like drones, shuttles, probes, plus weapons fire resolution tables, firing arcs, and miscellaneous ship data).

Fourth, it differs from many wargames in that each unit is not simply a set of offensive and defensive numerical ratings; rather, each ship has a variety of individual weapons and resources, each employing their own tactics and counter-tactics. Thus players are able to utilize, &quot;e.g.&quot;, boarding parties, shuttles, tractor beams, electronic countermeasures, &quot;etc.&quot;, permitting many more tactics than in the average wargame (and requiring much more documentation). It is this which allows the game to become a science-fiction experience, and puts it in concert with many literary elements of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Fifth, the game system is richly detailed and demanding of the players in terms of what might be called &quot;situational awareness&quot;, particularly in directionality and proximity. Every ship/unit must maintain a definite &quot;facing&quot; (heading on the game map&#x27;s hexagonal grid) which can only be changed sixty degrees or less at a time under strict rules (turn modes and the &quot;sideslip&quot; move). There are more drastic movement options available, such as the Quick Reverse and the High Energy Turn (HET), but they are limited by restrictions and risks of mishap (such as the always-dreaded Breakdown penalty). Adding complexity is the fact that the defensive shields of starships are spread around their six hex sides, most usually in an uneven pattern with the front (or number one) shield having most of the ship&#x27;s shield boxes. Each hexside around the ship towards its rear usually has fewer boxes for absorbing damage before incoming weapons fire begins scoring &quot;internal hits&quot; on the starship proper. Furthermore, direct-fire weapons (as opposed to seeking weapons, such as drones or plasma torpedoes) have a prescribed arc of fire and each type of weapon (such as photon torpedoes, phasers, fusion beams, &quot;etc.&quot;) has its own peculiar &quot;bands&quot; of effectiveness within which its hit probabilities and damage ratings vary. This last feature of the game system is particularly stark with its provision for &quot;overloaded&quot; weapons, in which hit probabilities for targets at ranges greater than 8 dwindle to zero (overloads burn out past this range) and the damage scored becomes decisive; in most cases, overloaded weapons score double damage; notable exceptions include for Hydran fusion beams and the ISC plasmatic pulsar device (which score half-again damage) and photon torpedoes (which have a &quot;dial-a-yield&quot; feature).

The interplay between directional limitations for ship maneuvering, shield protection, and weapons fire makes for a practically infinite number of tactical permutations from which the ship captains can decide. Each ship maneuvers to present the strongest shields to its most dangerous adversaries, while at the same time seeking to generate firing opportunities for its most powerful armaments against the most vulnerable or threatening opponents. When more advanced options are added to the basic game system (for example, mid-turn speed changes and reserve battery power for last-moment overloads or speed changes) the gaming situation can become very intricate. Environmental factors like asteroid fields, planetary atmospheres, and minefields further diversify the gaming possibilities. Finally, multi-starship scenarios (and also those involving starbases, battle stations, or civilian convoys) can complexify the gaming experience to suit the tastes of the most sophisticated wargamer.

===Rules===
Since the introduction of &quot;Commander&#x27;s Edition&quot; the rules have been organized with lettered major chapters, followed by a number to indicate a major rule. Then follows a decimal, and a series of numbers indicating the breakdown into subsections. For example, (D6.683) is the third subsection of (D6.68) Disrupted Fire Control, which is the eighth subsection of (D6.6) Active Fire Control, which is the sixth section of (D6.0) Fire Control Systems, which is the sixth rule in (D0.0) Combat. 

Chapter R is an exception; as it is a listing of every ship type in the game, the number after the decimal is a sequential number identifier. &quot;e.g.&quot;, (R2.12) is the Police Cutter, the eleventh Federation ship in the game; (R2.1) is background information. Occasionally, a chapter might have sub-chapters, which are indicated with two letters.

All of this is complicated, but is a consequence of the exceptionally wide-ranging nature of the rules, and the need to identify exactly what will happen under usually-obscure circumstances. To aid in this, a fair amount of the rules are actually dedicated to cross-referencing other rules sections. As it is, the designers made an effort to ensure that there are not any &#x27;unaddressed interactions&#x27; between different rules; if there is a possible interaction, it is covered. The result is that many newer players can be intimidated by the sheer bulk of the rulebook. This problem is addressed in two ways; first, the &quot;Cadet&#x27;s Game&quot; offers a stripped down introductory combat scenario that uses only the most basic of rules (for example, no overloaded weapons, no electronic warfare, &quot;etc.&quot;); second, the more-advanced rules are noted as such, so that players can ignore those they find too difficult or cumbersome without &quot;breaking&quot; the combat system (and some rules are entirely optional). 

As all the rules numbers were kept strictly intact from &quot;Commander&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;Captain&#x27;s Edition SFB&quot;, the presentation of rule numbers occasionally jump around in current products, as they are presented in the products that make the most sense, rather than in the order in which they were introduced in &quot;Commander&#x27;s Edition&quot;.

===Formats for gameplay===
There are three basic ways to play &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;.

The first, most casual, and most usual way the game is played among individual gamers not involved in regular group play is what&#x27;s called the &quot;Pick-up game&quot;. Each starship class (nonship units also) in &quot;SFB&quot; has what&#x27;s called a &quot;Basic Point Value&quot;, or BPV. This is considered the &quot;cost&quot; of the ship, besides its value in combat. In the pick-up game each player or team is allotted a certain number of BPV (casually referred to as &quot;points&quot;) to &quot;buy&quot; the starships and nonship units they will play. There are also optional items of equipment available that can also be purchased and added to the player&#x27;s order of battle (including ship &quot;refits&quot; and sundries such as improved drones or fire control, mines, extra boarding parties, multirole shuttles or fighters, etc.). Availability of optional items is usually restricted by race/empire and the historical year of the battle&#x27;s setting. Gaming commences when all players have &quot;spent&quot; all their BPV and gathered the required game materials to deploy their chosen battleforces. All players must agree on entry conditions for their forces (weapons status, hex(es) of first appearance, presence of &quot;terrain&quot; such as asteroid fields or minefields) and the &quot;ground rules&quot; that will be in effect during play (mainly which optional rules will or will not be used such as electronic warfare, mid-turn speed changes, cloaking devices, or the use of &quot;transporter bombs&quot; and mines). Several types of plotted movement systems are available in the &quot;SFB&quot; rules but most player groups in the pick-up game opt for the &quot;free&quot; movement method in which players proceed through the game turn without a prepared movement plot. Instead they decide how their units will move one impulse at a time. Typically victory in the pick-up game demands simple destruction of the enemy force(s) but players may devise other victory conditions by mutual consent.

The second way to play &quot;SFB&quot; is with the scenarios published either in the latter parts of the game rulebooks or the supplementary &quot;SFB&quot; publications from ADB (such as &quot;Captain&#x27;s Log&quot;). The advantages to scenario play include assured game balance (they are thoroughly playtested by ADB) and speed of setup (nearly all possible play options are specified). Many of the published scenarios offer unique and fascinating conditions of victory that need not require destruction of the opponent, such as the rescue of a disabled starship or units stranded on a planet, the seizure of cargo from a contested unit or location, or merely the successful disengagement of some particularly valuable unit or units from the mapboard. A special category of scenario involves a &quot;space monster&quot; that is controlled by automatic rules, and is so suited for solitaire play.

The third way &quot;SFB&quot; can be played is the &quot;campaign game&quot;, or simply a campaign. This mode of play involves a number of &quot;SFB&quot; tactical games that are played sequentially in order to simulate an entire war or theater of war between two or more game races (Federation, Kzinti, etc.) or teams. There is a &quot;strategic&quot; level game map which lays out the territories and borders/fronts of the races/teams, and indicates the economic and military resources controlled by each (homeworlds/capitals, planets, starbases, shipyards, etc.). In complex campaigns there are usually also separate records kept of national resources. Ships and other units are gathered into &quot;fleets&quot; and moved on the strategic gameboard until the opposing forces come into contact (almost always by moving into a single &quot;battle hex&quot;) and then combat commences in the form of the so-generated SFB combat scenario. Ships destroyed in one game are unavailable for later battles, damaged ships are repaired, fighters and drones and other &quot;expendables&quot; replenished, etc. between battles. The vanquished forces of each battle are usually required to retreat, and the victor(s) are free to advance or withdraw at will. Play continues until one side is destroyed or conquered.

Gamers are free to devise their own system for organizing campaigns. ADB published a game reference specifically for various ways/methods of organizing player-generated campaigns. There may be as many &quot;empires&quot; or nations as players, or they may form up into teams, or a single player may be responsible for different races on different fronts (depending on how much recordkeeping and gameplay he is willing to handle). The players will need to devise their system for strategic movement and some sort of economic system for generating resources for starship construction/deployment. They will also need to agree to such things as what timeframe (year) the campaign is set in (this determines what technologies are available for play), how planets are captured, how bases are constructed, etc.

A more structured way to organize a campaign is to use the system offered by Star Fleet Battle&#x27;s companion game at the galactic-strategic level, Federation and Empire. In effect, F&amp;E becomes a scenario generator for SFB. This way the gamers don&#x27;t need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;, and still can retain the freedom to modify the strategic system as they choose (by mutual consent). For instance, they may replay the General War, or instead play a &quot;free for all&quot; in which each race/empire may ally or team up with or against any race(s) of their choosing.

There is a different kind of campaign game that does not use a strategic gameboard &quot;per se&quot;. One was published in the &quot;Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot; called the &quot;Captain&#x27;s Game&quot;. There was also such a campaign published as &quot;Operation Unity&quot;, the push by the Galactic Powers to destroy the Andromedan starbase in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud. In this type of campaign there are a number of SFB tactical gameboards connected edge-to-edge a certain number of maps wide. These represent a &quot;border&quot; between two neighboring races/empires. The rules specify an order of battle for each side, and how they are to be deployed on each gamemap. A battle is fought on each map, and the victor advances to the next game map closer to his opponent&#x27;s home starbase (or planet). Between rounds ships are repaired and replenished as usual. The game ends when one player advances to his opponent&#x27;s home gameboard and vanquishes the enemy starbase (or if the enemy fleet is destroyed).

====Master Rule Book====
Recently, ADB has started releasing a set of &#x27;Master&#x27; products. These are intended as a compilation of all the system into a single source, instead of needing to either constantly refer to different products, or tear them apart to integrate them by hand. Existing products are:
*&quot;Master Rule Book&quot; (2004): Has all the rules from Basic Set, Advanced Missions, C1, C2, C3, J, J2, K, M, X, and Y1. It is the most up-to-date and comprehensive version of the rules available, but does not include ship descriptions, scenarios or annexes. Until the rest of the system is available, this is not suitable for a new player unless they have a friend who has those things available already. Replacement pages are occasionally made available, and the set is currently (April 2006) on Revision B. As this is a print on demand item, new orders are new printings with all available updates (2012).
*&quot;Module G3: Master Annexes&quot; (2009): This module contains annexes with information for all Alpha-Octant empires in every product published through the end of 2008 (including Captain&#x27;s Logs).

Also planned are the &quot;Master Ship Book&quot;, a compilation of all the Alpha-Octant ship listings; the &quot;Master SSD Book(s)&quot;; and the &quot;Master Scenario Book&quot;. A full set of all these products should provide everything needed other than maps and counters.

==Reception==
In the September 1979 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 29), Tim Kask did not recommend it for neophytes due to its complexity. &quot;There are quite a few rules to absorb and master, but it appears that it will be worth the effort... The game holds a lot of promise.&quot;

In the November–December 1979 issue of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 25), Kenneth W. Burke wrote that the game was too complex to be playable. &quot;I give &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; a &#x27;need for improvement&#x27; rating. In their desire to make an &#x27;accurate&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot; wargame, its designers inadvertently let playability fly out the window.&quot;

Two years later, in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 38, William A. Barton gave a thumbs up to the &quot;Star Fleet Battles Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, but also cautioned that the complex game was not for the faint-hearted. &quot;I&#x27;d have to give my whole-hearted recommendation to &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;. I find it a most satisfying game. I would, however, caution Trekkers who are inexperienced at simulations gaming to start with a less complex space combat game before trying SFB. But those of you who are old hands, if you haven&#x27;t yet taken on the helm of the U.S.S. Enterprise or one of its sister ships, then boldly go to your local game store and pick up a copy.&quot;

In the May 1981 edition of &quot;Ares&quot; (Issue 8), Steve List recommended the game, saying, &quot;Despite the minute details with which the player has to contend, this is neither a difficult game to learn (mastering it is another matter) or play as long as the player doesn&#x27;t try to handle too many ships at once.&quot;

John Lambshead reviewed &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #27, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that &quot;I have no hesitation in recommending this game. The only word of warning I would give is that it may be a little complex for beginners or younger gamers (who might usefully look at &quot;TFG&quot;&#x27;s simpler game on a similar subject &quot;Starfire&quot;).&quot;

In the June 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 230), Rick Swan thought the 4th edition was a worthy addition to the &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; line, saying that despite its complexity, it was &quot;an experience without parallel, one that can easily become an obsession.&quot;
In his 2007 essay, Bruce Nesmith stated &quot;No other game in hobby game history so completely captures the feel of ship-to-ship combat in space than &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;. The fact that it does so in the Star Fleet Universe is icing on the cake.&quot;

==Reviews==
*&quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;
*&quot;Fantastic Science Fiction&quot; v27 n11

==Awards==
&quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming, Arts, &amp; Design Hall of Fame in 2005, with the citation that &quot;&quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot; literally defined the genre of spaceship combat games in the early 1980s, and was the first game that combined a major license with &#x27;high re-playability&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Gopalaratnam Subramaniam (born 2 June 1956), known professionally as Mani Ratnam, is an Indian film director, film producer and screenwriter who predominantly works in Tamil cinema and a few Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada films. 

He has won seven National Film Awards, four Filmfare Awards, six Filmfare Awards South, and numerous awards at various film festivals across the world. In 2002, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, acknowledging his contributions to film.

Despite being born into a film family, Mani Ratnam did not develop any interest in films when he was young. Upon completion of his post graduation in management, he started his career as a consultant. He entered the film industry through the 1983 Kannada film, &quot;Pallavi Anu Pallavi&quot;. The failure of his subsequent films would mean that he would be left with fewer offers. After working in Telugu and Malayalam Cinema, he made his major breakthrough with &quot;Mouna Ragam&quot; (1986), established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema which won him his first Filmfare Best Director Award. He was the director of the critically acclaimed &quot;Nayakan&quot; (1987) and &quot;Anjali&quot; (1990), both of which qualified as India&#x27;s official entry for The Academy Awards. He found success with the crime drama &quot;Thalapathi&quot;, romantic terrorism drama &quot;Roja&quot; (1992), &quot;Bombay&quot; (1995), &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998), and his romantic trilogy of &quot;Mouna Ragam&quot; (1986), &quot;Alai Payuthey&quot; (2000), &quot;O Kadhal Kanmani&quot; (2015).

Each of his films contain its own unique style, with beautifully photographed songs and unique back-lighting. Exploring success in romantic, terrorism war and drama films. His epic historical dramas, &quot;Ponniyin Selvan: I&quot; (2022) and &quot;Ponniyin Selvan: II&quot; (2023), based on the Indian epic written by Kalki Krishnamurthy, were critical and commercial blockbusters with the former becoming the 35th highest-grossing film in India and 5th highest-grossing Tamil film.

== Early life ==

Mani Ratnam was born on 2 June 1956 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu as the second child of a family that was closely associated with film production. His father, S. Gopalaratnam, was a film distributor who worked for Venus Pictures, while his uncle, &quot;Venus&quot; Krishnamurthy, was a film producer. His elder brother G. Venkateswaran (died 2003) would go on to produce some of his films. His younger brother G. Srinivasan (died 2007), like G. Venkateswaran, would also co-produce some of his films. Mani Ratnam grew up in Madras (now Chennai), along with his siblings and cousins. Despite being a film family, the children were not allowed to watch films as the elders considered them taboo. &quot;As a youngster, films seemed like a waste of time&quot;, he claimed in a 1994 interview; however, he started watching films more actively when he was studying at the Besant Theosophical School. During this time, he developed an admiration for actors like Sivaji Ganesan and Nagesh; watching all their films. When he discovered the legendary director K. Balachander, he became his fan. Upon completing his schooling, he graduated with a degree in commerce from the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College, affiliated to the Madras University. Later, he did his Master of Business Administration (MBA) in finance from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies in Mumbai. After finishing his post-graduation in 1977, he was employed in a firm in Madras as a management consultant, and continued to work there for sometime.

== Personal life ==

Ratnam married actress Suhasini on 26 August 1988. The couple have a son. The family resides in Alwarpet, Chennai, where he runs his production company, Madras Talkies.

In 1995, Mani Ratnam was wounded and hospitalised after homemade bombs were thrown at his home by attackers, suspected by police as Islamic extremists, in the wake of opposition to his film &quot;Bombay&quot; which portrayed the romance of a Hindu man with a Muslim woman.

An FIR was filed on Mani Ratnam and 49 others in 2019 when they wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi listing statistics and expressing concern over the rise of communal violence against minorities including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits since Modi&#x27;s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took power in 2014.

== Film career ==
=== Beginnings: 1977–1983 ===
Mani Ratnam was not satisfied with his job as a consultant as he found it to be a mere extension of his academics. During this time his friend Ravi Shankar, son of director B. R. Panthulu, was in the process of making his first film. Mani Ratnam, Ravi Shankar and another friend Raman, son of filmmaker S. Balachander, worked on the script of the film. Mani Ratnam took a sabbatical from his job to ensure his participation in the making of the film. Being inexperienced, the makers were largely dependent upon the &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; magazine. The principal cast included Vishnuvardhan, Srinath, Ambareesh, Lakshmi, and Roja Ramani. When the filming was about to begin in Kolar, Karnataka, Mani Ratnam left his consulting job and joined the crew. The film, however, did not take off and was eventually shelved. Nevertheless, he was firm in his idea of becoming a film-maker. Although not impressed with many of the films made in Tamil cinema, he was &quot;amazed&quot; at Bharathiraja&#x27;s &quot;16 Vayathinile&quot; (1977), K. Balachander&#x27;s &quot;Apoorva Raagangal&quot; (1975), and Mahendran&#x27;s &quot;Mullum Malarum&quot; (1978) and &quot;Uthiripookkal&quot; (1979). During this time, he befriended a group of people namely P. C. Sreeram, Santhana Bharathi, and P. Vasu, who shared his interest of entering into the film industry.

With a script in hand, Mani Ratnam had an idea to either get a producer for his film or to narrate the script to a &quot;celebrated&quot; film-maker, so that he could get a chance to work along with them and get to know about the various aspects involved in film-making. He chose three directors—Balachander, Bharathiraja, and Mahendran. As the attempts to meet and convince all the three proved to be unsuccessful, he decided to look out for a producer. In the process, he along with P. C. Sreeram—who would collaborate with him in most of his future projects—met around 20 people; however, all the efforts turned out to be unsuccessful.

=== Early years and struggle: 1983–1986 ===
Mani Ratnam developed a script—originally written in English—into a film and named it &quot;Pallavi Anu Pallavi&quot;. His uncle Krishnamurthy agreed to produce the film but imposed a condition that it should be made under a limited budget in Kannada, to which he agreed. He persuaded Balu Mahendra to do the cinematography as he found the latter&#x27;s work to be very impressive. He managed to get other crew members B. Lenin (for Film editing), Thota Tharani (for art direction) and Ilaiyaraaja (for composer music), all leading craftsmen in their respective fields. For the male lead, he cast Anil Kapoor after watching his performance in the Telugu film &quot;Vamsa Vruksham&quot; (1980). Lakshmi was signed up as the female lead. The film explored the relationship between a young man and an older woman. Although an average grosser at the box-office, the film fetched Mani Ratnam the Best Screenplay Award from the Karnataka State Government for the year 1983. After watching &quot;Pallavi Anu Pallavi&quot;, N. G. John offered him a chance to direct a film in Malayalam. Scripted by T. Damodaran and featuring Mohanlal as hero, &quot;Unaroo&quot; was about the corruption in labour unions of Kerala. The film was completed within two months and released in April 1984. Mani Ratnam attributed the failure of the film to the conflict of interests that he and the producer had. Following this, he entered Tamil cinema when G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films offered him a chance to direct &quot;Pagal Nilavu&quot; (1985). The film had Murali and Revathi playing lead roles. It was different from his previous two films in that it included dance sequences and a &quot;comedy track&quot;. The same year, he directed another Tamil film &quot;Idaya Kovil&quot;, a romantic drama. He remodelled a ready made script on the lines of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot; (1952). Despite being unsatisfied with the final product, the film was a major box-office success. The phase between 1983 and 1986 was the toughest of his career with only &quot;Pallavi Anupallavi&quot; feeling satisfactory; the other three completed with a lot of &quot;compromises&quot;.

=== Breakthrough: 1986–1991 ===
In 1986, Mani directed the Tamil romantic drama &quot;Mouna Ragam&quot;, which starred Revathi and Mohan. The film was critically acclaimed for portraying urban Tamils in a &quot;realistic&quot; manner. Specifically, it told the story of the friction between a newly-wed couple. The score by Ilaiyaraaja was appreciated along with SPB in back ground score and became popular upon release. &quot;Mouna Raagam&quot; was subsequently dubbed into Telugu under the same title and became a hit in Andhra Pradesh as well. The film elevated Mani&#x27;s status as a director, and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil at the 34th National Film Awards. He won his first Filmfare Award for directing the film.

In 1987, Mani directed &quot;Nayakan&quot; starring Kamal Haasan, and the film became a huge success and brought him recognition at the national level. Inspired by the 1972 American crime film, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, the film was based on the real-life story of underworld don Varadarajan Mudaliar, and tells the story of an orphaned slum-dweller and his rise to top of the Bombay underworld hierarchy. It was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s All-Time 100 Greatest Movies in 2005. Satyajit Ray&#x27;s The Apu Trilogy and Guru Dutt&#x27;s &quot;Pyaasa&quot; are the only other Indian films that have appeared in the list. Indian critics dubbed the film as India&#x27;s answer to &quot;The Godfather&quot;. &quot;Nayakan&quot; was both commercially successful and critically acclaimed winning three National Awards—Best Actor, Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction—at the 35th National Film Awards. The film was India&#x27;s official entry to the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film at the 60th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.

Following these two commercial successes, Mani wrote and directed in 1988. The film deals with the story of half-brothers played by Prabhu and Karthik and is notable for its use of new techniques in camera framework, especially during the songs. The film had a successful run in the box office.

In 1989, Telugu actor Nagarjuna and Mani Ratnam collaborated for a Telugu film and it remains the only Telugu film directed by Ratnam. The film &quot;Geethanjali&quot; which had Nagarjuna and Girija Shettar in the lead, told the story of an ill-fated couple, both of whom are suffering from terminal diseases. &quot;Geethanjali&quot; was critically acclaimed and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment in 1990. In addition, it won the Best Director and Nandi Award for Best Story Writer for Mani. Mani maintained a momentum of making emotional stories of under-served people through the film &quot;Anjali&quot; in 1990, which starred Baby Shamili as the central character. The film which also had Raghuvaran and Revathy, told the story of an autistic child who changed the lives of people around her. The film proved to be a commercial success and was nominated as India&#x27;s official entry to the Oscars in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 63rd Academy Awards. Following &quot;Anjali&#x27;s&quot; release, Mani later made another underworld-themed Tamil film, &quot;Thalapathi&quot; (1991), starring Rajinikanth and Mammootty. The film was loosely based on Mahabharata, dealt with the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana portrayed by Rajinikanth and Mammmooty respectively. The film met with both critical acclaim and commercial success upon release. Ilaiyaraaja&#x27;s musical score and Mani&#x27;s work were highly appreciated as they both went on to win the Music Director and Best Director awards respectively at the 39th Filmfare Awards.

=== National acclaim: 1992–1999 ===
With &quot;Thalapathy&quot;, Mani ended his long-term association with music director Ilaiyaraaja, bringing in debutant music director A. R. Rahman to score his Tamil classic &quot;Roja&quot; (1992). The venture was successful, earning Mani various awards. &quot;Roja&quot;, a romantic film, was about terrorism in the Kashmir region. Starring Arvind Swamy and Madhoo, it was nominated for the Golden St. George Award at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. It became highly popular, gaining an iconic status in Indian cinema and was dubbed into other languages and met similar success in other regions. Mani took a more light-hearted approach with his next film—&quot;Thiruda Thiruda&quot; (1993). Scripted by Ram Gopal Varma, the film was a fun filled caper, which was a departure from Mani&#x27;s previous style and fared moderately well at the box office. &quot;Thiruda Thiruda&quot; was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1994.

Mani again teamed up with Ram Gopal Varma to provide the screenplay for the latter&#x27;s Telugu film &quot;Gaayam&quot;, a socio-politico film loosely based on &quot;The Godfather&quot;. In 1995, Mani returned to Tamil language drama through &quot;Bombay&quot; starring Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala, which told the story of a Hindu-Muslim couple in the midst of the 1993 religious Bombay riots and bombings. It was also the first Indian film to focus on marriage between Hindu and Muslim people. The film met with controversy and censorship upon release. It was subsequently dubbed into Hindi where it gained commercial success and appreciation by critics. It won a number of awards, such as Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, Political Film Society Awards|Special Award from the Political Film Society, In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem International Film Festival and the Gala Award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.

Mani produced his wife&#x27;s directorial debut film, &quot;Indira&quot;, and then directed the critically successful &quot;Iruvar&quot; with Mohanlal, Aishwarya Rai, Tabu and Prakash Raj in the lead. &quot;Iruvar&quot; was awarded the Best Film at the &quot;Festival of the Auteur Films&quot; at the FEST film festival held in Belgrade. In 1998 came the third part of his &quot;terrorism trilogy&quot;, named &quot;Dil Se..&quot; and starring Shahrukh Khan and Manisha Koirala, with the latter fabricating the second collaboration. It showed the relationship between a young man and a dangerous, disturbed woman. Although they fall in love, she is unable to take the romance further due to her bleak past. The soundtrack album, again composed by A. R. Rahman, gained mass appeal and gave Rahman his next Filmfare Award for Best Music Direction in 1999. Unlike his previous two projects, &quot;Dil Se..&quot; opened with little note among film critics and performed poorly in the domestic market, despite being a success overseas. It was screened in many international film festivals, and won the Netpac award (Ex-Aqueo) in the Berlin International Film Festival. The film over the years has achieved cult classic status.

In 2000, Mani directed the romantic drama &quot;Alaipayuthey&quot; that starred R. Madhavan and Shalini. The film focussed on marriage and explored relationships and their consequences, and garnered critical recognition. It was also screened at the Berlin International Film Festival.

Along with Vasanth, he was instrumental in organising &quot;Netru, Indru, Naalai&quot;, a stage musical that marked the first theatre production, with numerous other artistes, to aid The Banyan, an organisation that rehabilitates women and children with mental illness.

=== &quot;Kannathil Muthamittal&quot; and onwards: 2002–2010 ===
Mani&#x27;s next film, &quot;Kannathil Muthamittal&quot;, dealt with the story of a child of Sri Lankan Tamil parentage adopted by Indian parents, who wishes to meet her biological mother during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The film was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, winning six National Film Awards, Filmfare Award for Best Direction in Tamil, In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival, and an award at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles. In 2004, he made &quot;Aayutha Ezhuthu&quot;, which tells the story of how one incident sends the lives of three youths on a collision course and received positive reviews. Mani made the film simultaneously in Hindi as &quot;Yuva&quot;, his second venture into Bollywood. Ajay Devgn, Abhishek Bachchan, and Vivek Oberoi replaced Surya Sivakumar, R. Madhavan, and Siddharth, respectively in the Hindi version. Unlike &quot;Yuva&quot;, &quot;Aayutha Ezhuthu&quot; was appreciated by critics. Mani suffered his first heart attack while shooting &quot;Aayutha Ezhuthu&quot;.

In 2007, Mani made &quot;Guru&quot;, a biographical film based on the life of Dhirubhai Ambani, a business magnate from India. The film starred Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. The film, set in the early 1950s, became a box office success and received critical acclaim. Guru was screened at the Tous Les Cinemas du Monde (World Cinema) section of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. In 2010, Mani worked on a bilingual film, titled &quot;Raavanan&quot; starting Vikram, Aishwarya Rai and Prithviraj Sukumaran in Tamil where in the film look was unveiled at 2010 Cannes Film Festival, as part of its marketing campaign. and &quot;Raavan&quot; in Hindi. The Tamil version was dubbed into Telugu and titled &quot;Villain&quot;. The film was released worldwide on 18 June 2010.

The film is loosely based on the Hindu epic Ramayana; its narrative occurs over 14 days when a revolutionist named Veera, who lives in a forest, kidnaps a policeman&#x27;s wife to avenge his sister&#x27;s death. The Tamil version received positive reviews from the critics compared to its other versions. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called the movie a &quot;critics&#x27; pick&quot;. However, the reviewers of the Hindi version panned the film; Rajeev Masand said it was &quot;a crushing bore of a film, a disappointment on virtually every count&quot; The Tamil version was declared a box office success.

=== Comeback: 2013–present ===

Mani&#x27;s film, &quot;Kadal&quot; was released worldwide on 1 February 2013 to mixed reviews from critics and became a box office failure. Later the distributor of the film filed a police complaint against Mani on account of the huge losses suffered by him.

His next film, romantic drama &quot;O Kadhal Kanmani&quot; starring Dulquer Salmaan and Nithya Menen as the lead pair, was released in April 2015. The cinematography and editing of the film was handled by P.C. Sreeram and A. Sreekar Prasad respectively, while music was scored by A. R. Rahman. The film depicted the life of a young couple in a live-in relationship in Mumbai, and was said to be a &quot;reflection of the modern mindset of urban India&quot;, dealing with issues such as marriage and traditional values. Made at a small budget of 6 crores, the film achieved widespread critical acclaim and commercial success.

His next was &quot;Kaatru Veliyidai&quot;, starring Karthi, Aditi Rao Hydari and RJ Balaji. The film, set in 1999 during the Kargil War, followed a pilot who, during his time as a prisoner of war, reflects on his failed love life. Kaatru Veliyidai was released in April 2017 to mixed reviews and received an average box office return.

After &quot;Kattru Veliyadai&quot;, Ratnam&#x27;s next film was the crime thriller &quot;Chekka Chivantha Vaanam&quot;, starring Arvind Swami, Silambarasan, Arun Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi as the lead actors, while Jyothika, Aishwarya Rajesh, Aditi Rao Hydari and Dayana Erappa, Prakash Raj, Thiagarajan, and Mansoor Ali Khan rounded out the supporting cast. The film followed three children as they battled for complete power of their crime family following their father&#x27;s unexpected demise. &quot;Chekka Chivantha Vaanam&quot; opened in September 2018 to positive reviews and was a box office success. His next project was confirmed to be &quot;Ponniyin Selvan: I&quot;, based on the Indian epic written by Kalki Krishnamurthy. The film has an ensemble cast consisting of Vikram, Karthi, Jayam Ravi, Jayaram, Rahman, Aishwarya Rai, Trisha, Aishwarya Lekshmi, R. Parthiban, Lal, Babu Antony, Ashwin Kakumanu, Prabhu, Sarathkumar, Sobhita Dhulipala, Vikram Prabhu and many more, play the prominent roles. The venture was jointly produced by Mani Ratnam and Subaskaran under their banners, Madras Talkies and Lyca Productions. The music was composed by A. R. Rahman, while Ravi Varman handled the cinematography of the film. A. Sreekar Prasad was the editor. Initially planned as one film, reminiscent of &quot;Mughal-E-Azam&quot;, &quot;Ponniyin Selvan&quot; was divided into two parts. This was done to ensure that the audience would not be confused with the screenplay and story, adapted from the five books of the epic. The first part, &quot;Ponniyin Selvan: I&quot;, was released theatrically, on 30 September 2022. The second part released on 28 April 2023. He is currently working on Thug Life (2025) starring Kamal Hassan.

== Craft, style, and technical collaborations ==
Mani Ratnam grew up watching the films of K. Balachander, Guru Dutt and Sivaji Ganesan. He is greatly influenced by the film-making styles of Akira Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Ingmar Bergman and Mahendran.

Unlike most of his contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist anybody in film-making prior to entering the industry. A majority of his films are characterised by a string of socio-political themes. Because of his idea of combining art and commercial elements, most of his films garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. &quot;Nayakan&quot;, &quot;Bombay&quot; and &quot;Iruvar&quot; were inspired from real-life incidents, while &quot;Thalapathi&quot; and &quot;Raavan&quot; were based on Indian epics.

Mani Ratnam handled screenplays for a majority of his films. Lauded for his casting in each of his films, he claimed in an interview that &quot;I am not a director who performs and shows. I discuss the role, the scene with my actors and let them bring life to it&quot;. Right from the beginning of his career, his works were noted for their technical expertise in areas such as cinematography, art direction, editing and background score. For his debut film, he managed to handpick Balu Mahendra, Thotta Tharani, B. Lenin, and Ilaiyaraaja, leading craftsmen in their respective fields. As his career progressed, he worked with his childhood friend P. C. Sreeram and continued his collaborations with him until &quot;Geethanjali&quot;. In 1991 for his film &quot;Thalapathi&quot;, he chose Santosh Sivan and Suresh Urs—both newcomers to the Tamil film industry—to do cinematography and editing respectively. Both would later become a part of his regular crew. While working on &quot;Raavan&quot;, Santosh Sivan noted &quot;any cameraman can hone his skills just working with Mani&quot; and described Mani Ratnam&#x27;s films as difficult to film. From his debut project till &quot;Thalapathi&quot;, Ilaiyaraaja was his regular composer. For his next film &quot;Roja&quot; (1992), he collaborated with debutant A. R. Rahman, who has been his regular composer for all his films till date. Among cinematographers, he has also worked with Madhu Ambat, Rajiv Menon, Ravi K. Chandran, V. Manikandan and Ravi Varman while switching between Sreeram and Santosh Sivan otherwise. Since &quot;Alaipayuthey&quot;, Sreekar Prasad has been his regular film editor.

== Awards and honours ==

Mani is well recognised outside India with a retrospective of his films held at various film festivals around the world such as Toronto International Film Festival, Busan International Film Festival, Tokyo Filmex and Birmingham International Film Festival. His films are being screened regularly at many film festivals such as Venice Film Festival, Rotterdam Film Festival, Montreal World Film Festival and Palm Springs International Film Festival.

The Government of India honoured Mani with Padma Shri in 2002. He has won several National Film Awards, Filmfare Awards, Filmfare Awards South and state awards. Apart from these awards, many of his films have been screened at various film festivals and have won numerous accolades. &quot;Geethanjali&quot;, directed by him won the Golden Lotus Award for Best Popular Film at the 37th National Film Awards. Other films like &quot;Mouna Ragam&quot;, &quot;Anjali&quot;, and &quot;Kannathil Muthamittal&quot; have won the Best Regional Film awards at the National Film Awards. Two of his films, &quot;Roja&quot; and &quot;Bombay&quot; have won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration.

<text>Robert Hepler Lowe (born March 17, 1964) is an American actor, filmmaker, and podcast host. He made his acting debut at the age of 15 with ABC&#x27;s short-lived sitcom &quot;A New Kind of Family&quot; (1979–1980). Following numerous television roles in the early 1980s, he came to prominence as a teen idol and member of the Brat Pack with starring roles in &quot;The Outsiders &quot;(1983), &quot;Class&quot; (1983), &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; (1984), &quot;Oxford Blues&quot; (1984), &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985), &quot;About Last Night...&quot; (1986), and &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1988).

Lowe was involved in a sex tape scandal in 1988, which stymied his career for many years afterward. By the turn of the millennium, his career saw a resurgence when he ventured back into television, making his breakthrough as Sam Seaborn on the NBC political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; (1999–2003), for which he received nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. His other television roles include Robert McCallister on the ABC drama &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; (2006–2010), Chris Traeger on the NBC sitcom &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2010–2015), Ethan Willis on the CBS medical drama &quot;Code Black&quot; (2016–2018), and as Captain Owen Strand on the critically praised Fox drama &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot; (2020–2025). In 2018, he made his directorial debut with the television film &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;, a remake of the 1956 film of the same name.

==Early life==
Robert Lowe was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, to Barbara (née Hepler), a teacher, and Charles &#x27;Chuck&#x27; Davis Lowe, a trial lawyer. While still a baby, he lost complete hearing in his right ear as a result of undiagnosed mumps. His parents divorced when Lowe and his younger brother Chad were young. Lowe was baptized in the Episcopal Church. He is of German, English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh ancestry. On the show &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, Lowe found out that one of his ancestors, Christopher East, served as a Hessian soldier during the U.S. War of Independence. His ancestor served under the command of Colonel Johann Gottlieb Rall and was captured at the American victory at Trenton, New Jersey, on the morning of December 26, 1776. As a POW, his ancestor was given a choice, and took the option to stay in the United States. He has two half brothers from the second marriages of his parents, the producer Micah Dyer (maternal) and Justin Lowe (paternal).

Lowe grew up in Dayton, Ohio, in a &quot;traditional American setting&quot;. He attended Oakwood Junior High School before moving to the Point Dume area of Malibu, California, with his mother and brother. In California, he attended Santa Monica High School, where he met Charlie Sheen. In his autobiography &quot;Stories I Only Tell My Friends&quot;, he wrote regarding Sheen, &quot;We were both nerds [...] he wanted to be a baseball player.&quot; On a March 25, 2019 episode of the ‘WTF!? With Marc Maron’ podcast, Lowe boasted that he was once capable of bench pressing 135 pounds as a senior member of Santa Monica High School&#x27;s baseball team, which has become a reoccurring punchline on his ‘Literally’ podcast.

==Career==
===1970s===

Lowe got his first professional acting role in 1976 when he was 12 and still living in Dayton. He played an errand boy in a production of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; at the Wright State University summer theater. He landed the part by calling every local theater and asking each if there was a part for a child in a play. Lowe was paid $150 for the role. In 1979, Lowe landed the part of Tony Flanagan in the short-lived television comedy &quot;A New Kind of Family&quot;.

===1980s===

One of Lowe&#x27;s earliest roles came in the 1983 television film &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child&quot;, for which he received his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. He also appeared in the music video for The Go-Go&#x27;s song, &quot;Turn to You&quot;. His breakthrough role was his big-screen debut in 1983, when he and Emilio Estevez were cast in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. Lowe played the role of Sodapop Curtis, the brother of the main characters Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) and Darrel Curtis (Patrick Swayze). In 1984, he starred opposite Jodie Foster in Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot;. Lowe and Estevez reunited in &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, making them the two more prominent actors from the group known as the Brat Pack. &quot;About Last Night...&quot; followed, with Demi Moore (who had starred alongside Lowe in &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;). He then received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the mentally disabled Rory in &quot;Square Dance&quot; (1987). In August 1987, he performed on stage, playing Baron Tusenbach in Chekov&#x27;s &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; at The Williamstown Theatre Festival. In 1993, while filming a British TV production of the Tennessee Williams play &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; with Maggie Smith and Natasha Richardson, he recalled in an interview that he had run into Paul Newman four years earlier at the Williamstown Theatre Festival, and that Newman had encouraged him to continue to work in theatre.

In 1989, as part of the opening ceremony for the (critically derided) telecast of the 61st Academy Awards produced by Allan Carr, Lowe made his musical debut singing a reworked duet of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Proud Mary&quot; alongside actress Eileen Bowman, who was dressed as an unauthorized depiction of Snow White.

===1990s===
Lowe appeared in 1992&#x27;s Wayne&#x27;s World and 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot;, based on Stephen King&#x27;s book of the same name.

He played Sam Seaborn in the television series &quot;The West Wing&quot; from 1999 to 2003 (and briefly in 2006). His performance in the show garnered Lowe a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and two Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a Drama Series. Lowe was drawn to the role because of his personal love of politics, and his longstanding friendship with Martin Sheen, who was cast as President Josiah Bartlet.

When the show premiered, Lowe was considered the lead, and the pilot centered on his character. But as other members of the cast —including Allison Janney, Richard Schiff, Janel Moloney, Dulé Hill, John Spencer, Bradley Whitford, Martin Sheen (who was initially scripted as a small role), and Stockard Channing (whose First Lady was initially scripted as a guest role)— grew more popular, Lowe&#x27;s character no longer served as the show&#x27;s main focus. Lowe and series creator Aaron Sorkin soon found themselves at odds over the network&#x27;s meddling with the show, most notably the network demanding changes in Lowe&#x27;s character. Eventually, Lowe left the series, not long before Sorkin and director/executive producer Thomas Schlamme resigned over a dispute with NBC.

During the final season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Lowe returned to his role of Sam Seaborn, appearing in two of the final four episodes. In 2011, Lowe stated on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; that he left the show because he did not feel he was being respected, when the other lead characters received a raise and he did not.

===2000s===
After leaving &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Lowe was the star and executive producer of a failed NBC drama, &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot; (2003). In 2004, he tried again in a series entitled &quot;Dr. Vegas&quot;, but it also was quickly canceled.

Lowe passed on the role of Derek Shepherd of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, which eventually went to Patrick Dempsey.

Despite his two canceled TV series and flops like &quot;View From the Top&quot; and the made-for-TV movie &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; during his post–&quot;West Wing&quot; run, Lowe found success in the TV miniseries genre. In 2004, Lowe starred in the TNT remake of the Stephen King miniseries &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, which was the highest-rated cable program of that summer and the highest ratings TNT original programming had at the time.

In 2005, he starred as Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee in Sorkin&#x27;s London West End production of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, the first time the two had worked together since &quot;The West Wing&quot;. Although Lowe had expressed unhappiness about his decreased role on that show at the time of his departure, he has now repeatedly said that any animosity between them is over and that he was pleased to be working once more with Sorkin.

That same year, Lowe starred in the miniseries &quot;Beach Girls&quot; on the Lifetime network, based on the Luanne Rice novel of the same name. The series premiere received the highest ratings for a movie premiere in Lifetime history. Later, Lowe filmed his supporting role as a movie agent in the 2006 independent film &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;.

In 2006, he filmed &quot;The Perfect Day&quot; for TNT, in which he took a pay cut to film in New Orleans in order to help the Hurricane Katrina-ravaged area. That same year, Lowe filmed &quot;Stir of Echoes: The Homecoming&quot;, the sequel to the 1999 Kevin Bacon thriller &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot;, and it was announced that Lowe would join the cast of &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; for a guest run of several episodes.

In January 2007, ABC announced that Lowe would be staying on &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; as a &quot;special guest star&quot; for the rest of Season 1 after Lowe&#x27;s initial appearance on the show in November 2006 brought the best ratings and demographic showing for the show since its premiere. Soon after ABC announced an early Season 2 renewal for &quot;Brother &amp; Sisters&quot; in March 2007, Lowe announced he would be returning for the show&#x27;s second season. He continued to appear in the series until the end of the 2009–10 season. Then, Lowe announced he would leave, unhappy with the stories and his lack of screen time in the fourth season. In an episode broadcast on May 16, 2010, his character was part of a multi-vehicle crash involving a large truck and was put into a coma. The storyline was wrapped up in the first episode of the fifth season; Lowe did not appear in the episode.

In June 2006, he was the guest host for an episode in the third series of &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4. Lowe has also appeared in a televised advertisement for &#x27;Visit California&#x27; with other celebrities, including Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. (In the advertisement campaign, he was usually pictured in a white tee-shirt printed with the California state flag.)

Lowe had a supporting role in the 2009 movie &quot;The Invention of Lying&quot; and a leading role in &quot;Too Late to Say Goodbye&quot;.

===2010s===

In 2010, he appeared in the biography of the Brat Packers called: &quot;Brat Pack: Where Are They Now?&quot; He also appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Lowe is currently teaming up with 44 Blue to produce a reality series entitled &quot;Potomac Fever&quot; about young adults living in Washington, D.C.

In July 2010, it was announced that Lowe would be providing the voice for the superhero Captain Marvel in the animated series &quot;Young Justice&quot;. It was also announced in July 2010 that Lowe would become a series regular on the series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. He portrayed Chris Traeger, the relentlessly upbeat city manager of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana, for four seasons, before his character was written out of the show in 2014. He was so pleased with the show and his guest appearances on season 2 that he agreed to become a full-fledged cast member. He reprised the role in the 2015 series finale, &quot;One Last Ride&quot;, and in the 2020 special episode &quot;A &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; Special&quot;.

In 2011, Lowe guest starred in a recurring role on Showtime&#x27;s comedy &quot;Californication&quot;. Lowe featured as the troubled but in-demand actor Eddie Nero – a character based upon &quot;about ten people,&quot; according to Lowe but somewhat contradicted by sources at Showtime itself – employed to portray Hank in a film version of his book, &quot;Fucking and Punching&quot;.

In 2011, Lowe wrote a memoir titled &quot;Stories I Only Tell My Friends&quot;, which was released in May 2011. During his promotional tour for &quot;Stories I Only Tell My Friends&quot;, Lowe told Australian radio show &quot;The Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show&quot; that during his five-day press visit to Australia in 1990, he was so badly affected by the overuse of painkillers that the only two things he remembers from the trip were being at the Sydney Zoo and getting a tattoo, although he states in his book that he does not remember getting the tattoo. In 2014, Lowe wrote a second book titled &quot;Love Life&quot;, which was released in April that year. He uses stories and observations from his life in a poignant and humorous series of true tales about men and women, art and commerce, fathers and sons, addiction and recovery, and sex and love.

In 2014, Lowe starred in a pilot for the single-camera comedy &quot;The Pro&quot; as Ben Bertrahm, a former professional tennis player. The pilot was not picked up for series. He also narrated &quot;The &#x27;90s: The Last Great Decade?&quot; on the National Geographic Channel, which aired in July of that year. In 2015, Lowe starred in the satirical thriller &quot;Pocket Listing&quot;

Lowe has been a commercial spokesman for DirecTV since fall 2014. Commercials featuring Lowe contrast him with some alternate, less appealing form of Lowe, who instead has cable. The advertisements were pulled in April 2015 after the National Advertising Division, acting on a complaint by Comcast, found DirecTV&#x27;s claims about its customer satisfaction, quality, and ranking to be less than truthful.

In February 2015, Fox announced they had greenlit a pilot for the comedy &quot;The Grinder&quot; starring Lowe and Fred Savage, and directed by Jake Kasdan. The series, in which Lowe starred as a washed-up actor starting a new career as a lawyer, was cancelled after one season.

In November 2015, Lowe voiced Simba in the television pilot movie &quot;The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar&quot;. Lowe continued to voice Simba for its subsequent series &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;.

In December 2015, Lowe was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His star is located in front of the Musso and Frank Grill on Hollywood Boulevard.

In 2015, Lowe launched Profile™, a men&#x27;s skincare product line. The line features a collection of five antiaging products specially formulated for men. It is currently sold at Nordstrom stores and online. The product collection includes a cleanser, a shave gel, an aftershave serum, a moisturizer, and an eye serum in the price range of $24.50 to $59.50. In 2016, Lowe launched a fragrance product line called 18 Amber Wood with the Profile™ brand.

On August 27, 2016, a Comedy Central Roast TV special was recorded and aired on September 5, 2016, with Rob Lowe as the Roastee and David Spade as Roast Master. Amongst the Roasters were Jewel, Nikki Glaser, Ralph Macchio, Pete Davidson, Peyton Manning, Rob Riggle, Jimmy Carr, Ann Coulter and the &quot;Roast Master General&quot; Jeff Ross.

On April 21, 2017, KFC released a campaign featuring Lowe as astronaut Colonel Sanders giving a JFK speech spoof/homage about launching the Zinger chicken sandwich into space. Lowe said in a statement that when he was a child, his grandfather took him to meet Harland Sanders.

In late autumn 2017, Lowe began a reality series with his two sons, 24-year-old Matthew and 22-year-old Jon Owen, on A&amp;E titled &quot;The Lowe Files&quot;. With the exception of the hour-long pilot, the series featured 30-minute road trips with the Lowe boys, and occasional TV guest stars known in the field, investigating common urban myths and legends that Rob has loved since he was a young boy and has shared with his boys throughout their growth. Some of the topics being explored are Bigfoot/Sasquatch, the alleged unidentified &quot;submerged&quot; objects that may have a base off the coast from Los Angeles, alien abduction, and ghosts and their direct responses to stimuli. The series debuted on August 2, 2017, and lasted one season. Lowe has said he hadn&#x27;t planned on more than one season because of scheduling difficulties.

On January 3, 2018, Atkins Nutritionals announced Lowe as a new brand spokesperson. Due to his &quot;low carb lifestyle,&quot; Lowe was selected for a series of multimedia ads that were still appearing in 2024.

In October 2018, it was announced that Lowe would star in an ITV series, &quot;Wild Bill&quot;, about an American policeman who moves to Boston, Lincolnshire with his daughter. While the show was cancelled by ITV after one season, there were hopes it would be picked up by Netflix or Hulu at a future date.

On March 19, 2019, Lowe began hosting the Fox competition series &quot;Mental Samurai&quot; where he also served as a producer. It lasted two seasons.

=== 2020s ===
Lowe began hosting a podcast called &quot;Literally! With Rob Lowe&quot; on June 25, 2020. Guests included Chris Pratt and Conan O&#x27;Brien. In September 2021, Lowe launched a second podcast, a &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; recap show called &quot;Parks and Recollection&quot;, alongside &quot;Parks and Rec&quot; writer and producer Alan Yang.

Lowe directed a short documentary, &quot;Madness in the Hills&quot;, which is about the mudslides that killed 23 people in Southern California in January 2018, including many friends and neighbors of Lowe. It debuted on the Peacock streaming service on October 9, 2020.

On May 12, 2019, it was announced that a spin-off the &quot;9-1-1&quot; series titled &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot; was ordered to series with Lowe in the starring role of Owen Strand. The series premiered on January 19, 2020, to generally favorable reviews and was renewed for a second season, which premiered on January 18, 2021. The fifth and final season concluded on February 3, 2025.

In June 2021, as a surprise birthday present to his wife, he fulfilled her dream to be a contestant with him and their children on &quot;Celebrity&quot; &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

On August 6, 2021, Deadline revealed that Lowe will star and executive produce the Netflix movie &quot;Dog Gone&quot;.

Lowe will offer commentary in &quot;The Andy Warhol Diaries&quot;, premiering on Netflix on March 9, 2022.

On April 6, 2022, it was announced that Lowe will star in and executive produce &quot;Unstable&quot; with Victor Fresco and his son John Owen Lowe for Netflix. The show, which follows Lowe as successful biotech entrepreneur Ellis Dragon as he struggles to deal with his son and regain his footing following the death of his wife, premiered on March 30, 2023.

In January 2024 he began hosting &quot;The Floor,&quot; a trivia game show. In March 2024 he signed a production deal with Fox following the show&#x27;s renewal on the network for seasons two and three.

In 2024, he appeared in Andrew McCarthy&#x27;s Hulu documentary about the Brat Pack titled &quot;Brats&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family and relationships===
Lowe has been married to former makeup artist Sheryl Berkoff since 1991. She has worked as an interior designer and founder of Sheryl Lowe Jewelry. They met on a blind date in 1983, and again on the set of Lowe&#x27;s movie &quot;Bad Influence&quot;. They have two sons: Matthew Edward Lowe (b. 1993) and John Owen Lowe (b. 1995).

Lowe is a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Rams.

===Sex tape===
In 1988, Lowe, who was 24 years old at the time, was involved in a sex scandal over a videotape of him having sex with two women, one of whom was 22 and the other her 16-year-old friend. The three met at Club Rio, an Atlanta nightclub. They were videotaped the night before the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. As the age of consent in Georgia was 14 at the time (in 1995 it was raised to 16), both were of legal age to engage in sexual activity, but 18 was the legal age to be involved in such a recording. At the time, Lowe was campaigning for Michael Dukakis. Eventually, his career rebounded and Lowe mocked his own behavior during two post-scandal appearances as host of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===Sobriety===
Lowe began drinking heavily as a teenager. His early fame allowed him to lead a hard-partying lifestyle that was covered extensively in the tabloids. In 1990, two years following the sex tape scandal, Lowe decided to quit drinking and completed an extensive alcohol rehabilitation program. He has maintained sobriety ever since, saying it was the best decision of his life. Adopting a daily Transcendental Meditation practice has been instrumental to his well-being. &quot;It&#x27;s changed my life,&quot; says Lowe.

===Nanny lawsuit cases===
In April 2008, Lowe filed separate lawsuits against three former employees, accusing them of breach of contract, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Lowe accused an ex‑nanny of engaging in a scheme to hurt him and his wife by spreading &quot;malicious lies.&quot; Another former nanny was accused of falsely claiming to have had a personal and intimate relationship with Lowe, and also repeatedly expressing romantic interest in Lowe, claiming Lowe sexually harassed her and that Sheryl Lowe was an abusive employer. Lowe also claimed a former chef engaged in sex on their bed when the family was out of town, stole prescription drugs from the Lowes, broke several security cameras, overcharged them for food, and allegedly made statements to various people that Sheryl was heartless, cold, and unclean.

Jessica Gibson, Lowe&#x27;s 24-year-old former nanny, made 12 allegations against Lowe involving sexual harassment claims and labor-code violations. On June 19, 2008, Santa Barbara, California, Superior Court Judge Denise de Bellefeuille dismissed two allegations regarding labor-code violations due to lack of legal basis. The legal battle ended in May 2009. The press reported that court records showed that lawsuits filed by both nannies and Lowe were dismissed in Santa Barbara. Attorneys for both women and Lowe sought the dismissals.

==Philanthropy==
Lowe was the first male spokesman for the 2000 Lee National Denim Day fundraiser, which raises money for breast cancer research and education. His grandmother and great-grandmother both suffered from breast cancer, and his mother died of the disease in late 2003.

Lowe is a founder of the Homeowner&#x27;s Defense Fund, a Santa Barbara County non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to local control of land-use planning and transparency in government. The average price of tract homes in Santa Barbara in early 2006 was US$1,100,000, which motivated some to propose denser housing on existing lots. While in favor of increasing housing density, Lowe sought to build a mansion for himself on an empty lot in Montecito, California. His protest over the appearance of the address of the empty lot in the &quot;Santa Barbara News-Press&quot; precipitated a mass resignation of senior employees at that newspaper on July 6, 2006.

<text>Six Sigma (6σ) is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986.

Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. This is done by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction.

The term &quot;Six Sigma&quot; originates from statistical quality control, a reference to the fraction of a normal curve that lies within six standard deviations of the mean, used to represent a defect rate.

== History ==
Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a &quot;six sigma&quot; goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991 (); on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.

Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE&#x27;s CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy. In 1998 GE announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality.

In , some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting &quot;business and operational excellence&quot;.

In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published the first standard &quot;ISO 13053:2011&quot; defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs.

=== Etymology ===
The term Six Sigma comes from statistics, specifically from the field of statistical quality control, which evaluates process capability. Originally, it referred to the ability of manufacturing processes to produce a very high proportion of output within specification. Processes that operate with &quot;six sigma quality&quot; over the short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO). The 3.4 dpmo is based on a &quot;shift&quot; of ± 1.5 sigma explained by Mikel Harry. This figure is based on the tolerance in the height of a stack of discs.

Specifically, say that there are six standard deviations—represented by the Greek letter σ (sigma)—between the mean—represented by μ (mu)—and the nearest specification limit. As process standard deviation goes up, or the mean of the process moves away from the center of the tolerance, fewer standard deviations will fit between the mean and the nearest specification limit, decreasing the sigma number and increasing the likelihood of items outside specification. According to a calculation method employed in process capability studies, this means that practically no items will fail to meet specifications.

One should also note that the calculation of sigma levels for a process data is independent of the data being normally distributed. In one of the criticisms of Six Sigma, practitioners using this approach spend a lot of time transforming data from non-normal to normal using transformation techniques. It must be said that sigma levels can be determined for process data that has evidence of non-normality.

==Doctrine==

Six Sigma asserts that:
* Continuous efforts to achieve stable and predictable process results (e.g., by reducing process variation) are of vital importance to business success.
* Manufacturing and business processes have characteristics that can be defined, measured, analyzed, improved, and controlled.
* Achieving sustained quality improvement requires commitment from the entire organization, particularly from top-level management.

Features that set Six Sigma apart from previous quality-improvement initiatives include:
* Focus on achieving measurable and quantifiable financial returns
* Emphasis on management leadership and support
* Commitment to making decisions on the basis of verifiable data and statistical methods rather than assumptions and guesswork

In fact, lean management and Six Sigma share similar methodologies and tools, including the fact that both were influenced by Japanese business culture. However, lean management primarily focuses on eliminating waste through tools that target organizational efficiencies while integrating a performance improvement system, while Six Sigma focuses on eliminating defects and reducing variation. Both systems are driven by data, though Six Sigma is much more dependent on accurate data.

Six Sigma&#x27;s implicit goal is to improve all processes but not necessarily to the 3.4 DPMO level. Organizations need to determine an appropriate sigma level for each of their most important processes and strive to achieve these. As a result of this goal, it is incumbent on management of the organization to prioritize areas of improvement.

===Methodologies===
Six Sigma projects follow two project methodologies, inspired by W. Edwards Deming&#x27;s Plan–Do–Study–Act Cycle, each with five phases.
* DMAIC (&quot;duh-may-ick&quot;, ) is used for projects aimed at improving an existing business process
* DMADV (&quot;duh-mad-vee&quot;, ) is used for projects aimed at creating new product or process designs

====DMAIC====
The DMAIC project methodology has five phases:
* &quot; Define&quot; the system, the voice of the customer and their requirements, and the project goals, specifically.
* &quot; Measure&quot; key aspects of the current process and collect relevant data; calculate the &quot;as-is&quot; process capability
* &quot; Analyze&quot; the data to investigate and verify cause and effect. Determine what the relationships are, and attempt to ensure that all factors have been considered. Seek out the root cause of the defect under investigation.
* &quot; Improve&quot; or optimize the current process based upon data analysis using techniques such as design of experiments, poka yoke or mistake proofing, and standard work to create a new, future state process. Set up pilot runs to establish process capability.
* &quot; Control&quot; the future state process to ensure that any deviations from the target are corrected before they result in defects. Implement control systems such as statistical process control, production boards, visual workplaces, and continuously monitor the process. This process is repeated until the desired quality level is obtained. 
Some organizations add a &quot;Recognize&quot; step at the beginning, which is to recognize the right problem to work on, thus yielding an RDMAIC methodology.

====DMADV====
Also known as DFSS (&quot;Design For Six Sigma&quot;), the DMADV methodology&#x27;s five phases are:
* &quot; Define&quot; design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the enterprise strategy.
* &quot; Measure&quot; and identify CTQs (characteristics that are Critical To Quality), measure product capabilities, production process capability, and measure risks.
* &quot; Analyze&quot; to develop and design alternatives
* &quot; Design&quot; an improved alternative, best suited per analysis in the previous step
* &quot; Verify&quot; the design, set up pilot runs, implement the production process and hand it over to the process owner(s).

=== Professionalization ===
One key innovation of Six Sigma involves professionalizing quality management. Prior to Six Sigma, quality management was largely relegated to the production floor and to statisticians in a separate quality department. Formal Six Sigma programs adopt an elite ranking terminology similar to martial arts systems like judo to define a hierarchy (and career path) that spans business functions and levels.

Six Sigma identifies several roles for successful implementation:
* &quot;Executive Leadership&quot; includes the CEO and other members of top management. They are responsible for setting up a vision for Six Sigma implementation. They also empower other stakeholders with the freedom and resources to transcend departmental barriers and overcome resistance to change.
* &quot;Champions&quot; take responsibility for Six Sigma implementation across the organization. The Executive Leadership draws them from upper management. Champions also act as mentors to Black Belts.
* &quot;Master Black Belts&quot;, identified by Champions, act as in-house coaches on Six Sigma. They devote all of their time to Six Sigma, assisting Champions and guiding Black Belts and Green Belts. In addition to statistical tasks, they ensure that Six Sigma is applied consistently across departments and job functions.
* &quot;Black Belts&quot; operate under Master Black Belts to apply Six Sigma to specific projects. They also devote all of their time to Six Sigma. They primarily focus on Six Sigma project execution and special leadership with special tasks, whereas Champions and Master Black Belts focus on identifying projects/functions for Six Sigma.
* &quot;Green Belts&quot; are the employees who take up Six Sigma implementation along with their other job responsibilities, operating under the guidance of Black Belts.

According to proponents, special training is needed for all of these practitioners to ensure that they follow the methodology and use the data-driven approach correctly.

Some organizations use additional belt colors, such as &quot;yellow belts&quot;, for employees that have basic training in Six Sigma tools and generally participate in projects, and &quot;white belts&quot; for those locally trained in the concepts but do not participate in the project team. &quot;Orange belts&quot; are also mentioned to be used for special cases.

===Certification===

General Electric and Motorola developed certification programs as part of their Six Sigma implementation. Following this approach, many organizations in the 1990s started offering Six Sigma certifications to their employees. In 2008 Motorola University later co-developed with Vative and the Lean Six Sigma Society of Professionals a set of comparable certification standards for Lean Certification. Criteria for Green Belt and Black Belt certification vary; some companies simply require participation in a course and a Six Sigma project. There is no standard certification body, and different certifications are offered by various quality associations for a fee. The American Society for Quality, for example, requires Black Belt applicants to pass a written exam and to provide a signed affidavit stating that they have completed two projects or one project combined with three years&#x27; practical experience in the body of knowledge.

===Tools and methods===
Within the individual phases of a DMAIC or DMADV project, Six Sigma uses many established quality-management tools that are also used outside Six Sigma. The following list shows an overview of the main methods used.

==Role of the 1.5 sigma shift==
Experience has shown that processes usually do not perform as well in the long term as they do in the short term. As a result, the number of sigmas that will fit between the process mean and the nearest specification limit may well drop over time, compared to an initial short-term study. To account for this real-life increase in process variation over time, an empirically based 1.5 sigma shift is introduced into the calculation. Mikel Harry, the creator of Six Sigma, based the 1.5 sigma shift on the height of a stack of discs. He called this &quot;Benderizing&quot;. He claimed that based on his stack, all processes shift 1.5 sigma every 50 samples. According to this idea, a process that fits 6 sigma between the process mean and the nearest specification limit in a short-term study will in the long term fit only 4.5 sigma – either because the process mean will move over time, or because the long-term standard deviation of the process will be greater than that observed in the short term, or both.

Hence the widely accepted definition of a six sigma process is a process that produces 3.4 defective parts per million opportunities (DPMO). This is based on the fact that a process that is normally distributed will have 3.4 parts per million outside the limits, when the limits are six sigma from the &quot;original&quot; mean of zero and the process mean is then shifted by 1.5 sigma (and therefore, the six sigma limits are no longer symmetrical about the mean). The former six sigma distribution, when under the effect of the 1.5 sigma shift, is commonly referred to as a 4.5 sigma process. The failure rate of a six sigma distribution with the mean shifted 1.5 sigma is not equivalent to the failure rate of a 4.5 sigma process with the mean-centered on zero. This allows for the fact that special causes may result in a deterioration in process performance over time and is designed to prevent underestimation of the defect levels likely to be encountered in real-life operation.

The role of the sigma shift is mainly academic. The purpose of six sigma is to generate organizational performance improvement. It is up to the organization to determine, based on customer expectations, what the appropriate sigma level of a process is. The purpose of the sigma value is as a comparative figure to determine whether a process is improving, deteriorating, stagnant or non-competitive with others in the same business. Six Sigma (3.4 DPMO) is not the goal of all processes.

===Sigma levels===

The table below gives long-term DPMO values corresponding to various short-term sigma levels.

These figures assume that the process mean will shift by 1.5 sigma toward the side with the critical specification limit. In other words, they assume that after the initial study determining the short-term sigma level, the long-term Cpk value will turn out to be 0.5 less than the short-term Cpk value. So, now for example, the DPMO figure given for 1 sigma assumes that the long-term process mean will be 0.5 sigma beyond the specification limit (Cpk = –0.17), rather than 1 sigma within it, as it was in the short-term study (Cpk = 0.33). Note that the defect percentages indicate only defects exceeding the specification limit to which the process mean is nearest. Defects beyond the far specification limit are not included in the percentages.

The formula used here to calculate the DPMO is thus
formula_1

== In practice ==

Six Sigma mostly finds application in large organizations. According to industry consultants like Thomas Pyzdek and John Kullmann, companies with fewer than 500 employees are less suited to Six Sigma or need to adapt the standard approach to making it work for them. Six Sigma, however, contains a large number of tools and techniques that work well in small to mid-size organizations. The fact that an organization is not big enough to be able to afford black belts does not diminish its ability to make improvements using this set of tools and techniques. The infrastructure described as necessary to support Six Sigma is a result of the size of the organization rather than a requirement of Six Sigma itself.

=== Manufacturing ===
After its first application at Motorola in the late 1980s, other internationally recognized firms currently recorded high number of savings after applying Six Sigma. Examples include Johnson &amp; Johnson, with $600 million of reported savings, Texas Instruments, which saved over $500 million as well as Telefónica, which reported €30 million in savings in the first 10 months; Sony and Boeing also reported successfully reducing waste.

===Engineering and construction===
Although companies have considered common quality control and process improvement strategies, there&#x27;s still a need for more reasonable and effective methods as all the desired standards and client satisfaction have not always been reached. There is still a need for an essential analysis that can control the factors affecting concrete cracks and slippage between concrete and steel. After conducting a case study on Tinjin Xianyi Construction Technology, it was found that construction time and construction waste were reduced by 26.2% and 67% accordingly after adopting Six Sigma. Similarly, Six Sigma implementation was studied at one of the largest engineering and construction companies in the world: Bechtel Corporation, where after an initial investment of $30 million in a Six Sigma program that included identifying and preventing rework and defects, over $200 million were saved.

=== Finance ===
Six Sigma has played an important role by improving the accuracy of allocation of cash to reduce bank charges, automatic payments, improving the accuracy of reporting, reducing documentary credit defects, reducing check collection defects, and reducing variation in collector performance.

For example, Bank of America announced in 2004 that Six Sigma had helped it increase customer satisfaction by 10.4% and decrease customer issues by 24%; similarly, American Express eliminated non-received renewal credit cards. Other financial institutions that have adopted Six Sigma include GE Capital and JPMorgan Chase, where customer satisfaction was the main objective.

===Supply chain===
In the supply-chain field, it is important to ensure that products are delivered to clients at the right time while preserving high-quality standards. By changing the schematic diagram for the supply chain, Six Sigma can ensure quality control on products (defect-free) and guarantee delivery deadlines, the two main issues in the supply chain.

=== Healthcare ===
This is a sector that has been highly matched with this doctrine for many years because of the nature of zero tolerance for mistakes and potential for reducing medical errors involved in healthcare. The goal of Six Sigma in healthcare is broad and includes reducing the inventory of equipment that brings extra costs, altering the process of healthcare delivery in order to make it more efficient and refining reimbursements. A study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, which recorded an increase in examinations with no additional machines of 45% and a reduction in patients&#x27; preparation time of 40 minutes; from 45 minutes to 5 minutes in multiple cases.

Lean Six Sigma was adopted in 2003 at Stanford hospitals and was introduced at Red Cross hospitals in 2002.

==Criticism==
While there are many advocates for a Six Sigma approach for the reasons stated above, more than half of projects are unsuccessful: in 2010, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that more than 60% of projects fail. A review of academic literature found 34 common failure factors in 56 papers on Lean, Six Sigma, and LSS from 1995-2013. Among them are (summarized):
* Lack of top management attitude, commitment, and involvement; lack of leadership and vision
* Lack of training and education; lack of resources (financial, technical, human, etc.)
* Poor project selection and prioritization; weak link to strategic objectives of the organization
* Resistance to culture change; Poor communication; Lack of consideration of the human factors
* Lack of awareness of the benefits of Lean/Six Sigma; Lack of technical understanding of tools, techniques, and practices

Others have provided other criticisms.

===Lack of originality===
Quality expert Joseph M. Juran described Six Sigma as &quot;a basic version of quality improvement&quot;, stating that &quot;there is nothing new there. It includes what we used to call facilitators. They&#x27;ve adopted more flamboyant terms, like belts with different colors. I think that concept has merit to set apart, to create specialists who can be very helpful. Again, that&#x27;s not a new idea. The American Society for Quality long ago established certificates, such as for reliability engineers.&quot;

===Inadequate for complex manufacturing===
Quality expert Philip B. Crosby pointed out that the Six Sigma standard does not go far enough—customers deserve defect-free products every time. For example, under the Six Sigma standard, semiconductors, which require the flawless etching of millions of tiny circuits onto a single chip, are all defective.

===Role of consultants===
The use of &quot;Black Belts&quot; as itinerant change agents has fostered an industry of training and certification. Critics have argued there is overselling of Six Sigma by too great a number of consulting firms, many of which claim expertise in Six Sigma when they have only a rudimentary understanding of the tools and techniques involved or the markets or industries in which they are acting.

===Potential negative effects===
A &quot;Fortune&quot; article stated that &quot;of 58 large companies that have announced Six Sigma programs, 91% have trailed the S&amp;P 500 since&quot;. The statement was attributed to &quot;an analysis by Charles Holland of consulting firm Qualpro (which espouses a competing quality-improvement process)&quot;. The summary of the article is that Six Sigma is effective at what it is intended to do, but that it is &quot;narrowly designed to fix an existing process&quot; and does not help in &quot;coming up with new products or disruptive technologies.&quot;

===Over-reliance on statistics===
More direct criticism is the &quot;rigid&quot; nature of Six Sigma with its over-reliance on methods and tools. In most cases, more attention is paid to reducing variation and searching for any significant factors, and less attention is paid to developing robustness in the first place (which can altogether eliminate the need for reducing variation). The extensive reliance on significance testing and use of multiple regression techniques increase the risk of making commonly unknown types of statistical errors or mistakes. A possible consequence of Six Sigma&#x27;s array of &quot;p&quot;-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism. One of the most serious but all-too-common misuses of inferential statistics is to take a model that was developed through exploratory model building and subject it to the same sorts of statistical tests that are used to validate a model that was specified in advance.

Another comment refers to the oft-mentioned Transfer Function, which seems to be a flawed theory if looked at in detail. Since significance tests were first popularized many objections have been voiced by prominent and respected statisticians. The volume of criticism and rebuttal has filled books with language seldom used in the scholarly debate of a dry subject. Much of the first criticism was already published more than 40 years ago (see ).

In a 2006 issue of &quot;USA Army Logistician&quot; an article critical of Six Sigma noted: &quot;The dangers of a single paradigmatic orientation (in this case, that of technical rationality) can blind us to values associated with double-loop learning and the learning organization, organization adaptability, workforce creativity and development, humanizing the workplace, cultural awareness, and strategy making.&quot;

===1.5 sigma shift===
The statistician Donald J. Wheeler has dismissed the 1.5 sigma shift as &quot;goofy&quot; because of its arbitrary nature. Its universal applicability is seen as doubtful.

The 1.5 sigma shift has also become contentious because it results in stated &quot;sigma levels&quot; that reflect short-term rather than long-term performance: a process that has long-term defect levels corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance is, by Six Sigma convention, described as a &quot;six sigma process&quot;. The accepted Six Sigma scoring system thus cannot be equated to actual normal distribution probabilities for the stated number of standard deviations, and this has been a key bone of contention over how Six Sigma measures are defined. The fact that it is rarely explained that a &quot;6 sigma&quot; process will have long-term defect rates corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance rather than actual 6 sigma performance has led several commentators to express the opinion that Six Sigma is a confidence trick.

===Stifling creativity in research===
According to John Dodge, editor in chief of &quot;Design News&quot;, the use of Six Sigma is inappropriate in a research environment. Dodge states &quot;excessive metrics, steps, measurements and Six Sigma&#x27;s intense focus on reducing variability water down the discovery process. Under Six Sigma, the free-wheeling nature of brainstorming and the serendipitous side of discovery is stifled.&quot; He concludes &quot;there&#x27;s general agreement that freedom in basic or pure research is preferable while Six Sigma works best in incremental innovation when there&#x27;s an expressed commercial goal.&quot;

A &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; article says that James McNerney&#x27;s introduction of Six Sigma at 3M had the effect of stifling creativity and reports its removal from the research function. It cites two Wharton School professors who say that Six Sigma leads to incremental innovation at the expense of blue skies research. This phenomenon is further explored in the book &quot;Going Lean&quot;, which describes a related approach known as lean dynamics and provides data to show that Ford&#x27;s 6 Sigma program did little to change its fortunes.

===Lack of documentation===
One criticism voiced by Yasar Jarrar and Andy Neely from the Cranfield School of Management&#x27;s Centre for Business Performance is that while Six Sigma is a powerful approach, it can also unduly dominate an organization&#x27;s culture; and they add that much of the Six Sigma literature – in a remarkable way (six-sigma claims to be evidence, scientifically based) – lacks academic rigor:

<text>Geoffrey Howard Perkins (22 February 1953 – 29 August 2008) was a British comedy producer, writer and performer. He was BBC head of comedy between 1995 and 2001, and produced the first two radio series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. He is one of the people credited with creating the panel game Mornington Crescent for &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;. In December 2008 he posthumously received an Outstanding Contribution to Comedy Award.

==Early life==
Perkins attended the Harrow County Grammar School, alongside Nigel Sheinwald, Michael Portillo and Clive Anderson, with whom he ran the debating society. He took an early interest in drama in 1970, and he worked with Clive Anderson to write a charity revue called &quot;Happy Poison&quot;.

Perkins read English literature while at Lincoln College, Oxford and while a student directed and wrote for The Oxford Revues of 1974 and 1975. After his time at Oxford, Perkins joined the Ocean Transport and Trading Company, where he was put to work studying waste timber in Liverpool. He did not last long in the field of commercial shipping. In 1977 drawing upon his work for the Oxford Revue, Perkins joined BBC Radio&#x27;s light entertainment department alongside Cambridge graduates John Lloyd and Griff Rhys Jones.

In 1986, Perkins married Lisa Braun, who was BBC studio manager on &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;. The couple lost their first child to cot death in 1986.

==Radio career==
Department head David Hatch assigned Perkins to help revitalise the comedy panel show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; (launched five years earlier). It introduced the incomprehensible Mornington Crescent game which would become an enduring success.

===&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;===


Perkins produced the first series of Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; in 1977 for BBC Radio 4, taking over from Simon Brett, the producer of the pilot. Perkins assisted the notoriously slow writer in finishing the scripts, before John Lloyd was drafted in to write large sections of the later episodes. Perkins also drew upon the resources of the Radiophonic Workshop to help create the groundbreaking audio effects for the series.

===&quot;Radio Active&quot;===
In 1980, Perkins co-wrote and featured in the radio sketch show &quot;Radio Active&quot;, revised and adapted from the early Oxford Revue shows, and initially based around the comedy parody group The Hee Bee Gee Bees, consisting of Philip Pope, Angus Deayton and Michael Fenton Stevens. Prior to its leap from the revue to the radio, the production toured and appeared at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, after which it was picked up by BBC Radio 4 for a pilot called &quot;The Oxford Revue Presents Radio Active&quot;. &quot;Radio Active&quot;, &quot;which poked fun at the amateurishness of some local radio broadcasting&quot;. It went on to run for seven series and won a Sony Award. Perkins portrayed a character called Mike Flex, a young cocky disc jockey. Perkins and Deayton wrote much of the series and later it was transferred to BBC2 television as the Grand Prix and Silver Rose of Montreux-winner &quot;KYTV&quot;.

Perkins is credited with writing the joke about Ringo not being the best drummer in The Beatles, frequently misattributed to John Lennon or Jasper Carrott. It was broadcast on Radio Active on 6 October 1981.

===Later radio work===
Perkins, with &quot;Radio Active&quot; colleague and co-writer Deayton, later produced &quot;The Uncyclopaedia of Rock&quot; for Capital Radio, winning the Monaco Radio Award for the show, and penning a 1987 tie-in book with Deayton and Jeremy Pascall. In 2005 Perkins had cameos in the fourth radio series of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; (The Quandary Phase), as the producer of the radio show on which Arthur Dent worked. Perkins essentially played a fictional version of himself from the first series with a fictional version of writer Douglas Adams.

==Television career==
===Hat Trick===

Perkins left the BBC in 1988, to become a director of Hat Trick Productions which is an independent television and radio production company. Hat Trick produced comedy programmes for the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The first main production of Perkins was &quot;Spitting Image&quot; where he met Ben Elton, and Harry Enfield whom he got to develop the character of Douglas Hurd by suggesting he adapt it along the lines of Frank Oz&#x27;s character Fozzie Bear. As a result Perkins developed shows for both performers, &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, which was hosted by Elton, sketch show &quot;The Man from Auntie&quot; with Elton, and Enfield&#x27;s &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Television Programme.&quot; Perkins also developed &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, &quot;Drop The Dead Donkey&quot;, and &quot;Father Ted&quot; for Hat Trick; the shows won many awards including Baftas.

===BBC Head of Comedy===
In 1995, he resigned from Hat Trick and returned to the BBC as BBC Television&#x27;s Head of Comedy, requesting his contract stipulated &quot;his continued role as a programme producer,&quot; as well as overseeing the department. He stayed in this role until 2001, growing increasingly dissatisfied at &quot;official BBC snootiness about comedy&quot;.

Perkins meticulously read 30 new scripts every week, but &quot;found himself culturally marginalised at the BBC,&quot; saying: &quot;Unfortunately, the term sitcom implies a great disdain. People say it with a curl of their lips.&quot; Under Director-General John Birt, Perkins also felt &quot;hamstrung by the inevitable bureaucracy,&quot; which not only hindered programme-making, but saw Perkins spending &quot;more time on budgets&quot; than more creative pursuits.

Perkins felt that the changes in how the BBC was run,

During Perkins&#x27; time as Head of Comedy, the BBC produced such hits including &quot;Coupling,&quot; &quot;The Thin Blue Line,&quot; &quot;Jonathan Creek,&quot; &quot;The Fast Show,&quot; &quot;The Royle Family&quot; and &quot;My Family&quot;. Perkins also persuaded David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst to star in a new series of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, the first of which was screened at Christmas 2001.

===Tiger Aspect===

Having left the BBC, Perkins became a creative director and executive producer for independent production company Tiger Aspect in late 2001. In this role, he was able to pursue a more hands-on role in the &quot;creative side of programme-making.&quot; For Tiger Aspect, Perkins produced programmes including &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot; for the BBC, and &quot;Benidorm&quot; for ITV.

==Television writing and acting credits==

Perkins&#x27; writing credits for television include &quot;The World According To Smith &amp; Jones&quot;, &quot;KYTV&quot;, &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Television Programme&quot;, &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot; and &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot;. 

In addition to starring in &quot;KYTV&quot;, Perkins appeared in small cameo roles in several of the comedy programmes he produced, including &quot;Father Ted&quot;, &quot;Operation Good Guys&quot;, &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; and &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;. He also hosted the panel game &quot;Don&#x27;t Quote Me&quot;, made by Open Media for Channel 4 in 1990.

In 2006, Harry Enfield was told by Peter Fincham, the controller of BBC One that he was too old to make another comedy sketch series. Enfield approached Geoffrey Perkins with his ideas, which Perkins helped Enfield develop into the first series of &quot;Harry and Paul&quot;, starring Enfield and Paul Whitehouse. The series was broadcast in April 2007.

==Death and tributes==
Perkins died on 29 August 2008. It had been initially thought that Perkins died from injuries sustained in an accident involving a lorry in Marylebone High Street, London; however, a coroner&#x27;s inquest in April 2009 determined that Perkins had suffered from an undiagnosed case of channelopathies, which caused his heart to stop suddenly. The jury decided that Perkins had probably already died when he fell under the wheels of the lorry and as such the coroner recorded that he died from &quot;natural causes&quot;.

On 5 September 2008 the second series of the re-titled &quot;Harry and Paul&quot; was broadcast, a week after his death. The first episode was dedicated to his memory and instead of the usual closing credits, featured a short tribute to him and concluded with an out-take of Perkins forgetting his lines in a sketch absent from the transmitted series. On 8 November 2008, BBC Two aired an evening of programmes in tribute to Perkins, comprising episodes of &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;, &quot;Father Ted&quot; (which the BBC was given special permission to broadcast by Channel 4, as part of the tribute) and &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, together with a special edition of &quot;Comedy Connections&quot; looking at Perkins&#x27; career in comedy.

He was posthumously awarded the &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Comedy&quot; award at the British Comedy Awards on 6 December 2008. The recipients of both of the BAFTAs awarded on 27 April 2009 to &quot;Harry and Paul&quot; for Best Comedy Programme and to &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; for Best Situation Comedy dedicated their awards to Perkins.

<text>Ta Mok (; born Chhit Choeun, ; 1924 – 21 July 2006), also known as Nguon Kang, was a Cambodian military chief and soldier who was a senior figure in the Khmer Rouge and the leader of the national army of Democratic Kampuchea. He was also known as &quot;Brother Number Five&quot; or &quot;the Butcher&quot;. He was captured along the Thailand-Cambodia border in March 1999 by Cambodian government forces while on the run with a small band of followers and was held in government custody until his death in 2006 while awaiting his war crime trial.

==Early life==
The eldest of seven children, he is believed to have been born into a prosperous country family from Pra Keap village, Trapeang Thom commune, Tram Kak district, Takeo Province, and was of Chinese-Cambodian descent. He became a Buddhist monk in the 1930s but left the order at the age of 16.

Ta Mok took part in the resistance against French colonial rule and then the anti-Japanese resistance during the 1940s. He was training to become a Bhikkhu in Pali, Cambodia when he joined the anti-French Khmer Issarak in 1952. He soon left Phnom Penh and joined the Khmer Rouge/Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK).

==In Khmer Rouge==
By the late 1960s he was a general and the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s chief-of-staff. He was also a member of the Standing Committee of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s Central Committee (&quot;Party Centre&quot;) during its period in power. He became very powerful within the party, especially in the south-west zone. He was named by Pol Pot as leader of the national army of Democratic Kampuchea. He lost the lower part of one leg in fighting around 1970 during the Cambodian Civil War.

Ta Mok orchestrated several massacres within the territories that he captured from 1973, beginning before the final, complete seizure of power by the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975. For example, his and Ke Pauk&#x27;s soldiers had 20,000 civilians murdered or forced into slave labour after capturing Oudong in March 1974.

He was also responsible for directing the massive purges that characterised the short-lived Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979), including the mass killing of 30,000 people in the Angkor Chey district, earning him the nickname &quot;Butcher&quot;.

==After the fall of the Khmer Rouge==

After the regime was overthrown by Vietnamese in 1979, Ta Mok remained a powerful figure, controlling the northern area of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s remaining territory from his base at Anlong Veng in the Dângrêk Mountains. It is estimated that some 3,000 to 5,000 combatants remained loyal to Pol Pot and were directed by Ta Mok.

In 1997, after a split in the party, Ta Mok seized control of one faction and named himself supreme commander. Pol Pot then fled the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s northern stronghold, but was later arrested and sentenced to lifelong house arrest. In April 1998, after a new government attack, Ta Mok fled into the forest and took Pol Pot with him. A few days later, on 15 April 1998, Pol Pot died in custody.

On 25 July 1997, Ta Mok and Pol Pot were interviewed separately by Nate Thayer. Unrepentant, Mok chuckled as he debated whether the KR had killed millions of people or just &quot;hundreds of thousands,&quot; claiming that he had only killed Vietnamese.

In 1998, after several key defections, Ta Mok was forced to flee to Anlong Veng. On 6 March 1999, the general was captured by the Cambodian army near the Thai border and brought to capital Phnom Penh, where he joined former comrade Khang Khek Ieu (&quot;Comrade Duch&quot;) at the Military Prosecution Department Detention Facility. Ta Mok was the last leading member of the Khmer Rouge to remain at large in Cambodia; other senior figures had died or already made immunity deals with the government of Hun Sen, including Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary.

In prison his detention period was repeatedly extended without his being brought to trial. Under Cambodian law his trial should have begun within six months of his arrest. First charged with membership of an outlawed group and tax evasion, in February 2002 he was charged with crimes against humanity. In poor health with respiratory problems, Ta Mok&#x27;s only releases from solitary confinement were for hospital visits. On 21 July 2006, due to heart complications caused by the stress of the upcoming trial, he died in a military hospital after falling into a coma.

Ta Mok&#x27;s house in Anlong Ven is a tourist site. A 2023 study found that villages that were governed by Ta Mok during the Khmer Rouge regime have persistently worse economic development outcomes than villages that were governed by more moderate elements of the Khmer Rouge.

<doc id="222458" wikidata="Q7452493" url="?curid=222458" title="Sequent Computer Systems">
<text>Sequent Computer Systems was a computer company that designed and manufactured multiprocessing computer systems. They were among the pioneers in high-performance symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) open systems, innovating in both hardware (e.g., cache management and interrupt handling) and software (e.g., read-copy-update).

Through a partnership with Oracle Corporation, Sequent became a dominant high-end UNIX platform in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Later they introduced a next-generation high-end platform for UNIX and Windows NT based on a non-uniform memory access architecture, NUMA-Q. As hardware prices fell in the late 1990s, and Intel shifted their server focus to the Itanium processor family, Sequent joined the Project Monterey effort in October 1998, which aimed to move a standard Unix to several new platforms.

In July 1999 Sequent agreed to be acquired by IBM. At the time, Sequent&#x27;s CEO said its technology would &quot;find its way through IBM&#x27;s entire product field&quot; and IBM announced it would &quot;both sell Sequent machines, and fold Sequent&#x27;s technology...into its own servers&quot;, but by May 2002 a decline in sales of the models acquired from Sequent, among other reasons, led to the retirement of Sequent-heritage products.

Vestiges of Sequent&#x27;s innovations live on in the form of data clustering software from PolyServe (subsequently acquired by HP), various projects within OSDL, IBM contributions to the Linux kernel, and claims in the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; lawsuit.

==History==

Originally named Sequel, Sequent was formed in 1983 when a group of seventeen engineers and executives left Intel after the failed iAPX 432 &quot;mainframe on a chip&quot; project was cancelled; they were joined by one non-Intel employee. They started Sequent to develop a line of SMP computers, then considered one of the up-and-coming fields in computer design.

===Balance===
Sequent&#x27;s first computer systems were the Balance 8000 (released in 1984) and Balance 21000 (released in 1986). Both models were based on 10 MHz National Semiconductor NS32032 processors, each with a small write-through cache connected to a common memory to form a shared memory system. The Balance 8000 supported up to 6 dual-processor boards for a total maximum of 12 processors. The Balance 21000 supported up to 15 dual-processor boards for a total maximum of 30 processors.

The systems ran a modified version of 4.2BSD Unix the company called DYNIX, for DYNamic unIX. The machines were designed to compete with the DEC VAX-11/780, with all of their inexpensive processors available to run any process. In addition the system included a series of libraries that could be used by programmers to develop applications that could use more than one processor at a time.

===Symmetry===
Their next series was the Intel 80386-based Symmetry, released in 1987. Various models supported between 2 and 30 processors, using a new copy-back cache and a wider 64-bit memory bus. 1991&#x27;s Symmetry 2000 models added multiple SCSI boards, and were offered in versions with from one to six Intel 80486 processors. The next year they added the VMEbus based Symmetry 2000/x50 with faster CPUs.
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw big changes on the software side for Sequent. DYNIX was replaced by DYNIX/ptx, which was based on a merger of AT&amp;T Corporation&#x27;s UNIX System V and 4.2BSD. And this was during a period when Sequent&#x27;s high-end systems became particularly successful due to a close working relationship with Oracle, specifically their high-end database servers. In 1993 they added the Symmetry 2000/x90 along with their ptx/Cluster software, which added various high availability features and introduced custom support for Oracle Parallel Server.

In 1994 Sequent introduced the Symmetry 5000 series models SE20, SE60 and SE90, which used 66 MHz Pentium CPUs in systems from 2 to 30 processors. The next year they expanded that with the SE30/70/100 lineup using 100 MHz Pentiums, and then in 1996 with the SE40/80/120 with 166 MHz Pentiums. A variant of the Symmetry 5000, the WinServer 5000 series, ran Windows NT instead of DYNIX/ptx.

===NUMA===
Recognizing the increase in competition for SMP systems after having been early adopters of the architecture, and the increasing integration of SMP technology into microprocessors, Sequent sought its next source of differentiation. They began investing in the development of a system based on a cache-coherent non-uniform memory architecture (ccNUMA) and leveraging Scalable Coherent Interconnect. NUMA distributes memory among the processors, avoiding the that occurs with a single monolithic memory. Using NUMA would allow their multiprocessor machines to generally outperform SMP systems, at least when the tasks can be executed close to their memory — as is the case for servers, where tasks typically do not share large amounts of data.

In 1996 they released the first of a new series of machines based on this new architecture. Known internally as STiNG, an abbreviation for &quot;Sequent: The Next Generation (with Intel inside)&quot;, it was productized as NUMA-Q and was the last of the systems released before the company was purchased by IBM for over $800 million.
IBM then started Project Monterey with Santa Cruz Operation, intending to produce a NUMA-capable standardized Unix running on IA-32, IA-64 and POWER and PowerPC platforms. This project later fell through as both IBM and SCO turned to the Linux market, but is the basis for &quot;the new SCO&quot;&#x27;s &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; Linux lawsuit.

===IBM purchase and disappearance===
With their future product strategy in tatters, it appeared Sequent had little future standing alone, and was purchased by IBM in 1999 for $810 million. IBM released several x86 servers with a NUMA architecture. The first was the x440 in August, 2002 with a follow-on x445 in 2003. In 2004, an Itanium-based x455 was added to the NUMA family. During this period, NUMA technology became the basis for IBM&#x27;s extended X-Architecture (eXA, which could also stand for enterprise X-Architecture). As of 2011, this chipset is now on its fifth generation, known as eX5 technology. It now falls under the brand IBM System x.

According to a May 30, 2002 article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; (WSJ) entitled &quot;Sequent Deal Serves Hard Lesson for IBM&quot;:
:When IBM bought Sequent, ...it [Sequent] lacked the size and resources to compete with Sun and Hewlett-Packard Co. in the Unix server market...
:In 1999, IBM had problems of its own with an aged and high-priced line of servers, particularly for its version of Unix known as AIX. It also faced huge losses in personal computers and declining sales in its cash-cow mainframe line.

<doc id="222465" wikidata="Q23133" url="?curid=222465" title="Dasyuridae">
<text>The Dasyuridae are a family of marsupials native to Australia and New Guinea, including 71 extant species divided into 17 genera. Many are small and mouse-like or shrew-like, giving some of them the name marsupial mice or marsupial shrews, but the group also includes the cat-sized quolls, as well as the Tasmanian devil. They are found in a wide range of habitats, including grassland, underground, forests, and mountains, and some species are arboreal or semiaquatic. The Dasyuridae are often called the &#x27;marsupial carnivores&#x27;, as most members of the family are insectivores.

==Characteristics==
Most dasyurids are roughly the size of mice, but a few species are much larger. The smallest species is the Pilbara ningaui, which is from in length, and weighs just , while the largest, the Tasmanian devil, is long, and weighs from . The smaller dasyurids typically resemble shrews or mice in appearance, with long tails and narrow, pointed noses. The larger species bear a resemblance to such placental carnivores as mongooses or mustelids.

Many features of dasyurids are considered primitive; that is, they resemble the features of the earliest marsupials, from which other species, such as kangaroos and bandicoots, later diverged. For example, all of the toes in dasyurids are separate, whereas in many other marsupials, the second and third toes are fused. Similarly, many species lack a full marsupial pouch, instead having a simple fold of skin surrounding the teats to provide some protection to the developing young. The dentition of dasyurids is also considered primitive, and differs from that of other marsupials, with a dental formula of: . Their dentition is similar to many carnivores, characterized by bladelike incisors, large, sharp canines, and upper molars modified with large, sharp cusps.

Dasyurids are primarily insectivorous, but they will also eat small lizards, fruit, and flowers. One of the few exceptions to this rule is the Tasmanian devil, which subsists mainly on vertebrate carrion. They have relatively simple digestive tracts, as is typical of insectivores and other carnivores.

Gestation lasts from 12–16 days, and results in the birth of from two to 12 young, depending on species. Smaller species typically breed at least twice a year, while the larger forms tend to breed just once. The length of lactation reflects this, with young dunnarts, for example, being weaned after 60–70 days, but young quolls only after 8–9 months. Most dasyurid species are sexually mature at one year of age, but, again, the quolls and Tasmanian devil, being larger, take longer to mature and do not reach full adulthood for about two years.

Adult dasyurids are typically solitary, or travel in small groups of two to three individuals.

==Taxonomy==

The listing for extant species is based on The Third edition of Wilson &amp; Reeder&#x27;s Mammal Species of the World (2005), except where the Mammal Diversity Database and IUCN agree on a change.
