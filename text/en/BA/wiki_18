<text>The Bible has been translated into many languages from the biblical languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. the whole Bible has been translated into 756 languages, the New Testament has been translated into an additional 1,726 languages, and smaller portions of the Bible have been translated into 1,274 other languages according to Wycliffe Global Alliance. Thus, at least some portions of the Bible have been translated into 3,756 languages.

The Old Testament, written in Hebrew (with some sections in the Book of Daniel in the Aramaic language) was translated into Aramaic (the so-called Targums, originally not written down), Greek and Syriac.

The New Testament, written in Greek, was first translated into Syriac, Latin and Coptic – all before the time of Emperor Constantine. Jerome&#x27;s 4th-century Latin Vulgate version, a revision of earlier Latin translations, was dominant in Western Christianity during the Middle Ages.

By the year 500, the Bible had been translated into Ge&#x27;ez, Gothic, Armenian and Georgian. By the year 1000, a number of other translations were added (in some cases partial), including Old Nubian, Sogdian, Arabic and Slavonic languages, among others.

English Bible translations have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium. (See List of English Bible translations.)

Textual variants in the New Testament include errors, omissions, additions, changes, and alternate translations. In some cases, different translations have been used as evidence for or have been motivated by doctrinal differences.

== Original text ==
=== Hebrew Bible ===
The Hebrew Bible was mainly written in Biblical Hebrew, with some portions (notably in Daniel and Ezra) in Biblical Aramaic. Some of the Deuterocanonical books not accepted in every denomination&#x27;s canons, such as 2 Maccabees, originated in Koine Greek.

In the third and second centuries B.C.E., the Hebrew scriptures were translated into Koine Greek, known as the Septuagint version. This was the version commonly used by the writers of the Gospels.

From the 6th century to the 10th century AD, Jewish scholars, today known as Masoretes, compared the text of various biblical manuscripts in an effort to create a unified, standardized text. A series of highly similar texts eventually emerged, and any of these texts are known as Masoretic Texts (MT). The Masoretes also added vowel points (called niqqud) to the text, since the original text contained only consonants. This sometimes required the selection of an interpretation; since some words differ only in their vowels their meaning can vary in accordance with the vowels chosen. In antiquity, variant Hebrew readings existed, some of which have survived in the Samaritan Pentateuch and other ancient fragments, as well as being attested in ancient versions in other languages.

=== New Testament ===

The New Testament was written in Koine Greek reporting speech originally in Aramaic, Greek and Latin (see Language of the New Testament).

The &quot;autographs&quot;, the Greek manuscripts written by the original authors or collators, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the manuscripts that do survive.

Most variants among the manuscripts are minor, such as alternative spelling, alternative word order, the presence or absence of an optional definite article (&quot;the&quot;), and so on. Occasionally, a major variant happens when a portion of a text was missing or for other reasons. Examples of major variants are the endings of Mark, the Pericope Adulteræ, the Comma Johanneum, and the Western version of Acts.

Early manuscripts of the Pauline epistles and other New Testament writings show no punctuation whatsoever. The punctuation was added later by other editors, according to their own understanding of the text.

Four main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament have been theorized to allow grouping and analysis of manuscripts and changes: the Alexandrian text-type, the Byzantine text-type, the Western text-type and perhaps a largely lost Caesarean text-type, however many manuscripts are mixes of these.

The discovery of older manuscripts which belong to the Alexandrian text-type, including the 4th-century Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus, led scholars to revise their view about the original Greek text. Karl Lachmann based his critical edition of 1831 on manuscripts dating from the 4th century and earlier, to argue that the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; must be corrected according to these earlier texts.

There is also a long-standing tradition owing to Papias of Hierapolis (c.125) that the Gospel of Matthew was originally in Hebrew. Eusebius (c.300) reports that Pantaenus went to India (c. 200) and found them using a Gospel of St Matthew in Hebrew letters. Jerome also reports in his preface to St Matthew that it was originally composed &quot;in Hebrew letters in Judea&quot; not in Greek and that he saw and copied one from the Nazarene sect. The exact provenance, authorship, source languages and collation of the four Gospels is unknown but subject to much academic speculation and disputed methods.

== History ==
=== Ancient translations ===

==== Aramaic Targums ====
Some of the first translations of the Torah began during the Babylonian exile, when Aramaic became the lingua franca of the Jews. With most people speaking only Aramaic and not understanding Hebrew, the Targums were created to allow the common person to understand the Torah as it was read in ancient synagogues.

==== Greek Septuagint ====
By the 3rd century BC, Alexandria had become the center of Hellenistic Judaism, and during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC translators compiled in Egypt a Koine Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures in several stages (completing the task by 132 BC). The Talmud ascribes the translation effort to Ptolemy II Philadelphus (r. 285–246 BC), who allegedly hired 72 Jewish scholars for the purpose, for which reason the translation is commonly known as the Septuagint (from the Latin &quot;septuaginta&quot;, &quot;seventy&quot;), a name which it gained in &quot;the time of Augustine of Hippo&quot; (354–430 AD). The Septuagint (LXX), the very first translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, later became the accepted text of the Old Testament in the Christian church and the basis of its canon. Jerome based his Latin Vulgate translation on the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the Masoretic text), and on the Greek text for the deuterocanonical books.

The translation now known as the Septuagint was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians. It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew (Masoretic Text). This translation was promoted by way of a legend (primarily recorded as the Letter of Aristeas) that seventy (or in some sources, seventy-two) separate translators all produced identical texts; supposedly proving its accuracy.

Versions of the Septuagint contain several passages and whole books not included in the Masoretic texts of the Tanakh. In some cases these additions were originally composed in Greek, while in other cases they are translations of Hebrew books or of Hebrew variants not present in the Masoretic texts. Recent discoveries have shown that more of the Septuagint additions have a Hebrew origin than previously thought. While there are no complete surviving manuscripts of the Hebrew texts on which the Septuagint was based, many scholars believe that they represent a different textual tradition (&quot;Vorlage&quot;) from the one that became the basis for the Masoretic texts.

=== Late Antiquity ===
Christian translations of the Old Testament also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the Masoretic text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions.

The Christian New Testament was written in Koine Greek, and nearly all modern translations are to some extent based upon the Greek text.

==== 2nd century ====
Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot; () placed side by side six versions of the Old Testament: the Hebrew consonantal text, the Hebrew text transliterated into Greek letters (the &quot;Secunda&quot;), the Greek translations of Aquila of Sinope and Symmachus the Ebionite, one recension of the Septuagint, and the Greek translation of Theodotion. In addition, he included three anonymous translations of the Psalms (the &quot;Quinta&quot;, &quot;Sexta&quot; and &quot;Septima&quot;). His eclectic recension of the Septuagint had a significant influence on the Old Testament text in several important manuscripts.

In the 2nd century, the Old Testament was translated into Syriac translation, and the Gospels in the Diatessaron gospel harmony. The New Testament was translated in the 5th century, now known as the Peshitta.

In the 2nd and 3rd centuries, the New Testament was translated into various Coptic (Egyptian) dialects. The Old Testament was already translated by that stage.

==== 3rd century ====
The Frankfurt silver inscription, dated to between 230 and 270, quotes Philippians 2:10-11 in a Latin translation. It is the earliest reliable evidence of Christianity north of the Alps.

==== 4th century ====
In 331, the Emperor Constantine commissioned Eusebius to deliver fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople. Athanasius (&quot;Apol. Const. 4&quot;) recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for Constans. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Alexandrinus are examples of these Bibles. Together with the Peshitta, these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.

The Bible was translated into Gothic (an early East Germanic language) in the 4th century by a group of scholars, possibly under the supervision of Ulfilas (Wulfila).

The canonical Christian Bible was formally established by Bishop Cyril of Jerusalem in 350 (although it had been generally accepted by the church previously), confirmed by the Council of Laodicea in 363 (both lacked the Book of Revelation), and later established by Athanasius of Alexandria in 367 (with Revelation added).

Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Vulgate&quot; Latin translation dates to between AD 382 and 405. Latin translations predating Jerome are collectively known as &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; texts. Jerome began by revising these earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.

There are also several ancient translations, most important of which are in the Syriac dialect of Aramaic (including the Peshitta).

==== 4th to 6th century ====
The Codex Vaticanus dates to –350, and is missing only 21 sentences or paragraphs in various New Testament books: it is one of the four great uncial codices. The earliest surviving complete single-volume manuscript of the entire Bible in Latin is the Codex Amiatinus, a Latin Vulgate edition produced in 8th-century England at the double monastery of Wearmouth-Jarrow. Latin and its early Romance dialects were widely spoken as the primary or secondary language throughout Western Europe, including Britain even in the 700s and 800s.

Between the 4th to 6th centuries, the Bible was translated into Ge&#x27;ez (Ethiopic).

In the 5th century, Mesrob Mashtots translated the Bible using the Armenian alphabet invented by him. Also dating from the same period is the first Georgian translation. The creation of the Georgian scripts, like the Armenian alphabet, was also attributed to Mashtots by the scholar Koryun in the 5th century. This claim has been disputed by modern Georgian scholars, although the creation of a Georgian alphabet was likely still motivated by Christians who wished to translate holy scriptures.

In the 6th century, the Bible was translated into Old Nubian.

By the end of the eighth century, Church of the East monasteries (so-called Nestorians) had translated the New Testament and Psalms (at least, the portions needed for liturgical use) from Syriac to Sogdian, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Central Asia of the Silk Road, which was an Eastern Iranian language with Chinese loanwords, written in letters and logograms derived from Aramaic script. They may have also translated parts of books into a Chinese.

=== Middle Ages ===
==== Early Middle Ages ====

When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (&quot;marginal glosses&quot;) to correct their text—especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line—and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See textual criticism. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions, additions, and variants (mostly in orthography).

There are some fragmentary Old English Bible translations, notably a lost translation of the Gospel of John into Old English by the Venerable Bede, which is said to have been prepared shortly before his death around the year 735. An Old High German version of the Gospel of Matthew dates to 748. Charlemagne in c. 800 charged Alcuin with a revision of the Latin Vulgate. The translation into Old Church Slavonic was started in 863 by Cyril and Methodius.

Alfred the Great, a ruler in England, had a number of passages of the Bible circulated in the vernacular in around 900. These included passages from the Ten Commandments and the Pentateuch, which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time. In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared, in the West Saxon dialect; these are called the &quot;Wessex Gospels&quot;. Around the same time, a compilation now called the &quot;Old English Hexateuch&quot; appeared with the first six (or, in one version, seven) books of the Old Testament.

==== High Middle Ages ====
The arrival of the mendicant preaching orders in the 12th century saw individual books being translated with commentary, in Italian dialects.

Typically the Psalms were among the first books to be translated, being prayers: for example, the earliest Polish translation from 1280.

There are numerous manuscripts of the Psalms in Catalan from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, translated from the Vulgate, Occitan, French and Hebrew, with a New Testament and full Bible translation made in the 1300s. Parts of an Old Testament in Old Spanish from the late 1300s still exist.

Monks completed a translation into Franco-Provençal (Arpitan) c.1170-85, commissioned by Peter Waldo. The complete Bible was translated into Old French in the late 13th century. Parts of this translation were included in editions of the popular &quot;Bible historiale&quot;, and there is no evidence of this translation&#x27;s being suppressed by the Church. In England, &quot;about the middle of the fourteenth century—before 1361—the Anglo-Normans possessed an independent and probably complete translation of the whole of the Old Testament and the greater part of the New.&quot;

Friar Giovanni da Montecorvino of the large Franciscan mission to Mongol China in the early 1300s translated the Psalms and New Testament into the language of the Tartars: the Uyghur language or perhaps the Mongolian language.

A royal Swedish version of 1316 has been lost. The entire Bible was translated into Czech around 1360.

The provincial synods of Toulouse (1229) and Tarragona (1234) temporarily outlawed possession of some vernacular renderings, in reaction to the Cathar and Waldensian heresies, in South France and Catalonia. This demonstrates that such translations existed: there is evidence of some vernacular translations being permitted while others were being scrutinized.

==== Late Middle Ages ====
A group of Middle English Bible translations were created: including the Wycliffean Bibles (1383, 1393) and the Paues&#x27; New Testament, based on the Vulgate. New translation efforts were regulated in England by the provincial Oxford Synod in 1408 under church law to require the approval of a bishop; possession of material that contained Lollard material (such as the so-called General Prologue found in a few Wycliffite Bibles) was also illegal by English state law, in response to Lollard uprisings.

Later, many parts of the Bible in Late Middle English were printed by William Caxton in his translation of the Golden Legend (1483), and in the loose paraphrase &quot;Speculum Vitae Christi&quot; (&quot;The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ&quot;), which had been authorized into English around 1410.

A Cornish version may have been made.

The Hungarian Hussite Bible appeared in 1416.

Individual books continued to be translated: for example the Gospel of John in Slovak (1469). The first 12 books of the Old Testament in Danish (also used for Norwegian) was made in c. 1480.

The invention of printing saw complete Catholic Bibles produced in German (1466 and after; multiple), Valencian Catalan (1478), Tuscan (1471), Venetian (1471) and Dutch (1477).

From the late 1300s, the Brethren of the Common Life encouraged their laypeople to read the Gospels they would hear at church at home beforehand, in the vernacular. The early public demand for printed Dutch vernacular scriptures seems to have been for translations of the daily or weekly liturgical readings, and most printed books were of this &quot;Gospels and Epistles&quot; type; from the 1520s this reverted to a demand for pandect (full) Bibles.

=== Reformation and Early Modern period ===

The earliest printed edition of the Greek New Testament appeared in 1516 from the Froben press, by Desiderius Erasmus, who reconstructed a Greek text from several recent manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type, to accompany his Latin revision and philological annotations. This led to a gradual shift by subsequent translators away from Latin sources to Greek or Hebrew sources, though initially his Latin renditions and annotations were more influential.

Erasmus produced four later editions of this text with the sponsorship of various bishops and princes, and with the explicit encouragement of the Pope. He was an irenical, anti-ceremonial Catholic, and his ad fontes preference for the Greek manuscripts as well as the Latin Vulgate and Patristic quotations led some traditionalist theologians to view him with suspicion.

During 1517 and 1519 Francysk Skaryna printed a translation of the Bible in Old Belarusian language in twenty-two books.

In 1521, Martin Luther was placed under the Ban of the Empire, and he retired to the Wartburg Castle. During his time there, he translated the New Testament into German, using the 2nd edition of Erasmus&#x27; New Testament, which provide a new Latin translation, detailed annotations on Greek words, and a Greek text for reference. It was printed in September 1522.

The first complete Dutch Bible, partly based on the existing portions of Luther&#x27;s translation, was printed in Antwerp in 1526 by Jacob van Liesvelt.

The first printed edition with &quot;critical apparatus&quot; (noting variant readings among the manuscripts) was produced by the printer Robert Estienne of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; (Latin for &quot;received text&quot;), a name given to it in the Elzevier edition of 1633, which termed it as the text &quot;nunc ab omnibus receptum&quot; (&quot;now received by all&quot;).

The use of numbered chapters and verses was not introduced until the Middle Ages and later. The system used in English was developed by Stephanus (Robert Estienne of Paris). (See Chapters and verses of the Bible.)

The churches of the Protestant Reformation translated the Greek of the Textus Receptus to produce vernacular Bibles, such as the German Luther Bible (1522), the Polish Brest Bible (1563), the Spanish &quot;Biblia del Oso&quot; (in English: Bible of the Bear, 1569) which later became the Reina-Valera Bible upon its first revision in 1602, the Czech Melantrich Bible (1549) and Bible of Kralice (1579–1593) and numerous English translations of the Bible.

Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament translation (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536) and his translation of the Pentateuch (1530, 1534) and the Book of Jonah were met with heavy sanctions given the widespread belief that Tyndale &quot;changed&quot; the Bible as he attempted to translate it. Tyndale&#x27;s unfinished work, cut short by his execution, was supplemented by Myles Coverdale and published under a pseudonym to create the Matthew Bible, the first complete English translation of the Bible. Attempts at an &quot;authoritative&quot; English Bible for the Church of England would include the Great Bible of 1538 (also relying on Coverdale&#x27;s work), the Bishops&#x27; Bible of 1568, and the Authorized Version (the King James Version) of 1611, the last of which would become a standard for English speaking Christians for several centuries.

The first complete French Bible printed was a translation by Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples, published in 1530 in Antwerp. The Froschauer Bible of 1531 and the Luther Bible of 1534 (both appearing in portions throughout the 1520s) were an important part of the Reformation.

The first printed English translations of Psalms (1530), Isaiah (1531), Proverbs (1533), Ecclesiastes (1533), Jeremiah (1534) and Lamentations (1534), were executed by the Protestant Bible translator George Joye in Antwerp. In 1535 Myles Coverdale published the first complete English Bible also in Antwerp.

By 1578 both Old and New Testaments were translated to Slovene by the Protestant writer and theologian Jurij Dalmatin. The work was not printed until 1583. The Slovenes thus became the 12th nation in the world with a complete Bible in their language. The translation of the New Testament was based on the work by Dalmatin&#x27;s mentor, the Protestant Primož Trubar, who published the translation of the Gospel of Matthew already in 1555 and the entire Testament by parts until 1577.

Following the distribution of a Welsh New Testament and Prayer Book to every parish Church in Wales in 1567, translated by William Salesbury, Welsh became the 13th language into which the whole Bible had been translated in 1588, through a translation by William Morgan then vicar of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant (later Bishop of Llandaf and St Asaph.

In 1613, Jesuits in Kyoto published a lectionary of the Sunday Gospel readings and other Gospel material in Japanese; this is now lost.

Samuel Bogusław Chyliński (1631–1668) translated and published the first Bible translation into Lithuanian.

In 1660, John Eliot published the Eliot Indian Bible in the language of the Massachusett people, an indigenous American group who lived in the area around what is today Boston, Massachusetts. This was the first translation of the Bible into an indigenous American language. This translation was produced by Eliot in an effort to convert the dwindling population of Massachusett to Christianity in praying towns such as Natick, Massachusetts.

In 1671, a complete Bible translation into Arabic was made in Rome. In 1671, the annual Gospel readings were translated by a Jesuit into Konkani, an Indian language.

== Modern translation efforts ==

The Bible is the most translated book in the world. The United Bible Societies announced that as of 31 December 2007 the complete Bible was available in 438 languages, 123 of which included the deuterocanonical material as well as the Tanakh and New Testament. Either the Tanakh or the New Testament was available in an additional 1,168 languages, in some kind of translations, like the interlinear morpheme-by-morpheme translation (e.g. some Parallel Bible, with interlinear morphemic glossing).

In 1999, Wycliffe Bible Translators announced &quot;Vision 2025&quot; — a project that intends to commence Bible translation in every remaining language community by 2025. It was realised that, at the rates of Bible translation at that point, it would take until at least 2150 until Bible translation began in every language that was needing a translation. Since the launch of Vision 2025, Bible translation efforts have increased dramatically, in large part due to the technology that is now available. Due to the increase, at current rates, Bible translation will begin in every language by 2038, thus being 112 years faster.

As of September 2023, they estimated that around 99.8 million people spoke those 1,268 languages where translation work still needs to begin. This represents 17.1% of all languages (based off an estimate of 7,394 total languages) and 1.3% of the human population (based on a global population of 7.42 billion).

In total, there are 3,736 languages without any Bible translation at all, but an estimated 1,148 of these (with a population of 9.6 million people) are likely to never need a Bible because they are very similar to other languages, or spoken by very few speakers where the language will die out very soon.

Bible translation is currently happening in 3,283 languages in 167 countries. This work impacts 1.15 billion people, or about 15.5 percent of all language users, who have (or will soon have) new access to at least some portions of Scripture in their first language.

== Differences in Bible translations ==

Modern critical editions incorporate ongoing scholarly research, including discoveries of Greek papyrus fragments from near Alexandria, Egypt, that date in some cases within a few decades of the original New Testament writings. Today, most critical editions of the Greek New Testament, such as UBS4 and NA27, consider the Alexandrian text-type corrected by papyri, to be the Greek text that is closest to the original &quot;autographs&quot;. Their &quot;apparatus&quot; includes the result of votes among scholars, ranging from certain {A} to doubtful {E}, on which variants best preserve the original Greek text of the New Testament.

Critical editions that rely primarily on the Alexandrian text-type inform nearly all modern translations (and revisions of older translations). For reasons of tradition, however, some translators prefer to use the Textus Receptus for the Greek text, or use the &quot;Majority Text&quot; which is similar to it but is a critical edition that relies on earlier manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. Among these, some argue that the Byzantine tradition contains scribal additions, but these later interpolations preserve the orthodox interpretations of the biblical text—as part of the ongoing Christian experience—and in this sense are authoritative. Distrust of the textual basis of modern translations has contributed to the King-James-Only Movement.

=== Dynamic or formal translation policy ===
A variety of linguistic, philological and ideological approaches to translation have been used. Inside the Bible-translation community, these are commonly categorized as:
* Dynamic equivalence translation
* Formal equivalence translation (similar to literal translation)
* Idiomatic, or paraphrastic translation, as used by the late Kenneth N. Taylor

though modern linguists, such as Bible scholar Dr. Joel Hoffman, disagree with this classification.

Other translation approaches include:

* Literary translation, where the reader&#x27;s experience of the piece as literature is prized, as used in the Knox Bible
* Metrical translation, where prose is rendered in a rhythmic form, as represented by Old English and Middle English texts
* Prose translation, where no attempt is made to render the lyrical aspect of some poem or song, as King Alfred&#x27;s prose translation of the first fifty Psalms.

As Hebrew and Greek, the original languages of the Bible, like all languages, have some idioms and concepts not easily translated, there is in some cases an ongoing critical tension about whether it is better to give a word-for-word translation, to give a translation that gives a parallel idiom in the target language, or to invent a neologism.

For instance, in the Douay Rheims Bible, Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, New American Bible Revised Edition, which are the English language Catholic translations, as well as Protestant translations like the King James Bible, the Darby Bible, the Recovery Version, the Literal Standard Version, the New Revised Standard Version, the Modern Literal Version, and the New American Standard Bible are seen as more literal translations (or &quot;word-for-word&quot;).

Translations like the New International Version and New Living Translation sometimes attempt to give relevant parallel idioms. The Living Bible and The Message are two paraphrases of the Bible that try to convey the original meaning in contemporary language.

Less literal translations reflect the translator&#x27;s theological, linguistic or cultural interpretations; the result is more easily consumed by lay readers. This contrasts with more literal translations where interpretation is left to the reader; lay readers may be unfamiliar with ancient idioms and other historical and cultural contexts.

=== Doctrinal differences and translation policy ===
In addition to linguistic concerns, theological issues also drive Bible translations. Some translations of the Bible, produced by single churches or groups of churches, may be seen as subject to a point of view by the translation committee.

Historian David Lawton notes that the Middle Ages in the West, even up to the late period, &quot;There is little or no sense that the Bible, even if seen as single or whole, should necessarily stand alone and self-sufficient. It is a period without fundamentalists in the modern sense.&quot; The Bible was translated (usually from the Vulgate) in accordance with Catholic Sacred Tradition.

==== Names of God ====
For example, the New World Translation, produced by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, provides different renderings where verses in other Bible translations support the deity of Christ. The NWT also translates &quot;kurios&quot; as &quot;Jehovah&quot; rather than &quot;Lord&quot; when quoting Hebrew passages that used YHWH. The authors believe that Jesus would have used God&#x27;s name and not the customary &quot;kurios&quot;. On this basis, the anonymous New World Bible Translation Committee inserted &quot;Jehovah&quot; into the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures (New Testament) a total of 237 times while the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) uses Jehovah a total of 6,979 times to a grand total of 7,216 in the entire 2013 Revision New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures while previous revisions such as the 1984 revision were a total of 7,210 times while the 1961 revision were a total of 7,199 times.

A number of Sacred Name Bibles (e.g., the Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition) have been published that are even more rigorous in transliterating the tetragrammaton using Semitic forms to translate it in the Old Testament and also using the same Semitic forms to translate the Greek word &quot;Theos&quot; (God) in the New Testament—usually Yahweh, Elohim or some other variation.

Other translations are distinguished by smaller but distinctive doctrinal differences. For example, the Purified Translation of the Bible, by translation and explanatory footnotes, promoting the position that Christians should not drink alcohol, that New Testament references to &quot;wine&quot; are translated as &quot;grape juice&quot;.

<doc id="214536" wikidata="Q205364" url="?curid=214536" title="Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory">
<text>The Zionist occupation government, Zionist occupational government or Zionist-occupied government (ZOG), sometimes also called the Jewish occupational government (JOG), is an antisemitic conspiracy theory claiming that Jews secretly control the governments of Western states. It is a contemporary variation on the centuries-old belief in an international Jewish conspiracy. According to believers, a secret Zionist organization actively controls international banks, and through them governments, to conspire against white, Christian, or Islamic interests.

The expression is used by white supremacist, white nationalist, far-right, nativist or antisemitic groups in Europe and the United States, as well as by ultra-nationalists such as &quot;Pamyat&quot; in Russia.

Some organizations that employ (or have in the past employed) the term are partially or wholly inspired by religious aims or ideals. American far-right groups founded upon racialist, conspiratorial, and apocalypticist interpretations of Christianity, including the Freemen, various Identity Christian churches and sects, and the Ku Klux Klan are examples. Additionally, some contemporary militant, authoritarian, and theocratic Islamist and Islamic extremist organizations, including Salafi-jihadist terrorist cells, have used the term &quot;ZOG&quot; in propaganda campaigns.

The word &quot;Zionist&quot; in &quot;Zionist occupation government&quot; is used to equate being Jewish with the ideology of Zionism. As such, Zionists are depicted by the theory as conspiring for Jews and Israel to control the world as depicted in the forged &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;.

== Origins ==
The association of Jews with the control of economic forces is the modern resurgence of an old stereotype, that of the &quot;greedy Jewish merchant&quot;, that has been present in the Christian world since the Middle Ages. The conspiracy theory illustrates a specifically American far-right agrarian preoccupation, namely the vital possibility of extinction allegedly faced by the rural world, seen as the backbone of America, a danger caused by a remote, centralized and power-hungry metropolitan elite corrupted by &quot;alien&quot; influences.

== History ==

In late 19th-century France, the insinuation that the French government was in the power of the Jews was a commonplace claim in anti-republican discourse. The British fascist Arnold Leese already had the habit of referring to the &quot;Jewish government&quot; of his nation in the interwar and postwar decades. At the same time, Nazis under the Weimar Republic dismissed a so-called &quot;Jewish&quot; hand behind that regime.

An early appearance of the term was in a 1976 article, &quot;Welcome to ZOG-World&quot;, attributed to an American neo-Nazi named Eric Thomson, but Canadian white nationalists also used the term. It features as the main theme in the 1978 book &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; by William Luther Pierce, founder of the National Alliance, a white nationalist organization. The term came to the attention of a larger audience in a 27 December 1984 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about robberies committed in California and Washington by a white supremacist group called The Order. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, the crimes &quot;were conducted to raise money for a war upon the United States Government, which the group calls &#x27;ZOG&#x27;, or Zionist Occupation Government.&quot; In 1985, the Oregon-based far-right group Posse Comitatus claimed: &quot;Our nation is now completely under the control of the International Invisible government of World Jewry.&quot;

The Order of the Silent Brotherhood was an offshoot of the Aryan Nations, an organization founded in the early 1970s by Richard Girnt Butler, who since the 1950s had been associated with another antisemitic group, the Church of Jesus Christ–Christian. Both these groups trace their origins to antisemitic activists such as Gerald L.K. Smith and have interacted with the Ku Klux Klan. The term appeared extensively in Aryan Nations literature. In 1985, the Anti-Defamation League reported that the Aryan Nations had set up an electronic bulletin board system called &quot;Aryan Nation Liberty Net&quot; to offer information for the locations of Communist Party USA offices and &quot;ZOG informers&quot;.

In 1996, the Aryan Nations posted on its website an &quot;Aryan Declaration of Independence&quot; saying that &quot;the history of the present Zionist Occupied Government of the United States of America is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations [...] [all] having a direct object—the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.&quot; Claiming that &quot;the eradication of the White race and its culture&quot; is &quot;one of its foremost purposes&quot;, the ZOG is accused of relinquishing powers of government to private corporations, white traitors and ruling class Jewish families. It accused ZOG Jews of subverting the constitutional rule of law; responsibility for post-Civil War Reconstruction; subverting the monetary system with the Federal Reserve System; confiscating land and property; limiting freedoms of speech, religion and gun ownership; murdering, kidnapping and imprisoning patriots; abdicating national sovereignty to the United Nations; political repression; wasteful bureaucracy; loosening restrictions on immigration and drug trafficking; raising taxes; polluting the environment; commandeering the military, mercenaries and police; denying Aryan cultural heritage; and inciting immigrant insurrections.

Since 1996, the term has spread in usage. It is now popular with many other antisemitic organizations. Swedish Neo-Nazis say that Jews—in what they call the Swedish Zionist occupied government—are importing immigrants to &quot;dilute the blood of the white race&quot;. The antisemitic website Jew Watch claims that the entire spectrum of Western nations and other countries are being ruled by &quot;Zionist Occupation Governments&quot;.

Slovak politician Marian Kotleba, whose party (People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia) won two seats in the European Parliament in the 2019 election, claims that the &quot;Z. O. G.&quot; controls Slovak politics.

== Conspiracy theories ==
Activists imagined a variety of plots gravitating around the original conspiracy theory—for instance, that as many as 4,000 Jews were warned of the September 11 attacks. Believers also claim that ZOG-like forces control American foreign policy. Despite their singularities, most ZOG theories involve the idea of a Jewish power over finance or banking, including one imagining Jewish control of the Federal Reserve.

Neo-Nazi David Lane developed his version of the white genocide conspiracy theory in his &quot;White Genocide Manifesto&quot;, the origin of the later use of the term. Lane claimed that the government policies of many Western countries had the intent of destroying white European culture and making white people an &quot;extinct species&quot;. Lane—a founding member of the organization The Order—criticized miscegenation, abortion, homosexuality, alleged Jewish control of the media, &quot;multiracial sports&quot;, the legal repercussions against those who &quot;resist genocide&quot;, and the ZOG that he said controls the United States and the other majority-white countries, which encourages &quot;white genocide&quot;.

<doc id="214542" wikidata="Q7995181" url="?curid=214542" title="White Patriot Party">
<text>The White Patriot Party (WPP) was an American anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist, homophobic, white supremacist paramilitary political party which was associated with Christian Identity and the Ku Klux Klan. It was led by its founder, Frazier Glenn Miller Jr., through various organizational incarnations. In the mid-1970s, the organization was founded as the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. It was involved in the 1979 Greensboro massacre, when a confrontation between Klansmen, Nazis and communists degenerated into a shootout and a mass shooting which left five people dead and twelve people wounded. The organization became the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1980s and it became the White Patriot Party in 1985.

At a time when a poor farming economy existed in North Carolina, the group acquired support by blaming economic problems on Jewish bankers. According to some estimates, its membership might have been as high as 3000. On April 6, 1987, the group declared war against the federal government, which they called &quot;Zionist Occupation Government&quot; (ZOG).

The WPP collapsed after Miller violated an injunction against paramilitary activity and was convicted of threatening the civil rights activist Morris Dees. He was imprisoned from 1987 to 1990. In a 1988 sedition trial in Arkansas, Miller testified for the prosecution by stating that he had received $200,000 in stolen money from The Order and used it to finance the White Patriot Party&#x27;s activities.

<doc id="214547" wikidata="Q428388" url="?curid=214547" title="Equilateral polygon">
<text>In geometry, an equilateral polygon is a polygon which has all sides of the same length. Except in the triangle case, an equilateral polygon does not need to also be equiangular (have all angles equal), but if it does then it is a regular polygon. If the number of sides is at least four, an equilateral polygon does not need to be a convex polygon: it could be concave or even self-intersecting.

==Examples==

All regular polygons and edge-transitive polygons are equilateral. When an equilateral polygon is non-crossing and cyclic (its vertices are on a circle) it must be regular. An equilateral quadrilateral must be convex; this polygon is a rhombus (possibly a square).
A convex equilateral pentagon can be described by two consecutive angles, which together determine the other angles. However, equilateral pentagons, and equilateral polygons with more than five sides, can also be concave, and if concave pentagons are allowed then two angles are no longer sufficient to determine the shape of the pentagon.

A tangential polygon (one that has an incircle tangent to all its sides) is equilateral if and only if the alternate angles are equal (that is, angles 1, 3, 5, ... are equal and angles 2, 4, ... are equal). Thus if the number of sides &quot;n&quot; is odd, a tangential polygon is equilateral if and only if it is regular.

==Measurement==
Viviani&#x27;s theorem generalizes to equilateral polygons: The sum of the perpendicular distances from an interior point to the sides of an equilateral polygon is independent of the location of the interior point.

The &quot;principal diagonals&quot; of a hexagon each divide the hexagon into quadrilaterals. In any convex equilateral hexagon with common side &quot;a&quot;, there exists a principal diagonal &quot;d&quot;1 such that

:formula_1

and a principal diagonal &quot;d&quot;2 such that

:formula_2.

==Optimality==
When an equilateral polygon is inscribed in a Reuleaux polygon, it forms a Reinhardt polygon. Among all convex polygons with the same number of sides, these polygons have the largest possible perimeter for their diameter, the largest possible width for their diameter, and the largest possible width for their perimeter.

<doc id="214548" wikidata="Q6972001" url="?curid=214548" title="National Crime Victimization Survey">
<text>The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), administered by the US Census Bureau under the Department of Commerce, is a national survey of approximately 49,000 to 150,000 households - with approximately 240,000 persons aged 12 or older - twice a year in the United States, on the frequency of crime victimization, as well as characteristics and consequences of victimization. The survey focuses on gathering information on the following crimes: assault, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, rape, and robbery. The survey results are used for the purposes of building a crime index. It has been used in comparison with the Uniform Crime Reports and the National Incident-Based Reporting System to assess the dark figure of crime. The NCVS survey is comparable to the British Crime Survey conducted in the United Kingdom.

The NCVS began in 1972 and was developed from work done by the National Opinion Research Center and the 
President&#x27;s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. A key finding of the survey was the realization that many crimes were not reported to the police.

==Methodology==
NCVS surveys households randomly selected from a stratified multistage cluster sample, with the interviews administered by the United States Census Bureau. This methodology has some disadvantages for surveying domestic violence crimes, since the entire selected household (above age 12) is interviewed instead of just one member selected. The selected household remains in the survey sample for three years, with interviews conducted every six months.

NCVS also includes supplemental questions, which allow periodic questions to be asked regarding such topics as school violence or attitudes toward crime or police.

In response to criticism of the survey design, the NCVS was redesigned in the late 1980s. The survey redesign also incorporated improved survey methodology and asks more direct questions. The redesign went through testing and evaluation before being fully implemented in the 1992–1993 survey.

<text>The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is one of the nine known human herpesvirus types in the herpes family, and is one of the most common viruses in humans. EBV is a double-stranded DNA virus and is also called human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4). Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the first identified oncogenic virus, or a virus that can cause cancer. EBV establishes permanent infection in humans. It causes infectious mononucleosis and is also tightly linked to many malignant diseases (cancers). Various vaccine formulations underwent testing in different animals or in humans. However, none of them were able to prevent EBV infection and no vaccine has been approved to date.

Infectious mononucleosis (&quot;mono&quot; or &quot;glandular fever&quot;), is characterized by extreme fatigue, fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. Epstein–Barr virus is also associated with various non-malignant, premalignant, and malignant Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases such as Burkitt lymphoma, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma; non-lymphoid malignancies such as gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma; and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas. The virus is also associated with the childhood disorders of Alice in Wonderland syndrome and acute cerebellar ataxia and, by some evidence, higher risks of developing certain autoimmune diseases, especially dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. About 200,000 cancer cases globally per year are thought to be attributable to EBV. In 2022, a large study (population of 10 million over 20 years) suggested EBV as the leading cause of multiple sclerosis, with a recent EBV infection causing a increase in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis.

Infection with EBV occurs by the oral transfer of saliva and genital secretions. Most people become infected with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. In the United States, about half of all five-year-old children and about 90% of adults have evidence of previous infection. Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children who become infected with EBV display no symptoms or the symptoms are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood. When infection occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, it causes infectious mononucleosis 35 to 50% of the time.

EBV infects of the immune system and epithelial cells. Once EBV&#x27;s initial lytic infection is brought under control, EBV latency persists in the individual&#x27;s for the rest of their life.

==Virology==
===Structure and genome===
The virus is about 122–180 nm in diameter and is composed of a double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which contains about 172,000 base pairs encoding 85 genes. The DNA is surrounded by a protein nucleocapsid, which is surrounded by a tegument made of protein, which in turn is surrounded by an envelope containing both lipids and surface projections of glycoproteins, which are essential to infection of the host cell. In July 2020, a team of researchers reported the first complete atomic model of the nucleocapsid of the virus. This &quot;first complete atomic model [includes] the icosahedral capsid, the capsid-associated tegument complex (CATC) and the dodecameric portal—the viral genome translocation apparatus.&quot;

===Tropism===
The term viral tropism refers to which cell types that EBV infects. EBV can infect different cell types, including and epithelial cells.

The viral three-part glycoprotein complexes of mediate B cell membrane fusion; although the two-part complexes of gHgL mediate epithelial cell membrane fusion. EBV that are made in the B cells have low numbers of gHgLgp42 complexes, because these three-part complexes interact with Human-leukocyte-antigen class II molecules present in B cells in the endoplasmic reticulum and are degraded. In contrast, EBV from epithelial cells are rich in the three-part complexes because these cells do not normally contain molecules. As a consequence, EBV made from B cells are more infectious to epithelial cells, and EBV made from epithelial cells are more infectious to B cells. Viruses lacking the gp42 portion are able to bind to human B cells, but unable to infect.

===Replication cycle===
====Entry to the cell====
EBV can infect both B cells and epithelial cells. The mechanisms for entering these two cells are different.

To enter B cells, viral glycoprotein gp350 binds to cellular receptor CD21 (also known as CR2). Then, viral glycoprotein gp42 interacts with cellular MHC class II molecules. This triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane, allowing EBV to enter the B cell. Human CD35, also known as complement receptor 1 (CR1), is an additional attachment factor for gp350 / 220, and can provide a route for entry of EBV into CD21-negative cells, including immature B-cells. EBV infection downregulates expression of CD35.

To enter epithelial cells, viral protein BMRF-2 interacts with cellular β1 integrins. Then, viral protein gH/gL interacts with cellular αvβ6/αvβ8 integrins. This triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the epithelial cell membrane, allowing EBV to enter the epithelial cell. Unlike B-cell entry, epithelial-cell entry is actually impeded by viral glycoprotein gp42.

Once EBV enters the cell, the viral capsid dissolves and the viral genome is transported to the cell nucleus.

====Lytic replication====
The lytic cycle, or productive infection, results in the production of infectious virions. EBV can undergo lytic replication in both B cells and epithelial cells. In B cells, lytic replication normally only takes place after reactivation from latency. In epithelial cells, lytic replication often directly follows viral entry.

For lytic replication to occur, the viral genome must be linear. The latent EBV genome is circular, so it must linearize in the process of lytic reactivation. During lytic replication, viral DNA polymerase is responsible for copying the viral genome. This contrasts with latency, in which host-cell DNA polymerase copies the viral genome.

Lytic gene products are produced in three consecutive stages: immediate-early, early, and late.
Immediate-early lytic gene products act as transactivators, enhancing the expression of later lytic genes. Immediate-early lytic gene products include BZLF1 (also known as Zta, EB1, associated with its product gene &quot;ZEBRA&quot;) and BRLF1 (associated with its product gene &quot;Rta&quot;).
Early lytic gene products have many more functions, such as replication, metabolism, and blockade of antigen processing. Early lytic gene products include BNLF2.
Finally, late lytic gene products tend to be proteins with structural roles, such as VCA, which forms the viral capsid. Other late lytic gene products, such as BCRF1, help EBV evade the immune system.

EGCG, a polyphenol in green tea, has shown in a study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA, gene transcription, and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV lytic genes&quot; Zta, Rta&quot;, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by &quot;Rta&quot;), however, the highly stable &quot;EBNA-1&quot; gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected. Specific inhibitors (to the pathways) suggest that Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway contributes to EBV lytic infection though BZLF1 and PI3-K pathway through BRLF1, the latter completely abrogating the ability of a BRLF1 adenovirus vector to induce the lytic form of EBV infection. Additionally, the activation of some genes but not others is being studied to determine just how to induce immune destruction of latently infected B cells by use of either TPA or sodium butyrate.

====Latency====

Unlike lytic replication, latency does not result in production of virions.
Instead, the EBV genome circular DNA resides in the cell nucleus as an episome and is copied by host-cell DNA polymerase. It persists in the individual&#x27;s . Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and cellular chromatin constituents, suppress the majority of the viral genes in latently infected cells. Only a portion of EBV&#x27;s genes are expressed, which support the latent state of the virus.
Latent EBV expresses its genes in one of three patterns, known as latency programs. EBV can latently persist within and epithelial cells, but different latency programs are possible in the two types of cell.

EBV can exhibit one of three latency programs: Latency I, Latency II, or Latency III. Each latency program leads to the production of a limited, distinct set of viral proteins and viral RNAs.

Also, a program is postulated in which all viral protein expression is shut off (Latency 0).

Within B cells, all three latency programs are possible. EBV latency within B cells usually progresses from Latency III to Latency II to Latency I. Each stage of latency uniquely influences B cell behavior. Upon infecting a resting naïve B cell, EBV enters Latency III. The set of proteins and RNAs produced in Latency III transforms the B cell into a proliferating blast (also known as B cell activation). Later, the virus restricts its gene expression and enters Latency II. The more limited set of proteins and RNAs produced in Latency II induces the B cell to differentiate into a memory B cell. Finally, EBV restricts gene expression even further and enters Latency I. Expression of EBNA-1 allows the EBV genome to replicate when the memory B cell divides.

Within epithelial cells, only Latency II is possible.

In primary infection, EBV replicates in oropharyngeal epithelial cells and establishes Latency III, II, and I infections in B lymphocytes. EBV latent infection of B lymphocytes is necessary for virus persistence, subsequent replication in epithelial cells, and release of infectious virus into saliva. EBV Latency III and II infections of B lymphocytes, Latency II infection of oral epithelial cells, and Latency II infection of NK- or T-cell can result in malignancies, marked by uniform EBV genome presence and gene expression.

====Reactivation====
Latent EBV in B cells can be reactivated to switch to lytic replication. This is known to happen &quot;in vivo&quot;, but what triggers it is not known precisely. &quot;In vitro&quot;, latent EBV in B cells can be reactivated by stimulating the B cell receptor, so it is likely reactivation &quot;in vivo&quot; takes place after latently infected B cells respond to unrelated infections.

===Transformation of B lymphocytes===
EBV infection of B lymphocytes leads to &quot;immortalization&quot; of these cells, meaning that the virus causes them to continue dividing indefinitely. Normally, cells have a limited lifespan and eventually die, but when EBV infects B lymphocytes, it alters their behavior, making them &quot;immortal&quot; in the sense that they can keep dividing and surviving much longer than usual. This allows the virus to persist in the body for the individual&#x27;s lifetime.

When EBV infects B cells &quot;in vitro&quot;, lymphoblastoid cell lines eventually emerge that are capable of indefinite growth. The growth transformation of these cell lines is the consequence of viral protein expression.

EBNA-2, EBNA-3C, and LMP-1, are essential for transformation, whereas EBNA-LP and the EBERs are not.

Following natural infection with EBV, the virus is thought to execute some or all of its repertoire of gene expression programs to establish a persistent infection. Given the initial absence of host immunity, the lytic cycle produces large numbers of virions to infect other (presumably) B-lymphocytes within the host.

The latent programs reprogram and subvert infected B-lymphocytes to proliferate and bring infected cells to the sites at which the virus presumably persists. Eventually, when host immunity develops, the virus persists by turning off most (or possibly all) of its genes and only occasionally reactivates and produces progeny virions. A balance is eventually struck between occasional viral reactivation and host immune surveillance removing cells that activate viral gene expression. The manipulation of the human body&#x27;s epigenetics by EBV can alter the genome of the cell to leave oncogenic phenotypes. As a result, the modification by the EBV increases the hosts likelihood of developing EBV related cancer. EBV related cancers are unique in that they are frequent to making epigenetic changes but are less likely to mutate.

The site of persistence of EBV may be bone marrow. EBV-positive patients who have had their own bone marrow replaced with bone marrow from an EBV-negative donor are found to be EBV-negative after transplantation.

=== Latent antigens ===
All EBV nuclear proteins are produced by alternative splicing of a transcript starting at either the Cp or Wp promoters at the left end of the genome (in the conventional nomenclature). The genes are ordered &quot;EBNA-LP/EBNA-2/EBNA-3A/EBNA-3B/EBNA-3C/EBNA-1&quot; within the genome.

The initiation codon of the EBNA-LP coding region is created by an alternate splice of the nuclear protein transcript. In the absence of this initiation codon,&quot; EBNA-2/EBNA-3A/EBNA-3B/EBNA-3C/EBNA-1&quot; will be expressed depending on which of these genes is alternatively spliced into the transcript.

===Protein/genes===
===Subtypes of EBV===
EBV can be divided into two major types, EBV type 1 and EBV type 2. These two subtypes have different EBNA-3 genes. As a result, the two subtypes differ in their transforming capabilities and reactivation ability. Type 1 is dominant throughout most of the world, but the two types are equally prevalent in Africa. One can distinguish EBV type 1 from EBV type 2 by cutting the viral genome with a restriction enzyme and comparing the resulting digestion patterns by gel electrophoresis.

==Detection==


Epstein–Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) are by far the most abundant EBV products transcribed in cells infected by EBV. They are commonly used as targets for the detection of EBV in histological tissues.

Clinically, the most common way to detect the presence of EBV is enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Antibodies (IgM and IgG) to proteins encoded by the EBV DNA are detected. Direct detection of EBV genome presence via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is seldom done, as this method says nothing about the immune system&#x27;s reaction to the virus. EBV viral load does not correlate well with clinical symptoms of infection.

== Role in disease ==
:&quot;See also Infectious mononucleosis and the other diseases listed in this section&quot;

EBV causes infectious mononucleosis. Children infected with EBV have few symptoms or can appear asymptomatic, but when infection is delayed to adolescence or adulthood, it can cause fatigue, fever, inflamed throat, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, enlarged spleen, swollen liver, or rash. Post-infectious chronic fatigue syndrome has also been associated with EBV infection.

EBV has also been implicated in several other diseases, including Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, stomach cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, multiple sclerosis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

EBV infected B cells have been shown to reside within the brain lesions of multiple sclerosis patients, and a 2022 study of 10 million soldiers&#x27; historical blood samples showed that &quot;Individuals who were not infected with the Epstein–Barr virus virtually never get multiple sclerosis. It&#x27;s only after Epstein–Barr virus infection that the risk of multiple sclerosis jumps up by over 30 fold&quot;, and that only EBV of many infections had such a clear connection with the disease.

Additional diseases that have been linked to EBV include Gianotti–Crosti syndrome, erythema multiforme, acute genital ulcers, and oral hairy leukoplakia. The viral infection is also associated with, and often contributes to the development of, a wide range of non-malignant lymphoproliferative diseases such as severe hypersensitivity mosquito bite allergy reactions, Epstein–Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcers, and hydroa vacciniforme as well as malignant lymphoproliferative diseases such as Epstein–Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma, Epstein–Barr virus-positive Hodgkin lymphoma, and primary effusion lymphoma.

The Epstein–Barr virus has been implicated in disorders related to alpha-synuclein aggregation (e.g. Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy).

It has been found that EBNA1 may induce chromosomal breakage in the 11th chromosome, specifically in the 11q23 region between the FAM55D gene and FAM55B, which EBNA-1 appears to have a high affinity for due to its DNA-binding domain having an interest in a specific palindromic repeat in this section of the genome. While the cause and exact mechanism for this is unknown, the byproduct results in errors and breakage of the chromosomal structure as cells stemming from the line of the tainted genome undergo mitosis. Since genes in this area have been implicated in leukemia and is home to a tumor suppressor gene that is modified or not present in most tumor gene expression, it&#x27;s been hypothesized that breakage in this area is the main culprit behind the cancers that EBV increases the chance of. The breakage is also dose-dependent, a person with a latent infection will have less breakage than a person with a novel or reactivated infection since EBNA1 levels in the nucleus and nucleolus are higher during active attack of the body because of the constant replication and take-over of cells in the body.

The complexities of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persistence and its integration into host genomes have been explored. Research involving tissue samples from individuals with various conditions revealed that viral sequences were highly conserved, indicating long-term persistence from dominant strains. Notably, EBV was found to integrate into the host genome in cases of malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma, where a significant integration event was observed involving the EBV LMP-1 gene and chromosome 17. This integration likely occurred via microhomology-mediated end joining, suggesting a potential mechanism through which EBV may influence tumorigenesis. Moreover, instances of high viral loads and accompanying genetic diversity were noted in patients with active disease, underscoring the virus&#x27;s dynamic nature within the host and its possible contribution to the progression of EBV-associated cancers.

== History ==
The Epstein–Barr virus was named after M.A. Epstein and Yvonne Barr, who discovered the virus together with Bert Achong. In 1961, Epstein, a pathologist and expert electron microscopist, attended a lecture on &quot;The commonest children&#x27;s cancer in tropical Africa—a hitherto unrecognised syndrome&quot; by D. P. Burkitt, a surgeon practicing in Uganda, in which Burkitt described the &quot;endemic variant&quot; (pediatric form) of the disease that now bears his name. In 1963, a specimen was sent from Uganda to Middlesex Hospital to be cultured. Virus particles were identified in the cultured cells, and the results were published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1964 by Epstein, Achong, and Barr. Cell lines were sent to Werner and Gertrude Henle at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia who developed serological markers. In 1967, a technician in their laboratory developed mononucleosis and they were able to compare a stored serum sample, showing that antibodies to the virus developed. In 1968, they discovered that EBV can directly immortalize B cells after infection, mimicking some forms of EBV-related infections, and confirmed the link between the virus and infectious mononucleosis.

==Research==
As a relatively complex virus, EBV is not yet fully understood. Laboratories around the world continue to study the virus and develop new ways to treat the diseases it causes. One popular way of studying EBV &quot;in vitro&quot; is to use bacterial artificial chromosomes. Epstein–Barr virus can be maintained and manipulated in the laboratory in continual latency (a property shared with Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, another of the eight human herpesviruses). Although many viruses are assumed to have this property during infection of their natural hosts, there is not an easily managed system for studying this part of the viral lifecycle. Genomic studies of EBV have been able to explore lytic reactivation and regulation of the latent viral episome.

Although under active research, an Epstein–Barr virus vaccine is not yet available. The development of an effective vaccine could prevent up to 200,000 cancers globally per year. The absence of effective animal models is an obstacle to development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against EBV.

It is possible, in theory, that a prolonged use of valaciclovir, an antiviral drug approved to treat herpes simplex or herpes zoster, might lead to Epstein–Barr eradication, but such theory was not confirmed by any study. Antiviral agents act by inhibiting viral DNA replication, but there is little evidence that they are effective against Epstein–Barr virus. Moreover, they are expensive, risk causing resistance to antiviral agents, and (in 1% to 10% of cases) can cause unpleasant side effects.

<text>Write protection is any physical mechanism that prevents writing, modifying, or erasing data on a device. Most commercial software, audio and video on writeable media is write-protected when distributed.

== Examples ==
* IBM -inch magnetic tape reels, introduced in the 1950s, had a circular groove on one side of the reel, into which a soft plastic ring had to be placed in order to write on the tape. (&quot;No ring, no write.&quot;)
* Audio cassettes and VHS videocassettes have tabs on the top/rear edge that can be broken off (uncovered = protected). 
* 8 and -inch floppies can have, respectively, write-protect and write-enable notches on the right side (8-inch punched = protected; -inch covered/notch not present = protected). A common practice with single-sided floppies was to punch a second notch on the opposite side of the disk to enable use of both sides of the media, creating a flippy disk, so called because one originally had to flip the disk over to use the other side.
* -inch floppy disks have a sliding tab in a window on the right side (open = protected).
* Iomega Zip disks were write-protected using the IomegaWare software.
* Syquest EZ-drive (135 &amp; 250 MB) disks were write-protected using a small metal switch on the rear of the disk at the bottom.
* VHS-C, Video8, Hi8, and DV videocassettes have a sliding tab on the rear edge.
* Iomega ditto tape cartridges had a small sliding tab on the top left hand corner on the front face of the cartridge.
* USB flash drives sometimes have a small switch, though this has become uncommon. An example of a USB flash drive that supported write protection via a switch is the Transcend JetFlash series.
* Secure Digital (SD) cards have a write-protect tab on the left side.
* Extensively, media that, by means of design, can&#x27;t operate outside from this mode: CD-R, DVD-R, Vinyl records, etc.
These mechanisms are intended to prevent only accidental data loss or attacks by computer viruses. A determined user can easily circumvent them either by covering a notch with adhesive tape or by creating one with a punch as appropriate, or sometimes by physically altering the media transport to ignore the write-protect mechanism.

Write-protection is typically enforced by the hardware. In the case of computer devices, attempting to violate it will return an error to the operating system while some tape recorders physically lock the record button when a write-protected cassette is present.

== Write blocking ==
Write blocking, a subset of write protection, is a technique used in computer forensics in order to maintain the integrity of data storage devices. By preventing all write operations to the device, e.g. a hard drive, it can be ensured that the device remains unaltered by data recovery methods.

Hardware write blocking was invented by Mark Menz and Steve Bress (US patent 6,813,682 and EU patent EP1,342,145).

Both hardware and software write-blocking methods are used; however, software blocking is generally not as reliable, due to human error.

<doc id="214556" wikidata="Q3478113" url="?curid=214556" title="Self-denying Ordinance">
<text>The Self-denying Ordinance was passed by the English Parliament on 3 April 1645. All members of the House of Commons or Lords who were also officers in the Parliamentary army or navy were required to resign one or the other, within 40 days from 3 April 1645.

It was part of a set of reforms designed to ensure victory, another being the establishment of a professional, centrally-controlled New Model Army, which replaced the existing system of regional armies. It was also linked to an internal political struggle between a Peace Party, who wanted a negotiated settlement with King Charles, and a War Party which wanted to dictate terms.

First introduced in December 1644, the bill passed at the second attempt. As members of the Lords could not resign their titles, it effectively removed aristocratic commanders like the Earls of Manchester and Essex. Under the amended version, they were still required to resign their commissions, but could be re-appointed.

==Political motivation==
At the outset of the First English Civil War, Parliament gave command of its main armies to members of the aristocracy. This was in accordance with well-established practices of the day, and generalships were accorded to the earls of Manchester and Essex among others. Edward Montagu, Earl of Manchester, was given charge of the Eastern Association, where Cromwell served under him as a cavalry officer.

Parliament was soon hindered by dissension within this military leadership. These officers were not professional soldiers; their experience and skill at warfare varied. More significantly, a faction of them avoided engagements with the Cavalier forces, hoping that reconciliation with King Charles I was still possible. The Earl of Manchester, perhaps the most prominent of these, expressed his pessimism for the war as follows: &quot;If we beat the King ninety and nine times yet he is king still, and so will his posterity be after him; but if the King beat us once, we shall be all hanged, and our posterity be made slaves&quot;.

As the war proceeded, it was clear that Essex and Manchester were at best half-hearted in pursuing the fight against the Royalists, an attitude that became ever more apparent as the struggle became more radical. The growing rift between the Lords and the Commons finally came to a point of crisis when the fruits of the great victory at the Battle of Marston Moor were allowed to slip away at the disappointing Second Battle of Newbury. It was after this that the political tensions between Oliver Cromwell and Manchester could no longer be contained by the established forms of command.

Members of Parliament, notably Oliver Cromwell and Sir William Waller, saw the need for radical reform of the army. For Cromwell, this attack on Manchester&#x27;s conduct ultimately became an attack on the Lords, most of whom held the same views as Manchester, and on the Scots, who attempted to bring Cromwell to trial as an &quot;incendiary&quot;. At the height of this bitter controversy, Cromwell suddenly proposed to stifle all animosities by the resignation of all officers who were members of either House. This proposal, in theory, affected himself no less than the Earls of Essex and Manchester.

==Terms of the ordinance==
The first Self-denying Bill was put before Parliament on 9 December 1644. It provided that &quot;no member of either house shall have or execute any office or command&quot;, etc. in the armed forces. One of the exceptions was Oliver Cromwell. It passed the House of Commons on 19 December but was thrown out by the Lords on 13 January 1645. The Lords, naturally, were reluctant to approve an ordinance that would automatically exclude nobles from military command. It also &quot;weeded out&quot; the &quot;half measures men&quot; such as Lords Essex and Manchester.

A second version of the bill was prepared, which required resignations as above, but did not forbid re-appointment of the officers. This bill was agreed to on 3 April 1645.

==Historic significance==
The Self-denying Ordinance improved military unity by separating the quarrels in Parliament from the immediate operations of command. Leaders from the Presbyterian &quot;peace party&quot; faction in Parliament resigned their military positions to retain their political powers; Lords Manchester and Essex forfeited their generalships, as Lord Warwick did his command of the navy. Leadership of Parliament&#x27;s troops fell to Sir Thomas Fairfax, then a lieutenant general, who was among the few officers still eligible for the post.

In practical terms, the ordinance solidified the power of Cromwell and his &quot;war party&quot; faction. Cromwell was a member of the House of Commons, so he was obliged to resign his post as well. However, the Committee of Both Kingdoms, which oversaw the war, found his talents as a soldier indispensable. His term in command was extended several times, in forty-day increments, until it was finally made permanent. While this appointment was officially as Fairfax&#x27;s lieutenant general, Cromwell wielded influence well beyond his rank.

More broadly, this reform helped usher in the New Model Army. This reorganized force, designed for unity and efficiency, incorporated several practices recognizable in modern armies. In addition to a professional officer corps promoted on merit, it replaced the sometimes bulky local units with nationally controlled regiments, standardized training protocols, and ensured regular salary payments to the troops. This army soon turned the war in favour of Parliament, decisively beating the Royalist forces at the battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645.

<text>King Solomon&#x27;s Carpet (1991) is a novel by Barbara Vine, pseudonym of Ruth Rendell. It is about the London Underground and the people frequenting it. Vine&#x27;s novel is inhabited by ordinary passengers, tube aficionados, pickpockets, buskers, vigilantes, and children who go &quot;sledging&quot; on the roofs of train carriages as an initiation rite. The title of the book refers to the legend of King Solomon&#x27;s magic carpet of green silk which, as it could fly and brought everyone to their destination, is likened to the underground. &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Carpet&quot; is one of the few novels set in London which should be read with the help of a tube map. It won the CWA Gold Dagger for best crime novel of the year in 1991.

==Plot summary==

Jarvis Stringer is a student of the London Tube and its history and of underground trains worldwide. In order to finance his hobby and be able to travel to distant lands to inspect the underground systems in other parts of the world, he lets rooms in an old disused school building he has inherited which is close to the London Underground tracks in West Hampstead. There gather a group of misfits and weirdos, including a squatter, whose dreams of the good life have time and again been shattered as they are constantly victimised by society. There is 24-year-old Alice, an aspiring musician who leaves her husband and new-born baby only to end up busking in various stations in central London. There is Tom, who, after an accident, drops out of music school and is reduced to busking as well but who dreams of one day starting his own business. There is unemployed Tina, whose promiscuity landed her with two children whom she does not take care of in the way her mother thinks she ought to. There is Jed, who volunteers as a vigilante and who, disappointed by humans, lavishes all his love on the hawk he has acquired and which he keeps in the house. And there is Axel, an enigmatic man who regularly travels on the tube in the company of a man disguised as a bear and who is planning something illegal.

Cecilia and Daphne, two old ladies living in the neighbourhood, serve as a foil to this ill-assorted group. It is Cecilia in particular who does not understand how young people such as her daughter Tina can be utterly devoid of morals. She is shocked to learn that her 10-year-old grandson enjoys riding on the roof of carriages as they go through deep-level tunnels. While travelling on the tube herself, her handbag containing her credit cards is stolen, and she suffers a stroke in one of the packed carriages.

The novel is interspersed with extracts from Jarvis Stringer&#x27;s (fictional) book on the London Underground.

<doc id="214559" wikidata="Q236599" url="?curid=214559" title="Ethel Smyth">
<text>Dame Ethel Mary Smyth (; 22 April 18588 May 1944) was an English composer and a member of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Her compositions include songs, works for piano, chamber music, orchestral works, choral works and operas.

Smyth tended to be marginalised as a &quot;woman composer&quot;, as though her work could not be accepted as mainstream. Yet when she produced more delicate compositions, they were criticised for not measuring up to the standard of her male peers. She was the first female composer granted a damehood.

==Family background==
Ethel Smyth was born in Sidcup, Kent, which is now in the London Borough of Bexley, on 22 April 1858, the fourth of eight children. While 22 April is the actual date of her birth, Smyth habitually stated it was 23 April, the day that was celebrated by her family, as they enjoyed the coincidence with William Shakespeare&#x27;s. Her father, John Hall Smyth, who was a major general in the Royal Artillery, was very much opposed to her making a career in music. She lived at Frimhurst, near Frimley Green for many years, before moving to Hook Heath on the outskirts of Woking. Her youngest brother was Robert (&quot;Bob&quot;) Napier Smyth (1868–1947), who rose to become a Brigadier in the British Army. She was the aunt of Lieutenant General Sir Ralph Eastwood.

==Musical career==
Smyth was a child prodigy. She was a stellar pianist at a very young age and was able to compose her first hymn by the age of 10. She decided to study music at the age of 12. Smyth first studied with Alexander Ewing when she was 17. He introduced her to the music of Wagner and Berlioz. After a major battle with her father about her plans to devote her life to music, Smyth was allowed to advance her musical education at the Leipzig Conservatory, where she studied Brahmsian musical composition with Carl Reinecke. She left after a year, however, disillusioned with the low standard of teaching, and continued her music studies privately with Heinrich von Herzogenberg. While at the Leipzig Conservatory, Smyth met Dvořák, Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Through Herzogenberg, she also met Clara Schumann and Brahms. Upon her return to England, Smyth formed a supportive friendship with Arthur Sullivan in the last years of his life; he respected her and encouraged her work.

Smyth&#x27;s extensive body of work includes the Concerto for Violin, Horn and Orchestra and the Mass in D. It was the latter&#x27;s performance in London&#x27;s Albert Hall in 1893 that helped her gain recognition as a serious composer. Her opera &quot;The Wreckers&quot; is considered by some critics to be the &quot;most important English opera composed during the period between Purcell and Britten&quot;. Her best known work, she composed it to a French libretto by Henry Brewster. It premiered in 1906. In 2022 it received its first professional production in its original French text at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. It was also performed at the BBC Proms, where its prelude or overture was presented 27 times between 1913 and 1947.

Another of her operas, &quot;Der Wald&quot;, mounted in 1903, was, for more than a century, the only opera by a woman composer ever produced at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera (until Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amour de loin&quot; in December 2016).

On 28 May 1928, the nascent BBC broadcast two concerts of Smyth&#x27;s music, marking her &quot;musical jubilee&quot;, The first comprised chamber music, the second, conducted by Smyth herself, choral works. Otherwise, recognition in England came somewhat late for Smyth, wrote the conductor Leon Botstein at the time he conducted the American Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s US premiere of &quot;The Wreckers&quot; in New York on 30 September 2007:

After her release from prison, Smyth composed her final major work, the hour-long vocal symphony &quot;The Prison&quot;, setting a text by Henry Bennett Brewster. It was first performed in 1931. The first recording was issued by Chandos in 2020. Smyth’s composing and conducting career came to a premature end before the 1920s as she started to develop hearing loss, which eventually led to her becoming completely deaf. However, she found a new interest in literature and, between 1919 and 1940, she published ten highly successful, mostly autobiographical, books.

=== Critical reception ===
Overall, critical reaction to her work was mixed. She was alternately praised and panned for writing music that was considered too masculine for a &quot;lady composer&quot;, as critics called her. Though Smyth’s four movement Serenade earned her orchestral and public debut in England, she had to change her name to the pseudonym E.M. Smith to avoid biased criticism. Eugene Gates writes that:
Smyth&#x27;s music was seldom evaluated as simply the work of a composer among composers, but as that of a &quot;woman composer&quot;. This worked to keep her on the margins of the profession, and, coupled with the double standard of sexual aesthetics, also placed her in a double bind. On the one hand, when she composed powerful, rhythmically vital music, it was said that her work lacked feminine charm; on the other, when she produced delicate, melodious compositions, she was accused of not measuring up to the artistic standards of her male colleagues. 
Other critics were more favourable: &quot;The composer is a learned musician: it is learning which gives her the power to express her natural inborn sense of humour... Dr. Smyth knows her Mozart and her Sullivan: she has learned how to write conversations in music... [The Boatswain&#x27;s Mate] is one of the merriest, most tuneful, and most delightful comic operas ever put on the stage.&quot;

==Involvement with the suffrage movement==

In 1910, Smyth joined the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU), which agitated for women&#x27;s suffrage, giving up music for two years to devote herself to the cause. Smyth argued in her memoirs that the disadvantages that women face in music stems from the lack of a political vote or voice. She developed a very close relationship with the charismatic leader of the WSPU, Emmeline Pankhurst, and accompanied her on many occasions. Soon after, Smyth composed her most famous, &quot;The March of the Women&quot; (1911) to words by Cicely Hamilton. The text was used to inspire women to unite and free themselves from patriarchal rule. This eventually became the anthem of the WSPU and the suffragette movement.

Smyth is credited with teaching Emmeline Pankhurst how to throw stones in 1912. After further practice aiming stones at trees near the home of fellow suffragette Zelie Emerson, Pankhurst called on WPSU members to break a window of the house of any politician who opposed votes for women. Smyth was one of the 109 members who responded to Pankhurst&#x27;s call, asking to be sent to attack the home of Colonial Secretary Lewis Harcourt, who had remarked that if his wife&#x27;s beauty and wisdom was present in all women, they would have already won the vote.

Smyth stood half the bail for Helen Craggs, who had been caught on the way to carry out the arson of the leading politician&#x27;s home. During the stone-throwing, Pankhurst and 100 other women were arrested, and Smyth served two months in Holloway Prison. When Thomas Beecham, her proponent-friend, went to visit her there, he found suffragettes marching in the quadrangle and singing, as Smyth leaned out of a window conducting the song with a toothbrush.

In her book, &quot;Female Pipings in Eden&quot;, Smyth said her prison experience was of being &quot;in good company&quot; of united women &quot;old, young, rich, poor, strong, delicate&quot;, putting the cause they were imprisoned for before their personal needs. Smyth revealed that the prison was infested with cockroaches, even in the hospital ward. She was released early, due to a medical assessment that she was mentally unstable and hysterical. Smyth gave written evidence in the November trial of Pankhurst and others for inciting violence, stating that she (Smyth) had freely engaged in activism. She continued to correspond with Pankhurst, and heard of her getting lost trying to find the safe house provided for her to avoid re-arrest in Scotland.

Smyth strongly disagreed with the support Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel gave to the war effort in 1914, but she did train as a radiographer in Paris. Her fractious friendship with Christabel ended in 1925, and Smyth conducted the Metropolitan Police Band at the unveiling of the statue to Pankhurst in London in 1930.

==Personal life==
Smyth had several passionate affairs, most of them with women. Smyth was at one time in love with the married suffragette Pankhurst. At the age of 71, she fell in love with writer Virginia Woolf – herself having worked in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement – who, both alarmed and amused, said it was &quot;like being caught by a giant crab&quot;, but the two became friends. Smyth&#x27;s relationship with Violet Gordon-Woodhouse is depicted satirically in Roger Scruton&#x27;s 2005 opera, &quot;Violet.&quot;

Her philosopher-friend and the librettist of some of her operas, Henry Bennet Brewster, may have been her only male lover. She wrote to him in 1892: &quot;I wonder why it is so much easier for me to love my own sex more passionately than yours. I can&#x27;t make it out, for I am a very healthy-minded person&quot;. She met Willie Wilde, the brother of Oscar Wilde, during a trip to Ireland. They became engaged on the return railway journey from Holyhead to Euston, but she broke it off within three weeks.

In recognition of her work as a composer and writer, Smyth was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1922, becoming the first female composer to be awarded a damehood. Smyth received honorary doctorates in music from the universities of Durham and Oxford. She died in Woking in 1944 at the age of 86. 

Smyth was actively involved in sport throughout her life. In her youth, she was a keen horse-rider and tennis player. She was a passionate golfer and a member of the ladies&#x27; section of Woking Golf Club, near where she lived. After she died and was cremated, her ashes were, as she had requested, scattered in the woods neighbouring the club by her brother Bob. Her musical executor was the composer and musicologist Kathleen Dale, a close neighbour.

==Representations and legacy==

Ethel Smyth featured, under the name of Edith Staines, in E. F. Benson&#x27;s &quot;Dodo&quot; books (1893–1921), decades before the quaint musical characters of his more famous Mapp and Lucia series. She &quot;gleefully acknowledged&quot; the portrait, according to Prunella Scales.
She was later a model for the fictional Dame Hilda Tablet in the 1950s radio plays of Henry Reed.

She was portrayed by Maureen Pryor in the 1974 BBC television film &quot;Shoulder to Shoulder&quot;.

Judy Chicago&#x27;s monumental work of feminist art, &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, features a place setting for Smyth.

Since 2018, the actress and singer, Lucy Stevens, has portrayed Ethel Smyth on stage at various venues in Britain.

In 2021, Smyth posthumously received a Grammy for Best Classical Vocal Solo based on the recording of The Prison by conductor James Blachly and soloists Sarah Brailey and Dashon Burton, members of Experiential Orchestra. Their rendition was released in August 2020 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in the United States.

In March 2022, in recognition of International Women&#x27;s Day, a larger-than-size statue by Christine Charlesworth of Smyth conducting was unveiled in Duke&#x27;s Court Plaza, Woking, by the Mayor of Woking, Cllr Liam Lyons, with invited guests who included members of Smyth&#x27;s family as well as academics and councillors. Charlesworth described her sculpture as:

Ethel stands, wearing her usual tweed skirt, enthusiastically conducting passers-by with her over-sized baton, as presented to her at the Royal Albert Hall by Emeline Pankhurst.
&lt;br&gt;
Her jacket is half open, her arms are beating out the time and her eyes are full of concentration as she battles with her hearing loss, which went completely in her 50&#x27;s.
&lt;br&gt;
Also detailed in her pocket is a sheaf of paper which could be ideas for a new opera, or maybe notes for a new book, as well as sketches and polemical essays.

<doc id="214570" wikidata="Q14876077" url="?curid=214570" title="Protein catabolism">
<text>In molecular biology, protein catabolism is the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides and ultimately into amino acids. Protein catabolism is a key function of digestion process. Protein catabolism often begins with pepsin, which converts proteins into polypeptides. These polypeptides are then further degraded. In humans, the pancreatic proteases include trypsin, chymotrypsin, and other enzymes. In the intestine, the small peptides are broken down into amino acids that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. These absorbed amino acids can then undergo amino acid catabolism, where they are utilized as an energy source or as precursors to new proteins.

The amino acids produced by catabolism may be directly recycled to form new proteins, converted into different amino acids, or can undergo amino acid catabolism to be converted to other compounds via the Krebs cycle.

==Interface with other metabolic and salvage pathways ==
Protein catabolism produces amino acids that are used to form other proteins or oxidized to meet the energy needs of the cell. The amino acids that are produced by protein catabolism can then be further catabolized in amino acid catabolism. Among the several degradative processes for amino acids are Deamination (removal of an amino group), transamination (transfer of amino group), decarboxylation (removal of carboxyl group), and dehydrogenation (removal of hydrogen). Degradation of amino acids can function as part of a salvage pathway, whereby parts of degraded amino acids are used to create new amino acids, or as part of a metabolic pathway whereby the amino acid is broken down to release or recapture chemical energy. For example, the chemical energy that is released by oxidization in a dehydrogenation reaction can be used to reduce NAD+ to NADH, which can then be fed directly into the Krebs/Citric Acid (TCA) Cycle.

== Protein degradation ==
Protein degradation differs from protein catabolism. Proteins are produced and destroyed routinely as part of the normal operations of the cell. Transcription factors, proteins that help regulate protein synthesis, are targets of such degradations. Their degradation is not a significant contributor to the energy needs of the cell. The addition of ubiquitin (ubiquitylation) marks a protein for degradation via the proteasome.

== Amino acid degradation ==
Oxidative deamination is the first step to breaking down the amino acids so that they can be converted to sugars. The process begins by removing the amino group of the amino acids. The amino group becomes ammonium as it is lost and later undergoes the urea cycle to become urea, in the liver. It is then released into the blood stream, where it is transferred to the kidneys, which will secrete the urea as urine. The remaining portion of the amino acid becomes oxidized, resulting in an α-keto acid. The alpha-keto acid will then proceed into the TCA cycle, in order to produce energy. The acid can also enter glycolysis, where it will be eventually converted into pyruvate. The pyruvate is then converted into acetyl-CoA so that it can enter the TCA cycle and convert the original pyruvate molecules into ATP, or usable energy for the organism.

Transamination leads to the same result as deamination: the remaining acid will undergo either glycolysis or the TCA cycle to produce energy that the organism&#x27;s body will use for various purposes. This process transfers the amino group instead of losing the amino group to be converted into ammonium. The amino group is transferred to α-ketoglutarate, so that it can be converted to glutamate. Then glutamate transfers the amino group to oxaloacetate. This transfer is so that the oxaloacetate can be converted to aspartate or other amino acids. Eventually, this product will also proceed into oxidative deamination to once again produce alpha-ketoglutarate, an alpha-keto acid that will undergo the TCA cycle, and ammonium, which will eventually undergo the urea cycle.

Transaminases are enzymes that help catalyze the reactions that take place in transamination. They help catalyze the reaction at the point when the amino group is transferred from the original amino acid, like glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, and hold onto it to transfer it to another α-ketoacid.

== Factors determining protein half-life ==
Some key factors that determine overall rate include protein half-life, pH, and temperature.

Protein half-life helps determine the overall rate as this designates the first step in protein catabolism. Depending on whether this step is short or long will influence the rest of the metabolic process. One key component in determining the protein half-life is based on the N-end rule. This states that the amino acid present at the N-terminus of a protein helps determine the protein&#x27;s half-life.

<text>Catabolism () is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Catabolism breaks down large molecules (such as polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins) into smaller units (such as monosaccharides, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acids, respectively). Catabolism is the breaking-down aspect of metabolism, whereas anabolism is the building-up aspect.

Cells use the monomers released from breaking down polymers to either construct new polymer molecules or degrade the monomers further to simple waste products, releasing energy. Cellular wastes include lactic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and urea. The formation of these wastes is usually an oxidation process involving a release of chemical free energy, some of which is lost as heat, but the rest of which is used to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This molecule acts as a way for the cell to transfer the energy released by catabolism to the energy-requiring reactions that make up anabolism.

Catabolism is a destructive metabolism and anabolism is a constructive metabolism. Catabolism, therefore, provides the chemical energy necessary for the maintenance and growth of cells. Examples of catabolic processes include glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the breakdown of muscle protein in order to use amino acids as substrates for gluconeogenesis, the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue to fatty acids, and oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters by monoamine oxidase.

== Catabolic hormones ==
There are many signals that control catabolism. Most of the known signals are hormones and the molecules involved in metabolism itself. Endocrinologists have traditionally classified many of the hormones as anabolic or catabolic, depending on which part of metabolism they stimulate. The so-called classic catabolic hormones known since the early 20th century are cortisol, glucagon, and adrenaline (and other catecholamines). In recent decades, many more hormones with at least some catabolic effects have been discovered, including cytokines, orexin (known as hypocretin), and melatonin.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;catabolism&quot; is from Neo-Latin, which got the roots from Greek: κάτω &quot;kato&quot;, &quot;downward&quot; and βάλλειν &quot;ballein&quot;, &quot;to throw&quot;.

<doc id="214572" wikidata="Q184681" url="?curid=214572" title="Anabolism">
<text>Anabolism () is the set of metabolic pathways that construct macromolecules like DNA or RNA from smaller units. These reactions require energy, known also as an endergonic process. Anabolism is the building-up aspect of metabolism, whereas catabolism is the breaking-down aspect. Anabolism is usually synonymous with biosynthesis.

== Pathway ==
Polymerization, an anabolic pathway used to build macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides, uses condensation reactions to join monomers. Macromolecules are created from smaller molecules using enzymes and cofactors.
=== Energy source ===
Anabolism is powered by catabolism, where large molecules are broken down into smaller parts and then used up in cellular respiration. Many anabolic processes are powered by the cleavage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Anabolism usually involves reduction and decreases entropy, making it unfavorable without energy input. The starting materials, called the precursor molecules, are joined using the chemical energy made available from hydrolyzing ATP, reducing the cofactors NAD+, NADP+, and FAD, or performing other favorable side reactions. Occasionally it can also be driven by entropy without energy input, in cases like the formation of the phospholipid bilayer of a cell, where hydrophobic interactions aggregate the molecules.

=== Cofactors ===
The reducing agents NADH, NADPH, and FADH2, as well as metal ions, act as cofactors at various steps in anabolic pathways. NADH, NADPH, and FADH2 act as electron carriers, while charged metal ions within enzymes stabilize charged functional groups on substrates.

=== Substrates ===
Substrates for anabolism are mostly intermediates taken from catabolic pathways during periods of high energy charge in the cell.

== Functions ==
Anabolic processes build organs and tissues. These processes produce growth and differentiation of cells and increase in body size, a process that involves synthesis of complex molecules. Examples of anabolic processes include the growth and mineralization of bone and increases in muscle mass.

=== Anabolic hormones ===
Endocrinologists have traditionally classified hormones as anabolic or catabolic, depending on which part of metabolism they stimulate. The classic anabolic hormones are the anabolic steroids, which stimulate protein synthesis and muscle growth, and insulin.

=== Photosynthetic carbohydrate synthesis ===
Photosynthetic carbohydrate synthesis in plants and certain bacteria is an anabolic process that produces glucose, cellulose, starch, lipids, and proteins from CO2. It uses the energy produced from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis, and creates the precursors to these large molecules via carbon assimilation in the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, a.k.a. the Calvin cycle.
=== Amino acid biosynthesis ===
All amino acids are formed from intermediates in the catabolic processes of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. From glycolysis, glucose 6-phosphate is a precursor for histidine; 3-phosphoglycerate is a precursor for glycine and cysteine; phosphoenol pyruvate, combined with the &quot;3-phosphoglycerate&quot;-derivative erythrose 4-phosphate, forms tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine; and pyruvate is a precursor for alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. From the citric acid cycle, α-ketoglutarate is converted into glutamate and subsequently glutamine, proline, and arginine; and oxaloacetate is converted into aspartate and subsequently asparagine, methionine, threonine, and lysine.

=== Glycogen storage ===
During periods of high blood sugar, glucose 6-phosphate from glycolysis is diverted to the glycogen-storing pathway. It is changed to glucose-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase and then to UDP-glucose by UTP--glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen synthase adds this UDP-glucose to a glycogen chain.

=== Gluconeogenesis ===
Glucagon is traditionally a catabolic hormone, but also stimulates the anabolic process of gluconeogenesis by the liver, and to a lesser extent the kidney cortex and intestines, during starvation to prevent low blood sugar. It is the process of converting pyruvate into glucose. Pyruvate can come from the breakdown of glucose, lactate, amino acids, or glycerol. The gluconeogenesis pathway has many reversible enzymatic processes in common with glycolysis, but it is not the process of glycolysis in reverse. It uses different irreversible enzymes to ensure the overall pathway runs in one direction only.

== Regulation ==
Anabolism operates with separate enzymes from catalysis, which undergo irreversible steps at some point in their pathways. This allows the cell to regulate the rate of production and prevent an infinite loop, also known as a futile cycle, from forming with catabolism.

The balance between anabolism and catabolism is sensitive to ADP and ATP, otherwise known as the energy charge of the cell. High amounts of ATP cause cells to favor the anabolic pathway and slow catabolic activity, while excess ADP slows anabolism and favors catabolism. These pathways are also regulated by circadian rhythms, with processes such as glycolysis fluctuating to match an animal&#x27;s normal periods of activity throughout the day.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;anabolism&quot; is from Neo-Latin, with roots from , &quot;upward&quot; and , &quot;to throw&quot;.

<text>Digestion is the breakdown of carbohydrates to yield an energy-rich compound called ATP. The production of ATP is achieved through the oxidation of glucose molecules. In oxidation, the electrons are stripped from a glucose molecule to reduce NAD+ and FAD. NAD+ and FAD possess a high energy potential to drive the production of ATP in the electron transport chain. ATP production occurs in the mitochondria of the cell. There are two methods of producing ATP: aerobic and anaerobic. 
In aerobic respiration, oxygen is required. Using oxygen increases ATP production from 4 ATP molecules to about 30 ATP molecules.
In anaerobic respiration, oxygen is not required. When oxygen is absent, the generation of ATP continues through fermentation. There are two types of fermentation: alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.

There are several different types of carbohydrates: polysaccharides (e.g., starch, amylopectin, glycogen, cellulose), monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, galactose, fructose, ribose) and the disaccharides (e.g., sucrose, maltose, lactose).

Monosaccharides, also known as simple sugars, are the most basic, fundamental unit of a carbohydrate. These are simple sugars with the general chemical structure of C6H12O6.

Disaccharides are a type of carbohydrate. Disaccharides consist of compound sugars containing two monosaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule with the general chemical structure C12H22O11.

Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates that consist of a polymer that contains three to ten monosaccharides linked together by glycosidic bonds.

Glucose reacts with oxygen in the following reaction, C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O. Carbon dioxide and water are waste products, and the overall reaction is exothermic.

The reaction of glucose with oxygen releasing energy in the form of molecules of ATP is therefore one of the most important biochemical pathways found in living organisms.

==Glycolysis==

Glycolysis, which means “sugar splitting,” is the initial process in the cellular respiration pathway. Glycolysis can be either an aerobic or anaerobic process. When oxygen is present, glycolysis continues along the aerobic respiration pathway. If oxygen is not present, then ATP production is restricted to anaerobic respiration. The location where glycolysis, aerobic or anaerobic, occurs is in the cytosol of the cell. In glycolysis, a six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate. These carbon molecules are oxidized into NADH and ATP. For the glucose molecule to oxidize into pyruvate, an input of ATP molecules is required. This is known as the investment phase, in which a total of two ATP molecules are consumed. At the end of glycolysis, the total yield of ATP is four molecules, but the net gain is two ATP molecules. Even though ATP is synthesized, the two ATP molecules produced are few compared to the second and third pathways, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
==Fermentation==

Even if there is no oxygen present, glycolysis can continue to generate ATP. However, for glycolysis to continue to produce ATP, there must be NAD+ present, which is responsible for oxidizing glucose. This is achieved by recycling NADH back to NAD+. When NAD+ is reduced to NADH, the electrons from NADH are eventually transferred to a separate organic molecule, transforming NADH back to NAD+. This process of renewing the supply of NAD+ is called fermentation, which falls into two categories.

===Alcohol Fermentation===
In alcohol fermentation, when a glucose molecule is oxidized, ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and carbon dioxide are byproducts. The organic molecule that is responsible for renewing the NAD+ supply in this type of fermentation is the pyruvate from glycolysis. Each pyruvate releases a carbon dioxide molecule, turning into acetaldehyde. The acetaldehyde is then reduced by the NADH produced from glycolysis, forming the alcohol waste product, ethanol, and forming NAD+, thereby replenishing its supply for glycolysis to continue producing ATP.

===Lactic Acid Fermentation===
In lactic acid fermentation, each pyruvate molecule is directly reduced by NADH. The only byproduct from this type of fermentation is lactate. Lactic acid fermentation is used by human muscle cells as a means of generating ATP during strenuous exercise where oxygen consumption is higher than the supplied oxygen. As this process progresses, the surplus of lactate is brought to the liver, which converts it back to pyruvate.

==Respiration==
===The Citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle)===
If oxygen is present, then following glycolysis, the two pyruvate molecules are brought into the mitochondrion itself to go through the Krebs cycle. In this cycle, the pyruvate molecules from glycolysis are further broken down to harness the remaining energy. Each pyruvate goes through a series of reactions that converts it to acetyl coenzyme A. From here, only the acetyl group participates in the Krebs cycle—in which it goes through a series of redox reactions, catalyzed by enzymes, to further harness the energy from the acetyl group. The energy from the acetyl group, in the form of electrons, is used to reduce NAD+ and FAD to NADH and FADH2, respectively. NADH and FADH2 contain the stored energy harnessed from the initial glucose molecule and is used in the electron transport chain where the bulk of the ATP is produced.

===Oxidative phosphorylation===
The last process in aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, also known as the electron transport chain. Here NADH and FADH2 deliver their electrons to oxygen and protons at the inner membranes of the mitochondrion, facilitating the production of ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation contributes the majority of the ATP produced, compared to glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. While the ATP count is glycolysis and the Krebs cycle is two ATP molecules, the electron transport chain contributes, at most, twenty-eight ATP molecules. A contributing factor is due to the energy potentials of NADH and FADH2. A second contributing factor is that cristae, the inner membranes of mitochondria, increase the surface area and therefore the amount of proteins in the membrane that assist in the synthesis of ATP. Along the electron transport chain, there are separate compartments, each with their own concentration gradient of H + ions, which are the power source of ATP synthesis. To convert ADP to ATP, energy must be provided. That energy is provided by the H+ gradient. On one side of the membrane compartment, there is a high concentration of H+ ions compared to the other. The shuttling of H+ to one side of the membrane is driven by the exergonic flow of electrons throughout the membrane. These electrons are supplied by NADH and FADH2 as they transfer their potential energy. Once the H+ concentration gradient is established, a proton-motive force is established, which provides the energy to convert ADP to ATP. The H+ ions that were initially forced to one side of the mitochondrion membrane now naturally flow through a membrane protein called ATP synthase, a protein that converts ADP to ATP with the help of H+ ions.

<text>The willie wagtail (also spelt willy wagtail), scientific name Rhipidura leucophrys, is a passerine bird native to Australia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Eastern Indonesia. It is a common and familiar bird throughout much of its range, living in most habitats apart from thick forest. Measuring in length, the willie wagtail is contrastingly coloured with almost entirely black upperparts and white underparts; the male and female have similar plumage.

Three subspecies are recognised; &quot;Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys&quot; from central and southern Australia, the smaller &quot;R. l. picata&quot; from northern Australia, and the larger &quot;R. l. melaleuca&quot; from New Guinea and islands in its vicinity. It is unrelated to the true wagtails of the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot;; it is a member of the fantail genus &quot;Rhipidura&quot; and is a part of a &quot;core corvine&quot; group that includes true crows and ravens, drongos and birds of paradise. Within this group, fantails are placed either in the family Dicruridae, alongside drongos, or in their own small family, Rhipiduridae.

The willie wagtail is insectivorous and spends much time chasing prey in open habitat. Its common name is derived from its habit of wagging its tail horizontally when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the laughing kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It is widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around Australia and New Guinea in a variety of roles, from stealer of secrets and liar to a good omen for successful crops.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The willie wagtail was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as &quot;Turdus leucophrys&quot;. Its specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;leukos&quot; &quot;white&quot; and &quot;ǒphrys&quot; &quot;eyebrow&quot;. Other early scientific names include &quot;Muscicapa tricolor&quot; by Louis Pierre Vieillot, and &quot;Rhipidura motacilloides&quot; by naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, who erected the genus &quot;Rhipidura&quot;. The generic term is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;rhipis&quot; &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;oura&quot; &quot;tail&quot;.

John Gould and other early writers referred to the species as the black-and-white fantail, although did note the current name. However, &quot;willie wagtail&quot; rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916. &quot;Wagtail&quot; is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of &quot;willie&quot; are obscure. The name had been in use colloquially for the pied subspecies of the white wagtail (&quot;Motacilla alba&quot;) on the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland.

Other vernacular names applied include shepherd&#x27;s companion (because it accompanied livestock), frogbird, morning bird, and Australian nightingale. Many Aboriginal names are onomatopoeic, based on the sound of its scolding call. &quot;Djididjidi&quot; is a name from the South West (Noongar) region of Western Australia, and &#x27; is used by the Kunwinjku of western Arnhem Land. In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara word is &#x27;. Among the Kamilaroi, it is &#x27;. In Bougainville Island, it is called &#x27; in the Banoni language from the west coast, and in Awaipa of Kieta district it is &#x27;. In the Solomon Islands Pijin it is sometimes called the &#x27; (police) or &quot;&quot; (priest) bird, because of its black-and-white colouring.

The willie wagtail is unrelated to the Eurasian wagtails of the family Motacillidae. It is one of 47 members of the fantail genus &quot;Rhipidura&quot;; some authorities classify this group of birds as a subfamily Rhipidurinae within the drongo family Dicruridae, together with the monarch flycatchers, while others consider them distinct enough to warrant their own family Rhipiduridae. Early molecular research in the late 1980s and early 1990s revealed that the fantails belong to a large group of mainly Australasian birds known as the parvorder Corvida comprising many tropical and Australian passerines. More recently, the grouping has been refined somewhat and the fantails have been classified in a &quot;core corvine&quot; group with the crows and ravens, shrikes, birds of paradise, monarch flycatchers, drongos and mudnest builders.

===Subspecies===
The following three subspecies are widely recognised:
* &quot;R. leucophrys leucophrys&quot;, the nominate subspecies, is the most widely distributed form found in Australia. The description below refers to it. There is negligible variation within this form, and little between the three; all have very similar plumage.
* &quot;R. leucophrys picata&quot; was described by John Gould in 1848. It is found across northern Australia, from northern Western Australia to Queensland. It has shorter wings, and it has a gradient in wing length between latitudes 18 and 22°S across the Australian continent where this subspecies intergrades with &quot;leucophrys&quot;. The subspecific epithet is Latin &quot;pǐcata&quot; &quot;smeared with pitch&quot;.
* &quot;R. leucophrys melaleuca&quot; was described by French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1830. It occurs in eastern Indonesia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Bismarck Archipelago. It is significantly larger, with longer bristles and larger bill. Its subspecific name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;leukos&quot; &quot;white&quot;.

==Description==

An adult willie wagtail is between in length and weighs 17–24 g (0.6–0.85 oz), with a tail 10–11 cm (approx 4 in) long. The short, slender bill measures 1.64–1.93 cm (around 0.75 in), and is tipped with a small hook. This species has longer legs than other fantails, which may be an adaptation to foraging on the ground. The male and female have similar plumage; the head, throat, upper breast, wings, upperparts, and tail are all black, with a white eyebrow, &quot;whiskers&quot; and underparts. The bill and legs are black and the iris dark brown. Immature birds in their first year after moulting from juvenile plumage may have pale tips in their wings, while juvenile birds themselves have duller plumage, their upperparts brown-tinged with some pale brown scallops on the head and breast.

===Vocalisation===
The wagtail is very &quot;chatty&quot; and has a number of distinct vocalisations. Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid &quot;chit-chit-chit-chit&quot;, although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire. The alarm call is sounded to warn off potential rivals and threats from its territory and also seems to serve as a signal to its mate when a potential threat is in the area. John Gould reported that it sounded like a child&#x27;s rattle or &quot;small cog-wheels of a steam mill&quot;. In his book &quot;What Bird is That?&quot; (1935), Neville Cayley writes that it has &quot;a pleasant call resembling &quot;sweet pretty little creature&quot;, frequently uttered during the day or night, especially on moonlight nights&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

Widespread and abundant, the willie wagtail is found across most of Australia and New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and eastern Indonesia. It is sedentary across most of Australia, though some areas have recorded seasonal movements; it is an autumn and winter visitor to northeastern New South Wales and southeast Queensland, as well as the Gulf Country and parts of Cape York Peninsula in the far north. It is a vagrant to Tasmania, and on occasion reaches Lord Howe Island. There is one record from Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands archipelago east of New Zealand in 2002. The willie wagtail was released in Hawaii around 1922 to control insects on livestock, but the introduction was unsuccessful and the last sighting was at Koko Head in 1937.

The willie wagtail is at home in a wide variety of habitats, but avoids densely forested areas such as rainforest. It prefers semi-open woodland or grassland with scattered trees, often near wetlands or bodies of water. In New Guinea, it inhabits man-made clearings and grasslands, as well as open forest and mangroves. On Guadalcanal, it was reported from open areas and coconut groves. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and can often be seen hunting in open, grassed areas such as lawns, gardens, parkland, and sporting grounds. The species spread into the Western Australian Wheatbelt after the original vegetation had been cleared for agriculture.

==Behaviour==

The willie wagtail is almost always on the move and rarely still for more than a few moments during daylight hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.

The willie wagtail is highly territorial and can be quite fearless in defence of its territory; it will harass not only small birds but also much larger species such as the Australian magpie (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;), raven (&quot;Corvus coronoides&quot;), laughing kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo novaeguineae&quot;), and wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;). It may even attack domestic dogs, cats and humans which approach its nest too closely. It has also been observed harassing snake-neck turtles and tiger snakes in Western Australia. When harassing an opponent, the willie wagtail avoids the head and aims for the rear. Both the male and female may engage in this behaviour, and generally more intensely in the breeding season. Territories range from in area. A pair of birds will declare and defend their territory against other pairs in a &quot;diving display&quot;. One bird remains still while the other loops and dives repeatedly before the roles are reversed; both sing all the while.

The bird&#x27;s white eyebrows become flared and more prominent in an &quot;aggressive display&quot;, and settled and more hidden when in a submissive or &quot;appeasement display&quot;.

===Breeding===
Willie wagtails usually pair for life. The breeding season lasts from July to December, more often occurring after rain in drier regions. Anywhere up to four broods may be raised during this time. It builds a cup-like nest on a tree branch away from leaves or cover, less than above the ground. Rafters and eaves may also be used. It has been observed to build its nest in the vicinity of those of the magpie-lark (&quot;Grallina cyanoleuca&quot;), possibly taking advantage of the latter bird&#x27;s territoriality and aggression toward intruders. Similarly, it is not afraid to build near human habitation.

The nest consists of grass stems, strips of bark, and other fibrous material which is bound and woven together with spider web. Even hair from pet dogs and cats may be used. It has also been observed attempting to take hair from a pet goat. An alpaca breeder in the Mudgee District of New South Wales has observed alpaca fleece in the nests of willy wagtails (the results of scraps of fleece not picked up at shearing time). The female lays two to four small cream-white eggs with brownish markings measuring , and incubates them for 14 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial and nidicolous; they are born naked and helpless with closed eyes, and remain in the nest. Both parents take part in feeding the young, and may continue to do so while embarking on another brood. Nestlings remain in the nest for around 14 days before fledging. Upon leaving, the fledglings will remain hidden in cover nearby for one or two days before venturing further afield, up to away by the third day. Parents will stop feeding their fledglings near the end of the second week, as the young birds increasingly forage for themselves, and soon afterwards drive them out of the territory.

The female pallid cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus pallidus&quot;) will lay eggs in a willie wagtail nest, although the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful brood parasitism is rare. Parasitism by the fan-tailed (&quot;Cacomantis flabelliformis&quot;), brush, (&quot;C. variolosus&quot;), Horsfield&#x27;s bronze (&quot;Chrysococcyx basalis&quot;), and shining bronze cuckoo (&quot;C. lucidus&quot;) has also been reported.

Although the willie wagtail is an aggressive defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. About two thirds of eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. Nestlings may be preyed upon by both pied butcherbirds, (&quot;Cracticus nigrogularis&quot;) black butcherbirds (&quot;C. quoyi&quot;), the spangled drongo (&quot;Dicrurus bracteatus&quot;), and the pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), as well as the feral cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), and rat species. The proximity of nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children. Mostly male willie wagtails sing at night only during breeding season. The song rate increases with lunar illumination.

===Feeding===

The willie wagtail perches on low branches, fences, posts, and the like, watching for insects and other small invertebrates in the air or on the ground. It usually hunts by hawking flying insects such as gnats, flies, and small moths, but will occasionally glean from the ground. It will often hop along the ground and flit behind people and animals, such as cattle, sheep or horses, as they walk over grassed areas, to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing. It wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner; the exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch. The willie wagtail takes ticks from the skin of grazing animals such as cattle or pigs, even from lions asleep in a zoo. It kills its prey by bashing it against a hard surface, or holding it and pulling off the wings before extracting the edible insides.

The adaptability and opportunistic diet of the willie wagtail have probably assisted it in adapting to human habitation; it eats a wide variety of arthropods, including butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, dragonflies, bugs, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes, and has been recorded killing small lizards such as skinks and geckos in a study in Madang on Papua New Guinea&#x27;s north coast. The tailbones of these lizards have been found in their faeces although it is unclear whether the whole animal was eaten or merely the tail. Either way, lizards are only a very occasional prey item forming between 1 and 3% of the total diet. Evidence from the study in Madang suggested that the willie wagtail selectively fed nestlings larger prey.

==Cultural depictions==

The willie wagtail was a feature in Australian Aboriginal folklore. Aboriginal tribes in parts of southeastern Australia, such as the Ngarrindjeri of the Lower Murray River, and the Narrunga People of the Yorke Peninsula, regard the willie wagtail as the bearer of bad news. It was thought that the willie wagtail could steal a person&#x27;s secrets while lingering around camps eavesdropping, so women would be tight-lipped in the presence of the bird. The people of the Kimberley held a similar belief that it would inform the spirit of the recently departed if living relatives spoke badly of them. They also venerated the willie wagtail as the most intelligent of all animals. Its cleverness is also seen in a Tinputz tale of Bougainville Island, where &quot;Singsing Tongereng&quot; (Willie Wagtail) wins a contest among all birds to see who can fly the highest, by riding on the back of the eagle. However, the Kunwinjku in western Arnhem Land took a dimmer view and regarded it as a liar and a . The willie wagtail was held to have stolen fire and tried to extinguish it in the sea in a dreaming story of the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara, and was able to send a strong wind if frightened. In the Noongar language dialects, the willie wagtail is known as the &quot;Djiti-Djiti&quot; (pronounced &quot;Chitti-chitti)&quot; and the &quot;Willaring&quot; in the Perth region.

The Kalam people of New Guinea highlands called it &quot;konmayd&quot;, and deemed it a good bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, then there would be good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the &quot;kuritoro&quot; bird in New Guinea&#x27;s eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man&#x27;s soul had taken the offering.

A tale from the Kieta district of Bougainville Island relates that a &quot;maneka&quot;, the willie wagtail, darting along a river bank echoes a legendary daughter looking for her mother who drowned trying to cross a flooding river in a storm. The bird has been depicted on postage stamps in Palau and the Solomon Islands, and has also appeared as a character in Australian children&#x27;s literature, such as &quot;Dot and the Kangaroo&quot; (1899), &quot;Blinky Bill Grows Up&quot; (1935), and &quot;Willie Wagtail and Other Tales&quot; (1929).

<text>The Tian Shan, also known as the Tengri Tagh or Tengir-Too, meaning the &quot;Mountains of God/Heaven&quot;, is a large system of mountain ranges in Central Asia. The highest peak is Jengish Chokusu at high. Its lowest point is at the Turpan Depression, which is below sea level.

The Tian Shan is sacred in Tengrism. Its second-highest peak is known as Khan Tengri, which can be translated as &quot;Lord of the Spirits&quot;. At the 2013 Conference on World Heritage, the eastern portion of Tian Shan in western China&#x27;s Xinjiang Region was listed as a World Heritage Site. The western portion in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan was then listed in 2016.

== Geography ==
The Tian Shan range is located north and west of the Taklamakan Desert and directly north of the Tarim Basin. It straddles the border regions of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Xinjiang in Northwest China. To the south, it connects with the Pamir Mountains, while to north and east, it meets the Altai Mountains of Mongolia.

The Tian Shan range extends eastwards for approximately 2,900 kilometers from Tashkent, Uzbekistan. It forms part of the Himalayan orogenic belt, resulting from the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates during the Cenozoic era. The range encompasses the Bogda Shan in the east, as defined by both Western and Chinese cartography.

The Tian Shan&#x27;s highest peak is Jengish Chokusu (also known as Victory Peak), shared by Kyrgyzstan and China. At high, it is the highest point in Kyrgyzstan. The Tian Shan&#x27;s second highest peak, Khan Tengri (King Heaven), straddles the Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan-China tripoint and at , is the highest point of Kazakhstan. Mountaineers class these as the two northernmost peaks surpassing in the world.

The Torugart Pass, at , marks the border between Kyrgyzstan and Xinjiang. The lower-altitude, forested Alatau ranges in the northern Tian Shan is home to Turkic-speaking pastoral tribes.

The Tian Shan is separated from the Tibetan Plateau by the Taklimakan Desert and the Tarim Basin to the south. The Syr Darya, Ili River and Tarim River that originate in the Tian Shan. The Aksu Canyon is a prominent feature in the mountain range&#x27;s northwestern section.

Continuous permafrost typically forms in the Tian Shan at elevations above 3,500-3,700 meters. Discontinuous permafrost can be found as low as 2,000 meters in specific locations influenced by unique topographical and climatic conditions, though it generally occurs between 2,700-3,300 meters altitude.

The Tian Shan&#x27;s glaciers are rapidly receding, losing 27% or 5.4 billion tons of ice annually since 1961— nearly four times the global average of 7%. By 2050, half of the remaining ice is projected to disappear.

Russian explorer Peter Semenov was one of the first Europeans to extensively document the Tian Shan in the 1850s.

== Ranges==
The Tian Shan have a number of named ranges which are often mentioned separately (all distances are approximate):
* Barkol Tagh (Barkol Shan),
* Bei Shan, 
* Bogda Shan, 
* Borohoro Shan, 
* Irenchabirga, 
* Qarliq Tagh (Qarlik Shan, Karkik Tagh, Karlik Shan, Harlik Shan), 
* Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range (Kyrgyz Alatau, Kyrgyz Range, Alexander Range), 
* Kakshaal Too (Kokschaal Tau, Qaqşaal Too), 
* Küngöy Ala-Too Range (Kungej-Alatau, Kungey Alatau, Kungoy Ala-Too, Küngei Alataw. Kungey Alataw), 
* Ketmen Ridge
* Kuruk Tagh (Quruq Tagh, Kuruktagh, Kuluketage, Kuruktage Shan),
* Talas Alatau (Talas Alatow, Talas Ala-Too),
* Suusamyr Too 
* Terskey Alatoo (Terskey Alatau, Terskej Alatau, Teskey Alatoo) and 
* Trans-Ili Alatau (Ile Alatau, Ile Alatauy, Zailiisky Alatau, Transili Alatau).

In China the Tian Shan starts from about east of Ürümqi, north of Kumul City (Hami) with the Qarlik Tagh and the Barkol Mountains. Then the Bogda Shan (god mountains) run from east of Ürümqi. Then there is a low area between Ürümqi and the Turfan Depression. The Borohoro Mountains start just south of Ürümqi and run west-northwest separating Dzungaria from the Ili River basin. Their north end abuts on the Dzungarian Alatau which runs east northeast along Sino-Kazakh border. They start east of Taldykorgan in Kazakhstan and end at the Dzungarian Gate. The Dzungarian Alatau in the north, the Borohoro Mountains in the middle and the Ketmen Ridge in the south make a reversed Z or S, the northeast enclosing part of Dzungaria and the southwest enclosing the upper Ili valley.


In Kyrgyzstan the mainline of the Tian Shan continues as Narat Range from the base of the Borohoros west to the point where China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan meet. Here is the highest part of the range – the Central Tian Shan, with Peak Pobeda (Kakshaal Too range) and Khan Tengri. West of this, the Tian Shan split into an &#x27;eye&#x27;, with Issyk Kul Lake in its center. The south side of the lake is the Terskey Alatau and the north side the Kyungey Ala-Too (shady and sunny Ala-Too). North of the Kyungey Ala-Too and parallel to it is the Trans-Ili Alatau in Kazakhstan just south of Almaty. West of the eye, the range continues as the Kyrgyz Ala-Too, separating Chüy Region from Naryn Region and then Kazakhstan from the upper valley of the river Talas, the south side of which is the Talas Ala-Too Range (&#x27;Ala-too&#x27; is a Kyrgyz spelling of Alatau). At the east end of the Talas Alatau the Suusamyr Too range runs southeast enclosing the Suusamyr Valley or plateau.

As for the area south of the Fergana Valley there is an group of mountains that curves west-southwest from south of Issyk Kul Lake separating the Tarim Basin from the Fergana Valley. The Fergana Range runs northeast towards the Talas Ala-Too and separates the upper Naryn basin from Fergana proper. The southern side of these mountains merge into the Pamirs in Tajikistan (Alay Mountains and Trans-Alay Range). West of this is the Turkestan Range, which continues almost to Samarkand.

==Ice Age==
The Tian Shan plateau, stretching 100 to 120 km wide, is located on the northern margin of the Tarim basin between the Kokshaal-Tau mountain chain to the south and the Terskey Alatau mountain chain to the north. The Kokshaal-Tau extends for 570 km from Pik Dankowa in the west to Pik Pobeda in the east-northeast. This mountain chain, along with the parallel Terskey Alatau and the Tian Shan plateau in between, were covered by connected ice-stream-networks and a plateau glacier during glacial times. The only remaining interglacial remnant of this glaciation is the 61 km long South Inylschek glacier. The outlet glacier tongues of the plateau glacier flowed northward down to Lake Issyk Kul, calving in this 160 km long lake.

Similarly, strong glaciation was present in the high mountain area of the Kungey Alatau, which stretches for 230 km north of Issyk Kul and connects to the mountain foreland near Alma Ata. The glacial glaciers from the Kungey Alatau also calved into Lake Issyk Kul, with the Ak-Sai valley glacier developing a mountain foreland glacier. The Chon-Kemin valley was glaciated up to its inflow into the Chu valley.

Altogether, the glacial Tian Shan glaciation occupied an area of approximately 118,000 square kilometers. The glacier snowline was about 1200m lower during the last ice age than it is today. This would result in a depression of the average annual temperature of 7.2 to 8.4 °C for the Last Glacial Maximum compared with today, assuming a comparable precipitation ratio.

==Ecology==
The Tian Shan holds important forests of Schrenk&#x27;s spruce (&quot;Picea schrenkiana&quot;) at altitudes of over ; the lower slopes have unique natural forests of wild walnuts and apples.

The Tian Shan in its immediate geological past was kept from glaciation due to the &quot;protecting&quot; warm influence of the Indian Ocean monsoon climate. This defined its ecological features which could sustain its distinctive ecosphere. The mountains were subjected to constant geological changes with constantly evolving drainage systems which affected the patterns of vegetation, as well as exposing fertile soil for newly emerging seedlings to thrive in.

Tulips originated in the Tian Shan Mountains. The plant then made its way to Turkey via the Silk Road and became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire.

Ancestors of important crop vegetation were established and thrived in the area, among them: apricots (&quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot;), pears (&quot;Pyrus&quot; spp.), pomegranates (&quot;Punica granatum&quot;), figs (&quot;Ficus&quot;), cherries (&quot;Prunus avium&quot;) and mulberries (&quot;Morus&quot;). The Tian Shan region also included important animals like bears, deer, and wild boar, which helped to spread seeds and expand ecological diversity.

Among the vegetation colonizing the Tian Shan came, likely via birds from the east, the ancestors of what we know as the &quot;sweet&quot; apple. The fruit probably then looked like a tiny, long-stalked, bitter apple something like Malus baccata, the Siberian crab. The pips may have been carried in a bird&#x27;s crop or clotted onto feet or feathers.

The strain of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; which caused the bubonic plague now know as the Black Death may have originated in the Tian Shan, spreading along the Silk Road and killing half of Europe&#x27;s population in the mid 1300s.

==Climate==

Tian Shan has an alpine climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ETH&quot;).


==Religion==
===Tengrism===
In Tengrism, Khan Tengri, is the lord of all spirits and the religion&#x27;s supreme deity, and it is the name given to the second highest peak of Tian Shan.

== Name ==
One of the earliest historical references to these mountains may be related to the Xiongnu word &quot;Qilian&quot; (), which, according to Tang commentator Yan Shigu, is the Xiongnu word for &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven&quot;. Sima Qian, in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, mentioned &quot;Qilian&quot; in relation to the homeland of the Yuezhi, and the term is believed to refer to the Tian Shan rather than the range further east now known as the Qilian Mountains. The name of the Tannu-Ola mountains in Tuva has the same meaning. The Chinese name Tian Shan is most likely a direct translation of the traditional Kyrgyz name for the mountains, Teñir Too.

<text>Fantails are small insectivorous songbirds of the genus Rhipidura in the family Rhipiduridae, native to Australasia, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Most of the species are about long, specialist aerial feeders, and named as &quot;fantails&quot;, but the Australian willie wagtail is a little larger, and, though still an expert hunter of insects on the wing, concentrates equally on terrestrial prey.

The true wagtails are part of the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; in the family Motacillidae and are not close relatives of the fantails.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot; Rhipidura &quot; was introduced in 1827 by the naturalists Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield. The type species was subsequently designated as &quot;Muscicapa flabellifera&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1788 by the English zoologist George Gray in 1840. This is a junior synonym of &quot;Muscicapa fuliginosa&quot; Sparrman, 1787, the New Zealand fantail. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;rhipis&quot;, &quot;rhipidos&quot; meaning &quot;fan&quot; with &quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot;.

==Description==

The fantails are small bodied (11.5–21 cm long) birds with long tails; in some species the tail is longer than the body and in most the tail is longer than the wing. When the tail is folded it is rounded at the end, but when spread in display or aerial foraging it has a characteristic fan shape that gives the family its name.

Fantails adopt a hunched horizontal posture most of the time, with the wings drooped and held away from the body and the tail half cocked. There are some exceptions to this, particularly the northern fantail of New Guinea and the Cockerell&#x27;s fantail of the Solomon Islands, which have a more upright posture reminiscent of the monarch flycatchers.

The wings of fantails are tapered and have sacrificed speed for agility, making fantails highly efficient at catching insect prey. Overall the fantails are strong fliers, and some species can undertake long migrations, but the thicket fantails (sooty thicket fantail, white-bellied thicket fantail and black thicket fantail) are very weak fliers, and need to alight regularly.

The bills of fantails are typical for aerial insect eating birds, being flat and triangular. The gape is surrounded by two rows of rictal bristles which are long, often as long as the bill. The bills of most species are fairly weak, limiting fantails to softer insects, although the more terrestrial willie wagtail has a stronger bill.

The plumage of most fantails shows some variation, most species are relatively uniform with some markings. A few species, such as the Rennell fantail, have uniform plumage, while others have striking if sombre patterns. The colours of most species are greys, blacks, whites and browns, although a few species have yellow or even striking blue feathers. In most species there is no sexual dimorphism in plumage; the notable exception being the black fantail of New Guinea where the male has all-over black plumage and the female is almost entirely rufous. In a few species, such as the New Zealand fantail, there exist two colour morphs, the common pied morph and the rarer black morph (which is most common in the South Island).

==Distribution and habitat==

Fantails are an Australasian family that has spread from as far as Samoa to northern India. In the south the New Zealand fantail ranges as far as The Snares off New Zealand, in the eastern extent of the family has several endemic forms in western Polynesia. There are numerous species in Indonesia, the Philippines and in South East Asia, and the family ranges into southern China, India and the Himalayas. Some species have a widespread distribution, particularly the willie wagtail, grey fantail, white-throated fantail and northern fantail; others have a highly restricted range and in the case of some insular species may be restricted to a single island. The Mussau fantail is restricted to a single island in the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Kadavu fantail has a similarly restricted distribution in the Kadavu Group of Fiji.

Most fantails, particularly the tropical or insular forms, are sedentary and undertake no migration. Some northern and southern species undertake a variety of movements; the yellow-bellied fantail of the Himalayas is an altitudinal migrant, breeding between 1500 and 4000 metres, but moving to lower altitudes (as low as 180 m) in the winter. Some Australian fantails undertake seasonal migrations, although these show considerable variation even within individual species. Most populations of the rufous fantail exhibit little migratory behaviour, but the south-eastern population moves &quot;en masse&quot; to northern Queensland and New Guinea. 

Fantails exhibit wide tastes in habitat; while the majority of species are found in rainforests fantails exist in most available habitats from deserts and mangrove forests to highly modified agricultural and urban environments. Most species are able to survive in a variety of habitats. Of all the species the mangrove fantail has the most restricted habitat requirements, being entirely restricted to mangrove forests over some of its range, although it can exist 3 km away in the absence of other fantails. Some of the more primitive species are generally more restricted to primary rainforest, but most other species can survive in more disturbed forest. The most adaptable species is the willie wagtail, which is abundant in every habitat type in Australia except for dense rainforest.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The behaviour of many species of fantail has not been studied, but overall the family is highly uniform in its habits. Anecdotal observations of less studied species suggest a high degree of similarity with the better studied species. Fantails are highly active birds, with several of the smaller species continuously on the move; even when perched they continue to rock back and forth, spin 180° on the spot, wag their tail from side to side or fan it. In flight they are highly agile and undertake highly aerobatic and intricate looping flights while using their fanned tail to catch insects in flight.

===Diet and foraging===

The majority of the diet of fantails composes of small insects and invertebrates. The larger willie wagtail is capable of tackling small skinks, but this is exceptional. Insect prey is generally small and easily handled, but larger items sometimes need to be subdued by being banged on branches, an action that also removes the wings of larger prey items like moths.

There are two general techniques used by the family in order to obtain prey. The first is known as &quot;static searching&quot;, where the fantail will remain at a perch and watch for aerial prey which it will then sally towards and snatch from the air before returning to the perch in order to consume and resume searching. The second method used is known as &quot;progressive searching&quot;, where the fantail moves through vegetation searching for insect prey which it gleans; the movement of the searching fantail also flushes out hidden prey which is also pursued and consumed. The willie wagtail performs a terrestrial version of this technique, pumping its tail from side to side and undertaking quick darting movements across open ground in order to flush out prey.

Fantails frequently form associations with other species in order obtain prey. Some species perch on the backs of cattle, which they use both as a vantage point and because the cattle flush up insects. This behaviour has given the willie wagtail the nickname &quot;shepherd&#x27;s companion&quot;. Fantails are often very bold around people and will approach them closely in order to capture insects flushed by them. Different species are also frequently found in mixed-species feeding flocks, travelling with other small insectivorous birds on the periphery of the flocks taking advantage of flushed prey.

===Breeding===

Fantails are territorial and aggressively defend their territories from conspecifics (other members of the same species) as well as other fantail species and other flycatchers. Within the territory the female selects the nesting site, these sites are often close to the previous year&#x27;s nest. Breeding responsibilities, nest building, incubation and chick feeding, are shared between both sexes.

The nest, a small cup of grass stems neatly bound together in spider silk, takes around 10 days to construct. Many species incorporate a trailing tail into the base of the nest; this possibly breaks up the shape of the nest, although little other effort is made to conceal the nest. To compensate for the high visibility of the nest fantails will aggressively defend their chicks from potential predators.

Female fantails will also distract a potential predator by appearing to be injured and luring the predator away from the nest. While the female is pretending to be injured the male may continue to attack the predator. In spite of this fantails have a generally low nesting success.

<doc id="214616" wikidata="Q1154417" url="?curid=214616" title="Gondolin">
<text>In J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, Gondolin is a secret city of Elves in the First Age of Middle-earth, and the greatest of their cities in Beleriand. The story of the Fall of Gondolin tells of the arrival there of Tuor, a prince of Men; of the betrayal of the city to the dark Lord Morgoth by the king&#x27;s nephew, Maeglin; and of its subsequent siege and catastrophic destruction by Morgoth&#x27;s armies. It also relates the flight of the fugitives to the Havens of Sirion, the wedding of Tuor and the Elf Idril, and the childhood of their son Eärendil.

Scholars have noted the presence of tank-like iron fighting machines in Morgoth&#x27;s army in early versions of the story, written soon after Tolkien returned from the Battle of the Somme. They have likened the story of the Fall of Gondolin to the sack of Troy in ancient Greek literature, or to Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;; the role of Tuor&#x27;s wife Idril has similarly been compared to that of Cassandra or Helen of Troy in accounts of the Trojan War.

== City ==

=== Founding ===

The city of Gondolin in Beleriand, in the extreme northwest of Middle-earth, is founded with divine inspiration. The mightiest of the Elvish cities, it is hidden by mountains and endures for centuries before being betrayed and destroyed.
Gondolin is founded by King Turgon in the First Age. According to &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters, shows Turgon the Vale of Tumladen in a dream. Thus guided, Turgon travels from his kingdom in Nevrast and finds it. Within the Encircling Mountains is a round level plain surrounded by sheer walls; a ravine and tunnel, the Hidden Way, lead out to the southwest. In the middle of the vale is the steep Amon Gwareth, the &quot;Hill of Watch&quot;. There Turgon decides to found a city, designed like the Noldor Elves&#x27; former city of Tirion in Valinor. Gondolin is built in secret. The Hidden Way is protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of wood, then stone, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and steel. After it is completed, he brings all his people from Nevrast to dwell in the hidden city—almost a third of the Noldor of Fingolfin&#x27;s House—and nearly three quarters of the northern Sindar.

=== Customs ===

Gondolin develops its own Sindarin dialect, containing regional elements and words adapted from another Elvish language, Quenya.

The Elven smiths of Gondolin make powerful weapons. In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the Gondolin-made swords Orcrist, Glamdring and the dagger later named Sting are found in a Troll-hoard. Each of these weapons has the ability to reveal nearby Orcs by glowing; they terrify Orcs in battle.

According to &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, the city has seven names: &quot;’Tis said and ’tis sung: Gondobar am I called and Gondothlimbar, City of Stone and City of the Dwellers in Stone; Gondolin the Stone of Song and Gwarestrin am I named, the Tower of the Guard, Gar Thurion or the Secret Place, for I am hidden from the eyes of Melko; but they who love me most greatly call me Loth, for like a flower am I, even Lothengriol the flower that blooms on the plain.&quot;

=== Houses and heraldry ===

&quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; states that the active male Elves of Gondolin belong to one of the 11 &quot;Houses&quot; or &quot;Thlim&quot;, plus the bodyguard of Tuor, accounted as the twelfth. Each house has a distinct symbol: a mole, a swallow, the heavens, a pillar, a tower of snow, a tree, a golden flower, a fountain, a harp, a hammer and anvil, and finally the triple symbol of the King, namely the moon, sun, and scarlet heart worn by the Royal Guard.

=== Fall ===


The city stands for nearly 400 years until Maeglin, Turgon&#x27;s nephew, betrays it to Morgoth. Maeglin is captured while mining outside the Encircling Mountains, against Turgon&#x27;s orders. Maeglin is promised Lordship as well as Turgon&#x27;s daughter Idril, whom he had long coveted. The dark lord Morgoth sends an army over the Encircling Mountains during Gondolin&#x27;s festival of The Gates of Summer, and sacks the city with relative ease. Morgoth&#x27;s army consists of orcs, Balrogs, dragons and in early versions of the story iron machines powered by &quot;internal fires&quot;. These are used to carry soldiers, to surmount difficult obstacles, and to defeat fortifications. Idril, noted for her intuition, had prepared a secret route out of Gondolin prior to the siege. While her father Turgon perishes as his tower is destroyed, Idril flees the city, defended by her husband Tuor, a prince of Men.

== Analysis ==

=== Classical ===

Tolkien scholars have compared the fall of Gondolin to the sack of Troy, noting that both cities were famed for their walls, and likening Tolkien&#x27;s tale to Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Both have frame stories, situated long after the events they narrate; both have &quot;gods&quot; (Tolkien&#x27;s Valar) in the action; and both involve an escape. David Greenman compares the actions of Tolkien&#x27;s quest-heroes to those of Aeneas and Odysseus.

Greenman compares and contrasts Idril&#x27;s part in the story to Cassandra and Helen of Troy, two prominent female figures in accounts of the Trojan War: like the prophetess, Idril had a premonition of impending danger and like Helen, her beauty played a major role in instigating Maeglin&#x27;s betrayal of Gondolin, which ultimately led to its downfall and ruin. Conversely, Greenman notes that Idril&#x27;s advice to enact a contingency plan for a secret escape route out of Gondolin was heeded by her people, unlike the warning of Cassandra; and that Idril had always rejected Maeglin&#x27;s advances and remained faithful to Tuor, unlike Helen who left her husband King Menelaus of Sparta for Prince Paris of Troy.

Alexander Bruce writes that Tolkien&#x27;s tale parallels Virgil&#x27;s account, but varies the story. Thus, Morgoth attacks while Gondolin&#x27;s guard is lowered during a great feast, whereas the Trojans were celebrating the Greeks&#x27; apparent retreat, with the additional note of treachery. The Trojan Horse carried the Greeks into Troy, where they set fire to it, paralleled by the fire-serpents which carried &quot;Balrogs in hundreds&quot; into Gondolin. Tolkien&#x27;s serpents are matched by the great serpents with &quot;burning eyes, fiery and suffused with blood, their tongues a-flicker out of hissing maws&quot; which kill the high priest Laocoön and his sons. Aeneas and his wife Creusa become separated during their escape; her ghost pleads with him to leave when he searches for her, and he travels to Italy; in contrast, Tuor and Idril escape to Sirion together, eventually sailing from there to Valinor. Marco Cristini adds that both cities are fatally attacked during a feast; their heroes both leave their wives to fight, and both see their kings die. Cristini comments further that &quot;The most evident analogy is perhaps the behaviour of Creusa and Idril, who clasp the knees of their husbands to prevent them from joining again the battle when all hope is lost.&quot; Scholars have noted that Tolkien himself drew classical parallels for the assault, writing that &quot;Nor Bablon, nor Ninwi, nor the towers of Trui, nor all the many takings of Rûm that is greatest among Men, saw such terror as fell that day upon Amon Gwareth&quot;.

Tolkien appears to have based one scene on another classical source, Euripides&#x27; play &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;. Maeglin tries to throw Idril&#x27;s son Eärendil from the city wall, just as Hector&#x27;s son Astyanax is thrown down from Troy&#x27;s walls. Tolkien changes the outcome: Eärendil resists, and Tuor appears just in time to rescue him by throwing Maeglin from the walls instead.

=== British heraldry ===

The scholar of heraldry Cătălin Hriban writes that the emblems of the houses of Gondolin are simple and figurative, depicting familiar real-world objects. He notes that standard British texts on heraldry describe similar devices. He comments that Maeglin the traitor, of the House of Moles, fittingly has the colour black; like the animal, his people are miners, used to living underground in the dark.

=== Tolkien&#x27;s wartime experience ===

In his book &quot;Tolkien and the Great War&quot;, John Garth states that Tolkien wrote his 1917 story &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot; in hospital after returning to England from the Battle of the Somme. In his view, the tale&#x27;s first half seems to reflect Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;slow acceptance of duty&quot; at the start of the war, while the second half &quot;surely reverberates to his collision with war itself.&quot;

To defeat Gondolin, Melkor (at first called Melko) uses monsters, Orcs and Balrogs, supported by &quot;beasts like snakes and dragons of irresistible might that should overcreep the Encircling Hills and lap that plain and its fair city in flame and death&quot;. The monstrous beasts are not of flesh and blood, but are made by &quot;smiths and sorcerers&quot;. There are three kinds, Garth explains: heavy, slow, bronze dragons that can break gaps in Gondolin&#x27;s walls; fiery monsters, unable to climb the steep smooth hill on which the city sits; and iron dragons in which Orc-soldiers can ride, and which travel on &quot;iron so cunningly linked that they might flow ... around and above all obstacles&quot;, and are armoured so that they clang hollowly when bombarded or attacked with fire. Garth comments that these are not so much like mythical dragons as &quot;the tanks of the Somme&quot;, and that to the story&#x27;s Elf-narrator, a combustion engine would look like &quot;a metal heart filled with flame&quot;. Anthony Appleyard similarly likens the mechanical dragons to vehicles driven by internal combustion engines.

<doc id="214618" wikidata="Q183001" url="?curid=214618" title="Somatic (biology)">
<text>In cellular biology, the term somatic is derived from the French somatique which comes from Ancient Greek σωματικός (sōmatikós, “bodily”), and σῶμα (sôma, “body”.) is often used to refer to the cells of the body, in contrast to the reproductive (germline) cells, which usually give rise to the egg or sperm (or other gametes in other organisms). These somatic cells are diploid, containing two copies of each chromosome, whereas germ cells are haploid, as they only contain one copy of each chromosome (in preparation for fertilisation). Although under normal circumstances all somatic cells in an organism contain identical DNA, they develop a variety of tissue-specific characteristics. This process is called differentiation, through epigenetic and regulatory alterations. The grouping of similar cells and tissues creates the foundation for organs.

Somatic mutations are changes to the genetics of a multicellular organism that are not passed on to its offspring through the germline. Most cancers are due to somatic mutations.

&quot;Somatic&quot; is also defined as relating to the wall of the body cavity, particularly as distinguished from the head, limbs, or viscera. It is also used in the term somatic nervous system, which is the portion of the vertebrate nervous system that regulates voluntary movements of the body.

==Mutation frequency==

The frequency of mutations in mouse somatic tissue (brain, liver, Sertoli cells) was compared to the mutation frequency in male germline cells at sequential stages of spermatogenesis. The spontaneous mutation frequency was found to be significantly higher (5 to 10-fold) in the somatic cell types than in the male germline cells. In female mice, somatic cells were also found to have a higher mutation frequency than germline cells. It was suggested that elevated levels of DNA repair enzymes play a prominent role in the lower mutation frequency of male and female germline cells, and that enhanced genetic integrity is a fundamental characteristic of germline cells. DNA repair processes can remove DNA damages that would, otherwise, upon DNA replication, cause mutation.

<doc id="214632" wikidata="Q48214" url="?curid=214632" title="Near East">
<text>The Near East () is a transcontinental region around the Eastern Mediterranean broadly synonymous with the modern Middle East, encompassing the historical Fertile Crescent, the Levant, Anatolia, Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Iranian Plateau, and coastal areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The term was invented by modern Western geographers and was originally applied to the Ottoman Empire, but today has varying definitions within different academic circles. The term &quot;Near East&quot; was used in conjunction with the &quot;Middle East&quot; and the &quot;Far East&quot; (China and beyond), together known as the &quot;three Easts&quot;; it was a separate term from the &quot;Middle East&quot; during earlier times and official British usage. As of 2024, both terms are used interchangeably to refer to the same region. &quot;Near East&quot; and &quot;Middle East&quot; are both Eurocentric terms.

According to National Geographic, the terms &quot;Near East&quot; and &quot;Middle East&quot; denote the same territories and are &quot;generally accepted as comprising the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestinian territories, Syria, and Turkey&quot;. Also, Afghanistan is often included.

In 1997, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations defined the region similarly, but also included Afghanistan. The part of the region that is in Asia (ie., not including Egypt, the Balkans, and Thrace) is &quot;now commonly referred to as West Asia.&quot; Later on in 2012, the FAO defined the Near East as a subregion of the Middle East. The Near East included Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syrian Arab Republic, and Turkey while the Middle East included the Arabian Peninsula, the Caucasus, and Iran.

==Eastern question==

At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire included all of the Balkans, north to the southern edge of the Great Hungarian Plain. But by 1914, the empire had lost all of its territories except Constantinople and Eastern Thrace to the rise of nationalist Balkan states, which saw the independence of the Kingdom of Greece, Kingdom of Serbia, the Danubian Principalities, and the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Up until 1912, the Ottomans retained a band of territory including Albania, Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet, which were lost in the two Balkan Wars of 1912–13.

The Ottoman Empire, believed to be about to collapse, was portrayed in the press as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;. The Balkan states, with the partial exception of Bosnia and Albania, were primarily Christian, as was the majority of Lebanon. Starting in 1894, the Ottomans struck at the Armenians and Assyrians on the explicit grounds that they were non-Muslim peoples and as such were a potential threat to the Muslim empire within which they lived. The Hamidian Massacres, Adana Massacres and Massacres of Badr Khan targeting Assyrians and Armenians aroused the indignation of the entire Christian world. In the United States, the then aging Julia Ward Howe, author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, leapt into the war of words and joined the Red Cross. Relations of minorities within the Ottoman Empire and the disposition of former Ottoman lands became known as the &quot;Eastern question&quot;, as the Ottomans were on the east of Europe.

It now became relevant to define the east of the eastern question. In about the middle of the nineteenth century, &quot;Near East&quot; came into use to describe that part of the east closest to Europe. The term &quot;Far East&quot; appeared contemporaneously meaning Japan, China, Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam. &quot;Near East&quot; applied to what had been mainly known as the Levant, which was in the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Porte, or government. Europeans could not set foot on most of the shores of the southern and central Mediterranean from the Gulf of Sidra to Albania without permits from the Ottoman Empire.

Some regions beyond the Ottoman Porte were included. One was North Africa west of Egypt. It was occupied by piratical kingdoms of the Barbary Coast, &quot;de facto&quot;-independent since the eighteenth century, formerly part of the empire at its apogee. Iran was included because it could not easily be reached except through the Ottoman Empire or neighboring Russia. In the 1890s the term tended to focus on the conflicts in the Balkan states and Armenia. The demise of &quot;the sick man of Europe&quot; left considerable confusion as to what was to be meant by &quot;Near East&quot;. It is now generally used only in historical contexts, to describe the countries of West Asia from the Mediterranean to (or including) Iran. There is, in short, no universally-understood fixed inventory of nations, languages or historical assets defined to be in it.

==Background==

The geographical terms &quot;Near East&quot; and &quot;Far East&quot; refer to areas of the globe in or contiguous to the former British Empire and the neighboring colonies of the Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and Germans. They fit together as a pair based on the opposites of far and near, suggesting that they were innovated together. They appear together in the journals of the mid-19th century. Both terms were used before then with local British and American meanings: the near or far east of a field, village or shire.

===Ideas of the East up to the Crimean War===
There was a linguistic predisposition to use such terms. The Romans had used them in near Gaul / far Gaul, near Spain / far Spain and others. Before them the Greeks had the habit, which appears in Linear B, the oldest known script of Europe, referring to the near province and the far province of the kingdom of Pylos. Usually these terms were given with reference to a geographic feature, such as a mountain range or a river.

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; divided Asia on a similar basis. In the north is &quot;Scythia this side of the Himalayas&quot; and &quot;Scythia beyond the Himalayas&quot;. To the south is &quot;India on this side of the Ganges&quot; and &quot;India beyond the Ganges&quot;. Asia began on the coast of Anatolia (&quot;land of the rising Sun&quot;). Beyond the Ganges and Himalayas (including the Tien Shan) were Serica and Serae (sections of China) and some other identifiable far eastern locations known to the voyagers and geographers but not to the general European public.

By the time of John Seller&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Maritima&quot; of 1670, &quot;India Beyond the Ganges&quot; had become &quot;the East Indies&quot; including China, Korea, southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific in a map that was every bit as distorted as Ptolemy&#x27;s, despite the lapse of approximately 1,500 years. That &quot;east&quot; in turn was only an English translation of Latin &quot;Oriens&quot; and &quot;Orientalis&quot;, &quot;the land of the rising Sun&quot;, used since Roman times for &quot;east&quot;. The world map of Jodocus Hondius of 1590 labels all of Asia from the Caspian to the Pacific as &quot;India Orientalis&quot;, shortly to appear in translation as the East Indies.

Elizabeth I of England, primarily interested in trade with the east, collaborated with English merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions, using their own jargon. Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty. The queen chartered the Company of Merchants of the Levant, shortened to Levant Company, and soon known also as The Turkey Company, in 1581. In 1582, the ship &quot;The Great Susan&quot; transported the first ambassador, William Harebone, to the Ottoman Porte (government of the Ottoman Empire) at Constantinople. Compared to Anatolia, Levant also means &quot;land of the rising sun&quot;, but where Anatolia always only meant the projection of land currently occupied by the Republic of Turkey, Levant meant anywhere in the domain ruled by the Ottoman Porte. The East India Company (Originally charted as the &quot;Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies&quot;) was chartered in 1600 for trade to the East Indies.

It has pleased western historians to write of a decline of the Ottoman Empire as though a stable and uncontested polity of that name once existed. The borders did expand and contract but they were always dynamic and always in &quot;question&quot; right from the beginning. The Ottoman Empire was created from the lands of the former eastern Roman Empire on the occasion of the latter&#x27;s violent demise. The last Roman emperor died fighting hand-to-hand in the streets of his capital, Constantinople, overwhelmed by the Ottoman military, in May 1453. The victors inherited his remaining territory in the Balkans.

The Hungarian lands under Turkish rule had become part of the Habsburg monarchy by 1688. in the Great Turkish War. The Serbian Revolution, 1804–1833. created modern Serbia. The Greek War of Independence, 1821–1832, created modern Greece, which recovered most of the lands of ancient Greece, but could not gain Constantinople. The Ottoman Porte was continuously under attack from some quarter in its empire, primarily the Balkans. Also, on a number of occasions in the early 19th century, American and British warships had to attack the Barbary pirates to stop their piracy and recover thousands of enslaved Europeans and Americans.

In 1853 the Russian Empire on behalf of the Slavic Balkan states began to question the very existence of the Ottoman Empire. The result was the Crimean War, 1853–1856, in which the British Empire and the French Empire supported the Ottoman Empire in its struggle against the incursions of the Russian Empire. Eventually, the Ottoman Empire lost control of the Balkan region.

===Original diplomatic concept of &quot;Near East&quot;===

Until about 1855, the terms &quot;Near East&quot; and Far East did not refer to any particular region. The Far East, a phrase containing a noun, East, qualified by an adjective, far, could be at any location in the &quot;far east&quot; of the speaker&#x27;s home territory. The Ottoman Empire, for example, was the far East as much as the East Indies. The Crimean War brought a change in vocabulary with the introduction of terms more familiar to the late 19th century. The Russian Empire had entered a more aggressive phase, becoming militarily active against the Ottoman Empire and also against China, with territorial aggrandizement explicitly in mind. Rethinking its policy the British government decided that the two polities under attack were necessary for the balance of power. It therefore undertook to oppose the Russians in both places, one result being the Crimean War. During that war the administration of the British Empire began promulgating a new vocabulary, giving specific regional meaning to the &quot;Near East&quot;, the Ottoman Empire, and the &quot;Far East&quot;, the East Indies. The two terms were now compound nouns often shown hyphenated.

In 1855, a reprint of a letter earlier sent to &quot;The Times&quot; appeared in &quot;Littell&#x27;s Living Age&quot;. Its author, an &quot;official Chinese interpreter of 10 years&#x27; active service&quot; and a member of the Oriental Club, Thomas Taylor Meadows, was replying to the suggestion by another interpreter that the British Empire was wasting its resources on a false threat from Russia against China. Toward the end of the letter he said:

Much of the colonial administration belonged to this club, which had been formed by the Duke of Wellington. Meadows&#x27; terminology must represent usage by that administration. If not the first use of the terms, the letter to the &quot;Times&quot; was certainly one of the earliest presentations of this vocabulary to the general public. They became immediately popular, supplanting &quot;Levant&quot; and &quot;East Indies&quot;, which gradually receded to minor usages and then began to change meaning.

===Original archaeological concept of &quot;Nearer East&quot;===

&quot;Near East&quot; remained popular in diplomatic, trade and journalistic circles, but a variation soon developed among the scholars and the men of the cloth and their associates: &quot;the Nearer East&quot;, reverting to the classical and then more scholarly distinction of &quot;nearer&quot; and &quot;farther&quot;. They undoubtedly saw a need to separate the biblical lands from the terrain of the Ottoman Empire. The Christians saw the country as the land of the Old and New Testaments, where Christianity had developed. The scholars in the field of studies that eventually became biblical archaeology attempted to define it on the basis of archaeology.

For example, &quot;The London Review&quot; of 1861 (Telford and Barber, unsigned) in reviewing several works by Rawlinson, Layard and others, defined themselves as making: &quot;... an imperfect conspectus of the arrow-headed writings of the nearer east; writings which cover nearly the whole period of the postdiluvian Old Testament history ...&quot; By arrow-headed writings they meant cuneiform texts. In defense of the Bible as history they said: &quot;The primeval nations, that piled their glorious homes on the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Nile, are among us again with their archives in their hands; ...&quot; They further defined the nations as &quot;... the countries lying between the Caspian, the Persian Gulf, and the Mediterranean ...&quot; The regions in their inventory were Assyria, Chaldea, Mesopotamia, Persia, Armenia, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Ancient Israel, Ethiopia, Caucasus, Libya, Anatolia and Abyssinia. Explicitly excluded is India. No mention is made of the Balkans.

The British archaeologist D. G. Hogarth published &quot;The Nearer East&quot; in 1902, in which he stated his view of the &quot;Near East&quot;:

Hogarth then proceeds to say where and why in some detail, but no more mention is made of the classics. His analysis is geopolitical. His map delineates the Nearer East with regular lines as though surveyed. They include Iran, the Balkans, but not the Danube lands, Egypt, but not the rest of North Africa. Except for the Balkans, the region matches the later Middle East. It differs from the Ottoman Empire of the times in including Greece and Iran. Hogarth gives no evidence of being familiar with the contemporaneous initial concept of the Middle East.

===Balkan confusion===
In the last years of the 19th century, the term &quot;Near East&quot; acquired considerable disrepute in eyes of the English-speaking public as did the Ottoman Empire itself. The cause of the onus was the religiously motivated Hamidian Massacres of Christian Armenians, but it seemed to spill over into the protracted conflicts of the Balkans. For a time, &quot;Near East&quot; often included the Balkans. Robert Hichens&#x27; 1913 book &quot;The Near East&quot; is subtitled &quot;Dalmatia, Greece and Constantinople&quot;.

====Sir Henry Norman and his first wife====
The change is evident in the reports of influential British travelers to the Balkans. In 1894, Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet, a journalist, traveled to the Far East, afterwards writing a book called &quot;The Peoples and Politics of the Far East&quot;, which came out in 1895. By &quot;Far East&quot; he meant Siberia, China, Japan, Korea, Siam and Malaya. As the book was a big success, he was off to the Balkan states with his wife in 1896 to develop detail for a sequel, &quot;The People and Politics of the Near East&quot;, which Scribners planned to publish in 1897. Mrs. Norman, a writer herself, wrote glowing letters of the home and person of Mme. Zakki, &quot;the wife of a Turkish cabinet minister,&quot; who, she said, was a cultivated woman living in a country home full of books. As for the natives of the Balkans, they were &quot;a semi-civilized people&quot;.

The planned book was never published, however Norman published the gist of the book, mixed with vituperation against the Ottoman Empire, in an article in June 1896, in Scribner&#x27;s Magazine. The empire had descended from an enlightened civilization ruling over barbarians for their own good to something considerably less. The difference was the Hamidian Massacres, which were being conducted even as the couple traveled the Balkans. According to Norman now, the empire had been established by &quot;the Moslem horde&quot; from Asia, which was stopped by &quot;intrepid Hungary.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;Greece shook off the turbaned destroyer of her people&quot; and so on. The Russians were suddenly liberators of oppressed Balkan states. Having portrayed the Armenians as revolutionaries in the name of freedom with the expectation of being rescued by the intervention of Christian Europe, he states &quot;but her hope was vain.&quot; England had &quot;turned her back.&quot; Norman concluded his exhortation with &quot;In the Balkans, one learns to hate the Turk.&quot; Norman made sure that Gladstone read the article. Prince Nicolas of Montenegro wrote a letter thanking him for his article.

Throughout this article, Norman uses &quot;Near East&quot; to mean the countries where &quot;the eastern question&quot; applied; that is, to all of the Balkans. The countries and regions mentioned are Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina (which was Muslim and needed, in his view, to be suppressed), Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Romania. The rest of the Ottoman domain is demoted to just &quot;the East&quot;.

====William Miller====
If Norman was apparently attempting to change British policy, it was perhaps William Miller (1864–1945), journalist and expert on the Near East, who did the most in that direction. In essence, he signed the death warrant, so to speak, of the Age of Empires. The fall of the Ottoman Empire ultimately enmeshed all the others as well. In the &quot;Travel and Politics in the Near East&quot;, 1898, Miller claimed to have made four trips to the Balkans, 1894, 1896, 1897 and 1898, and to be, in essence, an expert on &quot;the Near East&quot;, by which he primarily meant the Balkans. Apart from the fact that he attended Oxford and played Rugby, not many biographical details have been promulgated. He was, in effect (whatever his formal associations if any), a point man of British Near Eastern intelligence.

In Miller&#x27;s view, the Ottoman officials were unfit to rule:
These were fighting words to be coming from a country that once insisted Europe needed Turkey and was willing to spill blood over it. For his authority Miller invokes the people, citing the &quot;collective wisdom&quot; of Europe, and introducing a concept to arise many times in the decades to follow under chilling circumstances: &quot;... no final solution of the difficulty has yet been found.&quot;

Miller&#x27;s final pronouncements on the topic could not be ignored by either the British or the Ottoman governments:
If the British Empire was now going to side with the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire had no choice but to cultivate a relationship with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was supported by the German Empire. In a few years these alignments became the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance (already formed in 1882), which were in part a cause of World War I. By its end in 1918 three empires were gone, a fourth was about to fall to revolution, and two more, the British and French, were forced to yield in revolutions started under the aegis of their own ideologies.

====Arnold Toynbee====

By 1916, when millions of Europeans were becoming casualties of imperial war in the trenches of eastern and western Europe over &quot;the eastern question&quot;, Arnold J. Toynbee, Hegelesque historian of civilization at large, was becoming metaphysical about the Near East. Geography alone was not a sufficient explanation of the terms, he believed. If the Ottoman Empire had been a sick man, then:There has been something pathological about the history of this Near Eastern World. It has had an undue share of political misfortunes, and had lain for centuries in a kind of spiritual paralysis between East and West—belonging to neither, partaking paradoxically of both, and wholly unable to rally itself decidedly to one or the other.
Having supposed that it was sick, he kills it off: &quot;The Near East has never been more true to itself than in its lurid dissolution; past and present are fused together in the flare.&quot; To Toynbee the Near East was a spiritual being of a &quot;Janus-character&quot;, connected to both east and west:The limits of the Near East are not easy to define. On the north-west, Vienna is the most conspicuous boundary-mark, but one might almost equally well single out Trieste or Lvov or even Prag. Towards the southeast, the boundaries are even more shadowy. It is perhaps best to equate them with the frontiers of the Arabic language, yet the genius of the Near East overrides linguistic barriers, and encroaches on the Arabicspeaking world on the one side as well as on the German-speaking world on the other. Syria is essentially a Near Eastern country, and a physical geographer would undoubtedly carry the Near Eastern frontiers up to the desert belt of the Sahara, Nefud and Kevir.
From the death of the Near East, new nations were able to rise from the ashes, notably the Republic of Turkey. Paradoxically it now aligned itself with the west rather than with the east. Mustafa Kemal, its founder, a former Ottoman high-ranking officer, was insistent on this social revolution, which, among other changes, liberated women from the strait rules still in effect in most Arabic-speaking countries. The demise of the political Near East now left a gap where it had been, into which stepped the Middle East.

===Rise of the &quot;Middle East&quot;===

====Origin of the concept of Middle East====
The term &quot;Middle East&quot; as a noun and adjective was common in the 19th century in nearly every context except diplomacy and archaeology. An uncountable number of places appear to have had their middle easts from gardens to regions, including the United States. The innovation of the term &quot;Near East&quot; to mean the holdings of the Ottoman Empire as early as the Crimean War had left a geographical gap. The East Indies, or &quot;Far East&quot;, derived ultimately from Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;India Beyond the Ganges.&quot; The Ottoman Empire ended at the eastern border of Iraq. &quot;India This Side of the Ganges&quot; and Iran had been omitted. The archaeologists counted Iran as the &quot;Near East&quot; because Old Persian cuneiform had been found there. This usage did not sit well with the diplomats; India was left in an equivocal state. They needed a regional term.

The use of the term &quot;Middle East&quot; as a region of international affairs apparently began in British and American diplomatic circles quite independently of each other over concern for the security of the same country: Iran, then known to the west as Persia. In 1900 Thomas Edward Gordon published an article, &quot;The Problem of the Middle East&quot;, which began:

The threat that caused Gordon, diplomat and military officer, to publish the article was resumption of work on a railway from Russia to the Persian Gulf. Gordon, a published author, had not used the term previously, but he was to use it from then on.

A second strategic personality from American diplomatic and military circles, Alfred Thayer Mahan, concerned about the naval vulnerability of the trade routes in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, commented in 1902:

Apparently the sailor did not connect with the soldier, as Mahan believed he was innovating the term &quot;Middle East&quot;. It was, however, already there to be seen.

====Single region concept====

Until the interwar period following the First World War, the terms &quot;Near East&quot; and &quot;Middle East&quot; co-existed, but they were not always seen as distinct in the eyes of Western commentators. Bertram Lenox Simpson, a journalist who served for a period as an officer for the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, combined both terms in his 1910 work &quot;The Conflict of Colour: The Threatened Upheaval Throughout the World&quot; as &quot;the Near and Middle East.&quot; According to Simpson, the combined region consisted of &quot;India, Afghanistan, Persia, Arabistan, Asia Minor, and last, but not least, Egypt&quot;, explaining that the aforementioned regions were in actuality &quot;politically one region – in spite of the divisions into which it is academically divided.&quot; 

In &quot;The Conflict of Colour&quot;, Simpson argued that what united these regions was their skin color and the fact that they were all under European colonial rule. The work included a &quot;color chart&quot; of the world, dividing it into a spectrum of &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;yellow&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27; races. Simpson also modified the Eastern Question (a diplomatic issue concerning the waning of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century) to the &quot;Problem of the Nearer East&quot;, which he rephrased around the issue of the future of European colonialism in the Near East, writing that in regards to &quot;the white man&quot;:

According to Simpson, the reason why the &quot;Problem of the Nearer East&quot; remained so misunderstood in the Western world (compared to diplomatic and political issues in the Near East) was due to the fact that &quot;there is no good work dealing with these problems as one whole, and much misunderstanding consequently exists.&quot;

====One presumed region, one name====
The term &quot;Near and Middle East&quot;, held the stage for a few years before World War I. It proved to be less acceptable to a colonial point of view that saw the entire region as one. In 1916 Captain T. C. Fowle, 40th Pathans (troops of British India), wrote of a trip he had taken from Karachi to Syria just before the war. The book does not contain a single instance of &quot;Near East&quot;. Instead, the entire region is considered the &quot;Middle East&quot;. The formerly Near Eastern sections of his trip are now &quot;Turkish&quot; and not Ottoman.

Subsequently, with the disgrace of &quot;Near East&quot; in diplomatic and military circles, &quot;Middle East&quot; prevailed. However, &quot;Near East&quot; continues in some circles at the discretion of the defining agency or academic department. They are not generally considered distinct regions as they were at their original definition.

Although racial and colonial definitions of the Middle East are no longer considered ideologically sound, the sentiment of unity persists. For much, but by no means all, of the Middle East, the predominance of Islam lends some unity, as does the accident of geographical continuity. Otherwise there is but little basis except for history and convention to lump together peoples of multiple, often unrelated languages, governments, loyalties and customs.

==Current meaning==
===Diplomatic===
In the 20th century, subsequent to major warfare and decades of intense political turmoil, the terms such as &quot;Near East&quot;, &quot;Far East&quot;, and &quot;Middle East&quot; continued to be used, but evolved in their meaning and scope. This increased confusion, the resolution of which became the study of experts in the new field of political science. The new wave of diplomats often came from those programmes.

Archaeology on the international scene, though very much of intellectual interest to major universities, was overshadowed by international relations. The archaeologists&#x27; domain became the ancient Near East, which could no longer be relied upon to be the actual Near East. The Ottoman Empire was gone, along with all the other empires of the 19th century, replaced in the region with a number of republics with various affinities, regional and global.

The many and varied specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of complex international relations, evolved with the terms. Definitions from the present came to be not in concert with those of the past. Reconciling these terms and their definitions remains difficult due to ongoing territorial disputes and non-free nuclear powers&#x27; territorial ambitions, putting any reconciliation of definitions out of scope of diplomatic corps in the classical sense.

The ancient Near East is frozen in time. The living Near East is primarily what the agencies each define as a matter of practice; often guided by their political leadership. In most cases, this single term is inadequate to describe the geographical range in practical applications. This has resulted is multiple definitions used differently by each major region, power, or institution.

====Influential agencies represented in the table====

The United States is the chief remaining nation to assign official responsibilities to a region called the &quot;Near East&quot;. Within the government the State Department has been most influential in promulgating the Near Eastern regional system. The countries of the former empires of the 19th century have in general abandoned the term and the subdivision in favor of Middle East, North Africa, and various forms of Asia. In many cases, such as France, no distinct regional substructures have been employed. Each country has its own French diplomatic apparatus, although regional terms, including Proche-Orient and Moyen-Orient, can be used in a descriptive sense.

Some of the most influential agencies in the United States still use &quot;Near East&quot; as a working concept. For example, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, a division of the United States Department of State, is perhaps the most influential agency to still use the term &quot;Near East&quot;. Under the Secretary of State, it implements the official diplomacy of the United States, called also statecraft by Secretary Hillary Clinton. The name of the bureau is traditional and historic. There is, however, no distinct Middle East. All official Middle Eastern affairs are referred to this bureau.

Working closely in conjunction with the definition of the Near East provided by the State Department is the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies (NESA), an educational institution of the United States Department of Defense. It teaches courses and holds seminars and workshops for government officials and military officers who will work or are working within its region. As the name indicates, that region is a combination of State Department regions; however, NESA is careful to identify the State Department region. As its Near East is not different from the State Department&#x27;s it does not appear in the table. Its name, however, is not entirely accurate. For example, its region includes Mauritania, a member of the State Department&#x27;s Africa (Sub-Sahara).

The Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) is a non-profit organization for research and advice on Middle Eastern policy. It regards its target countries as the Middle East but adopts the convention of calling them the &quot;Near East&quot; to be in conformance with the practices of the State Department. Its views are independent. The WINEP bundles the countries of Northwest Africa together under &quot;North Africa&quot;. Details can be found in &quot;Policy Focus #65&quot;.

====Table of Near Eastern countries recognized by various agencies====
&quot;Legend:&quot; included; excluded

====Other regional systems====
The United Nations formulates multiple regional divisions as is convenient for its various operations. But few of them include a Near East, and that poorly defined. UNICEF recognizes the &quot;Middle East and North Africa&quot; region, where the Middle East is bounded by the Red Sea on the west and includes Iran on the east. UNESCO recognizes neither a Near East nor a Middle East, dividing the countries instead among three regions: Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, and Africa. Its division &quot;does not forcibly reflect geography&quot; but &quot;refers to the execution of regional activities.&quot; The United Nations Statistics Division defines West Asia to contain the countries included elsewhere in the Middle East. Its total area extends further into Central Asia than that of most agencies.

The Directorate of Intelligence, one of four directorates into which the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is divided, includes the Office of Near Eastern and South Asian Analysis (NESA). Its duties are defined as &quot;support on Middle Eastern and North African countries, as well as on the South Asian nations of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.&quot; The combined range of countries is in fact the same as the State Department&#x27;s Near East, but the names do not correspond. The Near East of the NESA is the same as the Middle East defined in the CIA-published on-line resource, &quot;The World Factbook&quot;. Its list of countries is limited by the Red Sea, comprises the entire eastern coast of the Mediterranean, including Israel, Turkey, the small nations of the Caucasus, Iran and the states of the Arabian Peninsula.

The US Agency for International Development (USAID), an independent agency under the Department of State established in place of the Marshall Plan for the purpose of determining and distributing foreign aid, does not use the term &quot;Near East&quot;. Its definition of Middle East corresponds to that of the State Department, which officially prefers the term &quot;Near East&quot;.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office of United Kingdom recognises a Middle East and North Africa region, but not a Near East. Their original Middle East consumed the Near East as far as the Red Sea, ceded India to the Asia and Oceania region, and went into partnership with North Africa as far as the Atlantic.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hellenic Republic conducts &quot;bilateral relationships&quot; with the countries of the &quot;Mediterranean – Middle East Region&quot; but has formulated no Near East Region. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey also does not use the term &quot;Near East&quot;. Its regions include the Middle East, the Balkans and others.

===Archaeological===

The &quot;ancient Near East&quot; is a term of the 20th century intended to stabilize the geographical application of &quot;Near East&quot; to ancient history. The &quot;Near East&quot; may acquire varying meanings, but the &quot;ancient Near East&quot; always has the same meaning: the ancient nations, people and languages of the enhanced Fertile Crescent; a sweep of land from the Nile Valley through Anatolia and southward to the limits of Mesopotamia.

Resorting to this verbal device, however, did not protect the &quot;ancient Near East&quot; from the inroads of the &quot;Middle East&quot;. For example, a high point in the use of &quot;ancient Near East&quot; for Biblical scholars was the &quot;Ancient Near Eastern Texts relating to the Old Testament&quot; by James Bennett Pritchard, a textbook of first edition dated 1950. The last great book written by Leonard Woolley, British archaeologist, excavator of ancient Ur and associate of T. E. Lawrence and Arthur Evans, was &quot;The Art of the Middle East, Including Persia, Mesopotamia and Palestine&quot;, published in 1961. Woolley had completed it in 1960 two weeks before his death. The geographical ranges in each case are identical.

Parallel with the growth of specialized agencies for conducting or supporting statescraft in the second half of the 20th century has been the collection of resources for scholarship and research typically in university settings. Most universities teaching the liberal arts have library and museum collections. These are not new; however, the erection of these into &quot;centres&quot; of national and international interest in the second half of the 20th century have created larger databases not available to the scholars of the past. Many of these focus on the ancient Near East or &quot;Near East&quot; in the sense of ancient Near East.

One such institution is the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents (CSAD) founded by and located centrally at Oxford University, Great Britain. Among its many activities CSAD numbers &quot;a long-term project to create a library of digitised images of Greek inscriptions.&quot; These it arranges by region. The Egypt and the Near East region besides Egypt includes Cyprus, Persia and Afghanistan but not Asia Minor (a separate region).

===Academic===
A large percentage of experts on the modern Middle East began their training in university departments named for the Near East. Similarly the journals associated with these fields of expertise include the words &quot;Near East&quot; or &quot;Near Eastern&quot;. The meaning of &quot;Near East&quot; in these numerous establishments and publications is Middle East. Expertise on the modern Middle East is almost never mixed or confused with studies of the ancient Near East, although often &quot;ancient Near East&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;Near East&quot; without any implication of modern times. For example, &quot;Near Eastern languages&quot; in the ancient sense includes such languages as Sumerian and Akkadian. In the modern sense, it is likely to mean any or all of the Arabic languages.

<doc id="214644" wikidata="Q7260645" url="?curid=214644" title="Pup Parade">
<text>Pup Parade is a British comic strip that features in the comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. It is a spin-off to &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot;, following the lives of their dogs, and appeared in several issues for over two decades. The comic strip has been rebooted frequently, from the comic magazine it debuted in, to other comic magazines created and owned by DC Thomson.

== Synopsis ==
The Bash Street Kids&#x27; anthropomorphic dogs live in an alleyway and have many misadventures. They look for food, play games with each other and their owners, and meet other animals.

== Publication history ==
=== Original run ===
&quot;Pup Parade&quot; made its first appearance in issue 1326, illustrated by Gordon Bell. The original run finished in issue 2401. The strip returned with a new series from issue 3162 to 3204.

From June 2011, reprints appeared in &quot;The Beano&quot;, and then replaced by new stories, illustrated by Nigel Parkinson. Short strips featured in &quot;Funsize Funnies&quot;, but Lew Stringer became the new author and illustrator after 2014.

=== Subsequent appearances ===
==== &quot;The Beano&quot; ====
As of September 2021, the comic strip&#x27;s last appearance in &quot;The Beano&quot; was issue 4030, but &quot;Pup Parade&quot; has appeared in other part of the &quot;Beano&quot; franchise.

The Pup Parade also made a return in the &quot;Bash Street Kids Annual 2008&quot;. They appeared again in a talent contest in the 2012 Beano Annual, which Sniffy won. This strip was titled as &quot;The Bash Street Dogs&quot; and was drawn by Nigel Parkinson.

==== DC Thomson ====
They then moved to &quot;The Topper&quot; in January 1989, still drawn by Bell which they stayed for the rest of the comic&#x27;s life, surviving the merge with &quot;The Beezer&quot; and stayed on with the newly renamed comic &quot;Beezer and Topper&quot; until 1992.

== Characters ==
The pups were:
* Bones – Danny Morgan&#x27;s dog. The leader.
* Blotty – Spotty&#x27;s dog. The one with many spots. This dog was originally called &quot;Spotty&quot;, before its change in the mid-1970s. In the late 1980s he reverted to his original name, and his final name originated in 2003.
* &#x27;Enry – &#x27;Erbert&#x27;s dog. The shortsighted one.
* Manfrid – Wilfred&#x27;s dog. The one with a collar up to his chin.
* Peeps – Toots&#x27; dog. The girl (who wears a bow.)
* Pug – Plug&#x27;s dog. The ugly one.
* Sniffy – Smiffy&#x27;s dog. The stupid one. Got the most stories along with Bones.
* Tubby – Fatty&#x27;s dog. The fat one.
* Wiggy – Sidney&#x27;s dog. The one with strong hair.

Their sworn enemies are dubbed the Blob Street Dogs:
* Fusso – Bones&#x27; rival. The leader and the fussy one.
* Spots – Blotty&#x27;s rival, and his cousin.
* Lash – Peeps&#x27; rival. The girl.
* Thiky – Sniffy&#x27;s rival. The stupid one.
* Piggy – Tubby&#x27;s rival. The fat one.
* Baldy – Wiggy&#x27;s rival. The bald one.
* Soffo – The soft one.
* Proudon – The big-headed one.
* Markus – Proudon&#x27;s brother. Like his sibling, very big-headed.

Cuthbert Cringeworthy has a King Charles Spaniel called Cringley, but he rarely features in the strip.

Other sparring partners were the Bash Street Cats, who appeared in a summer special and in the Beano Book 1972. The Bash Street Kids also owned fish in the same issue.

Continuing the kids&#x27; anthropomorphosis into nature, the Bash Street Birds completed the set. They appeared in at least one annual and made fleeting appearances elsewhere.

<doc id="214645" wikidata="Q81683" url="?curid=214645" title="Varnish">
<text>Varnish is a clear transparent hard protective coating or film. It is not to be confused with wood stain. It usually has a yellowish shade due to the manufacturing process and materials used, but it may also be pigmented as desired. It is sold commercially in various shades.

Varnish is primarily used as a wood finish where, stained or not, the distinctive tones and grains in the wood are intended to be visible. Varnish finishes are naturally glossy, but satin/semi-gloss and flat sheens are available.

==History==
The word &quot;varnish&quot; comes from Mediaeval Latin &quot;vernix&quot;, meaning odorous resin, perhaps derived from Middle Greek &quot;berōnikón&quot; or &quot;beroníkē&quot;, meaning amber or amber-colored glass. A false etymology traces the word to the Greek &quot;Berenice&quot;, the ancient name of modern Benghazi in Libya, where the first varnishes in the Mediterranean area were supposedly used and where resins from the trees of now-vanished forests were sold.

Early varnishes were developed by mixing resin—pine pitch, for example—with a solvent and applying them with a brush to get the golden and hardened effect one sees in today&#x27;s varnishes. Varnishing was a technique well known in ancient Egypt.

Varnishing is also recorded in the history of East and South Asia; in India, China and Japan, where the practice of lacquer work, a species of varnish application, was known at a very early date. The Tang Chinese used medieval chemistry experiments to produce a varnish for clothes and weapons, employing complex chemical formulas applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and other formulas.

==Safety==
Because of flammability concerns, many product containers list safety precautions for storage and disposal for varnishes and drying oils as they are flammable, and materials used to apply the varnishes may spontaneously combust. Many varnishes contain plant-derived oils (e.g. linseed oil), synthetic oils (e.g. polyurethanes) or resins as their binder in combination with organic solvents. These are flammable in their liquid state. All drying oils, certain alkyds (including paints), and many polyurethanes produce heat (an exothermic reaction) during the curing process. Thus, oil-soaked rags and paper can smolder and ignite into flames, even several hours after use if proper precautions are not taken. Therefore, many manufacturers list proper disposal practices for rags and other items used to apply the finish, such as disposal in a water filled container.

==Components of varnish==
Varnish is traditionally a combination of a drying oil, a resin, and a thinner or solvent plus a metal drier to accelerate the drying. However, different types of varnish have different components. After being applied, the film-forming substances in varnishes either harden directly, as soon as the solvent has fully evaporated, or harden after evaporation of the solvent through curing processes, primarily chemical reaction between oils and oxygen from the air (autoxidation) and chemical reactions between components of the varnish.

Resin varnishes dry by evaporation of the solvent and harden quickly on drying. Acrylic and waterborne varnishes dry by evaporation of the water but will experience an extended curing period for evaporation of organic solvents absorbed on the latex particles, and possibly chemical curing of the particles. Oil, polyurethane, and epoxy varnishes remain liquid even after evaporation of the solvent but quickly begin to cure, undergoing successive stages from liquid or syrupy, to tacky or sticky, to dry gummy, to dry to the touch, to hard.

Environmental factors such as heat and humidity play a large role in the drying and curing times of varnishes. In classic varnish the cure rate depends on the type of oil used and, to some extent, on the ratio of oil to resin. The drying and curing time of all varnishes may be sped up by exposure to an energy source such as sunlight, ultraviolet light, or heat.

===Drying oil===

There are many different types of drying oils, including linseed oil, tung oil, and walnut oil. These contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Drying oils cure through an exothermic reaction between the polyunsaturated portion of the oil and oxygen from the air. Originally, the term &quot;varnish&quot; referred to finishes that were made entirely of resin dissolved in suitable solvents, either ethanol (alcohol) or turpentine. The advantage to finishes in previous centuries was that resin varnishes had a very rapid cure rate compared to oils; in most cases they are cured practically as soon as the solvent has fully evaporated. By contrast, untreated or &quot;raw&quot; oils may take weeks or months to cure, depending on ambient temperature and other environmental factors. In modern terms, boiled or partially polymerized drying oils with added siccatives or dryers (chemical catalysts) have cure times of less than 24 hours. However, certain non-toxic by-products of the curing process are emitted from the oil film even after it is dry to the touch and over a considerable period of time. It has long been a tradition to combine drying oils with resins to obtain favourable features of both substances.

===Resin===
Many different kinds of resins may be used to create a varnish. Natural resins used for varnish include amber, kauri gum, dammar, copal, rosin (colophony or pine resin), sandarac, balsam, elemi, mastic, and shellac. Varnish may also be created from synthetic resins such as acrylic, alkyd, or polyurethane. A varnish formula might not contain any added resins at all since drying oils can produce a varnish effect by themselves.

===Solvent===
Originally, turpentine or alcohol was used to dissolve the resin and thin the drying oils. The invention of petroleum distillates has led to turpentine substitutes such as white spirit, paint thinner, and mineral spirit. Modern synthetic varnishes may be formulated with water instead of hydrocarbon solvents.

==Types==

===Violin===

Violin varnishing is a multi-step process involving some or all of the following: primer, sealer, ground, color coats, and clear topcoat. Some systems use a drying oil varnish as described below, while others use spirit varnish made of resin(s) dissolved in alcohol. Touchup in repair or restoration is only done with solvent based varnish.

Drying oil such as walnut oil or linseed oil may be used in combination with amber, copal, rosin or other resins. Traditionally the oil is prepared by cooking or exposure to air and sunlight, but modern stand oil is prepared by heating oil at high temperature without oxygen. The refined resin is sometimes available as a translucent solid and is then &quot;run&quot; by cooking or melting it in a pot over heat without solvents. The thickened oil and prepared resin are then cooked together and thinned with turpentine (away from open flame) into a brushable solution. The ingredients and processes of violin varnish are very diverse, with some highly regarded old examples showing defects (e.g. cracking, crazing) associated with incompatible varnish components.

Some violin finishing systems use vernice bianca (egg white and gum arabic) as a sealer or ground. There is also evidence that finely powdered minerals, possibly volcanic ash, were used in some grounds. Some violins made in the late 18th century used ox blood to create a very deep-red coloration. Today this varnish would have faded and currently be a very warm, dark orange.

===Resin===
Most resin or gum varnishes consist of a natural, plant- or insect-derived substance dissolved in a solvent, called &quot;spirit varnish&quot; or &quot;solvent varnish.&quot; The solvent may be alcohol, turpentine, or petroleum-based. Some resins are soluble in both alcohol and turpentine. Generally, petroleum solvents, i.e. mineral spirits or paint thinner, can substitute for turpentine. The resins include amber, dammar, copal, rosin, sandarac, elemi, benzoin, mastic, balsam, shellac, and a multitude of lacquers.

Synthetic resins such as phenolic resin may be employed as a secondary component in certain varnishes and paints.

Over centuries, many recipes were developed which involved the combination of resins, oils, and other ingredients such as certain waxes. These were believed to impart special tonal qualities to musical instruments and thus were sometimes carefully guarded secrets. The interaction of different ingredients is difficult to predict or reproduce, so expert finishers were often prized professionals.

===Shellac===

Shellac is a very widely used single-component resin varnish that is alcohol-soluble. It is not used for outdoor surfaces or where it will come into repeated contact with water, such as around a sink or bathtub. The source of shellac resin is a brittle or flaky secretion of the female lac insect, &quot;Kerria lacca&quot;, found in the forests of Assam and Thailand and harvested from the bark of the trees where she deposits it to provide a sticky hold on the trunk. Shellac is the basis of French polish, which for centuries has been the preferred finish for fine furniture. Specified &quot;dewaxed&quot; shellac has been processed to remove the waxy substances from original shellac and can be used as a primer and sanding-sealer substrate for other finishes such as polyurethanes, alkyds, oils, and acrylics.

Prepared shellac is typically available in &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;amber&quot; (or &quot;orange&quot;) varieties, generally as &quot;three-pound cut&quot; or three pounds dry shellac to one US gallon of alcohol. Other natural color shades such as ruby and yellow are available from specialty pigment or woodworker&#x27;s supply outlets. Dry shellac is available as refined flakes, &quot;sticklac,&quot; &quot;button lac,&quot; or &quot;seedlac.&quot; &quot;White pigmented&quot; shellac primer paint is widely available in retail outlets, billed as a fast-drying interior primer &quot;problem solver&quot;, in that it adheres to a variety of surfaces and seals off odors and smoke stains. Shellac clean-up may be done either with pure alcohol or with ammonia cleansers.

===Alkyd===

Modern commercially produced varnishes employ some form of alkyd for producing a protective film. Alkyds have good solvent, moisture and UV light resistance. Alkyds are chemically modified vegetable oils which operate well in a wide range of conditions and can be engineered to speed up the cure rate and thus harden faster. Usually this is by the use of metal salt driers such as cobalt salts. Better (and more expensive) exterior varnishes employ alkyds made from high performance oils and contain UV-absorbers; this improves gloss-retention and extends the lifetime of the finish. Various resins may also be combined with alkyds as part of the formula for typical &quot;oil&quot; varnishes that are commercially available.

===Spar varnish===
&quot;Spar varnish&quot; (also called &quot;marine varnish&quot; or &quot;yacht varnish&quot;) was originally intended for use on ship or boat spars, to protect the timber from the effects of sea and weather. Spars bend under the load of their sails. The primary requirements were water resistance and also elasticity, so as to remain adhering as the spars flexed. Elasticity was a pre-condition for weatherproofing too, as a finish that cracked would then allow water through, even if the remaining film was impermeable. Appearance and gloss was of relatively low value. Modified tung oil and phenolic resins are often used.

When first developed, no varnishes had good UV-resistance. Even after more modern synthetic resins did become resistant, a true spar varnish maintained its elasticity above other virtues, even if this required a compromise in its UV-resistance. Spar varnishes are thus &quot;not&quot; necessarily the best choice for outdoor woodwork that does not need to bend in service.

Despite this, the widespread perception of &quot;marine products&quot; as &quot;tough&quot; led to domestic outdoor varnishes being branded as &quot;Spar varnish&quot; and sold on the virtue of their weather- and UV-resistance. These claims may be more or less realistic, depending on individual products. Only relatively recently have spar varnishes been available that can offer both effective elasticity and UV-resistance.

===Drying oils===

Drying oils, such as linseed and tung oil, are not true varnishes though often in modern terms they accomplish the same thing.

===Polyurethane===
Polyurethane varnishes are typically hard, abrasion-resistant, and durable coatings. They are popular for hardwood floors but are considered by some wood finishers to be difficult or unsuitable for finishing furniture or other detailed pieces. Polyurethanes are comparable in hardness to certain alkyds but generally form a tougher film. Compared to simple oil or shellac varnishes, polyurethane varnish forms a harder, decidedly tougher and more waterproof film. However, a thick film of ordinary polyurethane may de-laminate if subjected to heat or shock, fracturing the film and leaving white patches. This tendency increases with long exposure to sunlight or when it is applied over soft woods like pine. This is also in part due to polyurethane&#x27;s lesser penetration into the wood. Various priming techniques are employed to overcome this problem, including the use of certain oil varnishes, specified &quot;dewaxed&quot; shellac, clear penetrating epoxy sealer, or &quot;oil-modified&quot; polyurethane designed for the purpose. Polyurethane varnish may also lack the &quot;hand-rubbed&quot; lustre of drying oils such as linseed or tung oil; in contrast, however, it is capable of a much faster and higher film build, accomplishing in two coats what may require multiple applications of oil. Polyurethane may also be applied over a straight oil finish, but because of the relatively slow curing time of oils, the emission of certain chemical byproducts, and the need for exposure to oxygen from the air, care must be taken that the oils are sufficiently cured to accept the polyurethane. One of the disadvantages of a polyurethane-based varnish is the tendency to yellow over time. This is because the hydroxyl groups of a regular alkyd are reacted with TDI to produce a urethane-alkyd. This introduces a high degree of aromaticity and hence tendency to yellow. 

Unlike drying oils and alkyds which cure after evaporation of the solvent and upon reaction with oxygen from the air, true polyurethane coatings cure after evaporation of the solvent and then either by a variety of reactions of chemicals within the original mix, or by reaction with moisture from the air. Certain polyurethane products are &quot;hybrids&quot; and combine different aspects of their parent components. &quot;Oil-modified&quot; polyurethanes, whether water-borne or solvent-borne, are currently the most widely used wood floor finishes.

Exterior use of polyurethane varnish may be problematic due to its heightened susceptibility to deterioration through ultra-violet light exposure. All clear or translucent varnishes, and indeed all film-polymer coatings (e.g. paint, stain, epoxy, synthetic plastic, etc.) are susceptible to this damage in varying degrees. Pigments in paints and stains protect against UV damage. UV-absorbers are added to polyurethane and other varnishes (e.g. spar varnish) to work against UV damage but are decreasingly effective over the course of 2–4 years, depending on the quantity and quality of UV-absorbers added, as well as the severity and duration of sun exposure. Water exposure, humidity, temperature extremes, and other environmental factors affect all finishes.

===Lacquer===

The word &quot;lacquer&quot; refers to quick-drying, solvent-based varnishes or paints. Although their names may be similarly derived, lacquer is not the same as &quot;shellac&quot; and is not dissolved in alcohol. Lacquer is dissolved in lacquer thinner, which is a highly flammable solvent typically containing butyl acetate and xylene or toluene. Lacquer is typically sprayed on, within a &quot;spray booth&quot; that evacuates overspray and minimizes the risk of combustion.

The rule of thumb is that a clear wood finish formulated to be sprayed is a lacquer, but if it is formulated to be brushed on then it is a varnish. Thus, by far most pieces of wooden furniture are lacquered.
Lacquer may be considered different from varnish because it can be re-dissolved later by a solvent (such as the one it was dissolved in when it was applied) and does not chemically change to a solid like other varnishes.

===Acrylic===
Acrylic resin varnishes are typically water-borne varnishes with the lowest refractive index of all finishes and high transparency. They resist yellowing. Acrylics have the advantage of water clean-up and lack of solvent fumes, but typically do not penetrate into wood as well as oils. They sometimes lack the brushability and self-leveling qualities of solvent-based varnishes. Generally they have good UV-resistance.

In the art world, varnishes offer dust-resistance and a harder surface than bare paint – they sometimes have the benefit of ultraviolet light resistors, which help protect artwork from fading in exposure to light. Acrylic varnish should be applied using an isolation coat (a permanent, protective barrier between the painting and the varnish, preferably a soft, glossy gel medium) to make varnish removal and overall conservation easier. Acrylic varnishes used for such a final removable art protection layer are typically mineral-spirit–based acrylic, rather than water-based.

===Two-part epoxy===

Various epoxy resin systems have been formulated as varnishes or floor finishes whereby two components are mixed directly before application. Sometimes, the two parts are of equal volume and referred to as 1:1 but not always, as 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and even 5:1 mixing ratios are commercially available. The individual components are usually referred to as Part A and Part B. All two-part epoxies have a pot-life or working time during which the mixed material can be used. Usually the pot-life is a matter of a few hours or less, but this is highly temperature dependent. Both water-borne and solvent-based epoxies are used. Epoxies do have a tendency to yellow over a fairly short period of time.

===Conversion===
Used when a fast-curing, tough, hard finish is desired, such as for kitchen cabinets and office furniture. Comes in two parts: a resin and an acid catalyst. The first is a blend of an amino resin and an alkyd. The acid catalyst is added right before application in a set ratio determined by the manufacturer. Most produce minimal yellowing. There are, however, two downsides to this finish. The first is that as the finish cures, it gives off formaldehyde, which is toxic and carcinogenic. The second is that the finish can crack or craze if too many coats are applied.

<text>Gnasher () is a fictional comic strip character that appears in the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. He is the pet dog of Dennis the Menace, who meets him in 1968&#x27;s issue 1362, and is also the star of three spin-off comic strips. Gnasher is considered just as iconic as his owner as both have been the stars of many children&#x27;s television programming and are the unofficial mascots of &quot;The Beano&quot;. Gnasher reached nationwide news in the 1980s after he disappeared from the magazine for seven weeks, returning with his six newborn puppies, but usually interacts with his son Gnipper.

== Development ==
Although Dennis the Menace was shown with a terrier in his first story, he would not meet Gnasher for 17 years. Dennis&#x27; artist Davey Law decided to give his character a dog companion but struggled to give the dog a perfect design, inspired by DC Thomson writer Jim Fowler mentioning reading a newspaper story about pets looking like their owners. Ian Gray suggested Law should &quot;draw Dennis the Menace&#x27;s hair, put a leg on each corner and two eyeballs at that end.&quot; Gray was a dog breeding hobbyist, and assisted with some of Gnasher&#x27;s stories and for the stories in &quot;Pup Parade&quot;.

== Character background ==
Gnasher is a black-haired Abyssinian Wire-Haired Tripe Hound who often enjoys chewing and biting anyone and anything, grunting &quot;!&quot; instead of barking. He was a bushy stray when Dennis found him just as Dennis grew interest in a local dog show. Dennis gives him the name &quot;Gnasher&quot; and encourages his misbehaviour. The two are inseparable, to the point the comic strip alternates between the titles &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace and Gnasher&quot; and &quot;Dennis and Gnasher&quot;.

Although the reader can read Gnasher&#x27;s thoughts from the thought bubbles, other characters cannot understand him if he decides to talk in front of them (his dialogue usually represented with most words beginning with n having the (silent) letter g in front to represent his barks, e.g. &quot;gnight&quot;). Dennis can only understand him on Hallowe&#x27;en.

== &quot;Who&#x27;s Gnicked Gnasher?&quot; publicity stunt ==
&quot;The Beano&quot; sales ebbed throughout the 1980s, no longer selling millions of issues per week as it did thirty years ago. Aware of how audiences enjoyed watching Gnasher and Dennis&#x27; tight bond, sub-editor Alan Digby suggested a media prank that could cause a sales boost, leading to the seven-issue long &quot;Where&#x27;s Gnasher?&quot; saga. It began in issue 2279, initially about Dennis outwitting a man with a giant bag of money from buying Gnasher, but Gnasher later disappeared without explanation and the story ended with Dennis standing alone in his back garden asking the reader if they would help him find Gnasher. The following issues would commonly begin with a panel of children holding Gnasher picket signs as Dennis and his family either joined the march or tried to cope with Gnasher&#x27;s disappearance; Dennis also considers adopting a similar-looking replacement, and sets up traps to lure Gnasher back. Initially baffled by the town&#x27;s search parties, Dennis&#x27; father starts to miss Gnasher when he realises he cannot pretend to spill his wife&#x27;s terrible meals on the floor for Gnasher to eat when she is out of the room. Part 3 of the saga broke the fourth wall when Dennis decides to invite himself into DC Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Beano&quot; offices and ask chief-editor Euan Kerr to help. Gnasher&#x27;s departure would end in issue 2286 when Dennis and Walter find a pram full of puppies outside Dennis&#x27; front door, revealing he was caring for his son and five daughters. He reveals to the reader his children are named Gnorah, Gnatasha, Gnanette, Gnaomi, Gnancy and Gnipper.

== Star of his own stories ==
===&quot;Gnasher&#x27;s Tale&quot;===

After co-starring with his owner in &quot;Dennis the Menace and Gnasher&quot; for nine years, Gnasher would star in his own strip: &quot;Gnasher&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a prequel series about Gnasher&#x27;s life when he was a puppy. David Sutherland designed the series, encouraged to show off Gnasher&#x27;s dynamic expressions, and his stories debuted in 1977&#x27;s issue 1818.

Despite &quot;The Beano&quot; already establishing Dennis (and his family) met Gnasher when he was fully grown, Dennis is also portrayed as younger, and the first story showed his friend Curly wearing a bib and sucking a dummy. Each strip begins with a panel of Gnasher addressing the audience as he holds a book implied to contain the anecdote for the episode—its title initially &quot;Gnasher&#x27;s Puphood&quot;, then changed to &quot;My Tale by Gnasher&quot; three strips later. The series changes the origin story to Dennis and his friends finding Gnasher in a bush, thinking Gnasher is a hairy worm because of his size. Dennis&#x27;s father starts loathing Gnasher after Gnasher eats his dinner, and becomes determined to train the puppy, despite Gnasher&#x27;s hyperactive behaviour provoking, humiliating and injuring him. A few stories imply he understands Gnasher, showing him react to Gnasher&#x27;s anthropomorphic responses and the two violently arguing at times. Other cameos include Dennis&#x27; mum and a younger Walter, as Gnasher does not hold back from tormenting them as well for his amusement or to get his own way. Other stories are about &quot;Gnasher&#x27;s firsts&quot;, showing him at his first haircut and vet visit, and when he first learnt how strong his teeth are.

The series was eventually cancelled after issue 2278, in the wake of the &quot;Where&#x27;s Gnasher?&quot; saga. Its section was replaced by &quot;Foo Foo&#x27;s Fairy Story&quot;, also illustrated by Dave Sutherland, starring Walter&#x27;s dog Foo-Foo. When Gnasher reunited with Dennis, &quot;Gnasher&#x27;s Tale&quot; remained cancelled, but would feature in &quot;Beano&quot; annuals illustrated by Barry Glennard, and in &quot;Dandy and Beano: The Golden Years, Volume II&quot;.
===&quot;Gnasher and Gnipper&quot;===

In the same issue Gnasher returned, &quot;Gnasher and Gnipper&quot; debuted, replacing &quot;Gnasher&#x27;s Tale&quot;. This series was set in the present day, showing Gnasher bonding with his only son, usually chasing cats and postmen, pestering Foo-Foo, and finding some sausages to eat. Dennis and his family sometimes featured. Around each other, Gnasher and Gnipper communicate through speech bubbles anthropomorphically, but the dialogue is placed back in thought bubbles around human characters, implying the humans cannot understand them. Occasionally, one of Gnipper&#x27;s sisters make an appearance to help with a scheme, but most stories usually feature the protagonists irritating adults.

David Sutherland illustrated until 1993 and was succeeded by Barry Glennard. The series declined throughout the 2000s as &quot;The Beano&quot; prepped for the new &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; cartoon and did not return until 2014. Its recent artist is Barrie Appleby, with scripts by Danny Pearson and JD Savage. &quot;Gnasher and Gnipper&quot; has featured in &quot;The Beano Annual&quot;, &quot;The Beano Summer Special&quot; and in issue 168 of the &quot;Beano Comic Library&quot;.
===&quot;Gnasher&#x27;s Bit(e)&quot;===
Gnasher received a solo series again in 2011 with &quot;Gnasher&#x27;s Bit(e)&quot;, illustrated by Jimmy Hansen and then Barrie Appleby, authored by an uncredited Ryan C. Gavan. It ended in January 2014.

=== &quot;Funsize Funnies&quot; shorts ===
==== &quot;Gnipper&quot; ====
Gnasher&#x27;s son received his own, eponymous three-panel gag-a-day in &quot;Beano&quot; Funsize Funnies section from January to July 2013, with artwork by Canadian artist Graham Howie.

====&quot;Gnash Gnews&quot;====
&quot;Gnash Gnews&quot; was a mini-strip which featured in &quot;Funsize Funnies&quot; from issues 3660 to 3681, illustrated by Barrie Appleby.

== Reception and legacy ==
Although &quot;Who&#x27;s Gnicked Gnasher?&quot; failed to resurrect &quot;The Beano&quot; sales in the long term, the saga received nationwide attention. Distraught readers telephoned and wrote to DC Thomson to both voice their worry for Gnasher&#x27;s safety or help look for clues, and The Dennis the Menace club sold Gnasher badges to identify other readers also helping Dennis. Radio presenter Mike Read broadcast the news on his BBC Radio 1 show (which was dramatised in issue 2281), and newspapers like &quot;The Times&quot; reported the disappearance frequently. The series would be reprinted in the 1990 &quot;Dennis the Menace Annual&quot; as a 16-page story entitled &quot;Who&#x27;s Gnicked Gnasher?&quot; &quot;The Beano&quot; re-created the saga in 2014, in which Dennis would ask Bear Grylls to help with the search.

Gnasher&#x27;s debut appearance featured in Royal Mail&#x27;s commemorative &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; 70th anniversary stamps. Gnatasha had her own strip in &quot;The Beezer and Topper&quot;, and appeared in the 1994 &quot;Beezer Book&quot;.

<text>Eucosmodon is a genus of extinct mammal from the Paleocene of North America. It is a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata within the suborder of Cimolodonta, and the family Eucosmodontidae. This genus has partly also been known as Neoplagiaulax. All known fossils of this small mammal are restricted to teeth.

== Species ==
All known species of &quot;Eucosmodon&quot; have been found in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico (United States).
* &quot;Eucosmodon americanus&quot; is a species of which Puercan (Paleocene)-age fossils have been found. Some, but not all, of this fossil material has been reclassified as &quot;E. primus&quot;. This animal, which probably weighed something like 750 g, has been cited as a possible descendant of that species.
* &quot;Eucosmodon molestus&quot; is a species of Torrejonian (Paleocene) age. It has been cited as a possible descendant of &quot;E. americanus&quot;.
* &quot;Eucosmodon primus&quot;, also from the Puercan part of the Paleocene, have been found in the Nacimiento Formation of the San Juan Basin. This species is based on fossils originally ascribed to &quot;E. americanus&quot;.
* A possible fourth species, &quot;Eucosmodon kuszmauli&quot;, has also been named.

<text>Clemensodon is a genus of extinct mammal from the Upper Cretaceous of North America. It lived during the end of the Mesozoic, also known as the &quot;age of the dinosaurs&quot;. It was a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata within the suborder of Cimolodonta and family Eucosmodontidae. Fossil remains are restricted to teeth.

The main species of Clemensodon is Clemensodon megaloba, however, this species is also known as a part of &quot;Kimbetohia campi&quot;. Fossils have been found in the Lance Formation of Wyoming (United States). They age from the Maastrichtian division of the Upper Cretaceous. The species is based on a reassessment of a couple of &quot;Kimbetohia&quot; teeth, but not the entire species or genus. The assignment of this taxon to Eucosmodontidae is tentative.

Evidence from the size and number of serrations of certain teeth and its enamel microstructure indicates that &quot;Clemensodon&quot; is either a derived taeniolabidoid or a primitive ptilodontoid. Determination of which of these two alternatives is correct must await the recovery of teeth from other positions.

<text>FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. At its core is the command-line codice_1 tool itself, designed for processing video and audio files. It is widely used for format transcoding, basic editing (trimming and concatenation), video scaling, video post-production effects, and standards compliance (SMPTE, ITU).

FFmpeg also includes other tools: codice_2, a simple media player, and codice_3, a command-line tool to display media information. Among included libraries are libavcodec, an audio/video codec library used by many commercial and free software products, libavformat (Lavf), an audio/video container mux and demux library, and libavfilter, a library for enhancing and editing filters through a GStreamer-like filtergraph.

FFmpeg is part of the workflow of many other software projects, and its libraries are a core part of software media players such as VLC, and has been included in core processing for YouTube and Bilibili. Encoders and decoders for many audio and video file formats are included, making it highly useful for the transcoding of common and uncommon media files.

FFmpeg is published under the LGPL-2.1-or-later or GPL-2.0-or-later, depending on which options are enabled.

== History ==
The project was started by Fabrice Bellard (using the pseudonym &quot;Gérard Lantau&quot;) in 2000, and was led by Michael Niedermayer from 2004 until 2015. Some FFmpeg developers were also part of the MPlayer project.

The name of the project is inspired by the MPEG video standards group, together with &quot;FF&quot; for &quot;fast forward&quot;, so FFmpeg stands for &quot;Fast Forward Moving Picture Experts Group&quot;. The logo represents a zigzag scan pattern that shows how MPEG video codecs handle entropy encoding.

On March 13, 2011, a group of FFmpeg developers decided to fork the project under the name Libav. The event was related to an issue in project management, in which developers disagreed with the leadership of FFmpeg.

On January 10, 2014, two Google employees announced that over 1000 bugs had been fixed in FFmpeg during the previous two years by means of fuzz testing.

In January 2018, the &quot;ffserver&quot; command-line program – a long-time component of FFmpeg – was removed. The developers had previously deprecated the program citing high maintenance efforts due to its use of internal application programming interfaces.

The project publishes a new release every three months on average. While release versions are available from the website for download, FFmpeg developers recommend that users compile the software from source using the latest build from their source code, using the Git version control system.

=== Codec history ===
Two video coding formats with corresponding codecs and one container format have been created within the FFmpeg project so far. The two video codecs are the lossless FFV1, and the lossless and lossy Snow codec. Development of Snow has stalled, while its bit-stream format has not been finalized yet, making it experimental since 2011. The multimedia container format called NUT is no longer being actively developed, but still maintained.

In summer 2010, FFmpeg developers Fiona Glaser, Ronald Bultje, and David Conrad, announced the ffvp8 decoder. Through testing, they determined that ffvp8 was faster than Google&#x27;s own libvpx decoder. Starting with version 0.6, FFmpeg also supported WebM and VP8.

In October 2013, a native VP9 decoder and OpenHEVC, an open source High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) decoder, were added to FFmpeg. In 2016 the native AAC encoder was considered stable, removing support for the two external AAC encoders from VisualOn and FAAC. FFmpeg 3.0 (nicknamed &quot;Einstein&quot;) retained build support for the Fraunhofer FDK AAC encoder. Since version 3.4 &quot;Cantor&quot; FFmpeg supported the FITS image format. Since November 2018 in version 4.1 &quot;al-Khwarizmi&quot; AV1 can be muxed in MP4 and Matroska, including WebM.

== Components ==

=== Command-line tools ===
* &quot;ffmpeg&quot; is a command-line tool that converts audio or video formats. It can also capture and encode in real-time from various hardware and software sources such as a TV capture card.
* &quot;ffplay&quot; is a simple media player utilizing SDL and the FFmpeg libraries.
* &quot;ffprobe&quot; is a command-line tool to display media information (text, CSV, XML, JSON), see also MediaInfo.

=== Libraries ===
* &quot;libswresample&quot; is a library containing audio resampling routines.
* &quot;libavresample&quot; is a library containing audio resampling routines from the Libav project, similar to &quot;libswresample&quot; from &quot;ffmpeg&quot;.
* &quot;libavcodec&quot; is a library containing all of the native FFmpeg audio/video encoders and decoders. Most codecs were developed from scratch to ensure best performance and high code reusability.
* &quot;libavformat&quot; (Lavf) is a library containing demuxers and muxers for audio/video container formats.
* &quot;libavutil&quot; is a helper library containing routines common to different parts of FFmpeg. This library includes hash functions, ciphers, LZO decompressor and Base64 encoder/decoder.
* &quot;libpostproc&quot; is a library containing older H.263 based video postprocessing routines.
* &quot;libswscale&quot; is a library containing video image scaling and colorspace/pixelformat conversion routines.
* &quot;libavfilter&quot; is the substitute for vhook which allows the video/audio to be modified or examined (for debugging) between the decoder and the encoder. Filters have been ported from many projects including MPlayer and avisynth.
* &quot;libavdevice&quot; is a library containing audio/video io through internal and external devices.

== Supported hardware ==
=== CPUs ===
FFmpeg encompasses software implementations of video and audio compressing and decompressing algorithms. These can be compiled and run on many different instruction sets, including x86 (IA-32 and x86-64), PPC (PowerPC), ARM, DEC Alpha, SPARC, and MIPS.

=== Special purpose hardware ===
There are a variety of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for audio/video compression and decompression. These ASICs can partially or completely offload the computation from the host CPU. Instead of a complete implementation of an algorithm, only the API is required to use such an ASIC.

The following APIs are also supported: DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA2, Windows), Direct3D 11 (D3D11VA, Windows), Media Foundation (Windows), Vulkan (VKVA), VideoToolbox (iOS, iPadOS, macOS), RockChip MPP, OpenCL, OpenMAX, MMAL (Raspberry Pi), MediaCodec (Android OS), V4L2 (Linux). Depending on the environment, these APIs may lead to specific ASICs, to GPGPU routines, or to SIMD CPU code.

== Supported codecs and formats ==
=== Image formats ===

FFmpeg supports many common and some uncommon image formats.

The PGMYUV image format is a homebrew variant of the binary (P5) PGM Netpbm format. FFmpeg also supports 16-bit depths of the PGM and PPM formats, and the binary (P7) PAM format with or without alpha channel, depth 8 bit or 16 bit for codice_4 &quot;monob, gray, gray16be, rgb24, rgb48be, ya8, rgba, rgb64be&quot;.

=== Supported formats ===

In addition to FFV1 and Snow formats, which were created and developed from within FFmpeg, the project also supports the following formats:

== Applications ==

=== Legal aspects ===
FFmpeg contains more than 100 codecs, most of which use compression techniques of one kind or another. Many such compression techniques may be subject to legal claims relating to software patents. Such claims may be enforceable in countries like the United States which have implemented software patents, but are considered unenforceable or void in member countries of the European Union, for example. Patents for many older codecs, including AC3 and all MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 codecs, have expired.

FFmpeg is licensed under the LGPL license, but if a particular build of FFmpeg is linked against any GPL libraries (notably x264), then the entire binary is licensed under the GPL.

=== Projects using FFmpeg ===

FFmpeg is used by software such as Blender, Cinelerra-GG Infinity, HandBrake, Kodi, MPC-HC, Plex, Shotcut, VirtualDub2 (a VirtualDub fork), VLC media player, xine and YouTube. It handles video and audio playback in Google Chrome and the Linux version of Firefox. GUI front-ends for FFmpeg have been developed, including Multimedia Xpert and XMedia Recode.

FFmpeg is used by ffdshow, FFmpegInterop, the GStreamer FFmpeg plug-in, LAV Filters and OpenMAX IL to expand the encoding and decoding capabilities of their respective multimedia platforms.

As part of NASA&#x27;s Mars 2020 mission, FFmpeg is used by the Perseverance rover on Mars for image and video compression before footage is sent to Earth.

<doc id="214658" wikidata="Q5496708" url="?curid=214658" title="Freddie Fear">
<text>Freddie Fear is a fictional character who has his own comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot;, the tagline being Son of a Witch. 

Freddie Fear is a normal boy, but he lives with his mother, a witch. Each week they show adventures, mainly Freddie trying to do something normal and then his mum comes along and makes it all magical. He has a couple of pet monsters. The strip first appeared in issue 3103, dated 5 January 2002, where Beano readers voted between it and two other comic strips (Phone-a-Fiend and Space Kidette) for which one they wanted to stay in the comic. Freddie&#x27;s strip won. It is drawn by Dave Eastbury. Since his first appearance, he has grown less and less used to his mother&#x27;s witchcraft and, if anything, he is frequently frustrated by the stupidity of his mother or the other spooks, such as getting annoyed with his mother for trying to bake cakes using spells (resulting in a lot of snakes being produced because his mother cannot spell).

At the end of 2009, the artwork on the strip was given a revamp to match Dave Eastbury&#x27;s new style on Ball Boy. Since then, Freddie has appeared noticeably smaller, and his head is more stretched out. His mother&#x27;s appearance also changed, albeit to a lesser extent, and she began to wear a shorter dress. His story in the 2011 Beano Annual was drawn by Tom Paterson. However, his appearances in the comic became increasingly less regular during 2011. In October 2011, the strip returned as reprints from 2004, however, only two of these strips have been printed so far. On the Freddie Fear Beano page in 2012, it was confirmed that Freddie&#x27;s series has ended.</text><links>

<doc id="214659" wikidata="Q378835" url="?curid=214659" title="Unit 731">
<text>, short for Manchu Detachment 731 and also known as the Kamo Detachment and the Ishii Unit, was a covert biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Imperial Japanese Army that engaged in lethal human experimentation and biological weapons manufacturing during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and World War II. Estimates vary as to how many were killed. Between 1936 and 1945, roughly 14,000 victims were murdered in Unit 731. It is estimated that at least 300,000 individuals have died due to infectious illnesses caused by the activities of Unit 731 and its affiliated research facilities. It was based in the Pingfang district of Harbin, the largest city in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo (now Northeast China) and had active branch offices throughout China and Southeast Asia.

Established in 1936, Unit 731 was responsible for some of the most notorious war crimes committed by the Japanese armed forces. It routinely conducted tests on people who were dehumanized and internally referred to as &quot;logs&quot;. Victims were further dehumanized by being confined in facilities referred to as &quot;log cabins&quot;. Experiments included disease injections, controlled dehydration, biological weapons testing, hypobaric pressure chamber testing, vivisection, organ harvesting, amputation, and standard weapons testing. Victims included not only kidnapped men, women (including pregnant women) and children but also babies born from the systemic rape perpetrated by the staff inside the compound. The victims also came from different nationalities, with the majority being Chinese and a significant minority being Russian. Additionally, Unit 731 produced biological weapons that were used in areas of China not occupied by Japanese forces, which included Chinese cities and towns, water sources, and fields. All prisoners within the compound were killed to conceal evidence, and there were no documented survivors.

Originally set up by the military police of the Empire of Japan, Unit 731 was taken over and commanded until the end of the war by General Shirō Ishii, a combat medic officer. The facility itself was built in 1935 as a replacement for the Zhongma Fortress, a prison and experimentation camp. Ishii and his team used it to expand their capabilities. The program received generous support from the Japanese government until the end of the war in 1945. On 28 August 2002, Tokyo District Court ruled that Japan had committed biological warfare in China and consequently was responsible for the deaths of many residents.

Both the Soviet Union and United States gathered data from the Unit after the fall of Japan. While twelve Unit 731 researchers arrested by Soviet forces were tried at the December 1949 Khabarovsk war crimes trials, they were sentenced lightly to the Siberian labor camp from two to 25 years, in exchange for the information they held. Those captured by the US military were secretly given immunity. The United States helped cover up the human experimentations and handed stipends to the perpetrators. The US had co-opted the researchers&#x27; bioweapons information and experience for use in their own warfare program (resembling Operation Paperclip). The Soviet Union built their bioweapons facility in Sverdlovsk using documentation captured from the Unit in Manchuria.

== Formations ==
Japan initiated its biological weapons program during the 1930s due to the prohibition of biological weapons in interstate conflicts by the Geneva Protocol of 1925. They reasoned that the ban verified its effectiveness as a weapon. Japan&#x27;s occupation of Manchuria began in 1931 after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan decided to build Unit 731 in Manchuria because the occupation not only gave the Japanese an advantage of separating the research station from their island, but also gave them access to as many Chinese individuals as they wanted for use as test subjects. They viewed the Chinese as no-cost assets, and hoped this would give them a competitive advantage in biological warfare. Most of the victims were Chinese, but many victims were also from different nationalities. These facilities contained more than just medical research and experimentation areas; they also included spaces for detaining victims, essentially functioning as a prison. The research and experimentation rooms were constructed around the detention area, allowing researchers to conduct their daily work while monitoring the prisoners. 
Founded in 1936, Unit 731 expanded to include 3000 staff members, 150 structures, and the capacity to detain up to 600 prisoners concurrently for experimental purposes.

Unit 731 was a clandestine division of Japan&#x27;s Kwantung Army based in Manchuria during World War II. Led by Lieutenant General Shirō Ishii, the organization dedicated to the advancement of biological weaponry within the imperial army was commonly referred to as the Ishii Network. The Ishii Network was headquartered at the Epidemic Prevention Research Laboratory, established in 1932 at the Japanese Army Military Medical School in Tokyo, Japan. Unit 731 was the first among several covert units established as offshoots of the research lab, serving as field stations and experimental sites for advancing biological warfare techniques. These efforts culminated in the experimental deployment of biological weapons on Chinese cities, a direct breach of the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of biological and chemical weapons in warfare. Participants in these activities were aware of the violations and recognized the inhumanity of using human subjects in laboratory experiments, prompting the establishment of Unit 731 and other secret units.

Under the direction of Ishii Shiro, the Epidemic Prevention Research Laboratory was established following his return from a two-year exploration of American and European research institutions. With the endorsement of high-ranking military officials, it was established for the purpose of developing biological weapons. Ishii aimed to create biological weapons with humans as their intended victims, and Unit 731 was formed specifically to pursue this objective. Ishii organized a secret research group, the &quot;Tōgō Unit,&quot; for chemical and biological experimentation in Manchuria.

In 1936, Emperor Hirohito issued a decree authorizing the expansion of the unit and its integration into the Kwantung Army as the Epidemic Prevention Department. It was divided at that time into the &quot;Ishii Unit&quot; and &quot;Wakamatsu Unit&quot;, with a base in Xinjing. From August 1940 on, the units were known collectively as the &quot;Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army&quot; or &quot;Unit 731&quot; for short.

One of Ishii&#x27;s main supporters inside the army was Colonel Chikahiko Koizumi, who later served as Japan&#x27;s Health Minister from 1941 to 1945. Koizumi had joined a secret poison gas research committee in 1915, during World War I, when he and other Imperial Japanese Army officers were impressed by the successful German use of chlorine gas at the Second Battle of Ypres, in which the Allies suffered 6,000 deaths and 15,000 wounded as a result of the chemical attack.

=== Zhongma Fortress ===
Unit Tōgō was set into motion in the Zhongma Fortress, a prison and experimentation camp in Beiyinhe, a village south of Harbin on the South Manchuria Railway. The prisoners brought to Zhongma included common criminals, captured bandits, anti-Japanese partisans, as well as political prisoners and people rounded up on false charges by the Kempeitai. Prisoners were generally well fed on a diet of rice or wheat, meat, fish, and occasionally even alcohol in order to be in normal health at the beginning of experiments. Then, over several days, prisoners were eventually drained of blood and deprived of nutrients and water. Their deteriorating health was recorded. Some were also vivisected. Others were deliberately infected with plague bacteria and other microbes. A prison break in the autumn of 1934, which jeopardized the facility&#x27;s secrecy, and an explosion in 1935 (believed to be sabotage) led Ishii to shut down Zhongma Fortress. He then received authorization to move to Pingfang, approximately south of Harbin, to set up a new, much larger facility.

=== Other units ===
In addition to the establishment of Unit 731, the decree also called for the creation of an additional biological warfare development unit, called the Kwantung Army Military Horse Epidemic Prevention Workshop (later referred to as Manchuria Unit 100), and a chemical warfare development unit called the Kwantung Army Technical Testing Department (later referred to as Manchuria Unit 516). After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, sister chemical and biological warfare units were founded in major Chinese cities and were referred to as Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Units. Detachments included Unit 1855 in Beijing, Unit Ei 1644 in Nanjing, Unit 8604 in Guangzhou, and later Unit 9420 in Singapore. All of these units comprised Ishii&#x27;s network, which, at its height in 1939, oversaw over 10,000 personnel. Medical doctors and professors from Japan were attracted to join Unit 731 both by the rare opportunity to conduct human experimentation and the Army&#x27;s strong financial backing.

== Experiments ==

The military police and the Special Services Agency were responsible for finding victims to be test subjects for the unit, while a group of physicians were responsible for maintaining healthy victims and dispatching them for experimentations. Not all individuals sent to Unit 731 underwent experiments; these experiments were reserved for healthy individuals, and once accepted into the program, the preservation of their health became a top priority.

Human experiments involved intentionally infecting captives, especially Chinese prisoners of war and civilians, with disease-causing agents and exposing them to bombs designed to disperse infectious substances upon contact with the skin. There are no records indicating any survivors from these experiments; those who didn&#x27;t die from infection were murdered for autopsy analysis. After human experimentations, researchers commonly used either potassium cyanide or chloroform to kill survivors.

According to American historian Sheldon H. Harris:
The Togo Unit employed gruesome tactics to secure specimens of select body organs. If Ishii or one of his co-workers wished to do research on the human brain, then they would order the guards to find them a useful sample. A prisoner would be taken from his cell. Guards would hold him while another guard would smash the victim&#x27;s head open with an ax. His brain would be extracted off to the pathologist, and then to the crematorium for the usual disposal.

Nakagawa Yonezo, professor emeritus at Osaka University, studied at Kyoto University during the war. While he was there, he watched footage of human experiments and executions from Unit 731. He later testified about the playfulness of the experimenters:

Some of the experiments had nothing to do with advancing the capability of germ warfare, or of medicine. There is such a thing as professional curiosity: ‘What would happen if we did such and such?’ What medical purpose was served by performing and studying beheadings? None at all. That was just playing around. Professional people, too, like to play.

Prisoners were injected with diseases, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. To study the effects of untreated venereal diseases, male and female prisoners were deliberately infected with syphilis and gonorrhea, then studied. A special project, codenamed &quot;Maruta&quot;, used human beings for experiments. Test subjects were gathered from the surrounding population and sometimes euphemistically referred to as , used in such contexts as &quot;How many logs fell?&quot; This term originated as a joke on the part of the staff because the official cover story for the facility given to local authorities was that it was a lumber mill. According to a junior uniformed civilian employee of the Imperial Japanese Army working in Unit 731, the project was internally called &quot;Holzklotz&quot;, from the German word for log. In a further parallel, the corpses of &quot;sacrificed&quot; subjects were disposed of by incineration. Researchers in Unit 731 also published some of their results in peer-reviewed journals, writing as though the research had been conducted on nonhuman primates called &quot;Manchurian monkeys&quot; or &quot;long-tailed monkeys.&quot;

At the age of 14, on the encouragement of a former school teacher, Hideo Shimizu joined the fourth group of minors assigned to Unit 731. He recalled that he was brought to a specimen room where jars of various heights, with some reaching the height of an adult, were stored. The jars held body parts from humans preserved in formalin, such as heads and hands. There was also a pregnant woman&#x27;s body with a large belly, where the lower part was exposed to reveal a fetus with hair. Shimizu discovered that the term &quot;logs&quot; was used dehumanizingly to refer to prisoners. He also learned that the prisoners were further dehumanized by being held in facilities referred to as &quot;log cabins.&quot;

=== Vivisection ===
Thousands of men, women, children, and infants interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection, often performed without anesthesia and usually lethal. In a video interview, former Unit 731 member Okawa Fukumatsu admitted to having vivisected a pregnant woman. Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body.

Prisoners had limbs amputated in order to study blood loss. Limbs removed were sometimes reattached to the opposite side of victims&#x27; bodies. Some prisoners had their stomachs surgically removed and their esophagus reattached to the intestines. Parts of organs, such as the brain, lungs, and liver, were removed from others. Imperial Japanese Army surgeon Ken Yuasa said that practising vivisection on human subjects was widespread even outside Unit 731, estimating that at least 1,000 Japanese personnel were involved in the practice in mainland China. Yuasa said that when he performed vivisections on captives, they were &quot;all for practice rather than for research,&quot; and that such practises were &quot;routine&quot; among Japanese doctors stationed in China during the war.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; interviewed a former member of Unit 731. Insisting on anonymity, the former Japanese medical assistant recounted his first experience in vivisecting a live human being, who had been deliberately infected with the plague, for the purpose of developing &quot;plague bombs&quot; for war. &quot;The fellow knew that it was over for him, and so he didn&#x27;t struggle when they led him into the room and tied him down, but when I picked up the scalpel, that&#x27;s when he began screaming. I cut him open from the chest to the stomach, and he screamed terribly, and his face was all twisted in agony. He made this unimaginable sound, he was screaming so horribly. But then finally he stopped. This was all in a day&#x27;s work for the surgeons, but it really left an impression on me because it was my first time.&quot;

Other sources provided information on usual practice in the Unit for surgeons to stuff a rag (or medical gauze) into the mouth of prisoners before commencing vivisection in order to stifle any screaming.

=== Biological warfare ===
Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100, among others) were involved in research, development and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biological weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both military and civilian) throughout World War II.

By 1939, Ishii had condensed his laboratory discoveries to six potent pathogens: anthrax, typhoid, paratyphoid, glanders, dysentery, and plague-infected human fleas. These agents were robust enough to ignite epidemics of considerable magnitude and resilient to aerial dispersal. This marked the initiation of the latter phase of Ishii&#x27;s elaborate scheme: conducting field trials through military expeditions on unsuspecting civilians, aiming to devise a method of dissemination that would efficiently spread the pathogens in optimal concentrations for maximum devastation. His experiments involved the development of biodegradable bombs housing live rats and fleas infected with diseases, designed to explode mid-air, ensuring the safe descent of the infected creatures to the ground. Additionally, he deployed birds and bird feathers contaminated with anthrax from low-flying aircraft.

Plague-infected fleas, bred in the laboratories of Unit 731 and Unit 1644, were spread by low-flying airplanes over Chinese cities, including coastal Ningbo and Changde, Hunan Province, in 1940 and 1941. These operations killed tens of thousands with bubonic plague epidemics. An expedition to Nanjing involved spreading typhoid and paratyphoid germs into the wells, marshes, and houses of the city, as well as infusing them in snacks distributed to locals. Epidemics broke out shortly after, to the elation of many researchers, who concluded that paratyphoid fever was &quot;the most effective&quot; of the pathogens.

The Library of Congress holds a set of three declassified documents from Unit 731, each more than 100 pages long, translated from Japanese to English. These documents provided comprehensive clinical records about the daily progression of various pathogens within the bodies of helpless prisoners who were experimented on by Japanese doctors.

Japanese soldiers provided testimony indicating that the research program had the capability to manufacture substantial quantities of biological agents on a monthly basis: 300 kg of plague, 500–700 kg of anthrax, 800–900 kg of typhoid, and 1000 kg of cholera. Despite the significant production volumes, even small amounts of these bacteria possessed the potential to cause severe harm and fatalities.

Ishii determined that fleas were an efficient carrier for transmitting plague, leading Unit 731 to focus on breeding significant numbers of fleas. To achieve this goal, Unit 731 had approximately 4500 flea incubators, each capable of producing at least 45 kg of fleas per cycle. The substantial quantities of plague bacteria and fleas generated, combined with the severe illness and death rates associated with plague infection, illustrate the formidable biological warfare production capabilities wielded by the Japanese. Japanese researchers had the required materials to apply the scientific method in conducting experiments involving inoculation and the creation of airborne bacterial bombs.

Food items emerged as the preferred delivery mechanism for bacterial transmission. The unit maintained a stock of uncontaminated fruits. In a specific experiment conducted by Unit 731, typhoid was introduced into melons and cantaloupes. Following the contamination process, the bacterial density was measured. Once reaching a density level, the infected fruit was distributed to a small group of prisoners, with the objective of spreading typhoid throughout the entire group.

Unit 731 conducted biological warfare field trials by attacking many Chinese civilian populations. During the period of 1940 to 1943, Japanese scientists found that using bacterial bombs for transmission wasn&#x27;t effective, but they did find success in utilizing planes to spray microorganisms as a means of biological warfare delivery. Unit 100 also deployed aerial spraying methods akin to those examined by Unit 731.

At least 12 large-scale bioweapon field trials were carried out, and at least 11 Chinese cities attacked with biological agents. An attack on Changde in 1941 reportedly led to approximately 10,000 biological casualties and 1,700 deaths among ill-prepared Japanese troops, in most cases due to cholera. Japanese researchers performed tests on prisoners with bubonic plague, cholera, smallpox, botulism, and other diseases. This research led to the development of the defoliation bacilli bomb and the flea bomb used to spread bubonic plague. Some of these bombs were designed with porcelain shells, an idea proposed by Ishii in 1938.

These bombs enabled Japanese soldiers to launch biological attacks, infecting agriculture, reservoirs, wells, as well as other areas, with anthrax- and plague-carrier fleas, typhoid, cholera, or other deadly pathogens. During biological bomb experiments, researchers dressed in protective suits would examine the dying victims. Infected food supplies and clothing were dropped by airplane into areas of China not occupied by Japanese forces. In addition, poisoned food and candy were given to unsuspecting victims. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting cholera, anthrax, and plague were estimated to have killed at least 400,000 Chinese civilians. Tularemia was also tested on Chinese civilians.

Due to pressure from numerous accounts of the biowarfare attacks, Chiang Kai-shek sent a delegation of army and foreign medical personnel in November 1941 to document evidence and treat the afflicted. A report on the Japanese use of plague-infected fleas on Changde was made widely available the following year but was not addressed by the Allied Powers until Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a public warning in 1943 condemning the attacks.

In December 1944, the Japanese Navy explored the possibility of attacking cities in California with biological weapons, known as Operation PX or Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night. The plan for the attack involved &quot;Seiran&quot; aircraft launched by Sentoku submarine aircraft carriers upon the West Coast of the United States—specifically, the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The planes would spread weaponized bubonic plague, cholera, typhus, dengue fever, and other pathogens in a biological terror attack upon the population. The submarine crews would infect themselves and run ashore in a suicide mission. Planning for Operation PX was finalized on March 26, 1945, but shelved shortly thereafter due to the strong opposition of Chief of General Staff Yoshijirō Umezu. Umezu later explained his decision as such: &quot;If bacteriological warfare is conducted, it will grow from the dimension of war between Japan and America to an endless battle of humanity against bacteria. Japan will earn the derision of the world.&quot;

=== Weapons testing ===
Human targets were used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in various positions. Flamethrowers were tested on people. Victims were also tied to stakes and used as targets to test pathogen-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, shrapnel bombs with varying amounts of fragments, and explosive bombs as well as bayonets and knives.

==== Frostbite testing ====
Army Engineer Hisato Yoshimura conducted experiments by taking captives outside, dipping various appendages into water of varying temperatures, and allowing the limb to freeze. Once frozen, Yoshimura would strike their affected limbs with a short stick, &quot;emitting a sound resembling that which a board gives when it is struck.&quot; Ice was then chipped away, with the affected area being subjected to various treatments. Military personnel of the Unit referred to Yoshimura as a &quot;scientific devil&quot; and a &quot;cold-blooded animal&quot; due to his strictness and involvement in mass killings and inhumane scientific tests, which included soaking the fingers of a three-day-old child in water containing ice and salt.

Naoji Uezono, a member of Unit 731, described in a 1980s interview a grisly scene where Yoshimura had &quot;two naked men put in an area 40–50 degrees below zero and researchers filmed the whole process until [the subjects] died. [The subjects] suffered such agony they were digging their nails into each other&#x27;s flesh.&quot; Yoshimura&#x27;s lack of remorse was evident in an article he wrote for the Japanese Journal of Physiology in 1950 in which he admitted to using 20 children and a three-day-old infant in experiments which exposed them to zero-degree-Celsius ice and salt water. Although this article drew criticism, Yoshimura denied any guilt when contacted by a reporter from the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;.

Yoshimura developed a &quot;resistance index of frostbite&quot; based on the mean temperature 5 to 30 minutes after immersion in freezing water, the temperature of the first rise after immersion, and the time until the temperature first rises after immersion. In a number of separate experiments it was then determined how these parameters depend on the time of day a victim&#x27;s body part was immersed in freezing water, the surrounding temperature and humidity during immersion, how the victim had been treated before the immersion (&quot;after keeping awake for a night&quot;, &quot;after hunger for 24 hours&quot;, &quot;after hunger for 48 hours&quot;, &quot;immediately after heavy meal&quot;, &quot;immediately after hot meal&quot;, &quot;immediately after muscular exercise&quot;, &quot;immediately after cold bath&quot;, &quot;immediately after hot bath&quot;), what type of food the victim had been fed over the five days preceding the immersions with regard to dietary nutrient intake (&quot;high protein (of animal nature)&quot;, &quot;high protein (of vegetable nature)&quot;, &quot;low protein intake&quot;, and &quot;standard diet&quot;), and salt intake (45 g NaCl per day, 15 g NaCl per day, no salt). This original data is seen in the attached figure.

==== Syphilis ====
Unit members orchestrated forced sex acts between infected and non-infected prisoners to transmit the disease, as the testimony of a prison guard on the subject of devising a method for transmission of syphilis between patients shows:

After victims were infected, they were vivisected at different stages of infection, so that internal and external organs could be observed as the disease progressed. Testimony from multiple guards blames the female victims as being hosts of the diseases, even as they were forcibly infected. Genitals of female prisoners that were infected with syphilis were called &quot;jam-filled buns&quot; by guards.

Some children grew up inside the walls of Unit 731, infected with syphilis. A Youth Corps member deployed to train at Unit 731 recalled viewing a batch of subjects that would undergo syphilis testing: &quot;one was a Chinese woman holding an infant, one was a White Russian woman with a daughter of four or five years of age, and the last was a White Russian woman with a boy of about six or seven.&quot; The children of these women were tested in ways similar to their parents, with specific emphasis on determining how longer infection periods affected the effectiveness of treatments.

==== Rape and forced pregnancy ====
Female prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments. The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture. Fetal survival and damage to mother&#x27;s reproductive organs were objects of interest. Though &quot;a large number of babies were born in captivity,&quot; there have been no accounts of any survivors of Unit 731, children included. It is suspected that the children of female prisoners were killed after birth or aborted.

While male prisoners were often used in single studies, so that the results of the experimentation on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as a guard graphically demonstrated this reality:

== Other experiments ==
In other tests, subjects were deprived of food and water to determine the amount of time until death; placed into low-pressure chambers until their eyes popped from the sockets; experimented upon to determine the relationship between temperature, burns, and human survival; hung upside down until death; crushed with heavy objects; electrocuted; dehydrated with hot fans; placed into centrifuges and spun until death; injected with animal blood, notably with horse blood; exposed to lethal doses of X-rays; subjected to various chemical weapons inside gas chambers; injected with seawater; and burned or buried alive. In addition to chemical agents, the properties of many different toxins were also investigated by the Unit. To name a few, prisoners were exposed to tetrodotoxin (pufferfish or fugu poison), heroin, Korean bindweed, bactal, and castor-oil seeds (ricin). Massive amounts of blood were drained from some prisoners in order to study the effects of blood loss according to former Unit 731 vivisectionist Okawa Fukumatsu. In one case, at least half a liter of blood was drawn at two-to-three-day intervals.

As stated above, dehydration experiments were performed on the victims. The purpose of these tests was to determine the amount of water in an individual&#x27;s body and to see how long one could survive with a very low to no water intake. It is known that victims were also starved before these tests began. The deteriorating physical states of these victims were documented by staff at a periodic interval.

Unit 731 also performed transfusion experiments with different blood types. Unit member Naeo Ikeda wrote:

Unit 731 tested many different chemical agents on prisoners and had a building dedicated to gas experiments. Some of the agents tested were mustard gas, lewisite, cyanic acid gas, white phosphorus, adamsite, and phosgene gas. A former army major and technician gave the following testimony anonymously (at the time of the interview, this man was a professor emeritus at a national university):

Takeo Wano, a former medical worker in Unit 731, said that he saw a Western man, who was vertically cut into two pieces, pickled in a jar of formaldehyde. Wano guessed that the man was Russian because there were many Russians living in the area at that time. Unit 100 also experimented with toxic gas. Phone booth-like tanks were used as portable gas chambers for the prisoners. Some were forced to wear various types of gas masks; others wore military uniforms, and some wore no clothes at all. Some of the tests have been described as &quot;psychopathically sadistic, with no conceivable military application&quot;. For example, one experiment documented the time it took for three-day-old babies to freeze to death.

Unit 731 also tested chemical weapons on prisoners in field conditions. A report authored by unknown researcher in the Kamo Unit (Unit 731) describes a large human experiment of yperite gas (mustard gas) on 7–10 September 1940. Twenty subjects were divided into three groups and placed in combat emplacements, trenches, gazebos, and observatories. One group was clothed with Chinese underwear, no hat, and no mask and was subjected to as much as 1,800 field gun rounds of yperite gas over 25 minutes. Another group was clothed in summer military uniform and shoes; three had masks and another three had no mask. They also were exposed to as much as 1,800 rounds of yperite gas. A third group was clothed in summer military uniform, three with masks and two without masks, and were exposed to as much as 4,800 rounds. Then their general symptoms and damage to skin, eye, respiratory organs, and digestive organs were observed at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 2, 3, and 5 days after the shots. Injecting the blister fluid from one subject into another subject and analyses of blood and soil were also performed. Five subjects were forced to drink a solution of yperite and lewisite gas in water, with or without decontamination. The report describes conditions of every subject precisely without mentioning what happened to them in the long run. The following is an excerpt of one of these reports:

==Prisoners and victims==
After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the Japanese murdered every single prisoner in the unit. The remains were then buried in the Unit 731 grounds after being cremated. The following testimony explains how the captives were murdered:

On August 11 and 12, after the end of the war, approximately 300 prisoners were disposed of. The prisoners were coerced into suicide by being given a piece of rope. One quarter of them hung themselves, and the remaining three quarters who would not consent to suicide were made to drink potassium cyanide and killed by injection. In the end all were taken care of. The prisoners were made to drink potassium cyanide by mixing it with water and putting it into bowls. The injections were most likely chloroform.

In 2002, Changde, China, site of the plague flea bombing, held an &quot;International Symposium on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare,&quot; which estimated that the number of people slaughtered by the Imperial Japanese Army germ warfare and other human experiments was around 580,000. The American historian Sheldon H. Harris states that over 200,000 died. In addition to Chinese casualties, 1,700 Japanese troops in Zhejiang during Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign were killed by their own biological weapons while attempting to unleash the biological agent, indicating serious issues with distribution. Harris also said plague-infected animals were released near the end of the war, and caused plague outbreaks that killed at least 30,000 people in the Harbin area from 1946 to 1948.

Some test subjects were selected to gather a wide cross-section of the population and included common criminals, captured bandits, anti-Japanese partisans, political prisoners, homeless and mentally disabled people, which included infants, men, the elderly and pregnant women, as well as those rounded up by the &quot;Kenpeitai&quot; military police for alleged &quot;suspicious activities.&quot; Unit 731 staff included approximately 300 researchers, including doctors and bacteriologists.

At least 3,000 men, women, and children—of which at least 600 every year were provided by the &quot;Kenpeitai&quot;—were subjected to Unit 731 experimentation conducted at the Pingfang camp alone, not including victims from other medical experimentation sites such as Unit 100. Although 3,000 internal victims is the widely accepted figure in the literature, former Unit member Okawa Fukumatsu claims that there were at least 10,000 victims of internal experiments at the Unit, he himself vivisecting thousands.

According to A. S. Wells, the majority of victims were Chinese, with a lesser percentage being Russian, Mongolian, and Korean. They may also have included a small number of European, American, Indian, Australian, and New Zealander prisoners of war (see also Allied prisoners of war in Japan). A member of the Yokusan Sonendan paramilitary political youth branch, who worked for Unit 731, stated that not only were Chinese, Russians, and Koreans present, but also Americans, British, and French people. Sheldon H. Harris documented that the victims were generally political dissidents, communist sympathizers, ordinary criminals, impoverished civilians, and the mentally disabled. Author Seiichi Morimura estimates that almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese (both military and civilian), while close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian.

No one who entered Unit 731 came out alive. Prisoners were usually received into Unit 731 at night in motor vehicles painted black with a ventilation hole but no windows. The vehicle would pull up at the main gates and one of the drivers would go to the guardroom and report to the guard. That guard would then telephone to the &quot;Special Team&quot; in the inner-prison (Shiro Ishii&#x27;s brother was head of this Special Team). Then, the prisoners would be transported through a secret tunnel dug under the facade of the central building to the inner-prisons. One of the prisons housed women and children (Building 8), while the other prison housed men (Building 7). Once at the inner-prison, technicians would take samples of the prisoners&#x27; blood and stool, test their kidney function, and collect other physical data. Once deemed healthy and fit for experimentation, prisoners lost their names and were given a three-digit number, which they retained until their death. Whenever prisoners died after the experiments they had been subjected to, a clerk of the 1st Division struck their numbers off an index card and took the deceased prisoner&#x27;s manacles to be put on new arrivals to the prison.

There is at least one recorded instance of &quot;friendly&quot; social interaction between prisoners and Unit 731 staff. Technician Naokata Ishibashi interacted with two female prisoners, a 21-year-old Chinese woman and a 19-year-old Ukrainian woman. The two prisoners told Ishibashi that they had not seen their faces in a mirror since being captured and begged him to get one. Ishibashi snuck a mirror to them through a hole in the cell door.

The prison cells had wooden floors and a squat toilet in each. There was space between the outer walls of the cells and the outer walls of the prison, enabling the guards to walk behind the cells. Each cell door had a small window in it. Chief of the Personnel Division of the Kwantung Army Headquarters Tamura Tadashi testified that, when he was shown the inner-prison, he looked into the cells and saw living people in chains, some moved around, others were lying on the bare floor and were in a very sick and helpless condition. Former Unit 731 Youth Corps member Yoshio Shinozuka testified that the windows in these prison doors were so small that it was difficult to see in. The inner-prison was a highly secured building complete with cast iron doors. No one could enter without special permits and an ID pass with a photograph, and the entry/exit times were recorded. The &quot;special team&quot; worked in these two inner-prison buildings. This team wore white overall suits, army hats, rubber boots, and pistols strapped to their sides.

===Escape attempt===
Despite the prison&#x27;s status as a highly secure building, at least one unsuccessful escape attempt did occur. Corporal Kikuchi Norimitsu testified that he was told by another unit member that a prisoner &quot;had shown violence and had struck the experimenter with a door handle&quot; and then &quot;jumped out of the cell and ran down the corridor, seized the keys and opened the iron doors and some of the cells. Some of the prisoners managed to jump out but these were only the bold ones. These bold ones were shot.&quot;

Seiichi Morimura in his book &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Feast&quot; went into some greater detail regarding this escape attempt. Two Russian male prisoners were in a cell with handcuffs on, one of them lay flat on the floor pretending to be sick. This got the attention of a staff member who saw it as an unusual condition. That staff member decided to enter the cell. The Russian lying on the floor suddenly sprang up and knocked the guard down. The two Russians opened their handcuffs, took the keys, and opened some other cells while yelling. Some prisoners, including Russian and Chinese, were frantically roaming the corridors and kept yelling and shouting. One Russian shouted to the members of Unit 731, demanding to be shot rather than used as an experimental object. This Russian was shot to death. One staff member, who was an eyewitness at this escape attempt, recalled: &quot;spiritually we were all lost in front of the &#x27;marutas&#x27; who had no freedom and no weapons. At that time we understood in our hearts that justice was not on our side.&quot;

Unfortunately for the prisoners of Unit 731, escape was an impossibility. Even if they had managed to escape the quadrangle (itself a heavily fortified building full of staff), they would have had to get over a brick wall surrounding the complex, and then across a dry moat filled with electrified wire running around the perimeter of the complex.

===Experiments on staff members===
Members of Unit 731 were not immune from being subjects of experiments. Yoshio Tamura, an assistant in the Special Team, recalled that Yoshio Sudō, an employee of the first division at Unit 731, became infected with bubonic plague as a result of the production of it. The Special Team was then ordered to vivisect Sudō. Tamura recalled:

Additionally, Unit 731 Youth Corps member Yoshio Shinozuka testified that his friend junior assistant Mitsuo Hirakawa was vivisected as a result of being accidentally infected with plague.

== Known unit members ==


There are unit members who were known to be interned at the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre and Taiyuan War Criminals Management Centre after the war, who then went on to be repatriated to Japan and founded the Association of Returnees from China and testified about Unit 731 and the crimes perpetrated there.

Some members included:
* Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda
* Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni
* Yoshio Shinozuka
* Yasuji Kaneko
* Tadayuki Furumi
* Shigeru Fujita
* Ken Yuasa

In April 2018, the National Archives of Japan disclosed a nearly complete list of 3,607 members of Unit 731 to Katsuo Nishiyama, a professor at Shiga University of Medical Science. Nishiyama reportedly intended to publish the list online to encourage further study into the unit.

Previously disclosed members included:

* Lieutenant General Shirō Ishii
* Lieutenant Colonel Ryôichi Naitô, founder of Japan&#x27;s first commercial blood bank, the pharmaceutical company Green Cross
* Professor, Major General Masaji Kitano, commander, 1942–1945
* Yoshio Shinozuka
* Yasuji Kaneko
* Kazuhisa Kanazawa, chief of the 1st Division of Branch 673 of Unit 731
* Ryôichirô Hotta, member of the Hailar Branch of Unit 731
* Shigeo Ozeki, civilian employee
* Kioyashi Mineoi, civilian employee
* Masateru Saitô, civilian employee
* Major General Hitoshi Kikuchi, head of Research Division, 1942–1945
* Lieutenant General Yasazaka, doctor
* Yoshio Furuichi, student at Sunyu Branch of Unit 731

Twelve members were formally tried and sentenced in the Khabarovsk war crimes trials:

== Divisions ==
Unit 731 was divided into eight divisions:
* Division 1: research on bubonic plague, cholera, anthrax, typhoid, and tuberculosis using live human subjects; for this purpose, a prison was constructed to contain around three to four hundred people
* Division 2: research for biological weapons used in the field, in particular the production of devices to spread germs and parasites
* Division 3: production of shells containing biological agents; stationed in Harbin
* Division 4: bacteria mass-production and storage
* Division 5: training of personnel
* Divisions 6–8: equipment, medical, and administrative units

== Facilities ==


Unit 731 had other units underneath it in the chain of command; there were several other units under the auspice of Japan&#x27;s biological weapons programs. Most or all Units had branch offices, which were also often referred to as &quot;Units.&quot; The term Unit 731 can refer to the Harbin complex, or it can refer to the organization and its branches, sub-Units and their branches.

The Unit 731 complex covered and consisted of more than 150 buildings. The design of the facilities made them hard to destroy by bombing. The complex contained various factories. It had around 4,500 containers to be used to raise fleas, six cauldrons to produce various chemicals, and around 1,800 containers to produce biological agents. Approximately of bubonic plague bacteria could be produced in a few days. Some of Unit 731&#x27;s satellite (branch) facilities are still in use by various Chinese industrial companies. A portion has been preserved and is open to visitors as a museum.

=== Branches ===
Unit 731 had branches in Linkou (Branch 162), Mudanjiang, Hailin (Branch 643), Sunwu (Branch 673) and Hailar (Branch 543).

=== Tokyo ===
A medical school and research facility belonging to Unit 731 operated in the Shinjuku District of Tokyo during World War II. In 2006, Toyo Ishii—a nurse who worked at the school during the war—revealed that she had helped bury bodies and pieces of bodies on the school&#x27;s grounds shortly after Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945. In response, in February 2011 the Ministry of Health began to excavate the site.

While Tokyo courts acknowledged in 2002 that Unit 731 has been involved in biological warfare research, the Japanese government had made no official acknowledgment of the atrocities committed against test subjects and rejected the Chinese government&#x27;s requests for DNA samples to identify human remains (including skulls and bones) found near an army medical school.

== Surrender and immunity ==

=== Destruction of evidence ===
As the Second World War started to come to an end, all prisoners within the compound were killed to conceal evidence, and there were no documented survivors. With the coming of the Red Army in August 1945, the unit had to abandon their work in haste. Ministries in Tokyo ordered the destruction of all incriminating materials, including those in Pingfang. Potential witnesses, such as the 300 remaining prisoners, were either gassed or fed poison while the 600 Chinese and Manchurian laborers were shot. Ishii ordered every member of the group to disappear and &quot;take the secret to the grave.&quot; Potassium cyanide vials were issued for use in case the remaining personnel were captured. Skeleton crews of Ishii&#x27;s Japanese troops blew up the compound in the final days of the war to destroy evidence of their activities, but many were sturdy enough to remain somewhat intact.

Former Unit 731 member Hideo Shimizu stated that during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria he was instructed to eliminate evidence by burning the victims in the courtyard, collecting the leftover bones from the area, and then destroying the remains with explosives. While boarding a departing train, he was provided with a cyanide compound and instructed to commit suicide instead of being captured.

===American grant of immunity===
Among the individuals in Japan after its 1945 surrender was Lieutenant Colonel Murray Sanders, who arrived in Yokohama via the American ship &quot;Sturgess&quot; in September 1945. Sanders was a highly regarded microbiologist and a member of America&#x27;s military center for biological weapons. Sanders&#x27; duty was to investigate Japanese biological warfare activity. At the time of his arrival in Japan, he had no knowledge of what Unit 731 was. Until Sanders finally threatened the Japanese with bringing the Soviets into the picture, little information about biological warfare was being shared with the Americans. The Japanese wanted to avoid prosecution under the Soviet legal system, so, the morning after he made his threat, Sanders received a manuscript describing Japan&#x27;s involvement in biological warfare. 

Sanders took this information to General Douglas MacArthur, who was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and responsible for rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupations. MacArthur struck a deal with Japanese informants: he secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing exclusive American access to their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation. American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail. The Americans believed that the research data was valuable and did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons.

The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal heard only one reference to Japanese experiments with &quot;poisonous serums&quot; on Chinese civilians. This took place in August 1946 and was instigated by Joseph R Massey, assistant to the Chinese prosecutor. The Japanese defense counsel argued that the claim was vague and uncorroborated and it was dismissed by the tribunal president, Sir William Webb, for lack of evidence. The subject was not pursued further by Massey, who was probably unaware of Unit 731&#x27;s activities. His reference to it at the trial is believed to have been accidental. Later in 1981, one of the last surviving members of the Tokyo Tribunal, Judge Röling, had expressed bitterness in not being made aware of the suppression of evidence of Unit 731 and wrote, &quot;It is a bitter experience for me to be informed now that centrally ordered Japanese war criminality of the most disgusting kind was kept secret from the court by the U.S. government.&quot;

American investigations into Japanese war crimes ceased when Japanese scientists began disclosing information on biological warfare. Despite the establishment of their own research program, American scientists faced a significant gap in essential knowledge regarding biological warfare. The potential value to the Americans of Japanese-provided data, encompassing human research subjects, delivery system theories, and successful field trials, was immense. However, historian Sheldon H. Harris concluded that the Japanese data failed to meet American standards, suggesting instead that the findings from the unit were of minor importance at best. Harris characterized the research results from the Japanese camp as disappointing, concurring with the assessment of Murray Sanders, who characterized the experiments as &quot;crude&quot; and &quot;ineffective.&quot;

While German physicians were brought to trial and had their crimes publicized, the U.S. concealed information about Japanese biological warfare experiments and secured immunity for the perpetrators. Critics have argued that racism led to the double standard in the American postwar responses to the experiments conducted on different nationalities. Whereas the perpetrators of Unit 731 were exempt from prosecution, the U.S. held a tribunal in Yokohama in 1948 that indicted nine Japanese physician professors and medical students for conducting vivisection upon captured American pilots; two professors were sentenced to death and others to 15–20 years&#x27; imprisonment.

=== Separate Soviet trials ===
Although publicly silent on the issue at the Tokyo Trials, the Soviet Union pursued the case and prosecuted 12 top military leaders and scientists from Unit 731 and its affiliated biological-war prisons Unit 1644 in Nanjing and Unit 100 in Changchun in the Khabarovsk war crimes trials. Among those accused of war crimes, including germ warfare, was General Otozō Yamada, commander-in-chief of the million-man Kwantung Army occupying Manchuria.

The trial of the Japanese perpetrators was held in Khabarovsk in December 1949; a lengthy partial transcript of trial proceedings was published in different languages the following year by the Moscow foreign languages press, including an English-language edition. The lead prosecuting attorney at the Khabarovsk trial was Lev Smirnov, who had been one of the top Soviet prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trials. The Japanese doctors and army commanders who had perpetrated the Unit 731 experiments received sentences from the Khabarovsk court ranging from 2 to 25 years in a Siberian labor camp. The United States refused to acknowledge the trials, branding them communist propaganda. The sentences doled out to the Japanese perpetrators were unusually lenient by Soviet standards, and all but two of the defendants returned to Japan by the 1950s (with one prisoner dying in prison and the other committing suicide inside his cell).

In addition to the accusations of propaganda, the US also asserted that the trials were to only serve as a distraction from the Soviet treatment of several hundred thousand Japanese prisoners of war; meanwhile, the USSR asserted that the US had given the Japanese diplomatic leniency in exchange for information about their human experimentation. However, former Unit 731 members had also passed information about their biological experimentation to the Soviet government in exchange for judicial leniency. The Soviet Union built a biological weapons facility in Sverdlovsk using documentation captured from Unit 731 in Manchuria.

=== Official silence during the American occupation of Japan ===
As above, during the United States occupation of Japan, the members of Unit 731 and the members of other experimental units were allowed to go free. On 6 May 1947, Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, wrote to Washington in order to inform it that &quot;additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii, can probably be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as war crimes evidence&quot;.

According to an investigation by The Guardian, after the end of the war, under the pretense of vaccine development, former members of Unit 731 conducted human experiments on Japanese prisoners, babies and mental patients, with secret funding from the U.S. Government. One graduate of Unit 1644, Masami Kitaoka, continued to perform experiments on unwilling Japanese subjects from 1947 to 1956. He performed his experiments while he was working for Japan&#x27;s National Institute of Health Sciences. He infected prisoners with rickettsia and infected mentally-ill patients with typhus. As the chief of the unit, Shiro Ishii was granted immunity from prosecution for war crimes by the American occupation authorities, because he had provided human experimentation research materials to them. From 1948 to 1958, less than five percent of the documents were transferred onto microfilm and stored in the US National Archives before they were shipped back to Japan.

=== Post-occupation Japanese media coverage and debate ===
Japanese discussions of Unit 731&#x27;s activity began in the 1950s, after the end of the American occupation of Japan. In 1952, an infant girl at Nagoya City Pediatric Hospital died after being infected with &quot;E coli&quot; bacteria; the incident was publicly tied to former Unit 731 scientists. Later in that decade, journalists suspected that the murders attributed by the government to Sadamichi Hirasawa were actually carried out by members of Unit 731. In 1958, Japanese author Shūsaku Endō published the book &quot;The Sea and Poison&quot; about human experimentation in Fukuoka, which is thought to have been based on a real incident.

In 1950, former members of Unit 731 including Masaji Kitano founded the blood bank and pharmaceutical company Green Cross, for which Murray Sanders also served as a consultant. The company became the target of a scandal in the 1980s after up to 3,000 Japanese contracted HIV through the distribution and use of its blood products, which the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency had deemed unsafe.

The author Seiichi Morimura published &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Gluttony&quot; (悪魔の飽食) in 1981, followed by &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Gluttony: A Sequel&quot; in 1983. These books purported to reveal the &quot;true&quot; operations of Unit 731, but falsely attributed unrelated photos to the Unit, which raised questions about their accuracy. Also in 1981, the first direct testimony of human vivisection in China was given by Ken Yuasa. Since then, much more in depth testimony has been given in Japan. The 2001 documentary &quot;Japanese Devils&quot; largely consists of interviews with fourteen Unit 731 staff members taken prisoner by China and later released. Prince Mikasa, who was the younger brother of Hirohito, toured the Unit 731 headquarters in China, and wrote in his memoir that he watched films showing how Chinese prisoners were &quot;made to march on the plains of Manchuria for poison gas experiments on humans.&quot; Hideki Tojo, who later became Prime Minister in 1941, was also shown films of the experiments, which he described as &quot;unpleasant.&quot;

=== Significance in postwar research on bio-warfare and medicine ===
Despite conducting scientific experiments, Unit 731 faced scrutiny regarding the usefulness of the data produced from these experiments. Japanese biological warfare operations were by far the largest during WWII, and &quot;possibly with more people and resources than the BW producing nations of France&quot;,&quot; Hungary&quot;,&quot; Italy&quot;,&quot; Poland&quot;,&quot; and the Soviet Union combined, between the world wars. Despite the apparent success, Unit 731 lacked adequate scientific and engineering foundations to further maximize its effectiveness. Harris concluded that US scientists generally wanted to acquire it due to the concept of forbidden fruit, believing that lawful and ethical prohibitions could affect the outcomes of their research.

Historian Till Winfried Bärnighausen criticized the overall lack of scientific rigor in many of Unit 731&#x27;s experiments, but he noted some exceptions. He pointed to the mustard gas, freezing, and tuberculosis experiments as having a reliable and valid data collection process, suggesting they were conducted with greater rigor.

In 1969, Ikeda Naeo, a physician associated with Unit 731, published his own research on epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF). His paper documented experiments conducted at a military hospital on the China-Soviet border in January 1942. These experiments, involving infections on humans, confirmed the transmission of EHF by lice and fleas to local populations, resulting in deaths among those infected. Despite the explicit admission of conducting experiments on humans with fatal pathogenic inoculations, Ikeda&#x27;s report passed peer review and was published in a Japanese scholarly journal. The acceptance of this research by Ikeda underscored the widespread acknowledgment within the Japanese medical community of the human experiments conducted at Unit 731.

During the war, Yoshimura Hisato conducted research at Unit 731 in China focusing on low-temperature physiology, particularly studying the mechanisms involved in frostbite. Following the war, he established the Japanese Society of Biometeorology. His research in China marked the inception of his exploration into the relationship between physiology and environmental stress.

Most researchers at Unit 731 did not engage in a concerted effort to conceal the experiments they participated in. While they refrained from publicly acknowledging their crimes, they did share various details within their medical circles. Consequently, especially regarding research on EHF and frostbite, it has been relatively straightforward to ascertain who conducted which type of human experiments. Given that nearly all members of the Japanese medical community were aware of the human experiments conducted at Unit 731, researchers from the Unit were able to later publish their work in medical papers. Even after the war, reports were disseminated unmistakably detailing the results of experiments on humans, and accounts of the Unit were documented in medical journals. This indicates widespread awareness within the Japanese medical community regarding the experiments carried out at Unit 731.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some scientists called for experimental data from Unit 731 to be publicly released to the international medical community because the data available on human-pathogen interactions could have helped epidemiologists with pandemic control. The information has been withheld by both the US and Japanese government.

=== Official government response in Japan ===
In 1983, the Japanese Ministry of Education asked Japanese historian Saburō Ienaga to remove a reference from one of his textbooks that stated Unit 731 conducted experiments on thousands of Chinese. The ministry alleged that no academic research supported the claim. In 1984, Japanese historian Tsuneishi Keiichi translated and published over 4,000 pages of U.S. documents on Japanese biological warfare. The ministry backed down after new studies were published in Japan and important evidence surfaced in the United States.

Japanese history textbooks usually contain references to Unit 731, but the textbooks do not provide specific details about the activities conducted at the facility. Saburō Ienaga&#x27;s &quot;New History of Japan&quot; included a detailed description, based on officers&#x27; testimony. The Ministry for Education attempted to remove this passage from his textbook before it was taught in public schools, on the basis that the testimony was insufficient. The Supreme Court of Japan ruled in 1997 that the testimony was indeed sufficient and that requiring it to be removed was an illegal violation of freedom of speech.

In 1997, international lawyer Kōnen Tsuchiya filed a class action suit against the Japanese government, demanding reparations for the actions of Unit 731, using evidence filed by Professor Makoto Ueda of Rikkyo University. All levels of the Japanese court system found the suit baseless. No findings of fact were made about the existence of human experimentation. In August 2002, the Tokyo district court ruled for the first time that Japan had engaged in biological warfare. Presiding judge Koji Iwata ruled that Unit 731, on the orders of the Imperial Japanese Army headquarters, used bacteriological weapons on Chinese civilians between 1940 and 1942, spreading diseases, including plague and typhoid, in the cities of Quzhou, Ningbo, and Changde. He rejected victims&#x27; compensation claims on the grounds that they had already been settled by international peace treaties.

In October 2003, a member of Japan&#x27;s House of Representatives filed an inquiry. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi responded that the Japanese government did not then possess any records related to Unit 731, but recognized the gravity of the matter and would publicize any records located in the future. In April 2018, the National Archives of Japan released the names of 3,607 members of Unit 731, in response to a request by Professor Katsuo Nishiyama of the Shiga University of Medical Science.

=== Abroad ===
After World War II, the Office of Special Investigations created a watchlist of suspected Axis collaborators and persecutors who are banned from entering the United States. While they have added over 60,000 names to the watchlist, they have only been able to identify under 100 Japanese participants. In a 1998 correspondence letter between the DOJ and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Eli Rosenbaum, director of OSI, stated that this was due to two factors:

# While most documents captured by the US in Europe were microfilmed before being returned to their respective governments, the Department of Defense decided to not microfilm its vast collection of documents before returning them to the Japanese government.
# The Japanese government has also failed to grant the OSI meaningful access to these and related records after the war, while European countries, on the other hand, have been largely cooperative, the cumulative effect of which is that information pertaining to identifying these individuals is, in effect, impossible to recover.

<doc id="214663" wikidata="Q420783" url="?curid=214663" title="Polyphosphate">
<text>A polyphosphate is a salt or ester of polymeric oxyanions formed from tetrahedral PO4 (phosphate) structural units linked together by sharing oxygen atoms. Polyphosphates can adopt linear or a cyclic (also called, ring) structures. In biology, the polyphosphate esters ADP and ATP are involved in energy storage. A variety of polyphosphates find application in mineral sequestration in municipal waters, generally being present at 1 to 5 ppm. GTP, CTP, and UTP are also nucleotides important in the protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, respectively.

Polyphosphates are also used as food additives, marked E452.

== Structure==

The structure of tripolyphosphoric acid illustrates the principles which define the structures of polyphosphates. It consists of three tetrahedral PO4 units linked together by sharing oxygen centres. For the linear chains, the end phosphorus groups share one oxide and the others phosphorus centres share two oxide centres. The corresponding phosphates are related to the acids by loss of the acidic protons. In the case of the cyclic trimer each tetrahedron shares two vertices with adjacent tetrahedra.

Sharing of three corners is possible. This motif represents crosslinking of the linear polymer. Crosslinked polyphosphates adopt the sheet-structure Phyllosilicates, but such structures occur only under extreme conditions.

==Formation and synthesis==
Polyphosphates arise by polymerization of phosphoric acid derivatives. The process begins with two phosphate units coming together in a condensation reaction. 
:2 H(PO4)2− (P2O7)4− + H2O
The condensation is shown as an equilibrium because the reverse reaction, hydrolysis, is also possible. The process may continue in steps; at each step another (PO3)− unit is added to the chain, as indicated by the part in brackets in the illustration of polyphosphoric acid. P4O10 can be seen as the end product of condensation reactions, where each tetrahedron shares three corners with the others. Conversely, a complex mix of polymers is produced when a small amount of water is added to phosphorus pentoxide.

== Acid-base and complexation properties ==
Polyphosphates are weak bases. A lone pair of electrons on an oxygen atom can be donated to a hydrogen ion (proton) or a metal ion in a typical Lewis acid-Lewis base interaction. This has profound significance in biology. For instance, adenosine triphosphate is about 25% protonated in aqueous solution at pH 7. 
:ATP4− + H+ ATPH3−, p&quot;K&quot;a formula_1 6.6
Further protonation occurs at lower pH values.

== The &quot;high energy&quot; phosphate bond ==
ATP forms chelate complexes with metal ions. The stability constant for the equilibrium
:ATP4− + Mg2+ MgATP2−, log β formula_1 4
is particularly large. The formation of the magnesium complex is a critical element in the process of ATP hydrolysis, as it weakens the link between the terminal phosphate group and the rest of the molecule.

The energy released in ATP hydrolysis,
:ATP4− + H2O → ADP3− + Pi−
at ΔG formula_1 -36.8 kJ mol−1 is large by biological standards. Pi stands for inorganic phosphate, which is protonated at biological pH. However, it is not large by inorganic standards. The term &quot;high energy&quot; refers to the fact that it is high relative to the amount of energy released in the organic chemical reactions that can occur in living systems.

==High-polymeric inorganic polyphosphates==
High molecular weight polyphosphates are well known. One derivative is the glassy (i.e., amorphous) Graham&#x27;s salt. Crystalline high molecular weight polyphosphates include Kurrol’s salt and Maddrell’s salt (white powder practically insoluble in water). These species have the formula [NaPO3]n[NaPO3(OH)]2 where n can be as great as 2000. In terms of their structures, these polymers consist of PO3− &quot;monomers&quot;, with the chains are terminated by protonated phosphates.

===In nature===
High-polymeric inorganic polyphosphates were found in living organisms by L. Liberman in 1890. These compounds are linear polymers containing a few to several hundred residues of orthophosphate linked by energy-rich phosphoanhydride bonds.

Previously, it was considered either as “molecular fossil” or as only a phosphorus and energy source providing the survival of microorganisms under extreme conditions. These compounds are now known to also have regulatory roles, and to occur in representatives of all kingdoms of living organisms, participating in metabolic correction and control on both genetic and enzymatic levels. Polyphosphate is directly involved in the switching-over of the genetic program characteristic of the exponential growth stage of bacteria to the program of cell survival under stationary conditions, &quot;a life in the slow lane&quot;. They participate in many regulatory mechanisms occurring in bacteria: 
*They participate in the induction of rpoS, an RNA-polymerase subunit which is responsible for the expression of a large group of genes involved in adjustments to the stationary growth phase and many stressful agents.
*They are important for cell motility, biofilms formation and virulence.
*Polyphosphates and exopolyphosphatases participate in the regulation of the levels of the stringent response factor, guanosine 5&#x27;-diphosphate 3&#x27;-diphosphate (ppGpp), a second messenger in bacterial cells.
*Polyphosphates participate in the formation of channels across the living cell membranes. The above channels formed by polyphosphate and poly-b-hydroxybutyrate with Ca2+ are involved in the transport processes in a variety of organisms.
*An important function of polyphosphate in microorganisms—prokaryotes and the lower eukaryotes—is to handle changing environmental conditions by providing phosphate and energy reserves. Polyphosphates are present in animal cells, and there are many data on its participation in the regulatory processes during development and cellular proliferation and differentiation—especially in bone tissues and brain.

In humans polyphosphates are shown to play a key role in blood coagulation. Produced and released by platelets they activate blood coagulation factor XII which is essential for blood clot formation. Factor XII, also called Hageman factor, initiates fibrin formation and the generation of a proinflammatory mediator, bradykinin, that contributes to leakage from the blood vessels and thrombosis.
Bacterial-derived polyphosphates impair the host immune response during infection and targeting polyphosphates with recombinant exopolyphosphatase improves sepsis survival in mice.
Inorganic polyphosphates play a crucial role in tolerance of yeast cells to toxic heavy metal cations.

==Use as food additives==
Sodium polyphosphate (E452(i)), potassium polyphosphate (E452(ii)), sodium calcium polyphosphate (E452(iii)) and calcium polyphosphate (E452(iv)) are used as food additives (emulsifiers, humectants, sequestrants, stabilisers, and thickeners). They are not known to pose any potential health risk other than those generally attributed to other phosphate sources (including those naturally occurring in food). While concerns have been raised regarding detrimental effects on the bones and cardiovascular diseases, as well as hyperphosphatemia, these seem to be relevant only for exaggerated consumption of phosphate sources. In all, reasonable consumption (up to 40 mg phosphate per kg of body weight per day) seems to pose no health risk.

These categories are not exhaustive. A music platform, Gracenote, listed more than 2000 music genres (included by those created by ordinary music lovers, who are not involved within the music industry, these being said to be part of a &#x27;folksonomy&#x27;, i.e. a taxonomy created by non-experts). Most of these genres were created by music labels to target new audiences, however classification is useful to find music and distribute it.

<text>The governor of Minnesota is the head of government of the U.S. state of Minnesota. The governor is the head of the executive branch of Minnesota&#x27;s state government and is charged with enforcing state laws.

There have been 41 governors of the state; one, Rudy Perpich, served non-consecutive terms. Minnesota Territory had three governors appointed by the president of the United States; the first, Alexander Ramsey, would later be state governor.

The current governor is Tim Walz, a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, who took office on January 7, 2019.

<text>Stygimys is an extinct mammal genus from the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene of North America. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta, family Eucosmodontidae.

The genus &quot;Stygimys&quot; (&quot;Styx mouse&quot;) was named by R.E. Sloan and Leigh Van Valen in 1965. The name comes from the Styx (river of hell) from Greek mythology. The genus has also been known as &quot;Catopsalis&quot; (partly); &quot;Cimexomys&quot; (partly); &quot;Eucosmodon&quot; (partly); and &quot;Parectypodus&quot; (partly). Some skull material is known, but not much.

== Species ==
The species &quot;Stygimys camptorhiza&quot; was named by P.A. Johnston and R.C. Fox in 1984.
Place: Puercan (Paleocene)-age strata of Rav W-1 in Saskatchewan, Canada. The holotype for this species is in the University of Alberta collection.

The species &quot;Stygimys cupressus&quot; was named by R.C. Fox in 1989. Remains are known from the Puercan (Paleocene)-age strata of the Long Fall Horizon of Canada.

The species &quot;Stygimys jepseni&quot; was named by George Gaylord Simpson in 1935 and Sloan and Van Valen in 1965. It is also known as &quot;Eucosmodon sparsus&quot; (Simpson 1937a); &quot;E. jepseni&quot;; and &quot;Parectypodus jepseni&quot; (Simpson 1935d). Remains are known from the Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age strata of Montana (USA). This species has been cited as a descendant of &quot;S. kuszmauli&quot;. The animal weighed about 90 g.

The species &quot;Stygimys kuszmauli&quot; was named by R.E. Sloan and Leigh Van Valen in 1965. It has also been known as &quot;Catopsalis foliates&quot; (Cope 1882); &quot;Cimexomys gratus&quot; (Jepsen GL, 1930); &quot;Eucosmodon gratus&quot; (G.L. Jepson 1930); &quot;Eucosmodon kuszmauli &quot;; and &quot;Stygimys gratus&quot;. Remains were found in Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) - Puercan (Paleocene)-age strata of the Polecat Bench Formation of Wyoming and the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Some scraps of jaw are known. This species is the most basal member of the genus, with a weight of 300 g.

The species &quot;Stygimys teilhardi&quot; was named by W. Granger &amp; George Gaylord Simpson in 1929 and R.E. Sloan and Leigh Van Valen in 1965. It has also been known as &quot;Eucosmodon teilhardi&quot; (Granger W. &amp; Simpson G.G. 1929). Remains are known from the Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age strata of the San Juan Basin of New Mexico.

<text>Dennis O&#x27;Keefe (born Edward Vance Flanagan; March 29, 1908 – August 31, 1968) was an American actor and screenwriter.

==Early years==
O&#x27;Keefe was born in Fort Madison, Iowa, as Edward Vance Flanagan, the son of Edward J. Flanagan and Charlotte Flanagan ( Ravenscroft), both vaudevillians of Irish descent. As a small child, he joined his parents&#x27; act and later wrote skits for the stage. He attended the University of Southern California but left midway through his sophomore year after his father died.

== Career ==
O&#x27;Keefe continued his father&#x27;s vaudeville act for several years after the father&#x27;s death. He started in films as an extra in 1931 and appeared in numerous films under the name Bud Flanagan. After his role in &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937), Clark Gable recommended O&#x27;Keefe to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which signed him to a contract in 1937 and renamed him Dennis O&#x27;Keefe. 

His film roles were bigger after that, starting with &quot;The Bad Man of Brimstone&quot; (1938) opposite Wallace Beery, and the lead role in &quot;Burn &#x27;Em Up O&#x27;Connor&quot; (1939). He left MGM around 1940 but continued to work in mostly low-budget productions. He often played the tough guy in action and crime dramas, but was known as a comic actor as well as a dramatic lead. He gained great attention with a showy role in &quot;The Story of Dr Wassell&quot; and became a comedy star. He expressed interest in expanding into direction. In the mid-1940s, he was under a five-year contract to Edward Small. O&#x27;Keefe starred in film-noir classics such as &quot;T-Men&quot; and &quot;Raw Deal&quot;, both directed by Anthony Mann. In a 1946 newsreel following Howard Hughes&#x27; calamitous plane wreck into a neighbor&#x27;s Beverly Hills house, O&#x27;Keefe can be seen walking through the home inspecting the damage.

In 1950, O&#x27;Keefe starred in the radio program &quot;T-Man&quot; on CBS. Also in the 1950s, he did some directing and wrote mystery stories. During the 1950s, O&#x27;Keefe made guest appearances as himself, or in acting roles, on episodes of a number of television series, such as &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;The Ford Show&quot;, &quot;Studio 57&quot;, and &quot;Climax!&quot;. In 1957, he was to be the permanent host of &quot;Suspicion&quot;, an anthology TV series in which 10 episodes were produced by Alfred Hitchcock. After two episodes, he left the series and was not replaced. From 1959 to 1960, he was the star of &quot;The Dennis O&#x27;Keefe Show&quot;.

His Broadway credits include &quot;Never Live Over a Pretzel Factory&quot; (1964) and &quot;Never Too Late&quot;.

O&#x27;Keefe wrote screenplays under the pen name Jonathan Rix in the late 1940s and 1950s, and then as Al Everett Dennis in the 1960s. His &quot;Don&#x27;t Pull Your Punches&quot; was produced by Warner Bros. In 1947, he was working on plans to co-produce and act in &quot;Drawn Sabers&quot;, another of his stories. He also wrote and directed &quot;Angela&quot;.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Keefe married actress Louise Stanley in 1937; the couple divorced in 1938. In 1940 he married actress and dancer Steffi Duna. They had two children, Juliena and James.

O&#x27;Keefe was raised a Roman Catholic. A registered Democrat, he supported Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==

A heavy cigarette smoker, O&#x27;Keefe died of lung cancer in 1968 at the age of 60 at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California. He was buried at Wee Kirk O&#x27;the Heather at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<text>John Percival Martin (187924 March 1966) was an English author best known for his &quot;Uncle&quot; series of children&#x27;s stories.

==Life==
Martin was the son of John Martin, a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife Ellen Fowler, daughter of the Rev. Philip Fowler, another Wesleyan, and his wife Mary. Philip Fowler was the brother of Mary Fowler, wife of the Pacific missionary James Calvert.

John Percival, known in the family as Percy, was born in Scarborough in the North Riding of Yorkshire in the summer of 1879, the fifth of seven children of whom one died before he was born. His younger sister Dora (Theodora Fowler Martin, 1882–1961) is also known as a writer, under the name Dora Fowler Martin. While his two elder brothers were sent to Kingswood School, founded by John Wesley, John was not. His elder sister Mary Calvert (May) went to Trinity Hall School, Southport, and then university. His parents feeling he was not suited to boarding school, he attended local day schools in the northern cities and towns where his father ministered to Methodist circuits.

In 1898, the Martin family was based in Dewsbury, and John was working in the accounts department of the local steel works. He was asked to join the Wesleyan Leeds mission, which for some years had been reconstructed with the ministry of Samuel Chadwick. Shortly he became a candidate for the ministry, and was given a district missionary responsibility in Halifax and Bradford.

Martin became a Methodist minister in 1903, and then served as a missionary in South Africa: he chose reconstruction work after the Second Anglo-Boer War, over his father&#x27;s wish that he should go to Fiji. His uncle James Calvert Fowler had been posted to Kimberley, Northern Cape and the diamond mines. Percy had met his future wife Nancy at the Leeds Mission, and before he left came to understanding that they would marry. In 1904 he was placed first in Ventersdorp. From there he was exchanged to Potchefstroom, and was then sent across the Transvaal to Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest and Sabie, a gold-mining area, living first at Lydenburg since the Pilgrim&#x27;s Rest church had been destroyed in the war.

Now married, John and Nancy Martin moved to Roodepoort in 1907. They were transferred to the large Wesleyan church at Mafeking in 1910.

Returning with his family to England in 1913, Martin became a Wesleyan chaplain at Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire. He was an army chaplain in Palestine during the World War I. After World War II he lived in the village of Timberscombe in Somerset, where he died in March 1966.

==The &quot;Uncle&quot; series==
The &quot;Uncle&quot; books are:

* &quot;Uncle&quot; (1964)
* &quot;Uncle Cleans Up&quot; (1965)
* &quot;Uncle and His Detective&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Uncle and the Treacle Trouble&quot; (1967)
* &quot;Uncle and Claudius the Camel&quot; (1970)
* &quot;Uncle and the Battle for Badgertown&quot; (1973)

The Uncle of the six books in the series is a very rich elephant living in a very large house called Homeward. He is plagued by a group of enemies concerned with puncturing his pretensions, and driving home the charge, true enough, that he once stole a bicycle. 

Uncle has friends and supporters, including the Old Monkey, the One-Armed Badger, the cat Goodman, Noddy Ninety, Cloutman, the King of the Badgers, and Butterskin Mute. He is the sworn enemy of the inhabitants of Badfort, an enormous derelict fortress that blights the landscape in front of Homeward. Living in there are the Badfort gang, nominally headed by the Hateman family, Beaver, Nailrod Snr, Nailrod Jnr, Filljug, and Sigismund, with the support of Flabskin, Oily Joe, the dwarvish, cowardly, skewer-throwing Isidore Hitmouse, the scheming ghost Hootman, and Jellytussle, an animated mound of bluish jelly.

==Reception==
Initial reviews of the series in the 1960s by Penelope Mortimer and Geoffrey Moorhouse were favorable. In 1977 John Rowe Townsend wrote in &quot;25 Years of British Children&#x27;s Books&quot; &quot;There are several Uncle books, all inconsequentially episodic and hilariously illustrated by Quentin Blake&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Companion to Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; (1984) commented on its &quot;wildest schoolboy-style inventions and implausibilities, narrated with dead-pan humour.&quot;

&quot;The Economist&quot; noted in 2005 that the stories &quot;which focus on the doings of the eponymous hero, an elephant and benevolent dictator, were first published in the 1960s, and still enjoy a cult following.&quot; Imogen Russell Williams wrote in 2007 &quot;If there was ever a children&#x27;s series generating fanatical, &quot;cult&quot; adoration, this is it.&quot;

==Reprints==
The first book was reprinted in paperback in 2000 by Red Fox: . See also . Hardcover reprints of the first two volumes were published by the New York Review Books in 2007-2008 ( and ).

In March 2013, a Kickstarter campaign was announced to reprint all six Uncle books in an omnibus edition. The reprint had the support of — and contributions from — several authors and illustrators, including Neil Gaiman, Justin Pollard, Garth Nix, Martin Rowson, Andy Riley, Kate Summerscale, and Richard Ingrams. The campaign was fully funded in a little over four hours. The book was published on 31 October 2013 under the title of &quot;The Complete Uncle&quot;, .

==Family==
In 1906 Martin married Annie &quot;Nancy&quot; Mann (died 1944), daughter of Michael Urwin Mann, in Johannesburg. He later married as his second wife Jane Jenny Sowerbutts née Mann, in 1947. He had four children, two girls and two boys, from his first marriage. Martin&#x27;s &quot;Uncle&quot; stories were first told to his children before he wrote them down for a wider audience.

The eldest child was Helen Estella Martin (1907–1994), known as Stella Martin. She was to 1984 her father&#x27;s official biographer, her work appearing in 2017 as Stella Martin Currey edited by James Martin Currey, under the title &quot; J.P. Martin: Father of Uncle: A Master in the Great English Nonsense Tradition 1879–1966&quot;; and also editor of the three Uncle books that appeared after his death. 

Stella Martin worked from the early 1920s as a journalist on the &quot;Bristol Times and Mirror&quot;. At the end of the decade the &quot;Time and Mirror&quot;, owned by the Berry Group (at one point Allied Newspapers) was caught up in a circulation war with the &quot;Bristol Evening World&quot; (owned by national rivals the Rothermeres). It resulted in Stella being moved from writing aimed at a female audience, to being a &quot;zoo correspondent&quot;. For a time she provided copy influenced by her father&#x27;s juvenile fiction. In 1932 the &quot;Time and Mirror&quot; folded, and later that year Stella married Ralph Nixon Currey, a friend of the family. In 1934 the couple encouraged J. P. Martin to write down the &quot;Uncle&quot; stories.

<text>Uncle and his Detective (1966) is a children&#x27;s story by J. P. Martin, as part of his &quot;Uncle&quot; series of books.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with the arrival not of a detective, but of disaster: Badfort is for sale, but when Uncle decides to buy it, demolish it, and build a pleasantly appointed park on the site, he is forestalled. Beaver Hateman has sold it cheaply to someone on the condition that he, Hateman, is allowed to stay on as a paying guest. Forgetting that the man who has bought Badfort is certain to regret the &quot;bargain&quot;, Uncle tries to console himself by continuing his never-ending exploration of Homeward. He comes across the Art Gallery, reached along Quack Walk between two ponds crowded with noisy and aggressive ducks. &quot;En route&quot; he discovers the mysterious Crack House, which is the lair of a vicious and horribly squawking creature, half-bat, half-bird, called Batty. After visiting the Art Gallery and discovering that Batty is persecuting the curator and his family, Uncle has Batty expelled from Crack House and pursues a report of buried treasure there. Constant trips to Crack House have accustomed the ducks to passers-by, and Uncle&#x27;s miserly friend Alonzo S. Whitebeard foolishly tries to take advantage of their docility.

:This time the ducks were much quieter. They seemed so docile and friendly that Whitebeard captured one and tried to hide it under his beard, having visions of hot duck for supper. The duck nearly bit a piece out of his chest and Whitebeard flung it from him with a roar of pain.

By now the Detective of the title has appeared: an elegant and astute fox called A. B. Fox, who proves worthy of his hire (five shillings a day) as the Badfort Crowd, sniffing treasure from afar, are constantly on the prowl. After many adventures, Uncle eventually tracks down the treasure, an unimaginably vast block of softly glowing gold (or dlog, as they code-name it), beats off a final attack from the Badfort Crowd, and enjoys the acclaim of the grateful inhabitants of Homeward when he decides to distribute the gold for the common good. But the celebrations are interrupted briefly with a reminder that the Badfort Crowd, though defeated, are far from down and out. A group of young badgers are singing a song in praise of Uncle when:

:[A]n atrocious raucous voice away on the edge of the crowd interrupted them. &#x27;See that pompous humbug Unc/On the platform raise his trunk.&#x27;

It&#x27;s a promise of more trouble in the future from the Badfort Crowd, who are once again in sole possession of their ramshackle and crumbling headquarters.

== Other media ==
&quot;Uncle and his Detective&quot; was read by Spike Milligan on the BBC1 series Jackanory in 1971.

<doc id="214690" wikidata="Q1398332" url="?curid=214690" title="John Cowper Powys">
<text>John Cowper Powys ( ; 8 October 187217 June 1963) was an English novelist, philosopher, lecturer, critic and poet born in Shirley, Derbyshire, where his father was vicar of the parish church in 1871–1879. Powys appeared with a volume of verse in 1896 and a first novel in 1915, but gained success only with his novel &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; in 1929. He has been seen as a successor to Thomas Hardy, and &quot;Wolf Solent&quot;, &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; (1932), &quot;Weymouth Sands&quot; (1934), and &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; (1936) have been called his Wessex novels. As with Hardy, landscape is important to his works. So is elemental philosophy in his characters&#x27; lives. In 1934 he published an autobiography. His itinerant lectures were a success in England and in 1905–1930 in the United States, where he wrote many of his novels and had several first published. He moved to Dorset, England, in 1934 with a US partner, Phyllis Playter. In 1935 they moved to Corwen, Merionethshire, Wales, where he set two novels, and in 1955 to Blaenau Ffestiniog, where he died in 1963.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Powys was born in Shirley, Derbyshire, in 1872, the son of the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843–1923), and Mary Cowper Johnson, granddaughter of Dr John Johnson, the cousin and close friend of the poet William Cowper. He came from a family of eleven children, many of whom were also talented. The family lived in Shirley between 1871 and 1879, briefly in Dorchester, Dorset and then they moved to Montacute, Somerset, where Charles Powys was vicar for thirty-two years.

John Cowper Powys&#x27;s two younger brothers Llewelyn Powys (1884–1939) and Theodore Francis Powys were well-known writers, while his sister Philippa Powys published a novel and some poetry. Another sister Marian Powys was an authority on lace and lace-making and published a book on this subject. His brother A. R. Powys was Secretary of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and published a number of books on architectural subjects. Powys was educated at Sherborne School and graduated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, June 1894.

On 6 April 1896 he married Margaret Lyon. They had a son, Littleton Alfred, in 1902. Powys&#x27;s first employment was teaching in girls&#x27; schools in Brighton, and then Eastbourne. His first published works were two highly derivative collections of poetry published in the 1890s. He worked from 1898 as an Extension lecturer throughout England, for both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

===Lecturer in America===
Then from 1905 to the early 1930s, he lectured in the United States for the American Society for the Extension of University Teaching, gaining a reputation as a charismatic speaker. He spent his summers in England. During this time he travelled the length and breadth of the US, as well as into Canada. Powys&#x27;s marriage was unsatisfactory, and Powys eventually lived a large part of each year in the USA, and had relationships with various women. An important woman in his life was the American poet Frances Gregg, whom he first met in Philadelphia in 1912. He was also a friend of the famous dancer Isadora Duncan. Another friend and an important supporter in America was the novelist Theodore Dreiser. In 1921 he met Phyllis Playter, the twenty-six-year-old daughter of industrialist and business man Franklin Playter. Eventually they established a permanent relationship, though he was unable to divorce his wife Margaret, who was a Catholic. However, he diligently supported Margaret and the education of their son.

In the US he engaged in a public debate with the philosopher Bertrand Russell on marriage, and he also debated with the philosopher and historian Will Durant. Powys was also a witness in the obscenity trial of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and was mentioned with approval in the autobiography of US feminist and anarchist, Emma Goldman. Powys would later share Goldman&#x27;s support for the Spanish Revolution.
His first novel &quot;Wood and Stone&quot;, which Powys dedicated to Thomas Hardy, was published in 1915. This was followed by two collections of literary essays &quot;Visions and Revisions&quot; (1915) and &quot;Suspended Judgment&quot; (1916). In &quot;Confessions of Two Brothers&quot; (1916), a work that also contains a section by his brother Llewelyn, Powys writes about his personal philosophy, something he elaborated on in &quot;The Complex Vision&quot; (1920), his first full length work of popular philosophy. He also published three collections of poetry between 1916 and 1922.

Politically, Powys described himself as an anarchist and was both anti-fascist and anti-Stalinist: &quot;Powys already regarded fascism and Stalinism as appalling, but different, totalitarian regimes&quot;.

It was not until 1929, with the novel &quot;Wolf Solent&quot;, that Powys achieved any critical or financial success. In 1930 Powys and Phyllis moved from Greenwich Village in New York City to Hillsdale in rural upstate New York. One of Powys&#x27;s most admired novels, &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot;, published in 1932, sold well, though he made little if any money from it because of a libel lawsuit. Another important work, &quot;Autobiography&quot;, was published in 1934.

===Settling in Wales===
Then in June 1934 Powys and Phyllis left America and moved to England, living first in Dorchester, the setting for the final Wessex novel, &quot;Maiden Castle&quot;, before eventually moving in July 1935 to Corwen, Denbighshire North Wales, with the help of the novelist James Hanley, who lived nearby. Corwen was historically part of Edeirnion or Edeyrnion and an ancient commote of medieval Wales, once a part of the Kingdom of Powys. There Powys immersed himself in Welsh literature, mythology and culture, including learning to read Welsh. The move inspired two major historical novels with Welsh settings, &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; (1941) and &quot;Porius&quot; (1951).

Margaret Powys died in 1947, and his son Littleton Alfred in 1954.

In May 1955 they moved, for the last time, to Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales. John Cowper Powys died in 1963 and Phyllis Playter in 1982.
==Works==
===Poetry===
Powys&#x27;s first published works were poetry: &quot;Odes and Other Poems&quot; (1896), &quot;Poems&quot; (1899), collections which have &quot;echoes […] of Tennyson, Arnold, Swinburne, among contemporaries, and of Milton and Wordsworth and Keats&quot;. These were published with the assistance of his cousin Ralph Shirley, who was a director of William Rider and Son the publisher of them. In the summer of 1905 Powys composed &quot;The Death of God&quot; an epic poem &quot;modelled on the blank verse of Milton, Keats, and Tennyson&quot; that was published as &quot;Lucifer&quot; in 1956. There were three further volumes of poetry: &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Bane&quot; (1916), &quot;Mandragora&quot; (1917) and &quot;Samphire&quot; (1922). The first two collections were published by Powys&#x27;s manager G. Arnold Shaw. An unfinished, short narrative poem &quot;The Ridge&quot; was published in January 1963, shortly before Powys&#x27;s death that June. In 1964 Kenneth Hopkins published &quot;John Cowper Powys: A Selection from his Poems&quot; and in 1979 the Welsh poet and critic Roland Mathias thought this side of Powys worthy of critical study and published &quot;The Hollowed-Out Elder Stalk: John Cowper Powys as Poet&quot;. Belinda Humfrey, suggests that &quot;[p]erhaps Powys&#x27;s best poems are those given to Jason Otter in &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; and Taliessin in &quot;Porius&quot;.&quot;

&quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot; (1973) edited by English poet Philip Larkin contains &quot;In A Hotel Writing-Room&quot; by Powys.

While he was a famous lecturer and published a variety of both fiction and non-fiction regularly from 1915, it was not until he was in his early fifties, with the publication of &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; in 1929, that he achieved critical and financial success as a novelist. This novel was reprinted several times in both the United States and Britain and translated into German in 1930 and French in 1931. In the Preface he wrote for the 1961 Macdonald edition of the novel Powys states: &quot;&quot;Wolf Solent&quot; is a book of Nostalgia, written in a foreign country with the pen of a traveller and the ink-blood of his home&quot;. &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; is set in Ramsgard, based on Sherborne, Dorset, where Powys attended school from May 1883, as well as Blacksod, modelled on Yeovil, Somerset, and Dorchester and Weymouth, both in Dorset, all places full of memories for him. In the same year &quot;The Meaning of Culture&quot; was published and it, too, was frequently reprinted. &quot;In Defence of Sensuality&quot;, published at the end of the following year, was yet another best seller. First published in 1933, &quot;A Philosophy of Solitude&quot; was another best seller for Powys in the USA.

Before &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; there had been four earlier apprentice novels: &quot;Wood and Stone&quot; (1915), &quot;Rodmoor&quot; (1916), the posthumous &quot;After my Fashion&quot; (1980), which was written around 1920, and &quot;Ducdame&quot; (1925). &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; was the first of the so-called Wessex novels, which include &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; (1932), &quot;Weymouth Sands&quot; (1934) and &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; (1936). Powys was an admirer of Thomas Hardy, and these novels are set in Somerset and Dorset, parts of Hardy&#x27;s mythical Wessex. The American scholar Richard Maxwell described these four novels &quot;as remarkably successful with the reading public of his time&quot;. &quot;Maiden Castle&quot;, the last of the Wessex novels, is set in Dorchester, Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Casterbridge. Powys intended it to be a rival of Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;.

All the same, despite his indebtedness to the Victorian novel and his enthusiasm for Hardy, Walter Scott and such lesser figures as Ainsworth, Powys was clearly a modernist. He has affinities also with Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Walter Pater, Marcel Proust, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce and Dorothy Richardson.

It is clear from Powys&#x27;s diaries that his new-found success was much helped by the stability that his relationship with Phyllis Playter gave him and her frequent advice on his work in progress.

&quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; sold particularly well in its British edition, though this was of little avail as it was the subject of an expensive libel case brought by Gerard Hodgkinson, the owner of the Wookey Hole Caves, who felt himself identifiably and unfairly portrayed in the character of Philip Crow. According to Powys, this novel&#x27;s &quot;heroine is the Grail&quot;, and its central concern is with the various myths, legends and history associated with Glastonbury. Not only is &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; concerned with the legend that Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail, a vessel containing the blood of Christ, to the town, but the further tradition that King Arthur was buried there. Furthermore one of the novel&#x27;s main characters, the Welshman Owen Evans, introduces the idea that the Grail has a Welsh (Celtic), pagan, pre-Christian origin. The main sources for Powys&#x27;s ideas on mythology and the Grail legend are Sir John Rhys&#x27;s &quot;Studies in the Arthurian Legend&quot;, R. S. Loomis&#x27;s &quot;Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance&quot;, and the works of Jessie Weston, including &quot;From Ritual to Romance&quot;. T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; is another possible influence. A central aspect of &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; is the attempt by John Geard, an ex-minister now the Mayor of Glastonbury, to restore Glastonbury to its medieval glory as a place of religious pilgrimage. On the other hand, the Glastonbury industrialist Philip Crow, along with John and Mary Crow and Tom Barter, who are, like him, from Norfolk, view the myths and legends of the town with contempt. Philip&#x27;s vision is of a future with more mines and more factories. John Crow, however, as he is penniless, takes on the task of organising a pageant for Geard. At the same time an alliance of Anarchists, Marxists, and Jacobins try to turn Glastonbury into a commune.

====Welsh novels====
While Welsh mythology was already important in &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; and &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; it became still more so after he and Phyllis Playter moved to Corwen, Wales, in 1935, first in the minor novel &quot;Morwyn or The Vengeance of God&quot; (1937). Another important element in &quot;Morwyn&quot;, is condemnation of animal cruelty, especially vivisection, a theme also found in &quot;Weymouth Sands&quot; (1934). As a result, some writers have seen Powys as a forebear of the modern animal rights movement. In 1944, Powys wrote an anti-vivisection article for Leo Rodenhurst&#x27;s &quot;The Abolitionist&quot;, a paper published by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. Powys was also associated with the National Anti-Vivisection Society, where he met Evalyn Westacott, author of &quot;A Century of Vivisection and Anti-Vivisection&quot; (1949), who cited Powys arguments against vivisection, which Powys came to see as the worst of all crimes.

There then followed two major historical novels set in Wales, &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; (1941) and &quot;Porius&quot; (1951). The first deals with the rebellion of the Welsh Prince Owain Glyndŵr (1400–1416 CE), while &quot;Porius&quot; takes place in the time of the mythic King Arthur (499 CE). However, Arthur is a minor character compared with the Welsh Prince Porius and the King&#x27;s magician Myrddin (Merlin). In both works, but especially &quot;Porius&quot;, Powys makes use of the mythology found in the Welsh classic &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;. &quot;Porius&quot; is, for some, the crowning achievement of Powys&#x27;s maturity, but others are repelled by its obscurity. It was originally cut severely for publication, but in recent years two attempts have been made to recreate Powys&#x27;s original intent.

It is not surprising that John Cowper Powys, after he moved to Corwen, decided to begin a novel about Owain Glyndŵr, as it was in Corwen that Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion against Henry IV began on 16 September 1400, when he formally assumed the ancestral title of Prince of Powys at his manor house of Glyndyfrdwy, then in the parish of Corwen. In September 1935, Phyllis Playter had suggested he should write a historical novel about Owain Glyndŵr. An important aspect of &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; are historical parallels between the beginning of the 15th century and the late 1930s and early 1940s: &quot;A sense of contemporataneousness is ever present in &quot;Owen Glendower&quot;. We are in a world of change like our own&quot;. The novel was conceived at a time when the &quot;Spanish Civil War was a major topic of public debate&quot; and completed on 24 December 1939, a few months after World War II had begun.

&quot;Porius&quot; is set mainly in Corwen. The events take place in the week of &quot;October 18, to October 25, A.D. 499&quot;, during a historical period when, Powys claims, &quot;There appears to be an absolute blank, as far as documentary evidence goes, with regard to the history of Britain&quot;. This was in fact a time of major transition in the history of Britain, with the replacing of Roman traditions with Saxon rule and the conversion of the British to Christianity. There are again, as with &quot;Owen Glendower&quot;, parallels with contemporary history: &quot;The Dark Ages and the 1930s are the periods of what Powys, in Yeatsian phrase calls &#x27;appalling transition&#x27;.&quot; and there was a clear possibility of another &quot;Saxon&quot; invasion, when Powys began writing Porius in 1942. In prefatory comments probably written about 1949, as the Cold War began, Powys suggests:
As we contemplate the historic background to [...] the last year of the fifth century [sic], it is impossible not to think of the background of human life from which we watch the first half of the twentieth century dissolve into the second half. As the old gods were departing then, so the old gods are departing now. And as the future was dark with the terrifying possibilities of human disaster then, so, today, are we confronted by the possibility of catastrophic world events.

Powys also saw Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion taking place at the time of &quot;one of the most momentous and startling epochs of &quot;transition&quot; that the world has known&quot;.

Just as the landscape of Dorset and Somerset and the characters&#x27; deep personal relationships with it had been of importance in the great Wessex novels, so the landscape of Wales was now significant, especially that of the Corwen region.

The landscape and the intimate relations that characters have with the elements, including the sky, wind, plants, animals, and insects, have great significance in all Powys&#x27;s works. These are linked to another major influence: Romanticism, especially William Wordsworth and writers influenced by Wordsworth such as Walter Pater. Powys also admired Goethe and Rousseau. Words such as &quot;mysticism&quot; and &quot;pantheism&quot; are sometimes used in discussing Powys&#x27;s attitude to nature, but what he is concerned with is an ecstatic response to the natural world, epiphanies such as Wordsworth describes in his &quot;&quot;, with an important difference that Powys believes that the ecstasy of the young child can be retained by an adult who actively cultivates the power of the imagination. Some have compared this to Zen and such contemplative practices, and for Powys, and the protagonists of his novels who usually resemble him, the cultivation of a psycho-sensuous philosophy is as important as the Christian religion was for an earlier generation.

====Late novels====
More minor in scale, the novels that followed &quot;Porius&quot; are marked by elements of fantasy. &quot;The Inmates&quot; (1952) is set in a madhouse and explores Powys&#x27;s interest in mental illness, but it is a work on which Powys failed to bestow sufficient &quot;time and care&quot;. Glen Cavaliero, in &quot;John Cowper Powys: Novelist&quot;, describes the novels written after &quot;Porius&quot; as &quot;the spontaneous fairy tales of a Rabelaisian surrealist enchanted with life&quot;, and finds &quot;Atlantis&quot; (1954) &quot;the richest and most sustained&quot; of them. &quot;Atlantis&quot; is set in the Homeric world. The protagonist is Nisos, the young son of Odysseus, who plans to voyage west from Ithaca over the drowned Atlantis. Powys final fiction, such as &quot;Up and Out&quot; (1957) and &quot;All or Nothing&quot; (1960) &quot;use the mode of science fiction, although science has no part in them&quot;.

===Non-fiction===
====Autobiographical====
One of Powys&#x27;s most important works, his &quot;Autobiography&quot; (1934), describes his first 60 years. While he sets out to be totally frank about himself, and especially his sexual peculiarities and perversions, he largely excludes any substantial discussion of the women in his life. The reason for this is now much clearer because we now know that it was written while he was still married to Margaret, though he was living in a permanent relationship with Phyllis Playter.

It is one of his most important works and writer J. B. Priestley suggests that, even if Powys had not written a single novel, &quot;this one book alone would have proved him to be a writer of genius.&quot; And it &quot;has justly been compared to the &quot;Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&quot;.

John Cowper Powys was a prolific writer of letters, many of which have been published, and kept a diary from 1929; several diaries, including this one, have been published. Among his correspondents were the novelists Theodore Dreiser, James Purdy, James Hanley, Henry Miller and Dorothy Richardson, but he also replied to the many ordinary admirers who wrote to him.

====Philosophy====
Periodically, over almost 50 years, starting with &quot;Confessions of Two Brothers&quot; in 1916, Powys wrote works that present his personal philosophy of life. These are not works of philosophy in the academic sense; in a bookstore the appropriate section might be self-help. Powys describes &quot;A Philosophy of Solitude&quot; (1933) as a &quot;short textbook of the various mental tricks by which the human soul can obtain […] comparative happiness beneath the normal burden of human fate&quot;. Powys&#x27;s various works of popular philosophy may seem mere potboilers, written to help his finances as he worked on his novels, but critics like Denis Lane, Harald Fawkner and Janina Nordius see in them insight into &quot;the intellectual structures that form the metastructures of the great novels&quot;. These works were frequently bestsellers, especially in the United States. &quot;The Meaning of Culture&quot; (1929) went through 20 editions in Powys&#x27;s lifetime. &quot;In Defence of Sensuality&quot;, published at the end of the following year, was yet another bestseller, as was &quot;A Philosophy of Solitude&quot; (1933).

====Literary criticism====
Taking advantage of his reputation as an itinerant lecturer, Powys published in 1915 a collection of literary essays, &quot;Visions and Revisions&quot;. This was published by the manager of his lecture tours, Arnold Shaw, as were the subsequent &quot;Suspended Judgements: Essays on Books and Sensations&quot; (1916) and &quot;One Hundred Best Books&quot; (1916). &quot;Visions and Revisions&quot; went through four impressions in 16 months. In the next 30 years he published essay collection, &quot;The Enjoyment of Literature&quot; (1938) (&quot;The Pleasures of Literature&quot; in the UK), three studies of writers, &quot;Dorothy Richardson&quot; (1931), &quot;Dostoievsky&quot; (1947), and &quot;Rabelais&quot; (1948), and journal essays on various writers such as Theodore Dreiser, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and D. H. Lawrence. There is also a work on John Keats, part of which was published posthumously, and a study of Aristophanes that Powys was working on in his later years.

Powys&#x27;s literary criticism was generally well received by reviewers. Morine Krissdottir in her recent biography describes the essays in &quot;Suspended Judgements&quot; as &quot;fine criticism&quot;. As for &quot;The Pleasures of Literature&quot;, the writer Kenneth Hopkins states that &quot;[i]f ever there was a book of criticism for the general reader, this is it.&quot; In the 1940s Powys wrote books on two of his favourite authors: &quot;Dostoievsky&quot; (1946) and &quot;Rabelais&quot; (1948). The latter was particularly praised by some reviewers. The Rabelais scholar Donald M. Frame, for example, in the &quot;Romantic Review&quot;, December 1951, describes Powys&#x27;s translation (only of one fourth of Rabelais) &quot;the best we have in English&quot;. A French translation of &quot;Rabelais&quot;, by Catherine Lieutenant, was published in 1990.

===Reputation===
Powys is a controversial writer, &quot;who evokes both massive contempt and near idolatry.&quot; While Walter Allen in &quot;Tradition and Dream&quot; recognises Powys&#x27;s genius, he is dissatisfied with what Powys has done with it, seeing his approach to the novel as &quot;so alien to the temper of the age as to be impossible for many people to take seriously&quot;. Yet Annie Dillard sees Powys as &quot;a powerful genius, whose novels stir us deeply.&quot; Notable throughout his career is the admiration of novelists as diverse as Theodore Dreiser, Henry Miller, Iris Murdoch, Margaret Drabble, James Purdy, and the academic critics George Painter, G. Wilson Knight, George Steiner, Harald Fawkner and Jerome McGann. The film director John Boorman wrote in his autobiography of contemplating a movie adaptation of &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; early in his career.

In 1958, &quot;Powys was presented with the Bronze Plaque of the Hamburg Free Academy of Arts in recognition of his outstanding services to literature and philosophy&quot;. Then on 23 July 1962, aged 90, he gained an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters &quot;in absentia&quot; from the University of Wales at Swansea, as &quot;patriarch of the literature of these islands&quot;. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Enid Starkie in 1958 and by G. Wilson Knight in 1959 and 1962.

Powys&#x27;s works have been translated into French, German, Swedish, Japanese, and other languages.

<text>OBEX (abbreviation of OBject EXchange, also termed IrOBEX) is a communication protocol that facilitates the exchange of binary objects between devices. It is maintained by the Infrared Data Association but has also been adopted by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group and the SyncML wing of the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). One of OBEX&#x27;s earliest popular applications was in the Palm III. This PDA and its many successors use OBEX to exchange business cards, data, even applications.

Although OBEX was initially designed for infrared, it has now been adopted by Bluetooth, and is also used over RS-232, USB, WAP and in devices such as Livescribe smartpens.

==Comparison to HTTP==
OBEX is similar in design and function to HTTP in providing the client with a reliable transport for connecting to a server and may then request or provide objects. But OBEX differs in many important respects:

*HTTP is normally layered above a TCP/IP link. OBEX can also be, but is commonly implemented on an IrLAP/IrLMP/Tiny TP stack on an IrDA device. In Bluetooth, OBEX is implemented on a Baseband/ACL/L2CAP (and, for legacy uses, RFCOMM) stack. Other such &quot;bindings&quot; of OBEX are possible, such as over USB.
*HTTP uses human-readable text, but OBEX uses binary-formatted type–length–value triplets named &quot;Headers&quot; to exchange information about a request or an object. These are much easier to parse by resource-limited devices.
*HTTP transactions are inherently stateless; generally an HTTP client opens a connection, makes a single request, receives its response, and either closes the connection or makes other unrelated requests. In OBEX, a single transport connection may bear many related operations. In fact, recent additions to the OBEX specification allow an abruptly closed transaction to be resumed with all state information intact.

==Objects==
OBEX works by exchanging &quot;objects&quot;, which are used for a variety of purposes: establishing the parameters of a connection, sending and requesting data, changing the current path or the attributes of a file.

Objects are &quot;fields&quot; and &quot;headers&quot;. As an example, the following may be the object used for requesting the phonebook from a mobile:

This object contains two fields (command and length) and two headers. The first field (command) specifies that it is a request for data (GET). The second field is the total size of the object, including the two fields.

This object also contains two headers, specifically a &quot;Connection ID&quot; and a &quot;Name&quot;. The first byte of each header is the header&#x27;s name and its content type. In this case:

* 0xCB means that this header is a &quot;Connection ID&quot;, a number obtained previously; the two highest-order bits of 0xCB are 11, and this pair specifies that this as a 4-byte quantity;
* the first byte of the second header is 0x01; this byte identifies this header as a &quot;Name&quot; one; the first two bits of 0x01 are 00, meaning that the content of this header is a null-terminated unicode string (in UCS-2 form), prefixed by the number of bytes it is made of (0x00 0x1e).

A possible response, containing the requested data, could be:

In this example, the phonebook is assumed short enough to be contained in a single response object. The only header has 0x49 as its identifier, meaning that it is an &quot;End of Body&quot;, the last chunk of information (also the only one, in this case). The first two bits of 0x49 are 01, meaning that the content of this header is length-prefixed data: the two next bytes 0x00 0x2F tells the length of this data (in decimal, 47), the succeeding ones are the data, in this case a phonebook comprising only an empty vCard of 47 bytes.

This example shows a single GET command and its response, the only headers involved being connection id, name and end-of-body. Before issuing it, a CONNECT command should have been sent for establishing some parameters of the connection, including the connection id. Other commands are: put, setpath, action, abort, disconnect. Some other notable headers include: type, time, description, target.

After the client (e.g., computer) connects to the server (e.g., mobile), a typical session consists in the client sending a number of objects and getting their responses from the server. As an example:

* CONNECT: one of the fields specifies the largest size of packets the client can receive; a TARGET header specifies the kind of service the client is expecting (file-browsing, sync-ml, phonebook access); the server answer with its maximal packet length, the connection id, and other data
* GET: the client requests a file, specifying the connection id, the file name and/or its type; the server answer with the file content, or just a part of it; in the latter case, the client has to send other GET objects to obtain the rest of the file
* SETPATH: the client tells the server to switch to a different file folder, specifying the connection id and the folder name in two headers
* GET: the client requests a listing of the folder content by sending an object with the connection id and an appropriate TYPE header (e.g., &quot;x-obex/folder-listing&quot; for file transfer, &quot;x-bt/vcard-listing&quot; for phonebook access)
* PUT: the client sends a file to the server; if it is too large to fit into a single packet, the server will request the next part with a CONTINUE response
* DISCONNECT: the client informs the server that it is closing the session

The exchange may differ significantly depending on the service. For example, SyncML does not use SETPATH, while an OBEX push is made of just CONNECT (without a TARGET header), PUT and an optional DISCONNECT.

==Protocols==

The following protocols runs over OBEX, or have bindings to do so:

; OBEX Push
: Transfers a file from the originator of the request to the recipient; a CONNECTION object containing no target is sent, then PUT is used to transfer the file
; OBEX File Transfer Protocol
: Stores and retrieves files, similar to FTP. The target header of the CONNECTION object is {0xF9, 0xEC, 0x7B, 0xC4, 0x95, 0x3C, 0x11, 0xD2, 0x98, 0x4E, 0x52, 0x54, 0x00, 0xDC, 0x9E, 0x09}; the response contains the connection id to use in subsequent GET, PUT, SETPATH and ACTION object.
; Phonebook Access
: Similar to file transfer, but uses a target {0x79, 0x61, 0x35, 0xF0, 0xF0, 0xC5, 0x11, 0xD8, 0x09, 0x66, 0x08, 0x00, 0x20, 0x0C, 0x9A, 0x66}; phonebook entries can be listed (with various possible orderings and filters) and retrieved from certain directories under telecom/ using GET and SETPATH
; IrMC
: IrMC was designed for the exchange of phonebook entries, calendar entries, digital business cards, and to-do lists. In its connectionless form, a single PUT is used to transfer data; otherwise, various files and folders within telecom/ can be retrieved or pushed; a target header {&#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;R&#x27;, &#x27;M&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;-&#x27;, &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27;, &#x27;N&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;} may be used in GET requests to differentiate the kind of indexing used
; SyncML
: SyncML can synchronize phonebooks, calendars, notes, and other data. In its OBEX binding, the target of the CONNECT object is {&#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27;, &#x27;N&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;, &#x27;M&#x27;, &#x27;L&#x27;, &#x27;-&#x27;, &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27;, &#x27;N&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27;}; a session then consists in a sequence of PUT-GET pairs where nameless XML or WBXML files are sent and received, in turn.

==Implementations==

===javax.obex===

Optional package javax.obex in Java APIs for Bluetooth provides an implementation of OBEX in Java.

===OpenObex===
OpenObex is an open-source implementation of OBEX in C. It provides functions for connecting over IrDA, Bluetooth, USB and TCP/IP, building objects and handling received data. An example schema of a client application is:
void callback_function(...) {
 /* process received data */

int main() {
 OBEX_Init(..., callback_function);
 OBEX_TransportConnect(...);

 object = OBEX_ObjectNew(...);
 OBEX_ObjectAddHeader(object, ...);
 OBEX_ObjectAddHeader(object, ...);
 OBEX_Request(..., object);
 while (...)
 OBEX_HandleInput(...)

 object = OBEX_ObjectNew(...);
 OBEX_ObjectAddHeader(object, ...);
 OBEX_Request(..., object);
 while (...)
 OBEX_HandleInput(...)

 OBEX_TransportDisconnect(handle);
 OBEX_Cleanup(handle);


Objects are sent by codice_1. After calling codice_2, received data is processed in the callback function (which was specified when calling codice_3). The callback function can determine whether the response has been completely received, and therefore whether the main program can exit from the codice_4 loop it is executing.

===PyOBEX and nOBEX===
PyOBEX provides partial support for OBEX in Python. nOBEX is a fork of PyOBEX with more complete OBEX support, and support for the Bluetooth Hands Free Profile to facilitate OBEX testing on automotive infotainment systems.

==Profiles==
OBEX is the foundation for many higher-layer &quot;profiles&quot;:

==Supported devices==
*Android devices in version 2.1 “Eclair” and above
*All Palms since Palm III, except webOS devices: the Palm Pre, Palm Pre Plus, Palm Pixi and Palm Pixi Plus.
*Most non-Android Sharp, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, HTC and Nokia phones with infrared or Bluetooth port. Android devices are supported but this is supposed to be saying that they are supported as well.
*LG EnV Touch (VX11000)
*Many other PDAs since 2003, until their decline due to being replaced by smartphones 
*Many other phones with infrared or Bluetooth port
*Windows Phone 7.8 and 8 devices (limited to the transferring of pictures, music and videos via a &#x27;Bluetooth Share&#x27; app).

<text>John Johnstone ( – 3 September 1732) was the 32nd Mayor of New York City from 1714 to 1719.

==Career==
An associate of George Scot of Pitlochie, he was a druggist from Edinburgh and emigrated to the Thirteen Colonies in 1685 aboard the &quot;Henry and Francis&quot;. Scot himself died on board the ship.

In New Jersey, he was known as Dr. Johnstone.

In 1686, Johnstone was granted a tract of 500 acres by the East New Jersey Proprietors on account of his wife and another 30,000 acres in 1701. In spite of his investment in East New Jersey land, John Johnstone eventually settled in New York and was elected to the New York General Assembly, serving in 1709 and 1710. Between 1710 and 1714 Johnstone represented Perth Amboy in the New Jersey General Assembly. By 1714 he was mayor of New York City, in which office he served until 1716.

He was first recommended to the Crown for the New York Provincial Council by Governor Robert Hunter in 1715 to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Dr. Samuel Staats. Johnstone was finally appointed in 1720, but by 1722 Hunter&#x27;s successor, William Burnet, complained that Dr. Johnstone had &quot;without any leave obtained under the Hand and seal of any Governor or president, now resided for above two years last past in New Jersey&quot;, and asked for his removal from the Council. In July 1723 he was replaced by William Provost.

Governor Burnet had first-hand knowledge of Johnstone&#x27;s New Jersey residency, as he served as governor of both New York and New Jersey simultaneously. John Johnstone had returned to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1721, again representing Perth Amboy. He served as Speaker for most of that time, from 1721 through 1722, and again from 1725 through 1729, with the interim occupied by William Trent. He remained in the Assembly until his death on September 3, 1732.

==Marriage and children==
In 1686, Johnstone was married to Euphame Scot, the daughter of George Scot of Pitlochie. Together, they were the parents of Euphemia Johnston, Isabel Johnstone, Katherine Johnstone, John Johnston, Jr., Margaret Johnston, Andrew Johnston, William Johnstone, Janet, James Johnstone, George Johnston, Lewis Johnston, Isabel Johnstone, and Mary Johnston.

==Death==
Johnstone died on 3 September 1732 in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.

<doc id="214701" wikidata="Q1463025" url="?curid=214701" title="Water purification">
<text>Water purification is the process of removing undesirable chemicals, biological contaminants, suspended solids, and gases from water. The goal is to produce water that is fit for specific purposes. Most water is purified and disinfected for human consumption (drinking water), but water purification may also be carried out for a variety of other purposes, including medical, pharmacological, chemical, and industrial applications. The history of water purification includes a wide variety of methods. The methods used include physical processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and distillation; biological processes such as slow sand filters or biologically active carbon; chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination; and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light.

Water purification can reduce the concentration of particulate matter including suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses, and fungi as well as reduce the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate matter.

The standards for drinking water quality are typically set by governments or by international standards. These standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants, depending on the intended use of the water.

A visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality. Simple procedures such as boiling or the use of a household point of use water filter (typically with activated carbon) are not sufficient for treating all possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source. Even natural spring water—considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century—must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed. Chemical and microbiological analysis, while expensive, are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.

==Sources of water==

#Groundwater: The water emerging from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, or thousands of years ago. Soil and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to a high degree of clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding chlorine or chloramines as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, artesian springs, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high bacteriological quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially carbonates and sulfates of calcium and magnesium. Depending on the strata through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including chloride, and bicarbonate. There may be a requirement to reduce the iron or manganese content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary disinfection may also be required. Where groundwater recharge is practised (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.
#Upland lakes and reservoirs: Typically located in the headwaters of river systems, upland reservoirs are usually sited above any human habitation and may be surrounded by a protective zone to restrict the opportunities for contamination. Bacteria and pathogen levels are usually low, but some bacteria, protozoa or algae will be present. Where uplands are forested or peaty, humic acids can colour the water. Many upland sources have low pH which require adjustment.
#Rivers, canals and low land reservoirs: Low land surface waters will have a significant bacterial load and may also contain algae, suspended solids and a variety of dissolved constituents.
#Atmospheric water generation is a new technology that can provide high quality drinking water by extracting water from the air by cooling the air and thus condensing water vapour.
#Rainwater harvesting or fog collection which collect water from the atmosphere can be used especially in areas with significant dry seasons and in areas which experience fog even when there is little rain.
#Desalination of seawater by distillation or reverse osmosis.
#Surface water: Freshwater bodies that are open to the atmosphere and are not designated as groundwater are termed surface waters.

==Treatment==
=== Goals ===
The goals of the treatment are to remove unwanted constituents in the water and to make it safe to drink or fit for a specific purpose in industry or medical applications. Widely varied techniques are available to remove contaminants like fine solids, micro-organisms and some dissolved inorganic and organic materials, or environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants. The choice of method will depend on the quality of the water being treated, the cost of the treatment process and the quality standards expected of the processed water.

The processes below are the ones commonly used in water purification plants. Some or most may not be used depending on the scale of the plant and quality of the raw (source) water.

===Pretreatment===
#Pumping and containment – The majority of water must be pumped from its source or directed into pipes or holding tanks. To avoid adding contaminants to the water, this physical infrastructure must be made from appropriate materials and constructed so that accidental contamination does not occur.
#Screening (&quot;see also screen filter&quot;) – The first step in purifying surface water is to remove large debris such as sticks, leaves, rubbish and other large particles which may interfere with subsequent purification steps. Most deep groundwater does not need screening before other purification steps.
#Storage – Water from rivers may also be stored in bankside reservoirs for periods between a few days and many months to allow natural biological purification to take place. This is especially important if treatment is by slow sand filters. Storage reservoirs also provide a buffer against short periods of drought or to allow water supply to be maintained during transitory pollution incidents in the source river.
#Pre-chlorination – In many plants the incoming water was chlorinated to minimise the growth of fouling organisms on the pipe-work and tanks. Because of the potential adverse quality effects (see chlorine below), this has largely been discontinued.

====pH adjustment====
Pure water has a pH close to 7 (neither alkaline nor acidic). Sea water can have pH values that range from 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer and the influence of contaminant inputs (acid rain). 

If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes and is especially common practice for water softening. The choice of chemical used for raising the pH often depends on the carbonate alkalinity in the water. Addition of such chemicals increases the carbonate ion concentration, forcing precipitation of calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate at even higher pH. Ultimately, the water hardness is reduced. 

For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimise the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings. Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) does not necessarily mean that lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water. The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.

===Coagulation and flocculation===
One of the first steps in most conventional water purification processes is the addition of chemicals to assist in the removal of particles suspended in water. Particles can be inorganic such as clay and silt or organic such as algae, bacteria, viruses, protozoa and natural organic matter. Inorganic and organic particles contribute to the turbidity and colour of water.

The addition of inorganic coagulants such as aluminium sulfate (or alum) or iron (III) salts such as iron(III) chloride cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on and among the particles. Within seconds, negative charges on the particles are neutralised by inorganic coagulants. Also within seconds, metal hydroxide precipitates of the iron and aluminium ions begin to form. These precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as Brownian motion and through induced mixing which is sometimes referred to as flocculation. Amorphous metal hydroxides are known as &quot;floc&quot;. Large, amorphous aluminium and iron (III) hydroxides adsorb and enmesh particles in suspension and facilitate the removal of particles by subsequent processes of sedimentation and filtration.

Aluminum hydroxides are formed within a fairly narrow pH range, typically: 5.5 to about 7.7. Iron (III) hydroxides can form over a larger pH range including pH levels lower than are effective for alum, typically: 5.0 to 8.5.

In the literature, there is much debate and confusion over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculation: Where does coagulation end and flocculation begin? In water purification plants, there is usually a high energy, rapid mix unit process (detention time in seconds) whereby the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins (detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes) where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc. In fact, coagulation and flocculation processes are ongoing once the metal salt coagulants are added.

Organic polymers were developed in the 1960s as aids to coagulants and, in some cases, as replacements for the inorganic metal salt coagulants. Synthetic organic polymers are high molecular weight compounds that carry negative, positive or neutral charges. When organic polymers are added to water with particulates, the high molecular weight compounds adsorb onto particle surfaces and through interparticle bridging coalesce with other particles to form floc. PolyDADMAC is a popular cationic (positively charged) organic polymer used in water purification plants.

===Sedimentation===
Waters exiting the flocculation basin may enter the sedimentation basin, also called a clarifier or settling basin. It is a large tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.

In 1904, Allen Hazen showed that the efficiency of a sedimentation process was a function of the particle settling velocity, the flow through the tank and the surface area of tank. Sedimentation tanks are typically designed within a range of overflow rates of 0.5 to 1.0 gallons per minute per square foot (or 1250 to 2500 litres per square meter per hour). In general, sedimentation basin efficiency is not a function of detention time or depth of the basin. Although, basin depth must be sufficient so that water currents do not disturb the sludge and settled particle interactions are promoted. As particle concentrations in the settled water increase near the sludge surface on the bottom of the tank, settling velocities can increase due to collisions and agglomeration of particles. Typical detention times for sedimentation vary from 1.5 to 4 hours and basin depths vary from 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters).

Lamella clarifiers, inclined flat plates or tubes can be added to traditional sedimentation basins to improve particle removal performance. Inclined plates and tubes drastically increase the surface area available for particles to be removed in concert with Hazen&#x27;s original theory. The amount of ground surface area occupied by a sedimentation basin with inclined plates or tubes can be far smaller than a conventional sedimentation basin.

====Sludge storage and removal====
As particles settle to the bottom of a sedimentation basin, a layer of sludge is formed on the floor of the tank which must be removed and treated. The amount of sludge generated is significant, often 3 to 5 per cent of the total volume of water to be treated. The cost of treating and disposing of the sludge can impact the operating cost of a water treatment plant. The sedimentation basin may be equipped with mechanical cleaning devices that continually clean its bottom, or the basin can be periodically taken out of service and cleaned manually.

====Floc blanket clarifiers====
A subcategory of sedimentation is the removal of particulates by entrapment in a layer of suspended floc as the water is forced upward. The major advantage of floc blanket clarifiers is that they occupy a smaller footprint than conventional sedimentation. The disadvantages are that particle removal efficiency can be highly variable depending on changes in influent water quality and influent water flow rate.

===Dissolved air flotation===
When particles to be removed do not settle out of solution easily, dissolved air flotation (DAF) is often used. After coagulation and flocculation processes, water flows to DAF tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to the floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc. The floating floc blanket is removed from the surface and clarified water is withdrawn from the bottom of the DAF tank.
Water supplies that are particularly vulnerable to unicellular algae blooms and supplies with low turbidity and high colour often employ DAF.

===Filtration===

After separating most floc, the water is filtered as the final step to remove remaining suspended particles and unsettled floc.

====Rapid sand filters====

The most common type of filter is a rapid sand filter. Water moves vertically downward through sand which often has a layer of activated carbon or anthracite coal above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute to taste and odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles, so simple filtration is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles. Effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.
To clean the filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, opposite the normal direction (called &quot;backflushing&quot; or &quot;backwashing&quot;) to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown up through the bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process; this is known as &quot;air scouring&quot;. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.

Some water treatment plants employ pressure filters. These work on the same principle as rapid gravity filters, differing in that the filter medium is enclosed in a steel vessel and the water is forced through it under pressure.

Advantages:

* Filters out much smaller particles than paper and sand filters can.
* Filters out virtually all particles larger than their specified pore sizes.
* They are quite thin and so liquids flow through them fairly rapidly.
* They are reasonably strong and so can withstand pressure differences across them of typically 2–5 atmospheres.
* They can be cleaned (back flushed) and reused.

====Slow sand filters====

Slow sand filters may be used where there is sufficient land and space, as the water flows very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. They are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, at the bottom and the finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or Schmutzdecke, on the surface of the filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months, if the pretreatment is well designed, and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when the flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.

====Bank filtration====
In bank filtration, natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide the first stage of contaminant filtration. While typically not clean enough to be used directly for drinking water, the water gained from the associated extraction wells is much less problematic than river water taken directly from the river.

====Membrane filtration====
Membrane filters are widely used for filtering both drinking water and sewage. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2 μm—including &quot;Giardia&quot; and &quot;Cryptosporidium.&quot; Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river that is used by towns further downstream. They are widely used in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including bottled water). However no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as phosphates, nitrates and heavy metal ions.

===Removal of ions and other dissolved substances===
Ultrafiltration membranes use polymer membranes with chemically formed microscopic pores that can be used to filter out dissolved substances avoiding the use of coagulants. The type of membrane media determines how much pressure is needed to drive the water through and what sizes of micro-organisms can be filtered out.

Ion exchange: Ion-exchange systems use ion-exchange resin- or zeolite-packed columns to replace unwanted ions. The most common case is water softening consisting of removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions replacing them with benign (soap friendly) Na+ or K+ ions. Ion-exchange resins are also used to remove toxic ions such as nitrite, lead, mercury, arsenic and many others.

Precipitative softening: Water rich in hardness (calcium and magnesium ions) is treated with lime (calcium oxide) and/or soda-ash (sodium carbonate) to precipitate calcium carbonate out of solution utilising the common-ion effect.

Electrodeionization: Water is passed between a positive electrode and a negative electrode. Ion-exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionised water is produced continuously, similar to ion-exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible if the right conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove non-ionic organic contaminants, and with gas transfer membranes to remove carbon dioxide. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.

===Disinfection===
Disinfection is accomplished both by filtering out harmful micro-organisms and by adding disinfectant chemicals. Water is disinfected to kill any pathogens which pass through the filters and to provide a residual dose of disinfectant to kill or inactivate potentially harmful micro-organisms in the storage and distribution systems. Possible pathogens include viruses, bacteria, including &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Cholera&quot;, &quot;Campylobacter&quot; and &quot;Shigella&quot;, and protozoa, including &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; and other &quot;cryptosporidia&quot;. After the introduction of any chemical disinfecting agent, the water is usually held in temporary storage – often called a contact tank or clear well – to allow the disinfecting action to complete.

====Chlorine disinfection====

The most common disinfection method involves some form of chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, there is a danger of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires more routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach, which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is inexpensive and also safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per litre (4 parts per million) are considered safe in drinking water.

All forms of chlorine are widely used, despite their respective drawbacks. One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by-products. These by-products, trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), are both carcinogenic in large quantities and are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the UK. The formation of THMs and haloacetic acids may be minimised by the effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition. Although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria, it has limited effectiveness against pathogenic protozoa that form cysts in water such as &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; and &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;.

====Chlorine dioxide disinfection====
Chlorine dioxide is a faster-acting disinfectant than elemental chlorine. It is relatively rarely used because in some circumstances it may create excessive amounts of chlorite, which is a by-product regulated to low allowable levels in the United States. Chlorine dioxide can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems; chlorine dioxide gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate.

====Chloramination====

The use of chloramine is becoming more common as a disinfectant. Although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant, it provides a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine because of its lower redox potential compared to free chlorine. It also does not readily form THMs or haloacetic acids (disinfection byproducts).

It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding ammonia to the water after adding chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience nitrification, as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.

====Ozone disinfection====
Ozone is an unstable molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidising agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms. It is a very strong, broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in Europe and in a few municipalities in the United States and Canada. Ozone disinfection, or ozonation, is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts. It also works well against almost all other pathogens. Ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a &quot;cold&quot; electrical discharge. To use ozone as a disinfectant, it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact. Some of the advantages of ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems (in comparison to chlorination). No residual ozone is left in the water. In the absence of a residual disinfectant in the water, chlorine or chloramine may be added throughout a distribution system to remove any potential pathogens in the distribution piping.

Ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in Nice, France. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted ozone as being safe; and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment, storage, and processing of foods. However, although fewer by-products are formed by ozonation, it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen bromate. Bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 parts per billion (ppb) of bromatethe maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA. Ozone disinfection is also energy intensive.

====Ultraviolet disinfection====

Ultraviolet light (UV) is very effective at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light&#x27;s disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, a result of the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.

Over 2 million people in 28 developing countries use Solar Disinfection for daily drinking water treatment.

==== Ionizing radiation ====
Like UV, ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, and electron beams) has been used to sterilise water.

==== Bromination and iodinisation ====
Bromine and iodine can also be used as disinfectants. However, chlorine in water is over three times more effective as a disinfectant against &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; than an equivalent concentration of bromine, and over six times more effective than an equivalent concentration of iodine. Iodine is commonly used for portable water purification, and bromine is common as a swimming pool disinfectant.

===Portable water purification===

Portable water purification devices and methods are available for disinfection and treatment in emergencies or in remote locations. Disinfection is the primary goal, since aesthetic considerations such as taste, odour, appearance, and trace chemical contamination do not affect the short-term safety of drinking water.

===Additional treatment options===
#Water fluoridation: in many areas fluoride is added to water with the goal of preventing tooth decay. Fluoride is usually added after the disinfection process. In the U.S., fluoridation is usually accomplished by the addition of hexafluorosilicic acid, which decomposes in water, yielding fluoride ions.
#Water conditioning: This is a method of reducing the effects of hard water. In water systems subject to heating hardness salts can be deposited as the decomposition of bicarbonate ions creates carbonate ions that precipitate out of solution. Water with high concentrations of hardness salts can be treated with soda ash (sodium carbonate) which precipitates out the excess salts, through the common-ion effect, producing calcium carbonate of very high purity. The precipitated calcium carbonate is traditionally sold to the manufacturers of toothpaste. Several other methods of industrial and residential water treatment are claimed (without general scientific acceptance) to include the use of magnetic and/or electrical fields reducing the effects of hard water.
#Plumbosolvency reduction: In areas with naturally acidic waters of low conductivity (i.e. surface rainfall in upland mountains of igneous rocks), the water may be capable of dissolving lead from any lead pipes that it is carried in. The addition of small quantities of phosphate ion and increasing the pH slightly both assist in greatly reducing plumbo-solvency by creating insoluble lead salts on the inner surfaces of the pipes.
#Radium Removal: Some groundwater sources contain radium, a radioactive chemical element. Typical sources include many groundwater sources north of the Illinois River in Illinois, United States of America. Radium can be removed by ion exchange, or by water conditioning. The back flush or sludge that is produced is, however, a low-level radioactive waste.
#Fluoride Removal: Although fluoride is added to water in many areas, some areas of the world have excessive levels of natural fluoride in the source water. Excessive levels can be toxic or cause undesirable cosmetic effects such as staining of teeth. Methods of reducing fluoride levels is through treatment with activated alumina and bone char filter media.

==Other water purification techniques==
Other popular methods for purifying water, especially for local private supplies are listed below. In some countries some of these methods are used for large scale municipal supplies. Particularly important are distillation (desalination of seawater) and reverse osmosis.

=== Thermal ===
Bringing water to its boiling point (about 100 °C or 212 F at sea level), is the oldest and most effective way since it eliminates most microbes causing intestinal disease, but it cannot remove chemical toxins or impurities. For human health, complete sterilisation of water is not required, since heat resistant microbes do not affect intestines. The traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for additional safety, since microbes start expiring at temperatures greater than . Though the boiling point decreases with increasing altitude, it is not enough to affect disinfection. In areas where the water is &quot;hard&quot; (that is, containing significant dissolved calcium salts), boiling decomposes the bicarbonate ions, resulting in partial precipitation as calcium carbonate. This is the &quot;fur&quot; that builds up on kettle elements, etc., in hard water areas. With the exception of calcium, boiling does not remove solutes of higher boiling point than water and in fact increases their concentration (due to some water being lost as vapour). Boiling does not leave a residual disinfectant in the water. Therefore, water that is boiled and then stored for any length of time may acquire new pathogens.

=== Adsorption ===
Granular activated carbon is a form of activated carbon with a high surface area. It adsorbs many compounds including many toxic compounds. Water passing through activated carbon is commonly used in municipal regions with organic contamination, taste or odors. Many household water filters and fish tanks use activated carbon filters to purify water. Household filters for drinking water sometimes contain silver as metallic silver nanoparticle. If water is held in the carbon block for longer periods, microorganisms can grow inside which results in fouling and contamination. Silver nanoparticles are excellent anti-bacterial material and can decompose toxic halo-organic compounds such as pesticides into non-toxic organic products. Filtered water must be used soon after it is filtered, as the low amount of remaining microbes may proliferate over time. In general, these home filters remove over 90% of the chlorine in a glass of treated water. These filters must be periodically replaced otherwise the bacterial content of the water may actually increase due to the growth of bacteria within the filter unit.

=== Distillation ===
Distillation involves boiling water to produce water vapour. The vapour contacts a cool surface where it condenses as a liquid. Because the solutes are not normally vaporised, they remain in the boiling solution. Even distillation does not completely purify water, because of contaminants with similar boiling points and droplets of unvapourised liquid carried with the steam. However, 99.9% pure water can be obtained by distillation.

Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) passes heated seawater along the surface of a hydrophobic polymer membrane. Evaporated water passes from the hot side through pores in the membrane forming a stream of cold pure water on the other side. The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through.

=== Reverse osmosis ===
Reverse osmosis involves mechanical pressure applied to force water through a semi-permeable membrane. Contaminants are left on the other side of the membrane. Reverse osmosis is theoretically the most thorough method of large scale water purification available, although perfect semi-permeable membranes are difficult to create. Unless membranes are well-maintained, algae and other life forms can colonise the membranes.

=== Crystallization ===
Carbon dioxide or other low molecular weight gas can be mixed with contaminated water at high pressure and low temperature to exothermically form gas hydrate crystals. Hydrate may be separated by centrifuge or sedimentation. Water can be released from the hydrate crystals by heating.

=== &quot;In situ&quot; oxidation ===
&quot;In situ&quot; chemical oxidation (ISCO) is an advanced oxidation process. It is used for soil and/or groundwater remediation to reduce the concentrations of targeted contaminants. ISCO is accomplished by injecting or otherwise introducing oxidizers into the contaminated medium (soil or groundwater) to destroy contaminants. It can be used to remediate a variety of organic compounds, including some that are resistant to natural degradation

=== Bioremediation ===
Bioremediation uses microorganisms to remove waste products from a contaminated area. Since 1991 bioremediation has been a suggested tactic to remove impurities such as alkanes, perchlorates, and metals. Bioremediation has seen success because perchlorates are highly soluble, making them difficult to remove. Example applications of &quot;Dechloromonas agitata&quot; strain CKB include field studies conducted in Maryland and the US Southwest.

=== Hydrogen peroxide ===
Hydrogen peroxide () is a common disinfectant that can purify water. It is typically produced at chemical plants and transported to the contaminated water. An alternative approach employs a gold-palladium catalyst to synthesize from ambient hydrogen and oxygen atoms at the use site. The latter was reported to be faster and 107 times more potent at killing &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; than commercial , and over 108 times more effective than chlorine The catalytic reaction also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that bind and degrade other compounds.

==Safety and controversies==

In April 2007, the water supply of Spencer, Massachusetts in the United States of America, became contaminated with excess sodium hydroxide (lye) when its treatment equipment malfunctioned.

Many municipalities have moved from free chlorine to chloramine as a disinfection agent. However, chloramine appears to be a corrosive agent in some water systems. Chloramine can dissolve the &quot;protective&quot; film inside older service lines, leading to the leaching of lead into residential spigots. This can result in harmful exposure, including elevated blood lead levels. Lead is a known neurotoxin.

===Demineralized water===
Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals. This results in demineralised water which is not considered ideal drinking water. The World Health Organization has investigated the health effects of demineralised water since 1980. Experiments in humans found that demineralised water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased blood serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium, and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium, which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants, when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10 mg/L with 20–30 mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20 mg/L minimum and a 40–80 mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2 to 4 mmol/L. At water hardness above 5 mmol/L, higher incidence of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. Additionally, desalination processes can increase the risk of bacterial contamination.

Manufacturers of home water distillers claim the opposite—that minerals in water are the cause of many diseases, and that most beneficial minerals come from food, not water.

==History==
The first experiments into water filtration were made in the 17th century. Sir Francis Bacon attempted to desalinate sea water by passing the flow through a sand filter. Although his experiment did not succeed, it marked the beginning of a new interest in the field. The fathers of microscopy, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and Robert Hooke, used the newly invented microscope to observe for the first time small material particles that lay suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of waterborne pathogens.

===Sand filter===

The first documented use of sand filters to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in Paisley, Scotland, John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer James Simpson for the Chelsea Waterworks Company in London in 1829. This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the United Kingdom in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream and common, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician John Snow during the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant miasma theory that stated that diseases were caused by noxious &quot;bad airs&quot;. Although the germ theory of disease had not yet been developed, Snow&#x27;s observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay &quot;On the Mode of Communication of Cholera&quot; conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in Soho, with the use of a dot distribution map and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The Metropolis Water Act introduced the regulation of the water supply companies in London, including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act &quot;made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water&quot;, and required that all water be &quot;effectually filtered&quot; from 31 December 1855. This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across Europe. The Metropolitan Commission of Sewers was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the Thames were established above Teddington Lock. Automatic pressure filters, where the water is forced under pressure through the filtration system, were innovated in 1899 in England.

===Water chlorination===

John Snow was the first to successfully use chlorine to disinfect the water supply in Soho that had helped spread the cholera outbreak. William Soper also used chlorinated lime to treat the sewage produced by typhoid patients in 1879.

In a paper published in 1894, Moritz Traube formally proposed the addition of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) to water to render it &quot;germ-free.&quot; Two other investigators confirmed Traube&#x27;s findings and published their papers in 1895. Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in Hamburg, Germany and in 1897 the city of Maidstone, England was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty slow sand filter and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln, England. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.
The first continuous use of chlorine in the United States for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the Rockaway River), which served as the supply for Jersey City, New Jersey. Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm. The treatment process was conceived by John L. Leal and the chlorination plant was designed by George Warren Fuller. Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the Indian Medical Service, Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account: 

U.S. Army Major Carl Rogers Darnall, Professor of Chemistry at the Army Medical School, gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910. Shortly thereafter, Major William J. L. Lyster of the Army Medical Department used a solution of calcium hypochlorite in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster&#x27;s method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag (also spelled Lister Bag). The bag was made of canvas and could hold 36 gallons of water. It was porous and held up by ropes, purifying water with the help of calcium hypochlorite solution. Each bag had a faucet attached, which was used to flush water for testing, as well as dispensing for use. This became the basis for present day systems of municipal water &quot;purification&quot;.

== Global ==
According to a 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) report, 1.1 billion people lack access to an improved drinking water supply; 88% of the 4 billion annual cases of diarrheal disease are attributed to unsafe water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene, while 1.8 million people die from diarrhoeal disease each year. The WHO estimates that 94% of these diarrhoeal disease cases are preventable through modifications to the environment, including access to safe water. Simple techniques for treating water at home, such as chlorination, filters, and solar disinfection, and for storing it in safe containers could save a huge number of lives each year. Reducing deaths from waterborne diseases is a major public health goal in developing countries.

The global water purification market is worth 22 billion dollars. Home water filters and purifiers in India are common.

<text>Johann Michael Friedrich Rückert (16 May 1788 – 31 January 1866) was a German poet, translator, and professor of Oriental languages.

==Biography==
Johann Michael Friedrich Rückert was born 16 May 1788 in Schweinfurt and was the eldest son of a lawyer, Johann Adam Rückert, and his wife, Maria Barbara ( Schwappach). He was educated at the local &quot;Gymnasium&quot; and at the universities of Würzburg and Heidelberg. From 1816 to 1817, he worked on the editorial staff of the &quot;Morgenblatt&quot; at Stuttgart. Nearly the whole of the year 1818 he spent in Rome, and afterwards he lived for several years at Coburg (1820–1826), where he married Luise Wiethaus-Fischer in 1821.

He was appointed a professor of Oriental languages at the University of Erlangen in 1826, and, in 1841, he was called to a similar position in Berlin, where he was also made a privy councillor. In 1849 he resigned his professorship at Berlin, and went to live full-time in his &quot;Gut&quot; (estate) at Neuses (now a part of Coburg).

When Rückert began his literary career, Germany was at war with Napoleon; and in his first volume, &quot;Deutsche Gedichte&quot; (&quot;German Poems&quot;), published in 1814 under the pseudonym Freimund Raimar, he gave, particularly in the powerful &quot;Geharnischte Sonette&quot; (&quot;Sonnets in Arms/Harsh Words&quot;), vigorous expression to the prevailing sentiment of his countrymen. From 1815 to 1818, appeared &quot;Napoleon, eine politische Komödie in drei Stücken&quot; (&quot;Napoleon, a Political Comedy in Three Parts&quot;), of which only two parts were published. In 1817, &quot;Der Kranz der Zeit&quot; (&quot;The Wreath of Time&quot;), was published.

He issued a collection of poems, &quot;Östliche Rosen&quot; (&quot;Eastern Roses&quot;), in 1822; and from 1834 to 1838 his &quot;Gesammelte Gedichte&quot; (&quot;Collected Poems&quot;) were published in six volumes, a selection which has passed through many editions.

Rückert was master of thirty languages and made his mark chiefly as a translator of Oriental poetry and as a writer of poems conceived in the spirit of Oriental masters. Much attention was attracted by a translation of the &quot;Maqamat&quot; of Al-Hariri of Basra (&quot;Hariris Makamen&quot;) in 1826, &quot;Nal und Damajanti&quot;, an Indian tale, in 1828, &quot;Rostem und Suhrab, eine Heldengeschichte&quot; (&quot;Rostem and Suhrab, a Story of Heroes&quot;) in 1830, and &quot;Hamasa, oder die ältesten arabischen Volkslieder&quot; (&quot;Hamasa, or the Oldest Arabian Folk Songs&quot;) in 1846.

Among his original writings dealing with Oriental subjects are:

*&quot;Morgenländische Sagen und Geschichten&quot; (&quot;Oriental Myths and Poems&quot;) (1837)
*&quot;Erbauliches und Beschauliches aus dem Morgenland&quot; (&quot;Edifying and Contemplative, from the Orient&quot;) (1836–1838)
*&quot;Brahmanische Erzählungen&quot; (&quot;Brahmin Stories&quot;) (1839).

The most elaborate of his works is &quot;Die Weisheit des Brahmanen&quot; (&quot;The Wisdom of the Brahmins&quot;), published in six volumes from 1836 to 1839. The former and &quot;Liebesfrühling&quot; (&quot;Spring of Love&quot;) (1844), a cycle of love-songs, are the best known of all Rückert&#x27;s productions.

From 1843 to 1845 he issued the dramas &quot;Saul und David&quot; (1843), &quot;Herodes der Große&quot; (&quot;Herod the Great&quot;) (1844), &quot;Kaiser Heinrich IV&quot; (1845) and &quot;Christofero Colombo&quot; (1845), all of which are considered greatly inferior to the work to which he owes his place in German literature. At the time of the Danish war in 1864 he wrote &quot;Ein Dutzend Kampflieder für Schleswig-Holstein&quot; (&quot;A Dozen Battle Songs for Schleswig-Holstein&quot;), which, although published anonymously, made considerable impression on audiences.

Rückert died in 1866, aged 77, in , now part of Coburg. He is buried in the cemetery there.

Rückert&#x27;s poetry was commonly set to music and there are about 121 settings of his work – making him the fourth most-set German poet, behind Goethe, Heine and Rilke. Among the composers who set his poetry to music are Schubert, Robert and Clara Schumann, Brahms (including &quot;Two Songs for Voice, Viola and Piano&quot;, among others), Josef Rheinberger, Mahler (song cycles &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; and &quot;Rückert-Lieder&quot;), Max Bruch, Max Reger, and Elise Schmezer.

==Memorials==
A monument to Rückert is situated at Marktplatz in Schweinfurt. The monument of Rückert, whose birth house stands at the southeast corner of the town hall, has stood in the central square of Schweinfurt since 1890. It was created by architect Friedrich Ritter von Thiersch and sculptor Wilhelm von Rühmann. Allegorical figures from his works – &quot;Geharnischte Sonette&quot; (&quot;Withering Sonnets&quot;) and &quot;Weisheit des Brahmanen&quot; (&quot;Wisdom of the Brahmans&quot;) – are situated at the feet of the bronze Rückert.

Rückert is also commemorated by a small museum in his home at Neuses (now in Friedrich-Rückert-Strasse) and a park, &quot;Rückertpark&quot; which also features a memorial bust.

==Literature==

A comprehensive but by no means complete edition of Rückert&#x27;s poetical works appeared in 12 volumes in 1868–1869. Subsequent editions have been edited by L. Laistner (1896), C. Beyer (1896), G. Ellinger (1897). See B. Fortlage, &quot;F. Rückert und seine Werke&quot; (1867); C. Beyer, &quot;Friedrich Rückert, ein biographisches Denkmal&quot; (1868), &quot;Neue Mitteilungen über Rückert&quot; (1873), and &quot;Nachgelassene Gedichte Rückerts und neue Beiträge zu dessen Leben und Schriften&quot; (1877); R. Boxberger, &quot;Rückert-Studien&quot; (1878); P. de Lagarde, &quot;Erinnerungen an F. Rückert&quot; (1886); F. Muncker, &quot;Friedrich Rückert&quot; (1890); G.
