<text>Grape phylloxera is an insect pest of grapevines worldwide, originally native to eastern North America. Grape phylloxera (&quot;Daktulosphaira vitifoliae&quot; (Fitch 1855) belongs to the family Phylloxeridae, within the order Hemiptera, bugs); originally described in France as &quot;Phylloxera vastatrix&quot;; equated to the previously described &quot;Daktulosphaera vitifoliae&quot;, &quot;Phylloxera vitifoliae&quot;. The insect is commonly just called phylloxera (; from , leaf, and , dry).

These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects, related to aphids, feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, the resulting deformations on roots (&quot;nodosities&quot; and &quot;tuberosities&quot;) and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some &quot;Vitis&quot; species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.

American vine species (such as &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot;) have evolved to have several natural defenses against phylloxera. The roots of the American vines exude a sticky sap that repels the nymph form by clogging its mouth when it tries to feed from the vine. If the nymph is successful in creating a feeding wound on the root, American vines respond by forming a protective layer of tissue to cover the wound and protect it from secondary bacterial or fungal infections.

Currently there is no cure for phylloxera and unlike other grape diseases such as powdery or downy mildew, there is no chemical control or response. The only successful means of controlling phylloxera has been the grafting of phylloxera-resistant American rootstock (usually hybrid varieties created from the &quot;Vitis berlandieri&quot;, &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; and &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; species) to more susceptible European &quot;vinifera&quot; vines.

==Biology==

Phylloxera has a complex life-cycle of up to 18 stages, that can be divided into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.

The &quot;sexual form&quot; begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine&#x27;s trunk. This egg develops into the &quot;leaf form&quot;. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs parthenogenetically in a leaf gall that she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the &quot;root form&quot;. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that stops it from healing. This poison eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces by laying eggs for up to seven more generations (which also can reproduce parthenogenetically) each summer. These offspring spread to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge next spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the &quot;winged form&quot;, else they perform the same role without wings. These nymphs start the cycle again by either staying on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same.
Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but it has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.

==Fighting the &quot;phylloxera plague&quot;==
In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France. Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the European mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France. The problem spread rapidly across the continent. In France alone, total wine production fell from 84.5 million hectolitres in 1875 to only 23.4 million hectolitres in 1889. Some estimates hold that between two-thirds and nine-tenths of all European vineyards were destroyed.

In France, one of the desperate measures of grape growers was to bury a live toad under each vine to draw out the &quot;poison&quot;. Areas with soils composed principally of sand or schist were spared, and the spread was slowed in dry climates, but gradually phylloxera spread across the continent. A significant amount of research was devoted to finding a solution to the phylloxera problem, and two major solutions gradually emerged: grafting cuttings onto resistant rootstocks and hybridization.

===Response===

By the end of the 19th century, hybridization became a popular avenue of research for stopping phylloxera. Hybridization is the breeding of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; with resistant species. Most native American grapes are naturally phylloxera resistant (&quot;Vitis aestivalis&quot;, &quot;rupestris&quot;, and &quot;riparia&quot; are particularly so, while &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; has a somewhat weak resistance to it) but have aromas that are off-putting to palates accustomed to European grapes. The intent of the cross was to generate a hybrid vine that was resistant to phylloxera but produced wine that did not taste like the American grape. The hybrids tend not to be especially resistant to phylloxera, although they are much hardier with respect to climate and other vine diseases. The new hybrid varieties have never gained the popularity of the traditional ones. In the EU they are generally banned or at least strongly discouraged from use in quality wine, although they are still in widespread use in much of North America, such as Missouri, Ontario, and upstate New York.

===Grafting with resistant rootstock===

Use of a resistant, or tolerant, rootstock, developed by Charles Valentine Riley in collaboration with J. E. Planchon and promoted by T. V. Munson, involved grafting a &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; scion onto the roots of a resistant &quot;Vitis aestivalis&quot; or other American native species. This is the preferred method today, because the rootstock does not interfere with the development of the wine grapes (more technically, the genes responsible for the grapes are not in the rootstock but in the scion), and it furthermore allows the customization of the rootstock to soil and weather conditions, as well as desired vigor.

Not all rootstocks are equally resistant. Between the 1960s and the 1980s in California, many growers used a rootstock called AxR1. Even though it had already failed in many parts of the world by the early twentieth century, it was thought to be resistant by growers in California. Although phylloxera initially did not feed heavily on AxR1 roots, within twenty years, mutation and selective pressures within the phylloxera population began to overcome this rootstock, resulting in the eventual failure of most vineyards planted on AxR1. The replanting of afflicted vineyards continues today.

Many have suggested that this failure was predictable, as one parent of AxR1 is in fact a susceptible &quot;V. vinifera&quot; cultivar. But the transmission of phylloxera tolerance is more complex, as is demonstrated by the continued success of 41B, an F1 hybrid of &quot;Vitis berlandieri&quot; and &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;. Modern phylloxera infestation also occurs when wineries are in need of fruit immediately, and choose to plant ungrafted vines rather than wait for grafted vines to be available.
The use of resistant American rootstock to guard against phylloxera also brought about a debate that remains unsettled to this day: whether self-rooted vines produce better wine than those that are grafted. Of course, the argument is essentially irrelevant wherever phylloxera exists. Had American rootstock not been available and used, there would be no &quot;V. vinifera&quot; wine industry in Europe or most places other than Chile, Washington State, and most of Australia. Cyprus was spared by the phylloxera plague, and thus its wine stock has not been grafted for phylloxera resistant purposes.

===Aftermath===

The only European grapes that are natively resistant to phylloxera are the Assyrtiko grape which grows on the volcanic island of Santorini, Greece, although it is not clear whether the resistance is due to the rootstock itself or the volcanic ash on which it grows; and the Juan Garcia grape variety, autochthonous to the medieval village of Fermoselle in Spain. The Juan Garcia variety remained—untouched by phylloxera—sheltered on the vineyards planted on the man-made land terraces along the mountainous skirts on the gigantic and steep Duero Arribes / Douro River Canyon, where the microclimatic conditions discourage the growth of phylloxera.

To escape the threat of phylloxera, wines have been produced since 1979 on the sandy beaches of Provence&#x27;s Bouches-du-Rhône, which extends from the coastline of the Gard region to the waterfront village of Saintes Maries de la Mer. The sand, sun and wind in this area has been a major deterrent to phylloxera. The wine produced here is called &quot;Vins des Sables&quot; or &quot;wines of the sands&quot;. In the same department, where the canal irrigation system built by the Romans still partly persists to this day, winter flooding is also practiced where possible, for instance south of the city of Tarascon. Flooding the vineyards for 50 days kills all the nymphs that overwinter in the roots or the bark at the bottom of the plant.

Some regions were so blighted by phylloxera that they never recovered, and instead the producers switched crops entirely. The island of Mallorca is one example, where almonds now substitute for vines.

==Vines that survived phylloxera==

According to wine critic and author Kerin O&#x27;Keefe, thanks to tiny parcels of vineyards throughout Europe which were inexplicably unscathed, some vineyards still exist as they were before the phylloxera devastation.

So far, most Chilean wine has remained phylloxera free. It is isolated from the rest of the world by the Atacama Desert to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Andes Mountains to the east. Phylloxera has also never been found in several wine-growing regions of Australia, including Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia. Australia has strong internal biosecurity controls to minimise the risk of phylloxera spreading beyond &#x27;Phylloxera Infested Zones&#x27; in parts of Victoria and New South Wales. The Riesling of the Mosel region has also remained untouched by phylloxera; the parasite is unable to survive in the slate soil.

Until 2005, three tiny parcels of ungrafted Pinot noir that escaped phylloxera were used to produce Bollinger Vieilles Vignes Françaises, one of the rarest and most expensive Champagnes available. In 2004, one of the parcels, Croix Rouge in Bouzy, died from phylloxera and was replanted with grafted rootstock.

A rare vintage port is made from ungrafted vines grown on a small parcel, called Nacional, in the heart of the Quinta do Noval. It is unknown why this plot survived.

Another vineyard unaffected by the phylloxera is the Lisini estate in Montalcino in Italy, a half-hectare vineyard of Sangiovese with vines dating back to the mid-1800s. Since 1985, the winery has produced a few bottles of Prefillossero (Italian for &quot;before the phylloxera&quot;). The wine has a following, including Italian wine critic Luigi Veronelli who inscribed on a bottle of the 1987 at the winery that drinking Prefillossero was like listening to &#x27;the earth singing to the sky&#x27;.

Jumilla in southeastern Spain is an important area of ungrafted vineyards, mainly from Monastrell grapes. Those vineyards, however, are not immune to the insect, which is slowly advancing and destroying the Pie Franco vineyard of the Casa Castillo estate, planted in 1942, i.e., when phylloxera had already been in the region for five decades.

Large swaths of vineyards on the slopes of Sicily&#x27;s volcano Mount Etna also remain free of phylloxera. Some vines are more than one-hundred-fifty years old, predating the phylloxera infestation in Sicily (1879–1880). Part of the reason for this is the high concentration of silica sand and very low (less than 3%) concentration of clay in the volcanic soils. In this environment (&gt; 400m AMSL), the surface water from heavy bouts of rain seals the soil so perfectly that it drowns phylloxera before they are able to thrive.

Bien Nacido Vineyard in Santa Maria Valley AVA of Santa Barbara, CA is a phylloxera-free vineyard. Despite being planted on its own roots, with UC Davis virus-free clones, the vineyard has never been affected by phylloxera. The high percentage of sand in the soil creates a mostly uninhabitable substrate for phylloxera. While Bien Nacido has not been affected, there is a potential, as all of the vines are true &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; without scions or grafting. Many of the old vines were planted in 1973 and fall within the blocks G, N, Q and W. The wines of Bien Nacido Estate have a high percentage of these ungrafted and phylloxera-free vines within the cuvée.

Colares vineyards, native to the Portuguese region of Sintra are grown on 3–4 metres of sand, and are therefore unaffected by phylloxera.

<doc id="223506" wikidata="Q2704379" url="?curid=223506" title="Pull-off">
<text>A pull-off is a stringed instrument playing and articulation technique performed by plucking or &quot;pulling&quot; the finger that is grasping the sounding part of a string off the fingerboard of either a fretted or unfretted instrument. This intermediate- to advanced playing technique is done using the tip of a finger or fingernail on the fretting hand. Pull-offs are done to facilitate the playing of embellishments and ornaments such as grace notes. Pull-offs may be notated in sheet music or improvised by the performer, depending on the musical style and context.

==Performance and effect==

A pull-off is performed on a string which is already vibrating; when the fretting finger is pulled off (exposing the string either as open or as stopped by another fretting finger &quot;lower&quot; on the same string, with &quot;lower&quot; meaning in a position that is lower in pitch) the note playing on the string changes to the new, longer vibrating length of the string. Pull-offs are performed on both fretted instruments (e.g., electric guitar) and unfretted instruments (e.g., violin). They are used to sound grace notes with the transition from one note to the other sounding gentler and less percussive because the string is not picked or bowed again by the typical picking/bowing hand to produce the sound of the second note.

In the transition between the initial and final notes, the string may vibrate in an inharmonic manner for several cycles if it is plucked with the fretting finger, because the string is being plucked in a part of the string not usually used for plucking. The result, a slight &quot;quack&quot; sound, may be particularly audible when the interval of the pull-off is large. This transition also consumes some of the vibrational energy in the sounded string, with the effect that the second note is generally much quieter than the original. On a low-pitched string that is being bowed on a stopped note, say, at the halfway point of the vibrating string length, the player may left-hand flick the string immediately prior to sounding the deep-pitched open string to help the string &quot;speak&quot;. Without the left-hand &quot;flick&quot;, there could be a half-second delay in the sounding of the deep fundamental.

===Acoustic versus electric instruments===
On most acoustic instruments, this means the second note has little sustain. As a result, in acoustic music, pull-offs are primarily used as an embellishment. Performers of plucked instruments tend to use &quot;pull-offs&quot; when playing grace notes, usually in conjunction with multiple hammer-ons and strumming or picking to produce a rapid, rippling effect. In rock and heavy metal music, electric guitars are often performed with overdriven amplifiers and/or guitar effects such as distortion pedals and compression pedals are used, which add substantial sustain to the sound. With this type of electronic gear and a powerful instrument amplifier nearing the threshold of feedback, pull-offs can even be used to play sustained notes.

In a variation of the technique, often called a &quot;flick-off&quot;, the pulling-off finger is dragged slightly across the face of the string while performing the pull-off. This results in the string being gently sounded, either by the player&#x27;s finger callus or by their fretting-finger fingernail. This increases the volume and sustain of the pulled-off note, although the sound of the fretting finger dragging over the string may be audible on both an amplified instrument and on a brightly strung acoustic instrument.

===Left-hand pizzicato===
Classical music of the late romantic period features numerous applications of the technique to bowed string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass. In the classical context, the term is referred to as left-handed pizzicato.

When a player switches from arco (bowing) to regular pizzicato, the player normally requires a short pause to switch his or her bowing hand into pizzicato position and pluck the string. With left-hand pizzicato, though, a string player can play a pizzicato note immediately following a bowed note; thus, left-hand pizzicato provides a means to intersperse pizzicato notes into rapid passages of bowed notes. The string on which the note is played may be either open or stopped (fingered); the only requirement for using the technique on a stopped string is that the finger stopping the string be lower than the finger plucking the string.

Left-hand pizzicato appears most prominently in violin &quot;virtuoso pieces&quot; such as Pablo de Sarasate&#x27;s Zigeunerweisen and Paganini&#x27;s 24th Caprice.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;pull-off&quot; was invented and popularized by Pete Seeger in his book &quot;How to Play the 5-String Banjo&quot;. Seeger also invented the term &quot;hammer-on&quot;.

<text>A beehive is an enclosed structure where some honey bee species of the subgenus &quot;Apis&quot; live and raise their young. Though the word &quot;beehive&quot; is used to describe the nest of any bee colony, scientific and professional literature distinguishes &quot;nest&quot; from &quot;hive&quot;. &quot;Nest&quot; is used to discuss colonies that house themselves in natural or artificial cavities or are hanging and exposed. The term &quot;hive&quot; is used to describe an artificial/man-made structure to house a honey bee nest. Several species of &quot;Apis&quot; live in colonies. But for honey production, the western honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) and the eastern honey bee (&quot;Apis cerana&quot;) are the main species kept in hives.

The nest&#x27;s internal structure is a densely packed group of hexagonal prismatic cells made of beeswax, called a honeycomb. The bees use the cells to store food (honey and pollen) and to house the brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae).

Beehives serve several purposes. These include producing honey, pollinating nearby crops, housing bees for apitherapy treatment, and mitigating the effects of colony collapse disorder. In America, hives are commonly transported so bees can pollinate crops elsewhere. Several patents have been issued for beehive designs.

== Honey bee nests ==
Honey bees use caves, rock cavities, and hollow trees as natural nesting sites. In warmer climates, they may build exposed hanging nests; members of other subgenera have exposed aerial combs. Multiple parallel honeycombs form the hive with a relatively uniform bee space. It usually has a single entrance. Western honey bees prefer nest cavities approximately in volume and avoid those smaller than or larger than . Western honey bees show several nest-site preferences: the height above ground is usually between and , entrance positions tend to face downward, equatorial-facing entrances are favored, and nest sites over from the parent colony are preferred. Most bees occupy nests for several years.

The bees often smooth the bark surrounding the nest entrance and coat the cavity walls with a thin layer of hardened plant resin called propolis. Honeycombs are attached to the walls along the cavity tops and sides, but the bees leave passageways along the comb edges. The standard nest architecture for all honeybees is similar: honey is stored in the upper part of the comb; beneath it are rows of pollen-storage cells, worker-brood cells, and drone-brood cells, in that order. The peanut-shaped queen cells are normally built at the lower edge of the comb.

== Ancient hives ==
In antiquity, Egyptians kept bees in human-made hives. The walls of the Egyptian sun temple of Nyuserre Ini from the 5th Dynasty, dated earlier than 2422 BCE, depict workers blowing smoke into hives as they remove honeycombs. Inscriptions detailing honey production are found on the tomb of Pabasa from the 26th Dynasty (), and describe honey stored in jars and cylindrical hives.

The archaeologist Amihai Mazar cites 30 intact hives that were discovered in the ruins of Tel Rehov, located in modern-day Israel. This is evidence that an advanced honey industry existed in Canaan approximately 4,000 years ago. The 150 beehives, many broken, were made of straw and unbaked clay. They were found in orderly rows. Ezra Marcus from the University of Haifa said the discovery provided a glimpse of ancient beekeeping seen in texts and ancient art from the Near East. An altar decorated with fertility figurines was found alongside the hives and may indicate religious practices associated with beekeeping. While beekeeping predates these ruins, this is the oldest apiary yet discovered.

== Traditional hives ==


Traditional beehives provided an enclosure for the bee colony. Because no internal structures were provided for the bees, they created their honeycomb within the hives. The comb is often cross-attached and cannot be moved without destroying it. This is sometimes called a &quot;fixed-frame&quot; hive to differentiate it from the modern &quot;movable-frame&quot; hives. Harvest often destroyed the hives, though some adaptations were using top baskets which could be removed when the bees filled them with honey. These were gradually supplanted with box hives of varying dimensions, with or without frames, and finally replaced by newer modern equipment.

Honey from traditional hives was extracted by &quot;pressing&quot; – crushing the wax honeycomb to squeeze out the contents. Due to this harvesting, traditional beehives provided more beeswax, but far less honey than a modern hive.

Four styles of traditional beehives are mud hives, clay/tile hives, skeps, and bee gums.

=== Mud hives ===

Mud hives are still used in Egypt and Siberia. These are long cylinders made from a mixture of unbaked mud, straw, and dung.

=== Clay hives ===

Clay tiles were the customary homes of kept bees in the eastern end of the Mediterranean. Long cylinders of baked clay were used in ancient Egypt, the Middle East, and to some extent in Greece, Italy, and Malta. They sometimes were used singly, but more often stacked in rows to provide some shade, at least for those not on top. Keepers would smoke one end to drive the bees to the other end while they harvested honey.

=== Skeps ===

Skeps, baskets placed open-end-down, have been used to house bees for some 2000 years. Believed to have been first used in Ireland, they were initially made from wicker plastered with mud and dung but after the Middle Ages, almost all were made of straw. In northern and western Europe, skeps were made of coils of grass or straw. In its simplest form, there is a single entrance at the bottom of the skep. Again, there is no internal structure provided for the bees and the colony must produce its honeycomb, which is attached to the inside of the skep. The size of early modern skeps was about two pecks to a bushel (18 to 36 liters).

Skeps have two disadvantages: beekeepers cannot inspect the comb for diseases and pests, and honey removal is difficult and often results in the destruction of the entire colony. To get the honey beekeepers either drove the bees out of the skep or, by using a bottom extension called an eke or a top extension called a cap, sought to create a comb with only honey in it. Quite often the bees were killed, sometimes using lighted sulfur, to allow the honeycomb to be removed. Skeps could also be squeezed in a vise to extract the honey.

As of 1998, most US states prohibited the use of skeps, or any other hive that cannot be inspected for disease and parasites.

Later skep designs included a smaller woven basket (cap) on top over a small hole in the main skep. This cap acted as a crude super, allowing some honey to be extracted with less destruction of brood and bees. In England, such an extension piece consisting of a ring of about 4 or 5 coils of straw placed below a straw beehive to give extra room for brood rearing was called an &quot;eke&quot;, &quot;imp,&quot; or &quot;nadir&quot;. An eke was used to give just a bit of extra room, or to &quot;eke&quot; some more space, a nadir is a larger extension used when a full story was needed beneath.

The term is derived from Old Norse &quot;skeppa&quot;, &quot;basket&quot;. A person who made such woven beehives was called a &quot;skepper&quot;, a surname that still exists in Western countries. In England the thickness of the coil of straw was controlled using a ring of leather or a piece of cow&#x27;s horn called a &quot;girth&quot; and the coils of straw could be sewn together using strips of briar. Likenesses of skeps can be found in paintings, carvings, and old manuscripts. The skep is often used on signs as an indication of industry (&quot;the busy bee&quot;).

In the late 18th century, more complex skeps appeared with wooden tops with holes in them over which glass jars were placed. The comb would then be built into the glass jars, making the designs commercially attractive.

=== Bee gums ===
In the eastern United States, especially in the Southeast, sections of hollow trees were used until the 20th century. These were called &quot;gums&quot; because they often were from black gum (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;) trees.

Sections of the hollow trees were set upright in &quot;bee yards&quot; or apiaries. Sometimes sticks or crossed sticks were placed under a board cover to give an attachment for the honeycomb. As with skeps, the harvest of honey from these destroyed the colony. Often the harvester would kill the bees before even opening their nest. This was done by inserting a metal container of burning sulfur into the gum. 

Natural tree hollows and artificially hollowed tree trunks were widely used in the past by beekeepers in Central Europe. For example, in Poland, such a beehive was called a &quot;barć&quot; and was protected in various ways from unfavorable weather conditions (rain, frost) and predators (woodpeckers, bears, pine martens, forest dormice). Harvest of honey from these did not destroy the colony, as only a protective piece of wood was removed from the opening and smoke was used to pacify the bees for a short time. Spain still uses cork bark cylinder with cork top hives, similar to a gum or barc, colmenas de corcho.

Part of the reason why bee gums are still used is that this allows the producers of the honey to distinguish themselves from other honey producers and to ask for a higher price for the honey. An example where bee gums are still used is Mont-Lozère, France, although in Europe they are referred to as log hives. The length of these log hives used is shorter than bee gums; they are hollowed out artificially and cut to a specific size.

== Modern hives ==

The earliest recognizably modern designs of beehives arose in the 19th century, though they were perfected from intermediate stages of progress made in the 18th century.

Intermediate stages in hive design were recorded for example by Thomas Wildman in 1768-1770, who described advances over the destructive old skep-based beekeeping so that the bees no longer had to be killed to harvest the honey. Wildman, for example, fixed a parallel array of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive or skep (with a separate straw top to be fixed on later) &quot;so that there are in all seven bars of deal&quot; [in a hive] &quot;to which the bees fix their combs&quot;. He also described using such hives in a multi-story configuration, foreshadowing the modern use of supers: he described adding (at the proper time) successive straw hives below, and eventually removing the ones above when free of brood and filled with honey so that the bees could be separately preserved at the harvest for the following season. Wildman also described a further development, using hives with &quot;sliding frames&quot; for the bees to build their comb, foreshadowing more modern uses of movable-comb hives. Wildman acknowledged the advances in knowledge of bees previously made by Swammerdam, Maraldi, and de Reaumur – he included a lengthy translation of Reaumur&#x27;s account of the natural history of bees – and he also described the initiatives of others in designing hives for the preservation of bee-life when taking the harvest, citing in particular reports from Brittany dating from the 1750s, due to Comte de la Bourdonnaye.

In 1814 Petro Prokopovych, the founder of commercial beekeeping in Ukraine, invented one of the first beehive frames which allowed an easier honey harvest.

The correct distance between combs for easy operations in beehives was described in 1845 by Jan Dzierżon as from the center of one top bar to the center of the next one. In 1848, Dzierżon introduced grooves into the hive&#x27;s side walls replacing the strips of wood for moving top bars. The grooves were , the spacing later termed bee space.
Based on the aforementioned measurements, August Adolph von Berlepsch (Bienezeitung May 1852) in Thuringia and L.L. Langstroth (October 1852) in the United States designed their own movable-frame hives. Langstroth used, however &quot;about 1/2 inch&quot; () above the frame&#x27;s top bars and &quot;about 3/8 inch&quot; () between the frames and hive body.

Hives can be vertical or horizontal. There are three main types of modern hive in common use worldwide:
*the Langstroth hive
*the top-bar hive
*the Warre hive

Most hives have been optimized for &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; and &quot;Apis cerana&quot;. Some other hives have been designed and optimized for some meliponines such as &quot; Melipona beecheii&quot;. Examples of such hives are the Nogueira-Neto hive and the UTOB hive.

===Vertical hives===
==== Langstroth hives ====

Langstroth hives are named for Rev. Lorenzo Langstroth, who patented his design in the United States on October 5, 1852. It was based on the ideas of Johann Dzierzon and other leaders in apiculture. It combines a top-worked hive with hanging frames and the use of bee spaces between frames and other parts. Variants of his design have become the standard style of hive for many of the world&#x27;s beekeepers, both professional and amateur. Langstroth hive bodies are rectangular and can be stacked to expand the usable space for the bees. They can be made from a variety of materials, but commonly of timber. The modern Langstroth hive consists of:
* Bottom board: this has an entrance for the bees.
* Boxes containing frames for brood and honey: the lowest box for the queen to lay eggs, and boxes above where honey is stored
* Inner cover and top cap providing weather protection

Inside the boxes, frames are hung parallel to each other. Langstroth frames are thin rectangular structures made of wood or plastic and typically have a plastic or wax foundation on which the bees draw out the comb. The frames hold the honeycomb formed by the bees with beeswax. Eight or ten frames side by side (depending on the size of the box) will fill the hive body and leave the right amount of bee space between each frame and between the end frames and the hive body. With appropriate provision of bee space, the bees are not likely to glue parts together with propolis nor fill spaces with burr combalthough the dimensions now usual for top bee space are not the same as those that Langstroth described. Self-spacing beehive frames were introduced by Julius Hoffman, a student of Johann Dzierzon. Langstroth frames can be reinforced with wire, making it possible to spin the honey out of the comb in a centrifuge. As a result, the empty frames and comb can be returned to the beehive for re-filling by the bees. Creating a honeycomb involves a significant energy investment, conservatively estimated at of honey needed to create of comb in temperate climates. Reusing comb can thus increase the productivity of a beekeeping enterprise.

The sizes of hive bodies (rectangular boxes without tops or bottoms placed one on top of another) and of internal frames vary between named styles. A variety of approximations to Langstroth&#x27;s original box and frame sizes are still used, with top bars some long or a little more. However, this class of hives includes several other styles, mostly used in Europe, which differ mainly in the size and number of frames used. These include:
* BS National Beehive: This smaller version of the Langstroth class of hive is designed for the less prolific and more docile Buckfastleigh bee strain, and for standard dimension parts. It is based on square boxes ( side), with a standard/brood box and shallow, Supers typically used for honey. The construction of the boxes is relatively complicated (eight pieces), but strong and with easy-to-hold handles. The boxes take frames of in length, with a relatively long lug () and a comb width of . 
** BS Commercial hive: A variation with the same cross-sectional dimensions as a BS National hive (18 in x 18 in, 460 mm x 460 mm), but deeper brood box () and supers intended for more prolific bees. The internal structure of the boxes is also simpler, resulting in wider frames () with shorter handles or lugs. Some find these supers too heavy when full of honey and therefore use National supers on top of a Commercial brood box.
** Rose Hive: A hive and method of management developed by Tim Rowe, it is a variation on the BS National hive. The Rose hive maintains the same cross-sectional dimensions as the National hive (18 in x 18 in, 460 mm x 460 mm), but opts for a single depth box of . The single box and frame size are used for both brood and honey supers. Standardizing on one size reduces complexity and allows for the movement of brood or honey frames to any other position in the hive. A queen excluder is avoided, allowing the queen freedom to move where she wants. Boxes are added to the hive above the brood and below the supers. The colony can expand during a large nectar flow and retract to lower portions of the hive as the colony shrinks in the fall. When collecting honey, brood and honey frames can be relocated up or down the hive, as needed.
** Smith hive
* German Normal: German normal measure (DNM): mainly used in central and northern Germany. Of which Frankenbeute, Segeberger, and Spessartbeute are variants.
** Zander: Developed by Enoch Zander, mainly used in southern Germany
* D.E. hive Designed by David Eyre
* Dadant hive: Developed by Charles Dadant (developed in the US in 1920 from the Dadant-Blatt hive)
** B-BOX: Developed by the Italian company Beeing for urban locations and uses Dadant frames
* Hyper Hyve: Designed by Mike James and incorporates an insulated hive with integrated monitoring.

==== Warré hives ====
The Warré hive was invented by the village priest Émile Warré, and is also called (&#x27;the people&#x27;s hive&#x27;). It is a modular and storied design similar to a Langstroth hive. The hive body is made of boxes stacked vertically; however, it uses top bars for comb support instead of full frames similar to a Top-Bar Hive, as a general rule. The popularity of this hive is growing among &#x27;sustainable-practice&#x27; beekeepers.

The Warre hive differs from other stacked hive systems in one fundamental aspect: when the bees need more space as the colony expands, the new box is &quot;nadired&quot;; i.e., positioned underneath the existing box or boxes. This serves the purpose of warmth retention within the brood nest of the hive, considered vital to colony health.

==== WBC hives ====

The WBC, invented by and named after William Broughton Carr in 1890, is a double-walled hive with an external housing that splays out towards the bottom of each frame covering a standard box shape hive inside. The WBC is in many respects the &#x27;classic&#x27; hive as represented in pictures and paintings, but despite the extra level of insulation for the bees offered by its double-walled design, many beekeepers avoid it, owing to the inconvenience of having to remove the external layer before the hive can be examined.

==== CDB hives ====

In 1890, Charles Nash Abbott (1830–1894), advisor to Ireland&#x27;s Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, designed a new Congested Districts Board (CDB) hive in Dublin, Ireland. It was commissioned by and named after the Congested Districts Board for Ireland which provided support for rural populations until its absorption into the Department of Agriculture.

==== AZ hives ====
One of the most famous Slovenian beekeepers was Anton Žnideršič (1874–1947). He developed the AZ hive house and hive box widely used today in Slovenia.

===Horizontal hives===
These are single, long, boxes, with the bars hanging in parallel. The hive body of a common style of horizontal hive is often shaped like an inverted trapezoid, but it may be rectangular in cross-section and able to accept normal frames. They have movable combs and make use of the concept of bee space. They were developed as a lower-cost alternative to the standard Langstroth hives and equipment. They do not require the beekeeper to lift heavy supers when the hive is inspected or manipulated. They are popular in the US due to their alignment with the organic, treatment-free philosophies of many new beekeeping devotees in the United States. The initial costs and equipment requirements are typically much less than other hive designs. Scrap wood can often be used to build a good hive. Horizontal hives do not require the beekeeper to lift super boxes; all checks and manipulation can be done while lifting only one comb at a time and with minimal bending. In areas where large terrestrial animals such as honey badgers and bears present a threat to beehives, single-box hives may be suspended out of reach. Elsewhere, they are commonly raised to a level that allows the beekeeper to inspect and manipulate them in comfort.

Disadvantages include (usually) unsupported combs that cannot be spun in most honey extractors, and it is not usually possible to expand the hive if additional honey storage space is required. Most horizontal hives cannot easily be lifted and carried by one person.

==== Top-bar hives ====

Horizontal hives often use top-bars instead of frames. Top bars are simple lengths of timber often made by cutting scrap wood to size; it is not necessary to buy or assemble frames. The top bars form a continuous roof over the hive chamber, unlike conventional frames which offer a bee-space gap so that the bees can move up and down between hive boxes. The beekeeper does not usually provide foundation wax (or provides only a small starter piece of foundation) for the bees to build from. The bees build the comb so it hangs down from the top bar. This is in keeping with the way bees build wax in a natural cavity.

Because the unsupported comb built from a top bar cannot usually be centrifuged in a honey extractor, the honey is usually extracted by crushing and straining rather than centrifuging. Because the bees have to rebuild their comb after the honey is harvested, a top-bar hive yields a beeswax harvest in addition to honey. Queen excluders may or may not be used to keep the brood areas entirely separate from the honey. Even if no queen excluder is used, the bees store most of their honey separately from the areas where they are raising the brood, and honey can still be harvested without killing the bees or brood.
* Cathedral Hive: Modified top bar. The top bar is split into 3 equal parts and joined at angles of 120° to form half a hexagon.

==== Long box hive ====
The long box hive is a single-story hive that accepts enclosed frames and is worked horizontally in the manner of Kenya/Tanzanian top-bar hives. This non-stacked style had higher popularity a century ago in the Southeast United States but faded from use due to a lack of portability. With the recent popularity of horizontal top-bar hives, the long box hive is gaining renewed but limited utilization. Alternative names are &quot;new idea hive&quot;, &quot;single story hive&quot;, &quot;Poppleton hive&quot;, or &quot;long hive&quot;.

Variations:
* Long Langstroth Hive: Uses 32 standard Langstroth deep frames without any supers.
* Dartington long deep (DLD) hive: Being derived from fixing two Deep National hives back-to-back, the DLD can take up to 21 frames each . It is possible to have two colonies in the brood box; e.g., &quot;swarm&quot; and &quot;parent&quot;, separated by a loose Divider Board, as there is an entrance at either end. It has half-size honey supers, which take six frames that are lighter than full supers and are correspondingly easier to lift than 12-frame National supers. The Dartington was originally developed by Robin Dartington so that he could keep bees on his London rooftop.
* Beehaus Hive: A proprietary design for a beehive launched in 2009 based on the Dartington long deep. It is a hybrid of the top-bar hive and a Langstroth hive.
* Layens Hive: Developed by Georges de Layens in 1864. This hive is a popular standard in Spain and Romania. It was also popular in Russia during the early 1900s until forced industrialization standardized all apiaries. 
* ZEST Hive:
* Lazutin Hive: Developed by Fedor Lazutin 
* Golden Hive: Ukrainian Hive or Einraumbeute Hive uses Dadant size frames that are rotated ninety degrees.

== Symbolism ==


The beehive is a commonly used symbol in various human cultures. In Europe, it was used by the Romans as well as in heraldry. Most heraldic representation of beehives is in the form of a skep. Bees (and beehives) have some symbols often associated with them though it is not universal:
In modern times, it is a key symbol in Freemasonry. In masonic lectures, it represents industry and cooperation, and as a metaphor cautioning against intellectual laziness, warning that &quot;he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons.&quot;

The beehive appears on the 3rd Degree emblems on the Tracing Board of Royal Cumberland No. 41, Bath and is explained as such:
The beehive is also used with a similar meaning by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, informally known as Mormons. From Latter-day Saint usage, it has become one of the State symbols of Utah (&quot;see Deseret&quot;).

== Relocation and destruction ==
===Relocation===
Beekeepers and companies may remove unwanted honey bee nests from structures to relocate them into an artificial hive. This process is called a &quot;cut out&quot;.

===Destruction===
====Animal destruction====
Black bears destroy hives in their quest for honey and protein-rich larvae. Grizzly bears will also eat beehives and are harder to dissuade from taking several beehives. Hives can be protected with an electrified enclosure and livestock fence &quot;shocker&quot; base. Systems available are grid plugged(120v) or solar (dc) for remote spots (more info).

Hives erected as a crop shield against elephants are sometimes destroyed elephants. These hives are hung on a single metal wire that encircles the crop field of some farms in African elephant territory. The installation is called a beehive fence and was conceived by Lucy King.

====Human destruction====

Humans have historically destroyed nests and hives of honey-producing bee species to obtain honey and beeswax and other bee products. Modern honey frame and centerfuge systems, such as Langstroth, are less harmful to the hive, assuming harvest will happen, and increase production at the same time.

Humans may also determine that a beehive must be destroyed in the interest of public safety or in the interest of preventing the spread of bee diseases. The U.S. state of Florida destroyed the hives of Africanized honey bees, in 1999. The state of Alaska has issued regulations governing the treatment of diseased beehives via burning followed by burial, fumigation using ethylene oxide or other approved gases, sterilization by treatment with lye, or by scorching. In New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the treatment of hives infected with the disease American foulbrood with antibiotics is prohibited, and beekeepers are required by law to destroy such colonies and hives with fire.

<text>The Jersey is a British breed of small dairy cattle from Jersey, in the British Channel Islands. It is one of three Channel Island cattle breeds, the others being the Alderney – now extinct – and the Guernsey. The milk is high in butterfat and has a characteristic yellowish tinge.

The Jersey adapts well to various climates and environments, and unlike many breeds originating in temperate climates, tolerates heat well. It has been exported to many countries of the world; in some of them, including Denmark, France, New Zealand and the United States, it has developed into an independent breed. In Nepal, it is used as a draught animal.

== History of the breed ==
As its name implies, the Jersey was bred on the British Channel Island of Jersey. It apparently descended from cattle stock brought over from the nearby Norman mainland, and was first recorded as a separate breed around 1700.

The breed was isolated from outside influence for over 200 years, with a ban from 1789 to 2008. &quot;Farmers Weekly&quot; stated the ban began in 1763 until 2008 or 245 years. 

In December 2022 a dairy was struck with a virus that killed around half the dairy cows, Woodlands Farm. The exact cause has been stated as the &quot;most likely&quot; cause of death was botulism. The exact number of cows, listed as over 100 was also stated as 112 cows and 132 cows, which was more than half the dairy herd.

Before 1789, cows would be given as dowry for inter-island marriages between Jersey and Guernsey. This was, however, not widespread. 

In 1789, imports of foreign cattle into Jersey were forbidden by law to maintain the purity of the breed, although exports of cattle and semen have been important economic resources for the island. The restriction on the import of cattle was initially introduced to prevent a collapse in the export price. The United Kingdom levied no import duty on cattle imported from Jersey. Cattle were being shipped from France to Jersey and then shipped onward to England to circumvent the tariff on French cattle. The increase in the supply of cattle, sometimes of inferior quality, was bringing the price down and damaging the reputation of Jersey cattle. The import ban stabilised the price and enabled a more scientifically controlled programme of breeding to be undertaken.

Sir John Le Couteur studied selective breeding and became a Fellow of the Royal Society; his work led to the establishment of the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society in 1833. At that time, the breed displayed greater variation than it does today, with white, dark brown, and mulberry beasts. However, since the honey-brown cows sold best, the breed was developed accordingly. In 1860, cows were exported via England, the average price being £16 per head. By 1910, over head were exported annually to the United States alone.

In 1866, at the annual general meeting of the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society, H.G. Shepard noted in his history that &quot;it was resolved – on the motion of Col. Le Couteur, that the Hon. Secretary be hereby invited to open and to carry on a &quot;herd book&quot; in which the pedigree of bulls, cows, and heifers shall be entered for reference to all the members of the Society.&quot; In 1869 for the first time, prizes were awarded at the society&#x27;s shows for herd book stock cattle.

The States of Jersey took a census of stock in 1866, and Jersey then supported head of cattle, of which 611 were bulls.

In July 2008 the States of Jersey took the historic step of ending the ban on imports, and allowing the import of bull semen from any breed of cattle, although only semen that is genetically pure enables the resultant progeny to be entered in the Jersey Herd Book. For many decades, each of the 12 parishes in Jersey held cattle shows in the spring, summer, and autumn, followed in turn by the main shows held by the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society, where the best of the parish shows competed. The colour of the rosette secured by a prize-winning cow was said to determine its export value. Today, the RJAHS holds two shows a year, where usually five or six of the remaining 23 herds compete against each other for the top prizes. A Jersey cattle show is also held in Jersey, by the West Show Association.

In February 2010, semen from an impure breed Jersey bull had been imported into the island despite strict laws and checks, and 100 cows had been impregnated with the semen. Their offspring was not recorded in the Jersey Herd Book.

Jersey cattle were exported to the United States from about 1850. A breed society, the American Jersey Cattle Club, was formed in 1868. In the USA, a distinction is sometimes made between the &quot;American Jersey&quot;, which is comparatively coarse and large and has been selectively bred mainly for milk yield, and the original or &quot;Island&quot; type; the latter may also be called &quot;Miniature Jersey&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
The Jersey is small. Cows in the island weigh some and stand about at the withers; bulls weigh some . Factors contributing to the popularity of the breed have been their greater economy of production, due to:
* The ability to carry a larger number of effective milking cows per unit area due to lower body weight, hence lower maintenance requirements, and superior grazing ability
* Calving ease and a relatively lower rate of dystocia, leading to their popularity in crossbreeding with other dairy and even beef breeds to reduce calving related injuries
* High fertility
* High butterfat (4.84%) and protein (3.95%), and the ability to thrive on locally produced feed

Jerseys occur in all shades of brown, from light tan to almost black. They are frequently fawn in colour. All purebred Jerseys have a lighter band around their muzzles, a dark switch (long hair on the end of the tail), and black hooves, although in recent years, colour regulations have been relaxed to allow a broadening of the gene pool.

The cows are calm and docile; bulls may be unpredictable or aggressive.

Jersey cattle have a greater tendency towards postparturient hypocalcaemia (or &quot;milk fever&quot;) in dams, and tend to have frail calves that require more attentive management in cold weather than other dairy breeds due to their smaller body size (which results in an increased surface area-to-mass ratio, increasing heat loss).

==Milk==
After 2008, there was some pressure for Jersey dairymen to attempt to increase the milk production per cow. This led to possibly securing options from outside the island.

From 2020 onward there was a further challenge with COVID-19 while seeking the &quot;maximum productivity and business efficiencies&quot;. Jersey milk has 20% more calcium, 18% more protein, and 29% more milk fat than Holstein.

<text>Lichfield Cathedral, formally the , is a Church of England cathedral in the city of Lichfield, England. It is the seat of the bishop of Lichfield and the principal church of the diocese of Lichfield. There are daily services at the cathedral, which has been designated a grade I listed building.

The diocese of Mercia was created in 656, and a cathedral was consecrated on the present site in 700. The relics of the fifth bishop, Chad of Mercia, were housed at the cathedral until being removed in 1538 during the English Reformation. In 1075 the seat of the diocese was moved to St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Chester and then from there to St Mary&#x27;s Priory in Coventry. Lichfield gained co-cathedral status in 1148, and became the sole cathedral in the diocese after St Mary&#x27;s Priory was dissolved in 1539 and the new diocese of Chester created in 1541. During the English Civil War the cathedral close was beseiged three times; the church was severely damaged, losing all of its medieval glass and many monuments.

The cathedral was built between early 13th century and in the Decorated Gothic style. The work probably began with the choir at the east end and progressed west through the transepts, chapter house, nave, and south-west tower. The lady chapel, central tower, south-east tower, and three spires followed. The building was extensively restored after the Civil War under bishop John Hacket and several times in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Many of the details of the building date from the restorations undertaken by George Gilbert Scott, owing to the soft sandstone of which it is constructed as well as war damage.

==Overview==
The cathedral is dedicated to St Chad and St Mary. Its internal length is , and the breadth of the nave is . The central spire is high and the western spires are about with the southern spire a little taller than the northern one. The stone is Mercian red sandstone and came from quarries close to Lichfield. The walls of the nave lean outwards slightly, due to the weight of stone used in the ceiling vaulting; some 200–300 tons of which was removed during renovation work in 1788 to prevent the walls leaning further.

Lichfield suffered severe damage during the English Civil War, in which all of the stained glass was destroyed. In spite of this the windows of the Lady Chapel contain some of the finest medieval Flemish painted glass in existence. Dating from the 1530s, it came from the Abbey of Herkenrode in Belgium, in 1801. It had been purchased by Brooke Boothby after the abbey was annexed in 1795 by the advance of the French Revolutionary Army. There are also some fine windows by Betton and Evans (1819), and many fine late 19th century windows, particularly those by Charles Eamer Kempe.

The Lichfield Gospels, also known as the St Chad&#x27;s Gospels, dated 720–740, are the gospels of Matthew and Mark, and the early part of Luke, written in Latin with some marginalia in early Welsh. It has similarities to the Lindisfarne Gospels. The manuscript is on display in the Chapter House.

The Cathedral Close is one of the most complete in the country and includes a medieval courtyard which once housed the men of the choir. The three spires are often referred to as the &quot;Ladies of the Vale&quot;.

==History of the cathedral==
=== Early history and elevation to Archbishopric===

Bede stated that Chad established his See at Lichfield; and the first cathedral would presumably have been on this site in 669. When he died in 672, his grave site, near the church of St Mary, became a sacred shrine for many pilgrims. In 2003, excavations under the east end of the nave revealed a grave cut into the sandstone bedrock which has been attributed to Chad. It was within the foundation of a tower-like building seven metres square.

In 787, Offa, King of Mercia, created his own archbishopric in Lichfield, and this archbishop then presided over all the bishops from the Humber to the Thames. This was with the consent of Pope Adrian and agreed at the Council of Chelsea, 787, often called the &quot;contentious synod&quot;. Higbert, or Hygeberht was installed as the new Archbishop of Lichfield. In gratitude, Offa promised to send an annual shipment of gold to the pope for alms and supplying the lights in St. Peter&#x27;s church in Rome. However, the Archbishopric of Lichfield lasted for only 14 years, ending soon after Offa&#x27;s death, when it was restored to Archbishop Aethelheard of Canterbury.

In 1854, a foundation, 1.5 metres wide and 1.7 metres high, was found under the choir and presbytery floor. This basilica-shaped foundation was recognised as the second cathedral. The Victorians assumed this was a Norman cathedral, but its shape, dimensions and material (much concrete hard mortar) suggest otherwise. It has yet to be carbon-dated and a case has been made that the church was built by Offa for his archbishopric. The date for construction of the present Gothic cathedral is unclear since all fabric accounts were destroyed in the Civil War sieges and early texts are ambiguous. The general opinion is that the cathedral was begun in the early 13th century. It was completed by the building of the Lady Chapel in the 1330s. The Choir dates from 1200, the Transepts from 1220 to 1240 and the Nave was started around 1260. The octagonal Chapter House, which was completed in 1249 and is one of the most beautiful parts of the cathedral with some charming stone carvings, houses an exhibition of the cathedral&#x27;s greatest treasures, the Lichfield Gospels, an 8th-century illuminated manuscript and the Lichfield Angel stonework.

===Devastation of the English Civil War===
There were three great sieges of Lichfield during the period 1643–1646 as the cathedral close was surrounded by a moat and defensive walls, which made it a natural fortress. Clergy followed Charles I, but the townsfolk generally sided with Parliament. Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, led an assault against it, but was killed by a musket shot said to be from John Dyott (known as &#x27;dumb&#x27; because he was a deaf mute) who along with his brother Richard Dyott had taken up a position on the battlements on 2 March 1643. Brooke&#x27;s deputy John Gell, took over the siege and the garrison surrendered to Gell two days later.

In April of the same year (1643) Prince Rupert led an Royalist expeditionary force from Oxford to recapture Lichfield. The siege started on 8 April. During the second assault Rupert&#x27;s engineers detonated what is thought to be the first explosive mine to be used in England to breach the defences. Unable to defend the Close, Colonel Russell, the parliamentary commander of the garrison, surrendered on terms to Rupert on 21 April.

In 1646 the Parliamentarians were once again victorious, but the Cathedral suffered extensive damage: the central spire was demolished, the roofs ruined and all the stained glass smashed. Bishop Hacket began the restoration of the cathedral in the 1660s, aided by substantial funds donated by the restored monarch, but it was not until the 19th century that the damage caused by the Civil War was fully repaired. Until the 19th century, on top of an ornamented gable, between the two spires, stood a figure of Charles II, by William Wilson. Today it stands just outside the south doors.

===Victorian restoration===
Although the 18th century was a golden age for the City of Lichfield, it was a period of alteration for the cathedral. The 15th-century library, on the north side of the nave, was pulled down in 1798 and the books moved to their present location above the Chapter House. Most of the statues on the west front were removed and the stonework covered with Roman cement. At the end of the century James Wyatt organised some major structural work, removing the High Altar to make one long worship area of Choir, Presbytery and Lady Chapel and adding a massive stone screen with glass to the roof at the entrance to the Choir. Francis Eginton painted the east window and was commissioned by the chapter to do other work in the cathedral.

The ornate west front was extensively renovated in the Victorian era by George Gilbert Scott. It includes a remarkable number of ornate carved figures of kings, queens and saints, working with original materials where possible and creating fine new imitations and additions when the originals were not available. Between 1877 and 1884 the empty niches on the west front were given new statues, most carved by Robert Bridgeman of Lichfield: the statue of Queen Victoria on the north side of the central window was carved by her daughter, Princess Louise.

Wyatt&#x27;s choir-screen had utilised medieval stone-work which Scott in turn used to create sedilia with clergy&#x27;s seats in the sanctuary. The new metal screen by Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip to designs by Scott himself is a triumph of metalwork art, as are the fine Minton&#x27;s tiles in the choir, inspired by the medieval ones found in the Choir foundations and some still seen in the Library.

===Lichfield Angel===

In February 2003, an eighth-century sculpted panel of the Archangel Gabriel was discovered under the nave of the cathedral in and near the grave of Chad. The 600mm-tall panel is carved from limestone from quarry at Ancaster, Lincolnshire. It was part of a stone chest, which is thought to have contained the relics of St Chad. The panel was broken into three parts but was still otherwise intact and had traces of red, black, yellow and white pigment from the period. The pigments on the Lichfield Angel correspond closely to those of the Lichfield Gospels which have been dated between 720 and 740. The Angel was first unveiled to the public in 2006, when visitor numbers to the cathedral trebled. After being taken to Birmingham for eighteen months for examination, it is now exhibited in the cathedral.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
On Friday 15 January 2021, while closed to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lichfield Cathedral became the first place of worship in England to accommodate the vaccination programme in the United Kingdom.

=== Shrine of St Chad ===
On the 7 and 8 November 2022 a new shrine to St Chad was consecrated and a relic of the saint was translated from St Chad&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham, at two separate services.

<text>Burton upon Trent, also known as Burton-on-Trent or simply Burton, is a market town in the borough of East Staffordshire in the county of Staffordshire, England, close to the border with Derbyshire. At the 2021 census, it had a population of 76,270. The demonym for residents of the town is &quot;Burtonian&quot;. Burton is located on the River Trent south-west of Derby and south of the Peak District National Park.

Burton is known for its brewing. The town grew up around Burton Abbey. Burton Bridge was also the site of two battles, in 1322, when Edward II defeated the rebel Earl of Lancaster and in 1643 when royalists captured the town during the First English Civil War. William Lord Paget and his descendants were responsible for extending the manor house within the abbey grounds and facilitating the extension of the River Trent Navigation to Burton. Burton grew into a busy market town by the early modern period.

The town is served by Burton-on-Trent railway station. The town was also the start and terminus of the now defunct South Staffordshire Line which linked it to Lichfield, Walsall, Dudley and Stourbridge.

==Toponymy==
The name Burton upon Trent derives from the meaning &quot;a settlement at a fortified place&quot; along the River Trent and dates from the 8th century.

According to the town&#x27;s charter the official name of the town is Burton upon Trent. However, the form &#x27;Burton-on-Trent&#x27; is used for the post town by Royal Mail and for the town&#x27;s railway station.

==History==
Rykneld Street, a Roman road, ran north-east through what later became the parish of Burton, linking settlements at Letocetum (Wall), near Lichfield and Derventio (Little Chester) near Derby.

Between 666 and 669 Wilfrid, the pro-Roman bishop of York, exercised episcopal functions in Mercia, whose Christian king, Wulfhere, gave him land in various places, on which he established monasteries. Burton was almost certainly one of the sites: the name Andresey given to an island in the river Trent near the parish church means &quot;Andrew&#x27;s isle&quot; and refers to a church there dedicated to St Andrew. The island is associated with the legend of St Modwen or Modwenna, an Irish abbess. It is likely that any surviving religious house would have been destroyed during the Danish incursion into the area in 874. Place names indicate Scandinavian influence, and several personal names of Scandinavian origin were still used in the area in the early 12th century. In 1003 a Benedictine abbey was established on a new site on the west bank of the Trent at Burton by Wulfric Spott, a thegn. He is known to have been buried in the abbey cloister in 1010, alongside his wife.

Burton Abbey was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it was said to control lands in Appleby Magna in Leicestershire, and Mickleover, Winshill, Stapenhill, Coton in the Elms, Ca(u)ldwell (in Stapenhill Parish) and Ticknall, all then in Derbyshire. The monastery was the most important in Staffordshire and by the 1530s had the highest revenue. It is known that there were frequent Royal visits to the abbey, including those by William I, Henry II and Edward I. In the 12th and 13th centuries, streets were laid out off the west side of High Street, the earliest being New Street, which stretched from the abbey gates towards the line of Ryknild Street. Horninglow Street at the north end of High Street was part of a major east–west route using the bridge over the river.

A royal charter was granted on 12 April 1200 by King John to the Abbot to hold a market in Burton every Thursday. This charter was later renewed by King Henry III and King Edward IV. There were four annual fairs for trade in horses, cattle and produce: on Candlemas Day, 5 April, Holy Thursday, and 29 October (the feast of St Modwen) although as in other British towns this practice has died out.
While Burton&#x27;s great bridge over the Trent was in poor repair by the early 16th century, it served as &quot;a comen passage to and fro many countries to the grett releff and comfort of travellyng people&quot;, according to the abbot. The bridge was the site of two battles, first in 1322 when Edward II defeated the rebel Earl of Lancaster and also in 1643 when the Royalists captured the town during the First English Civil War.
Under Henry VIII the abbey was dissolved in 1539, to be refounded in 1541 as a collegiate church for a dean (who had been the last abbot) and four prebendaries. It was again dissolved in 1545 and granted to Sir William Paget. Paget began planning to expand the Manor House within the abbey precincts, known to have existed since at least 1514, into a grand mansion. To provide the materials for this project, the old abbey buildings were to be cannibalised. There were major alterations to the house over the next three centuries. Sir William died in 1563.

In 1585 it was suggested that Mary, Queen of Scots might stay at Burton while Tutbury Castle was cleaned, but it was said that it was &quot;a ruinous house, the buildings scattered and adjoining a very poor town, full of bad neighbours&quot;. The Paget family was implicated in Catholic plots against Queen Elizabeth I, the manor house along with most of the family estates were confiscated, with the Manor House leased to Richard Almond in 1612. Parts of the abbey church may have been retained for parish use, however these were demolished and replaced by a new church in 1719–1726. Some fragments remain of the chapter house nearby, but little of the rest remains. Two buildings were converted to residential use—a part known as the Manor House and the former Infirmary. The Infirmary became known as The Abbey and is now an inn.

===Canals and breweries===
The Paget family&#x27;s lands and title were restored to them by James I in 1604 and they owned considerable estates around Burton for over 150 years. In 1699, William Lord Paget obtained an Act of Parliament to extend navigation on the River Trent from Nottingham up to Burton, but nothing was immediately done. In 1711 Lord Paget leased his rights to George Hayne, who in 1712 opened the River Trent Navigation and constructed a wharf and other buildings in the precinct of the old abbey. This led to the development of Burton as the major town for brewing and exporting beer, as it allowed Burton beer to be shipped to Hull, and on to the Baltic Sea and Prussia, as well as to London, where it was being sold in 1712. A number of breweries opened in the second half of the 18th century. The Napoleonic blockade badly affected overseas trade, leading to some consolidation and a redirection of the trade to London and Lancashire via canals. When Burton brewers succeeded in replicating the pale ale produced in London, the advantage of the water&#x27;s qualities, in a process named Burtonisation allowed the development of the trade of Burton India Pale Ale (an ale specially brewed to keep during the long sea voyage to India). New rail links to Liverpool enabled brewers to export their beer throughout the British Empire.

Burton came to dominate the brewing trade, and at its height one quarter of all beer sold in Britain was produced here. In the second half of the 19th century there was a growth in native breweries, supplemented by outside brewing companies moving into the town, so that over 30 breweries were recorded in 1880. However at the beginning of the 20th century there was a slump in beer sales, causing many breweries to fail; the industry suffered from the Liberal government&#x27;s anti-drinking attitudes. This time no new markets were found and so the number of breweries shrank by closure and consolidation from 20 in 1900 to 8 in 1928. After further mergers and buy-outs, just three main breweries remained by 1980: Bass, Ind Coope and Marston&#x27;s.

Burton was home to the Peel family, who played a significant role in the Industrial Revolution. The family home is still visible in the town as Peel House on Lichfield Street. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited the town on 3 July 2002 during her Golden Jubilee celebrations.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Burton, at county, district and parish level: Staffordshire County Council, East Staffordshire Borough Council, and a number of parish councils covering different parts of the urban area. There is a parish called Burton which just covers the central part of the town.

Burton is the administrative centre for the borough of East Staffordshire and forms part of the Burton and Uttoxeter constituency. The local Member of Parliament (MP) is the Labour Party&#x27;s Jacob Collier, who has represented the constituency since the 2024 general election, winning the seat from Kate Kniveton of the Conservative Party.

===Administrative history===
Burton upon Trent was an ancient parish, which historically straddled the boundary between Staffordshire and Derbyshire. The parish was divided into five townships, being Winshill in Derbyshire, and Branston, Horninglow, Stretton and a Burton upon Trent township (covering the central part of the parish) in Staffordshire. The rural parts of the Burton township became a separate township called Burton Extra in the sixteenth century. Such townships were all reclassified as civil parishes in 1866.

Burton had been an ancient borough from the twelfth century, giving some degree of self-government for the town, but by the seventeenth century its borough corporation had ceased to operate and its borough status lapsed, with the town being administered by the parish vestry and manorial courts instead. More urban forms of local government returned to the town in 1779 when a body of improvement commissioners was established, initially just covering the Burton township. Their district was extended in 1853 to take in parts of the townships of Burton Extra and Horninglow, and again in 1878 to take in the rest of Burton Extra, more of Horninglow (including the village), parts of Branston and Winshill, and part of the neighbouring Derbyshire parish of Stapenhill.

Later in 1878 the improvement commissioners&#x27; district was incorporated as a municipal borough called Burton upon Trent. When elected county councils were created in 1889 boroughs were no longer allowed to straddle county boundaries, and so the Derbyshire parts of the borough (Stapenhill and Winshill) were transferred to Staffordshire. Six years later the Local Government Act 1894 said that parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries, and so the parts of Stapenhill parish outside the borough were transferred to the neighbouring parishes of Bretby and Drakelow, the rural parts of Winshill went to Newton Solney, the rural part of Horninglow became a new parish called Outwoods and the parts of Branston inside the borough were transferred to Burton Extra. The five urban parishes inside the borough were then Burton upon Trent, Burton Extra, Horninglow, Stapenhill and Winshill, which were amalgamated into a single Burton upon Trent parish in 1904.
In 1891 the council was given the former St Paul&#x27;s Institute and Liberal Club on King Edward Place, which had been built in 1878. They substantially extended the building to serve as their headquarters, renaming it Town Hall.

Burton was elevated to become a county borough in 1901, making it independent from Staffordshire County Council, having reached the 50,000 population required. It never substantially exceeded the population of 50,000, and with a population of 50,201 in the 1971 census it was the second smallest county borough in England after Canterbury. The Local Government Commission for England recommended in the 1960s that it be demoted to a non-county borough within Staffordshire, but this was not implemented. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town became on 1 April 1974, an unparished area in the new district of East Staffordshire.

The town became entirely parished on 1 April 2003, when the parishes of Anglesey, Brizlincote, Burton, Horninglow and Eton, Shobnall, Stapenhill, and Winshill were created. Burton parish itself only covers the town centre, with the other parishes covering various suburbs. The urban area now also extends into the adjoining parishes of Branston, Outwoods and Stretton, which had all been outside the pre-1974 county borough.

==Geography==
Burton is about north west of London, about 30 miles north east of Birmingham, the UK&#x27;s second largest city and about 23 miles east of the county town Stafford. It is at the easternmost border of the county of Staffordshire with Derbyshire, its suburbs and the course of the River Trent forming part of the county boundary. It is also near the south-eastern terminus of the Trent and Mersey Canal.
Burton lies within the northern boundary of the National Forest.
The town centre is on the western bank of the River Trent in a valley bottom; its average elevation is about 50 metres above sea level; the village of Winshill and the suburb of Stapenhill rise to 130 m and 100 m respectively.
Burton became a centre for the brewing industry due in part to the quality of the local water, which contains a high proportion of dissolved salts, predominantly caused by the gypsum in the surrounding hills. This allowed a greater proportion of hops, a natural preservative, to be included in the beer, thereby allowing the beer to be shipped further afield. Much of the open land within and around the town is protected from chemical treatment to help preserve this water quality.

===Region===
There is some confusion as to whether Burton is in the West Midlands or the East Midlands, even though the entire urban centre is southwest of the River Dove, which forms the Derbyshire/Staffordshire boundary. Being in Staffordshire, the town officially lies within the West Midlands region. Several factors contribute to the ambiguity of the town&#x27;s status. The local vernacular shares more similarities with East Midlands English than West Midlands English; the town was formerly within the East Midlands Utility (electricity/gas) areas and has Derby postcodes (DE13-DE15). However, it is served by the BBC Midlands (West Midlands) region based in Birmingham and before consolidation exercises formed part of the ITV Central (West) region, again based in Birmingham.

=== Green belt ===

The suburbs of Winshill, Brizlincote and Stapenhill to the southeast of the town lie along a green-belt area, in place to stop uncontrolled development which could cause Burton to, in time, merge with neighbouring Swadlincote. The majority of this green belt lies in Derbyshire, with small tracts within Staffordshire.

==Demography==
The town had an estimated population of 43,784 in the 2001 Census. Stapenhill and Winshill were treated separately and together had a further population of 21,985 according to this source. According to the 2001 census,

In the 2021 Census, the population of Burton was recorded at 76,270.

The town&#x27;s ethnicity composition was recorded at:

*White - 60,895 (79.9%)
*Asian - 10,883 (14.3%)
*Mixed Race - 2,169 (2.8%)
*Black - 1,169 (1.5%)
*Other - 1,164 (1.3%)

The town&#x27;s religious composition was recorded at:

*Christians - 34,140 (47.5%)
*Irreligious - 26,275 (36.5%)
*Muslims - 10,363 (14.4%)
*Other - 347 (0.5%)
*Hindus - 293 (0.4%)
*Sikhs - 268 (0.4%)
*Buddhists - 195 (0.3%)
*Jews - 13 (0.1%)

==Economy==

===Brewing===

For centuries brewing was Burton&#x27;s major trade, and it is still an important part of its economy.

The town is currently home to eight breweries; Coors Brewers Ltd: formerly Bass Brewers Ltd, and now the UK arm of Molson Coors Brewing Company – which produces Carling and Worthington Bitter; Marston&#x27;s, Thompson and Evershed plc, bought by Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries now renamed Marstons plc. The Marston&#x27;s Brewery produces its own brands, draught Marston&#x27;s Pedigree, draught Hobgoblin and also draught Bass under licence from InBev.

Burton Bridge Brewery is based in Bridge Street, with six pubs in and around Burton. It produces a number of traditional beers including Bridge Bitter, Stairway to Heaven, Damson Porter and Golden Delicious. Tower Brewery is a microbrewery off Wharf Road. Old Cottage Brewery is based in Hawkins Lane. Its beers include Oak Ale and Halcyon Daze. Black Hole Brewery is based at the Imex Centre. Gates Brewery microbrewery is in Reservoir Road.

Burton is also the corporate headquarters of the pub operators Punch Taverns plc and Spirit Pub Company which was brought by Greene King so doesn&#x27;t have a headquarters there anymore, which were spun out of Bass in 1997. In addition, the White Shield microbrewery remains open alongside the National Brewery Centre (formerly the Bass Museum of Brewing).

A by-product of the brewing industry is the Marmite factory in the town. The original Marmite factory (now demolished) was at the corner of Cross Street and Duke Street before they moved to the current factory on Wellington Road in the 1960s. The production of Marmite has in turn generated the production of Bovril. Both are owned by multinational company Unilever.

Burton is also home to CAMRA&#x27;s National Breweriana Auction that takes place each October in the Town Hall.

===Manufacturing===
Eatough&#x27;s (sometimes Etough&#x27;s) was a shoemaking firm from Leicestershire that opened a factory in Burton Road, Branston in 1920. It was the first British shoe factory to introduce music in the workplace (1936), and washable children&#x27;s sandals (&#x27;Plastisha&#x27; 1957), but it closed in 1989 as a result of competition from cheap imports.

Briggs of Burton (formerly S. Briggs &amp; Co.) is a Burton-based brewery and process engineering company established in 1732 by Samuel Briggs. Famous for its manufacturing innovation and craftsmanship across the world, Briggs moved from its works in New Street to Derby Street having taken over its rival Robert Morton DG in 1988. The former site is now occupied by the Octagon Shopping Centre.

Established in 1740, Thornewill and Warham was a metal hardware and industrial metalwork manufacturer, later an engineering company that became a notable producer of steam engines and railway locomotives. It also constructed two footbridges across the River Trent in Burton. It too was acquired by S. Briggs &amp; Co, in 1929.

===Retail===
A market has been held on Thursdays in Burton since a charter was granted to the abbot by King John on 12 April 1200. Burton today has an indoor and an outdoor market, which are owned by East Staffordshire Borough Council. In 2011 the council contracted out responsibility for market stall rentals to private letting agency Quarterbridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burtonmail-29/06/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Market Hall was built in 1883 from designs by Dixon &amp; Moxon of Barnsley and opens from Tuesday to Saturday. A fish market was added to the hall in 1925. The outdoor market is held every Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 8.30am until 4pm.

The Coopers Square shopping centre is the principal shopping area, opened in 1970 by the Princess Alexandra but since considerably upgraded with a roof being added in the mid-1990s. The older Riverside Shopping Centre (known as Bargates) is now demolished.

An additional shopping centre is The Octagon Shopping Centre on New Street, constructed in the mid-1980s. There is another, much smaller shopping centre, Burton Place Shopping Centre, which was built in 1986 and originally known as Worthington Walk. Also located in the town centre is Middleway Retail Park, which includes a Cineworld multiplex cinema, Mecca Bingo, Matalan and restaurants, including Bella Italia and Nando&#x27;s.

In 2005 a report by the New Economics Foundation rated Burton at 13.3 out of 60 for &quot;individuality&quot;, putting it in the top ten clone towns in England, because of the large number of chain stores in the town centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill-13/10/2005&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then events such as a French market have been organised to bring more footfall into the town centre.

===Media===

Media services include the &quot;Burton Mail&quot;, BBC Radio Derby, and Capital Mid-Counties.

=== Distribution and warehousing ===
Due to Burton&#x27;s relative location in the centre of England and its transport links which allow easy access to Birmingham (the second largest UK city), Derby, Nottingham, Leicester and other locations, there are a significant number of warehouses based in Burton (and nearby Fradley Park).

Notable businesses with distribution centres and warehouses include B&amp;Q, Boots, Hobbycraft, Holland &amp; Barrett, DHL, Waterstones, Clipper and Amazon.

==Culture and community==

===Culture===

The main venue for live theatre and other performing and visual arts is &quot;The Brewhouse&quot;, which is run by East Staffordshire Council. During the 1970s and 1980s a number of well known rock bands appeared at the 76 Club nightclub in Burton, including Dire Straits and the Sex Pistols.
Bloodstock Open Air is an annual festival of heavy metal music, which takes place in August and has been held at Catton Hall in Walton-on-Trent, 8 miles south-west of Burton since 2005.

Burton Operatic Society is a musical theatre company based in Burton and produces two productions each year. The town was also home to the Burton School of Speech and Drama on Guild Street where many professional and amateur actors and actresses learned their craft. Following the closure of the school in July 1984, its in-house amateur company, the Little Theatre Players, continued life as an independent amateur drama company called The Little Theatre Company. LTC currently stages at least four productions a year in the town: two plays, a musical and a youth production.

Burton has one of the oldest amateur radio clubs in the UK. It was formed in 1919, although there were enthusiasts of wireless telegraphy in Burton well before the First World War. One of the founder members of the club was F. V. A. Smith, call sign XSR, (X = experimental station). Smith was licensed on 3 July 1914 and one month later, he received a message from the Marconi spark transmitter at Poldhu in Cornwall, being sent to London, on the eve of the outbreak of war. The message, which has survived and is in the present club archives, was announcing the mobilisation of Russian, French and Belgian troops.

The Statutes Fair takes place in the town every year on the first Monday and Tuesday after Michaelmas (29 September). This is usually on the first Monday/Tuesday in October but can occasionally fall on 30 September/1 October as in 2002. The fair occupies the Market Place and parts of High Street, New Street and Lichfield Street for two days.

===Community facilities===
The local Sea Cadet unit is TS (Training Ship) &quot;Modwena&quot; alongside the River Trent and road bridge. The town&#x27;s Air Training Corps unit is No 351 (Burton-upon-Trent) Squadron. The local Army Reserve unit is F (Fire Support) Company, 4 Mercian Regiment, an infantry unit at Coltman House Army Reserve Centre, Hawkins Lane; the unit was formerly a volunteer brigade of the North Staffordshire Regiment.

==Landmarks==

The town&#x27;s connection with the brewing industry is celebrated in &quot;The Burton Cooper&quot;, a bronze sculpture by James Walter Butler. It was commissioned in 1977 and depicts a local craftsman making a barrel. It originally stood opposite the market and – despite opposition from many townspeople – was moved to its present location inside the Coopers Square Shopping Centre in 1994.

The National Brewery Centre (previously Coors Visitor Centre &amp; the Museum of Brewing, before that it was the Bass Museum of Brewing), which celebrated the town&#x27;s brewing heritage was its biggest tourist attraction; the Centre closed in 2022 after Coors decided to move its UK headquarters to the site. Claymills Pumping Station on the north side of Burton is a restored Victorian sewage pumping station, adjacent to the modern sewage works. Until 2005/2006 one of Burton&#x27;s most distinguishable landmarks was Drakelow Power Station just south of Burton on the opposite side of the River Trent. The chimneys, boiler-house building and cooling towers have since been demolished.

The former Magistrates&#x27; Court is a distinctive neo-classical domed building in a commanding position facing Guild Street. It was built by Richard Kershaw to designs by Henry Beck and opened in 1909.

Finney&#x27;s post, part of an ornate mediaeval oak post which once stood at the corner of the Market Place and High Street, is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

The Horninglow Street drill hall dates back to the early 19th century.

The former Ritz Cinema, built in 1935 in Modernist style with Art Deco interior, is in Guild Street.

==Transport==

===River===
Burton now lies on both sides of the River Trent. Historically, there was just one bridge over the river, &quot;Burton old bridge&quot; (which carries the A511) and there was a small ferry that operated from &quot;time immemorial&quot;. This was eventually replaced by the Ferry Bridge. A second road crossing of the Trent is St Peter&#x27;s Bridge (which carries the A5189) was opened in 1985.

===Road===
The A38, which bypasses the town, connects Burton to Birmingham and Derby. The A444 links traffic to Coventry and the M42 motorway and the A511 links traffic to Leicester. The A5121 carries traffic through the middle of Burton connecting to the A38, A5189 and A511 respectively. The A5189 runs (West-East) across Burton and connects the A444 through Burton and across the River Trent.

===Rail===
The town is served by Burton-on-Trent railway station, which is accessed from the bridge on Borough Road. The station has two platforms: platform one for Derby, Nottingham and the North; platform two for Tamworth, Birmingham and the South. The station is situated on the Cross Country Route between the principal cities of Derby and Birmingham.

The station&#x27;s operator is East Midlands Railway, although none of their trains call there. All services are provided by CrossCountry, with trains between Cardiff Central, Birmingham and Nottingham, as well as longer-distance services to destinations such as Bristol Temple Meads, Leeds and Newcastle. Burton is positioned at the western terminus of the aborted Ivanhoe line towards Leicester.

The station utilises the PlusBus scheme where train and bus tickets can be bought together at a saving.

===Bus===
The town had its own municipal buses operated by Burton Corporation Transport and later East Staffordshire District Council after 1974. This was taken over by Stevensons of Uttoxeter in the mid-1980s and, in turn, was absorbed by Arriva Midlands in the late 1990s.

In July 2005, Midland Classic then operated the majority of buses in the town to outlying areas such as Uttoxeter, Horninglow, Edge Hill, Stapenhill, Queen&#x27;s Hospital Burton, Winshill, Stretton, Abbots Bromley, Tatenhill, Wetmore, Branston, Lichfield, Ashby-de-la-Zouch and East Midlands Airport having taken over the local depot of Arriva Midlands at Wetmore Road in August 2016.

In August 2022, Midland Classic were acquired by Rotala. The vehicles were rebranded into Diamond livery with the operations to be known as Diamond East Midlands and administered from the Tividale headquarters of Rotala.

A number of local routes are fully or part operated by Burton based Bus Link whose owner also registered the name Stevensons Bus Services. 

Arriva Midlands continues to operate service X38 to Derby, jointly run with Trentbarton who also run the villager V1 and V3 services to Derby.

==Religious sites==
The mother church of Burton is St Modwen&#x27;s, a Georgian building which replaced the former Burton Abbey&#x27;s church. Other Anglican parish churches built to serve the expanding population include Holy Trinity, St Mark&#x27;s, Winshill, St Paul&#x27;s, St John the Divine, Horninglow, St Chad&#x27;s, All Saints and St Mary&#x27;s, Stretton.

The Roman Catholic church in the town is St Mary and St Modwen&#x27;s Catholic Church.

There are five mosques in Burton, three Bareilvi or Sufi, one Deobandi and one Salafi.
There is a Sikh Gurdwara established in St Chad&#x27;s Community Centre.
Although there was a small Jewish community in Burton in the early half of the 20th century, there is no record of a synagogue being established. There was however a close relationship with the community in Derby, whose minister acted as visiting teacher and shochet.

==Education==
Burton &amp; South Derbyshire College (BSDC) is a general further education college and is situated in the town centre. It attracts approximately 13,000 students from Burton and the surrounding towns and villages. It delivers a wide range of courses for all ages including 14- to 19-year-olds, adults into part-time study, employer training and higher education. Recently a &#x27;university centre&#x27; has been developed within the college to enable students to study on franchised higher education courses, but is not in itself a university.

The University of Wolverhampton&#x27;s School of Health and Wellbeing has a presence at Burton Health Education Centre located at the Queen&#x27;s Hospital, which specialises in nursing.

==Sport==
Since the establishment of the Football League in 1888, Burton has been represented by four separate clubs in the League, two of which played in the league simultaneously in the 1890s. Burton Swifts became members of the Football League in 1892, and were joined by Burton Wanderers in 1894. Swifts played at Peel Croft, whilst Wanderers home ground was Derby Turn. Wanderers left the League in 1897, and the two clubs merged to form Burton United in 1901, with the new club playing at Peel Croft. United were voted out of the Football League in 1907, and folded in 1910. Burton All Saints were then left as the town&#x27;s main club, becoming Burton Town in 1924, but folded in 1940. In 1950 Burton Albion were founded. Having moved from Eton Park to the Pirelli Stadium in 2005, Albion became the town&#x27;s fourth Football League club in 2009 after winning the Football Conference. The team now play in League 1, the third tier of the English football league system, following relegation in 2017–18, after two years in The Championship. Burton is also the location of the St George&#x27;s Park National Football Centre, which opened in 2012.

The Burton &amp; District Cricket League has many notable clubs, including Burton Cricket Club, Dunstall Cricket Club, Abbott&#x27;s Bromley, Yoxall and Lichfield Cricket Club.

Burton Rugby Football Club, one of the oldest rugby union clubs in the country, was established in 1870, when it played both association and rugby football rules. It did not adopt rugby union only rules until 1876.

The town is also home to the Burton Canoe Club on the banks of the River Trent. It has recently expanded and built its own clubhouse. Also along the River Trent in Burton are Burton Leander Rowing Club, which was founded in 1847 (and is one of the oldest rowing clubs in the country), and Trent Rowing Club, founded in 1863.

Burton Hockey Club was established in 1899. The club promotes and supports seven men&#x27;s teams, four ladies&#x27; teams, and a popular and successful youth academy. Home matches are played at Shobnall Leisure Complex in the shadows of Marstons Brewery, Shobnall Road. The club has also been recognised as working towards providing a Safe, Effective and Child Friendly club environment, and as such has been awarded the England Hockey Club&#x27;s First Accreditation, (EH id: 1180).

Burton is home to the Powerhouse Gym International All-Round Weightlifting team, which was set up in 1985 by Steve Gardner (former World All-Round Weightlifting Champion – inducted into the IAWA (UK) Hall of Fame in 2000). The club trains All-Round Weightlifters, including powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting and is affiliated to the International All-Round Weightlifting Association. The Burton club hosted the 2008 IAWA World Championships.

<text>The Trent is the third longest river in the United Kingdom. Its source is in Staffordshire, on the southern edge of Biddulph Moor. It flows through and drains the North Midlands into the Humber Estuary. The river is known for dramatic flooding after storms and spring snowmelt, which in the past often caused the river to change course.

The river passes through Stoke-on-Trent, Stone, Staffordshire, Rugeley, Burton-upon-Trent and Nottingham before joining the River Ouse, Yorkshire at Trent Falls to form the Humber Estuary, which empties into the North Sea between Kingston upon Hull in Yorkshire and Immingham in Lincolnshire. The wide Humber estuary has often been described as the boundary between the Midlands and the north of England.

==Name==
The name &quot;Trent&quot; is possibly from a Romano-British word meaning &quot;strongly flooding&quot;. More specifically, the name may be a contraction of two Romano-British words, &quot;tros&quot; (&quot;over&quot;) and &quot;hynt&quot; (&quot;way&quot;). This may indeed indicate a river that is prone to flooding. However, a more likely explanation may be that it was considered to be a river that could be crossed principally by means of fords, i.e. the river flowed over major road routes. This may explain the presence of the Romano-British element &quot;rid&quot; (cf. Welsh &quot;rhyd&quot;, &quot;ford&quot;) in various place names along the Trent, such as Hill Ridware, as well as the Old English‐derived &quot;ford&quot;. Another translation is given as &quot;the trespasser&quot;, referring to the waters flooding over the land. According to Koch at the University of Wales, the name &quot;Trent&quot; derives from the Romano-British &quot;Trisantona&quot;, a Romano-British reflex of the combined elements *&quot;tri-sent(o)-on-ā-&quot; (through-path-augmentative-feminine-) ‘great thoroughfare’. A traditional but almost certainly wrong opinion is that of Izaak Walton, who states in The Compleat Angler (1653) that the Trent is &quot;... so called from thirty kind of fishes that are found in it, or for that it receiveth thirty lesser rivers.&quot;

==Course==
The Trent rises within the Staffordshire Moorlands district, near the village of Biddulph Moor, from a number of sources including the Trent Head Well. It is then joined by other small streams to form the Head of Trent, which flows south, to the only reservoir along its course at Knypersley Reservoir. Downstream of the reservoir it passes through Stoke-on-Trent and merges with the Lyme, Fowlea and other brooks that drain the six towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to become the River Trent. On the southern fringes of Stoke, it passes through the landscaped parkland of Trentham Gardens.

The river then continues south through the market town of Stone, and after passing the village of Salt, it reaches Great Haywood, where it is spanned by the 16th-century Essex Bridge near Shugborough Hall. At this point the River Sow joins it from Stafford. The Trent now flows south-east past the town of Rugeley until it reaches Kings Bromley where it meets the Blithe. After the confluence with the Swarbourn, it passes Alrewas and reaches Wychnor, where it is crossed by the A38 road dual carriageway, which follows the route of the Roman Ryknild Street. The river turns north-east where it is joined by its largest tributary, the River Tame (which is at this point actually the larger, though its earlier length shorter) and immediately afterwards by the River Mease, creating a larger river that now flows through a broad floodplain.

The river continues north-east, passing the village of Walton-on-Trent until it reaches the large town of Burton-upon-Trent. The river in Burton is crossed by a number of bridges including the ornate 19th-century Ferry Bridge that links Stapenhill to the town. To the north-east of Burton the river is joined by the River Dove at Newton Solney and enters Derbyshire, before passing between the villages of Willington and Repton where it turns directly east to reach Swarkestone Bridge. Shortly afterwards, the river becomes the Derbyshire-Leicestershire border, passing the traditional crossing point of King&#x27;s Mill, Castle Donington, Weston-on-Trent and Aston-on-Trent.

At Shardlow, where the Trent and Mersey Canal begins, the river also meets the Derwent at Derwent Mouth. After this confluence, the river turns north-east and is joined by the River Soar before reaching the outskirts of Nottingham, where it is joined by the River Erewash near the Attenborough nature reserve and enters Nottinghamshire. As it enters the city, it passes the suburbs of Beeston, Clifton and Wilford; where it is joined by the Leen. On reaching West Bridgford it flows beneath Trent Bridge near the cricket ground of the same name, and beside The City Ground, home of Nottingham Forest F.C., until it reaches Holme Sluices.

Downstream of Nottingham it passes Radcliffe-on-Trent, Stoke Bardolph and Burton Joyce before reaching Gunthorpe with its bridge, lock and weir. The river now flows north-east below the Toot and Trent Hills before reaching Hazelford Ferry, Fiskerton and Farndon. To the north of Farndon, beside the Staythorpe Power Station the river splits, with one arm passing Averham and Kelham, and the other arm, which is navigable, being joined by the Devon before passing through the market town of Newark-on-Trent and beneath the town&#x27;s castle walls. The two arms recombine at Crankley Point beyond the town, where the river turns due north to pass North Muskham and Holme to reach Cromwell Weir, below which the Trent becomes tidal.

The now tidal river meanders across a wide floodplain, at the edge of which are located riverside villages such as Carlton and Sutton on Trent, Besthorpe and Girton. After passing the site of High Marnham power station, it becomes the approximate boundary between Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire and reaches the only toll bridge along its course at Dunham on Trent. Downstream of Dunham the river passes Church Laneham and reaches Torksey, where it meets the Foss Dyke navigation which connects the Trent to Lincoln and the River Witham. Further north at Littleborough is the site of the Roman town of Segelocum, where a Roman road once crossed the river.

It then reaches the town of Gainsborough with its own Trent Bridge. The river frontage in the town is lined with warehouses, that were once used when the town was an inland port, many of which have been renovated for modern use. Downstream of the town the villages are often named in pairs, representing the fact that they were once linked by a river ferry between the two settlements. These villages include West Stockwith and East Stockwith, Owston Ferry and East Ferry, and West Butterwick and East Butterwick. At West Stockwith the Trent is joined by the Chesterfield Canal and the River Idle and soon after enters Lincolnshire fully, passing to the west of Scunthorpe. The last bridge over the river is at Keadby where it is joined by both the Stainforth and Keadby Canal and the River Torne.

Downstream of Keadby the river progressively widens, passing Amcotts and Flixborough to reach Burton upon Stather and finally Trent Falls. At this point, between Alkborough and Faxfleet the river reaches the boundary with Yorkshire and joins the River Ouse to form the Humber which flows into the North Sea.

===Migration of course in historic times===
Unusually for an English river, the channel altered significantly during historic times, and has been described as being similar to the Mississippi in this respect, especially in its middle reaches, where there are numerous old meanders and cut-off loops. An abandoned channel at Repton is described on an old map as &#x27;Old Trent Water&#x27;, records show that this was once the main navigable route, with the river having switched to a more northerly course in the 18th century. Farther downstream at Hemington, archaeologists have found the remains of a medieval bridge across another abandoned channel. Researchers using aerial photographs and historical maps have identified many of these palaeochannel features, a well-documented example being the meander cutoff at Sawley. The river&#x27;s propensity to change course is referred to in Shakespeare&#x27;s play Henry IV, Part 1:

Henry Hotspur&#x27;s speech complaining about the river has been linked to the meanders near West Burton, however, given the wider context of the scene, in which conspirators propose to divide England into three after a revolt, it is thought that Hotspur&#x27;s intentions were of a grander design, diverting the river east towards the Wash such that he would benefit from a much larger share of the divided Kingdom. Downstream of Burton upon Trent, the river increasingly trends northwards, cutting off a portion of Nottinghamshire and nearly all of Lincolnshire from his share, north of the Trent. The idea for this scene, may have been based on the disagreement regarding a mill weir near Shelford Manor, between local landowners Gilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and Sir Thomas Stanhope which culminated with a long diversion channel being dug to bypass the mill. This took place in 1593 so would have been a contemporary topic in the Shakespearean period.

===Prehistory===
During the Pleistocene epoch (1.7 million years ago), the River Trent rose in the Welsh hills and flowed almost east from Nottingham through the present Vale of Belvoir to cut a gap through the limestone ridge at Ancaster and thence to the North Sea. At the end of the Wolstonian Stage (c. 130,000 years ago) a mass of stagnant ice left in the Vale of Belvoir caused the river to divert north along the old Lincoln river, through the Lincoln gap, along what is now the course of the Witham. During a following glaciation (Devensian, 70,000 BC) the ice held back vast areas of water – called Glacial Lake Humber – in the current lower Trent basin. When this retreated, the Trent adopted its current course into the Humber.

==Catchment==

The Trent basin covers a large part of the Midlands, and includes the majority of the counties of Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and the West Midlands; but also includes parts of Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, Warwickshire and Rutland. The catchment is located between the drainage basins of the Severn and its tributary the Avon to the south and west, the Weaver to the north-west, the tributaries of the Yorkshire Ouse to the North and the basins of the Welland, Witham and Ancholme to the east.

A distinctive feature of the catchment is the marked variation in the topography and character of the landscape, which varies from the upland moorland headwaters of the Dark Peak, where the highest point of the catchment is the Kinder Scout plateau at ; through to the intensively farmed and drained flat fenland areas that exist alongside the lower tidal reaches, where ground levels can equal sea level. These lower reaches are protected from tidal flooding by a series of floodbanks and defences.

Elsewhere there is a distinct contrast between the open limestone areas of the White Peak in the Dove catchment, and the large woodland areas, including Sherwood Forest in the Dukeries area of the Idle catchment, the upland Charnwood Forest, and the National Forest in the Soar and Mease drainage basins respectively.

Land use is predominantly rural, with some three-quarters of the Trent catchment given over to agriculture. This ranges from moorland grazing of sheep in the upland areas, through to improved pasture and mixed farms in the middle reaches, where dairy farming is important. Intensive arable farming of cereals and root vegetables, chiefly potatoes and sugar beet occurs in the lowland areas, such as the Vale of Belvoir and the lower reaches of the Trent, Torne and Idle.
Water level management is important in these lowland areas, and the local watercourses are usually maintained by internal drainage boards and their successors, with improved drainage being assisted by the use of pumping stations to lift water into embanked carrier rivers, which subsequently discharge into the Trent.

The less populous rural areas are offset by a number of large urbanised areas including the conurbations of Stoke-on-Trent, Birmingham and the surrounding Black Country in the West Midlands; and in the East Midlands the major university cities and historical county seats of Leicester, Derby and Nottingham. Together these contain the majority of the 6 million people who live in the catchment.

The majority of these urban areas are in the upper reaches of either the Trent itself, as is the case with Stoke, or its tributaries. For example, Birmingham lies at the upper end of the Tame, and Leicester is located towards the head of the Soar. Whilst this is not unique for an English river, it does mean that there is an ongoing legacy of issues relating to urban runoff, pollution incidents, and effluent dilution from sewage treatment, industry and coal mining. Historically, these issues resulted in a considerable deterioration in the water quality of both the Trent and its tributaries, especially the Tame. To bring clean water to the West Midlands, Birmingham Corporation created a large reservoir chain and aqueduct system to bring water from the Elan Valley.

==Geology==

Underlying the upper reaches of the Trent, are formations of Millstone Grit and Carboniferous Coal Measures which include layers of sandstones, marls and coal seams. The river crosses a band of Triassic Sherwood sandstone at Sandon, and it meets the same sandstone again as it flows beside Cannock Chase, between Great Haywood and Armitage, there is also another outcrop between Weston-on-Trent and King&#x27;s Mill.
Downstream of Armitage the solid geology is primarily Mercia Mudstones, the course of the river following the arc of these mudstones as they pass through the Midlands all the way to the Humber. The mudstones are not exposed by the bed of the river, as there is a layer of gravels and then alluvium above the bedrock. In places, however the mudstones do form river cliffs, most notably at Gunthorpe and Stoke Lock near Radcliffe on Trent, the village being named after the distinctive red coloured strata.

The low range of hills, which have been formed into a steep set of cliffs overlooking the Trent between Scunthorpe and Alkborough are also made up of mudstones, but are of the younger Rhaetic Penarth Group.

In the wider catchment the geology is more varied, ranging from the Precambrian rocks of the Charnwood Forest, through to the Jurassic limestone that forms the Lincolnshire Edge and the eastern watershed of the Trent. The most important in terms of the river are the extensive sandstone and limestone aquifers that underlie many of the tributary catchments. These include the Sherwood sandstones that occur beneath much of eastern Nottinghamshire, the Permian Lower Magnesian limestone and the carboniferous limestone in Derbyshire. Not only do these provide baseflows to the major tributaries, the groundwater is an important source for public water supply.

Sand, gravels and alluvium deposits that overlie the mudstone bedrock occur almost along the entire length of the river, and are an important feature of the middle and lower reaches, with the alluvial river silt producing fertile soils that are used for intensive agriculture in the Trent valley. Beneath the alluvium are widespread deposits of sand and gravel, which also occur as gravel terraces considerably above the height of the current river level. There is thought to be a complex succession of at least six separate gravel terrace systems along the river, deposited when a much larger Trent flowed through the existing valley, and along its ancestral routes through the water gaps at Lincoln and Ancaster.

This ‘staircase’ of flat topped terraces was created as a result of successive periods of deposition and subsequent down cutting by the river, a product of the meltwater and glacially eroded material produced from ice sheets at the end of glacial periods through the Pleistocene epoch between 450,000 and 12,000 years BP. Contained within these terraces is evidence of the mega fauna that once lived along the river, the bones and teeth of animals such as the woolly mammoth, bison and wolves that existed during colder periods have all been identified. Another notable find in a related terrace system near Derby from a warmer interglacial period, was the Allenton hippopotamus.

The lower sequences of these terraces have been widely quarried for sand and gravel, and the extraction of these minerals continues to be an important industry in the Trent Valley, with some three million tonnes of aggregates being produced each year. Once worked out, the remaining gravel pits which are usually flooded by the relatively high water table have been reused for a wide variety of purposes. These include recreational water activities, and once rehabilitated, as nature reserves and wetlands.

During the end of the last Devensian glacial period the formation of Lake Humber in the lowest reaches of the river, meant that substantial lake bed clays and silts were laid down to create the flat landscape of the Humberhead Levels. These levels extend across the Trent valley, and include the lower reaches of the Eau, Torne and Idle. In some areas, successive layers of peat were built up above the lacustrine deposits during the Holocene period, which created lowland mires such as the Thorne and Hatfield Moors.

==Hydrology==
The topography, geology and land use of the Trent catchment all have a direct influence on the hydrology of the river. The variation in these factors is also reflected in the contrasting runoff characteristics and subsequent inflows of the principal tributaries. The largest of these is the River Tame, which contributes nearly a quarter of the total flow for the Trent, with the other significant tributaries being the Derwent at 18%, Soar 17%, the Dove 13%, and the Sow 8%. Four of these main tributaries, including the Dove and Derwent which drain the upland Peak District, all join within the middle reaches, giving rise to a comparatively energetic river system for the UK.

===Rainfall===
Rainfall in the catchment generally follows topography with the highest annual rainfall of and above occurring over the high moorland uplands of the Derwent headwaters to the north and west, with the lowest of , in the lowland areas to the north and east. Rainfall totals in the Tame are not as high as would be expected from the moderate relief, due to the rain shadow effect of the Welsh mountains to the west, reducing amounts to an average of for the tributary basin.
The average for the whole Trent catchment is which is significantly lower than the average for United Kingdom at and lower than that for England at .

Like other large lowland British rivers, the Trent is vulnerable to long periods of rainfall caused by sluggish low pressure weather systems repeatedly crossing the basin from the Atlantic, especially during the autumn and winter when evaporation is at its lowest. This combination can produce a water-logged catchment that can respond rapidly in terms of runoff, to any additional rainfall. Such conditions occurred in February 1977, with widespread flooding in the lower reaches of the Trent when heavy rain produced a peak flow of nearly at Nottingham. In 2000 similar conditions occurred again, with above average rainfall in the autumn being followed by further rainfall, producing flood conditions in November of that year.

Another meteorological risk, although one that occurs less often, is that related to the rapid melting of snow lying in the catchment. This can be a result of a sudden rise in temperature after a prolonged cold period, or when combined with extensive rainfall. Many of the largest historical floods were caused by snowmelt, but the last such episode occurred when the bitter winter of 1946–7 was followed by a rapid thaw due to rain in March 1947 and caused severe flooding all along the Trent valley.

At the other extreme, extended periods of low rainfall can also cause problems. The lowest flows for the river were recorded during the drought of 1976, following the dry winter of 1975/6. Flows measured at Nottingham were exceptionally low by the end of August, and were given a drought return period of greater than one hundred years.

===Discharge===
The river&#x27;s flow is measured at several points along its course, at a number of gauging stations. At Stoke-on-Trent in the upper reaches, the average flow is only , which increases considerably to , at Great Haywood, as it includes the flow of the upper tributaries draining the Potteries conurbation. At Yoxall, the flow increases to due to the input of larger tributaries including the Sow and Blithe. At Drakelow upstream of Burton the flow increases nearly three-fold to , due to the additional inflow from the largest tributary the Tame. At Colwick near Nottingham, the average flow rises to , due to the combined inputs of the other major tributaries namely the Dove, Derwent and Soar. The last point of measurement is North Muskham here the average flow is , a relatively small increase due to the input of the Devon, and other smaller Nottinghamshire tributaries.

The Trent has marked variations in discharge, with long term average monthly flows at Colwick fluctuating from in July during the summer, and increasing to in January.
During lower flows the Trent and its tributaries are heavily influenced by effluent returns from sewage works, especially the Tame where summer flows can be made up of 90% effluent. For the Trent this proportion is lower, but with nearly half of low flows being made up of these effluent inflows, it is still significant. There are also baseflow contributions from the major aquifers in the catchment.

Average monthly flows of Trent in cubic metres per second measured at Colwick (Nottingham).
===Sediment===
In the lower tidal reaches the Trent has a high sediment load, this fine silt which is also known as ‘warp&#x27;, was used to improve the soil by a process known as warping, whereby river water was allowed to flood into adjacent fields through a series of warping drains, enabling the silt to settle out across the land. Up to of deposition could occur in a single season, and depths of have been accumulated over time at some locations. A number of the smaller Trent tributaries are still named as warping drains, such as Morton warping drain, near Gainsborough.

Warp was also used as a commercial product, after being collected from the river banks at low tide, it was transported along the Chesterfield Canal to Walkeringham where it was dried out and refined to be eventually sold as a silver polish for cutlery manufacturers.

==Floods==
The Trent is widely known for its tendency to cause significant flooding along its course, and there is a well documented flood history extending back for some 900 years. In Nottingham the heights of significant historic floods from 1852 have been carved into a bridge abutment next to Trent Bridge, with flood marks being transferred from the medieval Hethbeth bridge that pre-dated the existing 19th-century crossing. Historic flood levels have also been recorded at Girton and on the churchyard wall at Collingham.
One of the earliest recorded floods along the Trent was in 1141, and like many other large historical events was caused by the melting of snow following heavy rainfall, it also caused a breach in the outer floodbank at Spalford. Some of the earliest floods can be assessed by using Spalford bank as a substitute measure for the size of a particular flood, as it has been estimated that the bank only failed when flows were greater than , the bank was also breached in 1403 and 1795.

Early bridges were vulnerable to floods, and in 1309 many bridges were washed away or damaged by severe winter floods, including Hethbeth Bridge. In 1683 the same bridge was partially destroyed by a flood that also meant the loss of the bridge at Newark. Historical archives often record details of the bridge repairs that followed floods, as the cost of these repairs or pontage had to be raised by borrowing money and charging a local toll.

The largest known flood was the Candlemas flood of February 1795, which followed an eight-week period of harsh winter weather, rivers froze which that meant mills were unable to grind corn, and then followed a rapid thaw. Due to the size of the flood and the ice entrained in the flow, nearly every bridge along the Trent was badly damaged or washed away. The bridges at Wolseley, Wychnor and the main span at Swarkestone were all destroyed. In Nottingham, residents of Narrow Marsh were trapped by the floodwaters in their first floor rooms, boats were used to take supplies to those stranded. Livestock was badly affected, 72 sheep drowned in Wilford and ten cows were lost in Bridgford. The vulnerable flood bank at Spalford was breached again, floodwaters spreading out across the low-lying land, even reaching the River Witham and flooding Lincoln. Some were flooded for a period of over three weeks.

A description of the breach was given as follows:

The bank is formed upon a plain of sandy nature, and when it was broken in 1795, the water forced an immense breach, the size of which may be judged from the fact that eighty loads of faggots and upwards of four hundred tons of earth were required to fill up the hole, an operation which took several weeks to complete.

The flood bank was subsequently strengthened and repaired, following further floods during 1824 and 1852.

The principal flood of the 19th century and the second largest recorded, was in October 1875. In Nottingham a cart overturned in the floodwaters near the Wilford Road and six people drowned, dwellings nearby were flooded to a depth of . Although not quite as large as 1795 this flood devastated many places along the river, at Burton upon Trent much of the town was inundated, with flooded streets and houses, and dead animals floating past in the flood. Food was scarce, &quot;in one day 10,000 loaves had to be sent into the town and distributed gratuitously to save people from famine&quot;. In Newark the water was deep enough to allow four grammar school boys to row across the countryside to Kelham. The flood marks at Girton show that this flood was only lower than that of 1795, when the village was flooded to a depth of .
On 17–18 March 1947 the Trent overtopped its banks in Nottingham. Large parts of the city and surrounding areas were flooded with 9,000 properties and nearly a hundred industrial premises affected some to first floor height. The suburbs of Long Eaton, West Bridgford and Beeston all suffered particularly badly. Two days later, in the lower tidal reaches of the river, the peak of the flood combined with a high spring tide to flood villages and 2,000 properties in Gainsborough. River levels dropped when the floodbank at Morton breached, resulting in the flooding of some of farmland in the Trent valley.

Flooding on the Trent can also be caused by the effects of storm surges independently of fluvial flows, a series of which occurred during October and November 1954, resulting in the worse tidal flooding experienced along the lower reaches. These floods revealed the need for a tidal protection scheme, which would cope with the flows experienced in 1947 and the tidal levels from 1954, and subsequently the floodbanks and defences along the lower river were improved to this standard with the works being completed in 1965. In December 2013, the largest storm surge since the 1950s occurred on the Trent, when a high spring tide combined with strong winds and a low pressure weather system, produced elevated tidal river levels in the lower reaches. The resulting surge overtopped the flood defences in the area near Keadby and Burringham, flooding 50 properties.

The fifth largest flood recorded at Nottingham occurred in November 2000, with widespread flooding of low-lying land along the Trent valley, including many roads and railways. The flood defences around Nottingham and Burton constructed during the 1950s, following the 1947 event, stopped any major urban flooding, but problems did occur in undefended areas such as Willington and Gunthorpe, and again at Girton where 19 houses were flooded.
The flood defences in Nottingham that protect 16,000 homes and those in Burton where they prevent 7,000 properties from flooding were reassessed after this flood, and were subsequently improved between 2006 and 2012.

==History of navigation==

Nottingham seems to have been the ancient head of navigation until the Restoration, due partly to the difficult navigation of the Trent Bridge. Navigation was then extended to Wilden Ferry, near to the more recent Cavendish Bridge, as a result of the efforts of the Fosbrooke family of Shardlow.

Later, in 1699, the baron William Paget (Lord Paget), who owned coal mines and land in the area, obtained an Act of Parliament (10 Will. 3. c. 26) to extend navigation up to Fleetstones Bridge, Burton, despite opposition from the people of Nottingham. Lord Paget seems to have funded the work privately, building locks at King&#x27;s Mill and Burton Mills and several cuts and basins. The Act gave him absolute control over the building of any wharves and warehouses above Nottingham Bridge. Lord Paget leased the navigation and the wharf at Burton to George Hayne, while the wharf and warehouses at Wilden were leased by Leonard Fosbrooke, who held the ferry rights and was a business partner of Hayne. The two men refused to allow any cargo to be landed which was not carried in their own boats, and so created a monopoly.

In 1748, merchants from Nottingham attempted to end this monopoly by landing goods on the banks and into carts, but Fosbrooke used his ferry rope to block the river, and then created a bridge by mooring boats across the channel, and employing men to defend them. Hayne subsequently scuppered a barge in King&#x27;s Lock, and for the next eight years goods had to be transhipped around it. Despite a Chancery injunction against them, the two men continued with their action. Hayne&#x27;s lease expired in 1762, and Lord Paget&#x27;s son, the Earl of Uxbridge, gave the new lease to the Burton Boat Company.

The Trent and Mersey Canal was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1766, and construction from Shardlow to Preston Brook, where it joined the Bridgewater Canal, was completed by 1777. The canal ran parallel to the upper river to Burton upon Trent, where new wharfs and warehouses at Horninglow served the town, and the Burton Boat Company were unable to repair the damaged reputation of the river created by their predecessors. Eventually in 1805, they reached an agreement with Henshall &amp; Co., the leading canal carriers, for the closure of the river above Wilden Ferry. Though the river is no doubt legally still navigable above Shardlow, it is probable that the agreement marks the end of the use of that stretch of the river as a commercial navigation.

===The lower river===
The first improvement of the lower river was at Newark, where the channel splits into two. The residents of the town wanted to increase the use of the branch nearest to them, and so an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1772 to authorise the work. Newark Navigation Commissioners were created, with powers to borrow money to fund the construction of two locks, and to charge tolls for boats using them. The work was completed by October 1773, and the separate tolls remained in force until 1783, when they were replaced by a one-shilling (5p) toll whichever channel the boats used.

Users of the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Loughborough Canal and the Erewash Canal next demanded major improvements to the river down to Gainsborough, including new cuts, locks, dredging and a towing path suitable for horses. The Dadfords, who were engineers on the Trent and Mersey Canal, estimated the cost at £20,000, but the proposal was opposed by landowners and merchants on the river, while the &quot;Navigator&quot;, published in 1788, estimated that around 500 men who were employed to bow-haul boats would have lost their jobs. Agreement could not be reached, and so William Jessop was asked to re-assess the situation. He suggested that dredging, deepening, and restricting the width of the channel could make significant improvements to the navigable depth, although cuts would be required at Wilford, Nottingham bridge and Holme. This proposal formed the basis for an Act of Parliament obtained in 1783, which also allowed a horse towing path to be built. The work was completed by September 1787, and dividends of 5 per cent were paid on the capital during 1786 and 1787, increasing to 7 per cent, the maximum allowed by the Act, after that. Jessop carried out a survey for a side cut and lock at Sawley in 1789, and it was built by 1793.

At the beginning of the 1790s, the Navigation faced calls for a bypass of the river at Nottingham, where the passage past Trent Bridge was dangerous, and the threat of a canal running parallel to the river, which was proposed by the Erewash and the Trent and Mersey Canal companies. In order to retain control of the whole river, they supported the inclusion of the Beeston Cut in the bill for the Nottingham Canal, which prevented the Erewash Canal company from getting permission to build it, and then had the proposal removed from the Nottingham Canal company&#x27;s bill in return for their support of the main bill. The parallel canal was thwarted in May 1793, when they negotiated the withdrawal of the canal bill by proposing a thorough survey of the river which would result in their own legislation being put before parliament. William Jessop performed the survey, assisted by Robert Whitworth, and they published their report on 8 July 1793. The major proposals included a cut and lock at Cranfleet, where the River Soar joins the Trent, a cut, locks and weirs at Beeston, which would connect with the Nottingham Canal at Lenton, and a cut and lock at Holme Pierrepont. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1794, and the existing proprietors subscribed the whole of the authorised capital of £13,000 (equivalent to £ in ), themselves.

The aim of the improvements was to increase the minimum depth from to . By early 1796, the Beeston cut was operational, with the Cranfleet cut following in 1797, and the Holme cut in 1800, with the whole works being finished by 1 September 1801. The cost exceeded the authorised capital by a large margin, with the extra being borrowed, but the company continued to pay a 7 per cent dividend on the original shares and on those created to finance the new work. In 1823 and again in 1831, the Newark Navigation Commissioners proposed improvements to the river, so that larger vessels could be accommodated, but the Trent Navigation Company were making a good profit, and did not see the need for such work.

===Competition===
The arrival of the railways resulted in significant change for the company. Tolls were reduced to retain the traffic, wages were increased to retain the workforce, and they sought amalgamation with a railway company. The Nottingham and Gainsborough Railway offered £100 per share during 1845, but this was rejected. Tolls decreased from £11,344 (equivalent to £ in ), during 1839 to £3,111 (equivalent to £ in ), in 1855. Many of the connecting waterways were bought by railway companies, and gradually fell into disrepair. In an attempt to improve the situation, the company toyed with the idea of cable-hauled steam tugs, but instead purchased a conventional steam dredger and some steam tugs. The cost of improvements was too great for the old company, and so an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1884 to restructure the company and raise additional capital. Failure to raise much of the capital resulted in another Act being obtained in 1887, with similar aims and similar results. A third Act of 1892 reverted the name to the Trent Navigation Company, and this time, some improvements were performed.

With traffic still between 350,000 and 400,000 tonnes per year, Frank Rayner became the engineer in 1896, and the company were persuaded that major work was necessary if the navigation was to survive. The engineer for the Manchester Ship Canal, Sir Edward Leader Williams, was commissioned to survey the river, while negotiations with the North Staffordshire Railway, who owned the Trent and Mersey Canal and had maintained its viability, ensured that some of the clauses from previous Acts of Parliament did not prevent progress. A plan to build six locks between Cromwell and Holme, and to dredge this section to ensure it was wide and deep was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1906. Raising finance was difficult, but some was subscribed by the chairman and vice-chairman, and construction of Cromwell Lock began in 1908. The Newark Navigation Commissioners financed improvements to Newark Town lock at the same time, and dredging of the channel was largely funded by selling the 400,000 tonnes of gravel removed from the river bed. At , Cromwell lock could hold a tug and three barges, and was opened on 22 May 1911. The transport of petroleum provided a welcome increase to trade on the river, but little more work was performed before the beginning of the First World War.

===Modernisation===
Increased running costs after the First World War could not be met by increasing the tolls, as the company had no statutory powers to do so, and so suggested that the Ministry of Transport should take over the navigation, which they did from 24 September 1920. Tolls were increased, and a committee recommended improvements to the river. Nottingham Corporation invested some £450,000 on building the locks authorised by the 1906 Act, starting with Holme lock on 28 September 1921, and finishing with Hazelford lock, which was formally opened by Neville Chamberlain on 25 June 1926. A loan from Nottingham Corporation and a grant from the Unemployment Grants Committee enabled the company to rebuild Newark Nether lock, which was opened on 12 April 1926.

During the early 1930s, the company considered enlarging the navigation above Nottingham, in conjunction with improvements to the River Soar Navigation, between Trent Lock and Leicester. There were also negotiations with the London and North Eastern Railway, who were responsible for the Nottingham Canal between Trent Lock and Lenton. Plans for new larger locks at Beeston and Wilford were abandoned when the Trent Catchment Board opposed them. The Grand Union refused to improve the Soar Navigation, because the Trent Navigation Company could not guarantee 135,000 tons of additional traffic. The company also considered a plan to reopen the river to Burton, which would have involved the rebuilding of Kings Mills lock, and the construction of four new locks. An extra set of gates were added to Cromwell lock in 1935, effectively creating a second lock, while the Lenton to Trent Lock section was leased from the LNER in 1936, and ultimately purchased in 1946.

Frank Rayner, who had been with the company since 1887, and had served as its engineer and later general manager since 1896, died in December 1945. Sir Ernest Jardine, who as vice-chairman had partly funded the first lock at Cromwell in 1908, died in 1947, and the company ceased to exist in 1948 when the waterways were nationalised. The last act of the directors was to pay a 7.5 per cent dividend on the shares in 1950. Having taken over responsibility for the waterway, the Transport Commission enlarged Newark Town lock in 1952, and the flood lock at Holme was removed to reduce the risk of flooding in Nottingham. More improvements followed between 1957 and 1960. The two locks at Cromwell became one, capable of holding eight Trent barges, dredging equipment was updated, and several of the locks were mechanised. Traffic increased from 620,000 tonnes during 1951 to 1,017,356 tonnes during 1964, but all of this was below Nottingham. Commercial carrying above Nottingham ceased during the 1950s, to be replaced by pleasure cruising.

Although commercial use of the river has declined, the lower river between Cromwell and Nottingham can still take large motor barges up to around in length with a capacity of approx 300 tonnes. Barges still transport gravel from pits at Girton and Besthorpe to Goole and Hull.

===Navigation today===

The river is legally navigable for some below Burton upon Trent. However, for practical purposes, navigation above the southern terminus of the Trent and Mersey Canal (at Shardlow) is conducted on the canal, rather than on the river itself. The canal connects the Trent to the Potteries and on to Runcorn and the Bridgewater Canal.

Down river of Shardlow, the non-tidal river is navigable as far as the Cromwell Lock near Newark, except in Nottingham (Beeston Cut &amp; Nottingham Canal) and just west of Nottingham, where there are two lengths of canal, Sawley and Cranfleet cuts. Below Cromwell lock, the Trent is tidal, and therefore only navigable by experienced, well-equipped boaters. Navigation lights and a proper anchor and cable are compulsory. Associated British Ports, the navigation authority for the river from Gainsborough to Trent Falls, insist that anyone in charge of a boat must be experienced at navigating in tidal waters.

Between Trent Falls and Keadby, coastal vessels that have navigated through the Humber still deliver cargoes to the wharves of Grove Port, Neap House, Keadby, Gunness and Flixborough. Restrictions on size mean that the largest vessels that can be accommodated are long and 4,500 tonnes.
The use of a maritime pilot on the Trent is not compulsory for commercial craft, but is suggested for those without any experience of the river. Navigation can be difficult, and there have been a number of incidents with ships running aground and in one case, striking Keadby Bridge. The most recent occurrence involved the &quot;Celtic Endeavour&quot; being aground near Gunness for ten days, finally being lifted off by a high tide.

==Trent Aegir==

At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent experience a moderately large tidal bore (up to high), commonly known as the Trent Aegir (named after the Norse sea god). The Aegir occurs when a high spring tide meets the downstream flow of the river. The funnel shape of the river mouth exaggerates this effect, causing a large wave to travel upstream as far as Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, and sometimes beyond. The Aegir cannot travel much beyond Gainsborough as the shape of the river reduces the Aegir to little more than a ripple, and weirs north of Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, stop its path completely.

==The literal North/South divide==
The Trent historically marked the boundary between Northern England and Southern England. For example, the administration of royal forests was subject to a different justice in eyre north and south of the river, and the jurisdiction of the medieval Council of the North started at the Trent. In addition to this, the University of Oxford was formerly divided into a northern nation and a southern nation, the former consisting of English people north of the River Trent and the Scots and the latter consisting of English people south of the Trent, the Irish, and the Welsh.

Some traces of the former division remain: the Trent marks the boundary between the provinces of two English Kings of Arms, Norroy and Clarenceux. This divide was also described in Michael Drayton&#x27;s epic topographical poem, &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot;, The Sixe and Twentieth Song, 1622:
==Pollution history==
It is not clear when pollution first became an issue for the River Trent, but in the late 1880s, it had a thriving salmon fishery, with the river producing an annual catch of some 3,000 fish, a decade later, this had fallen to 100. The collapse of the fishery was due to the rapid population increase of the towns that developed following the Industrial Revolution. The tipping point being the introduction of piped water and a basic sewer network, which meant that effluent, which was previously stored in cesspits, was carried away through drains into the nearest brook.

This was a particular problem in Stoke-on-Trent and the growing towns of the Potteries. Due to the relatively small size of the Trent and its tributaries such as the Fowlea Brook, which drained these towns, the river and brooks were unable to dilute the inflow of domestic sewage and soon became overwhelmed and badly polluted.

At the downstream end of the Potteries was Trentham Hall, here pollution became so bad that the owner, the Duke of Sutherland, made a claim against the local Fenton council in 1902. He also took out an injunction against the council to prevent the ongoing contamination causing a &quot;most foul and offensive stench&quot;, the river not even being suitable to water grazing cattle on the estate.
 Although he provided land for a sewage works nearby at Strongford, the problems continued such that in 1905 the Levenson-Gower family left Trentham altogether and moved to their other properties, including Dunrobin Castle in Scotland.

Until the outbreak of the Second World War, the main source of pollution continued to be the Potteries, although there was contamination from the Tame and other lower tributaries it was not as prominent. During the 1950s, however, the same problem of effluent dilution that occurred in Stoke began to become significant in Birmingham and the Black Country. Domestic effluent and polluting discharges from the metal working industries in the upper reaches, combined to affect the whole length of the tributary River Tame.

The Tame pollution also reached the Trent as well, with one of the worse affected reaches being that downstream of the confluence with the Tame through Burton, this being exacerbated by its late introduction of sewage treatment, and the substantial wastewater arising from the breweries in the town. Angling clubs in Burton used the Dove or local lakes for fishing, as the Trent through the town was absent of any fish. Downstream, the inflow of cleaner water from the Dove and then the Derwent meant that conditions improved enough to allow recreational coarse fishing in the lower reaches.

The pollution of the &quot;Trent catchment was probably at its worst in the late 1950s&quot;, this being the result of the ongoing industrialisation of the urban areas, combined with the interruption and under investment caused by two world wars, which lead to only piecemeal improvements of the sewerage treatment infrastructure taking place. One effect of this pollution was that the upper and middle reaches were completely devoid of any fish life.

John Jennings, the local MP for Burton highlighted these problems in a speech to the House when he stated in 1956, that as in previous years the river had been declared unsafe for swimming on advice from the medical officer, and how its unhealthy condition affected a local rowing club.

From the 1960s onwards, there were gradual but steady improvements to the inadequate sewage works and sewers built during the Victorian era in the urban areas, but this was expensive, and took time to complete. The changes were helped by the introduction of more stringent pollution control legislation, which required industrial waste to be discharged to sewers, and the formation of the Trent River Authority, which had new duties relating to managing water quality issues. Other changes, such as the replacement of town gas with natural gas, saw the end of the polluting and toxic coal tar emissions to rivers in 1963.

In 1970, Mr Jennings again raised the issue of pollution through Burton, the River Tame continuing to be a source of the problem, and further improvements were promised. The responsibility for sewage treatment works still belonged primarily to local authorities, which often meant an uncoordinated approach and a proliferation of small works. In 1974, these works were transferred to the regional water authorities, with the Severn Trent Water Authority taking over the role for the Trent catchment. This led to increased investment, the closure of older and smaller works, with sewage treatment being combined at larger modern works such as Strongford and Minworth.

The economic recession in the 1970s meant that there was a considerable contraction of heavy industrial sectors, reducing pollution loadings from factories and foundries. Later improvements such as the series of purification lakes that were constructed on the Tame in the 1980s, which allowed contaminated sediment to settle out from the river, also reduced pollution levels, and lessened the impact of first flush runoff events in the lower Tame and the middle Trent.

The improvements in water quality along the Trent were recorded through the chemical monitoring of the river from the 1950s. Polluting substances such as ammonia showed a reduction, as did the biochemical oxygen demand, an indicator of the contamination present in the river. There were corresponding increases in dissolved oxygen, an indicator of a healthy river environment.
The programme of monitoring also extended to taking biological samples, and one of the first biotic indices used for assessing the ecological rather than the chemical quality of rivers was developed by the local river board in the 1960s. Using invertebrates as an indicator of pollution levels, it was appropriately named the Trent Biotic index.

By 2004, it was reported that the Trent was cleaner than it had been in the last 70–80 years, and that episodic incidents of pollution had also reduced considerably since the 1970s. The river remains vulnerable to these pollution events, such as the one that occurred in October 2009 when an accidental release of cyanide from a factory into the sewer system in Stoke-on-Trent, affected the treatment works at Strongford. This resulted in the release of raw sewage and the chemical into the river, killing thousands of fish, and posing a health risk to river users as far south as Burton.

Although now considered cleaner, there are still problems with diffuse pollution from agricultural runoff and urban areas, as well as point source contamination from sewage works. The improvements that have taken place mean that the Trent can be used for public water consumption. Riverside lakes near Shardlow act as a reserve water source for Nottingham and Derby, and water is also abstracted at Torksey and Newton-on-Trent for supplies in Lincolnshire.

==Wildlife and ecology==
Artificial changes along the Trent, due to navigation, farming, mineral extraction and drainage works, mean that much of the riparian landscape has been altered, reducing the amount of natural habitat. The river channel links the remaining, but fragmented wetland areas and nature reserves, providing a refuge for native and migrant species. These include wildfowl and wading birds that use the Trent Valley as a migration corridor, with the river also being used as a wildlife route by mammals such as otters and non-native American mink. It forms part of the Severn-Trent flyway, a route used by migratory birds to cross Great Britain.

Additional nature conservation areas were created beside the river in the 20th century, when a number of disused gravel pits, were rehabilitated as nature reserves. One of the most important of these is Attenborough Nature Reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which is visited by wildfowl such as Eurasian wigeon and common teal. Wading birds such as Eurasian oystercatcher and great bittern have also been observed at the reserve; as have kingfishers, reed warblers and water rails.

Other managed wetland sites along the river include Beckingham Marshes, Croxall Lakes, Drakelow, and Willington Gravel Pits. At Besthorpe near Newark, breeding pairs of little egrets and grey herons have been observed.

The Trent valley also links together other SSSI and local nature reserves, which have varying habitats not only for birds, but also mammals, insects and fish, a good example is the tributary River Mease where the entire watercourse has been designated both as a SSSI and a European special area of conservation.

One of the more unusual ecological sites is Pasturefields nature reserve near Hixon, an inland saltmarsh, which is a rare habitat for the UK. A vestige of the saline marshes created by the brine springs that seep from the groundwater of the Mercia mudstones, the reserve contains salt tolerant species normally found on the coast, such as sea plantain, arrowgrass and milkwort.

Improvements in water quality and subsequent fish stocks, in combination with the ban on the use of certain persistent pesticides have meant that otters have now returned to the Trent system, having been absent as recently as the 1980s. A survey in 2003 showed a doubling in the number of sites where evidence, such as spraints and footprints of these elusive animals were found. They have also now been sighted at locations such as Wolseley, Willington, and Attenborough. Seals have been reported up to near the head of the tidal section at Newark.

==Fishing==
Evidence of fishing along the Trent can be traced back to the Neolithic period, with the possible remnants of a fish weir discovered in the abandoned river channels at Hemington. More definitive finds from the medieval period were also found at this site and near Colwick. These consisted of V-shaped alignments of stakes; wattle panels and a large wicker trap and demonstrate that passive fishing techniques were in use on the river.

The Domesday catalogue showed that there were many successful mills and fisheries along the Trent. Mills were important locations for fish and eel traps, the eels being caught during ‘quill time’ between mid-August and early September. Written records show that in the 12th century landlords were paid in salmon, in lieu of rent at Burton upon Trent.

In the 17th century Izaak Walton described the River Trent as &#x27;One of the finest rivers in the world and the most abounding with excellent salmon and all sorts of delicate fish.&#x27; A list composed in 1641 for the Trent, contained thirty types of fish and other species including those that migrated from the sea such as shad, smelt, salmon and flounder, and riverine species such as trout, grayling, perch and pike.

The largest of those listed was the sturgeon, which at one time were caught in the Trent as far upstream as King&#x27;s Mill, but only in low numbers. Particular examples included one of taken near Donington castle in 1255, and another at King&#x27;s Mill of in 1791. The last known catch was in 1902 near Holme, the fish was and weighed .

The effluent and industrial pollution of the early 20th century, led to a rapid decline in fish stocks, large stretches of the river became fishless and species such as salmon almost disappeared. As water quality improved from the 1960s onwards, fish numbers recovered, and recreational coarse fishing became more popular.
By the 1970s the Trent was regarded as &#x27;one of the most productive rivers in the British Isles&#x27;. by anglers, who would travel from South Yorkshire and other surrounding areas, to fish the Trent as their local rivers still remained badly polluted and were absent of fish.

Analysis of catch returns from 1969 to 1985, showed that the fish caught most often by anglers were barbel, bream, bleak, carp, chub, dace, eel, gudgeon, perch, and roach. Over the study period the returns revealed that there was a variation in the species caught, with a shift from roach and dace based catches, to one of chub and bream, a change that was perceived by anglers to represent a ‘serious detriment’ to the fishery. This led to comments that the river had become ‘too clean for its fish’, and its popularity, especially for match fishing, declined from the mid-1980s. Competition from other fisheries such as well stocked ponds and lakes with better amenities and more consistent catches of fish also meant a reduction in the appeal of fishing the Trent.

Recreational fishing is still popular, although anglers no longer line the banks as they once did. There are many fishing clubs that use the river, with catches including barbel, bream, carp, chub, dace, pike, and roach.

Salmon, a species that became virtually extinct due to historic pollution, have been progressively reintroduced on the tributaries since 1998, with thousands of salmon parr being released into the Dove and its tributary the Churnet each year. Returning adult salmon have been seen leaping over weirs on the river and in 2011 a large salmon weighing over was caught at an undisclosed location, and was &#x27;thought to be the biggest caught on the Trent in the last thirty years&#x27;.

==Crossing the Trent==
Prior to the mid-18th century there were few permanent crossings of the river with only four bridges downstream of the Tame confluence: the old medieval bridges at Burton, Swarkestone, Nottingham (known as Hethbeth Bridge) and Newark, all first built by 1204. There were, however, over thirty ferries that operated along its course, and numerous fords, where passage was possible, their locations indicated by the suffix ‘ford’ in many riverside place-names such as Hanford, Bridgford, and Wilford.

Glover noted in 1829 that all three types of crossing were still in use on the Derbyshire section of the Trent, but that the fords were derelict and dangerous. These fording points only allowed passage across the river when water levels were low; when the river was in flood a long detour could be required. He reported that they could be treacherous to the unwary, since there were few gauges to show if the river had become too deep to cross, and that they were rarely used except by locals. One of the earliest known fords was the crossing at Littleborough, constructed by the Romans it was paved with flagstones, and supported by substantial timber pilings. The importance of these fords was demonstrated by their inclusion in the 1783 navigation Act, which limited any dredging at these sites so that they remained less than deep.
Ferries often replaced these earlier fording points, and were essential where the water was too deep, such as the tidal section of the lower river. As they were a source of income, they were recorded in the Domesday Book at a number of locations including Weston on Trent and Fiskerton, both of which were still in operation in the middle of the 20th century. The ferry boats used along the Trent ranged in size from small rowing boats, to flat decked craft that could carry livestock, horses, and in some case their associated carts or wagons.

Bridges over the river were created in Saxon times at Nottingham at least (and for a time just north of Newark at Cromwell, although it is not known how long that bridge site lasted), and formed major centres of trade and military importance. King Edward fortified the Nottingham bridge in 920, while a notable battle took place at Burton&#x27;s bridge in 1322, and another in 1643. The medieval bridges of Burton and Nottingham survived relatively intact until the 1860s, when both were replaced and demolished. The central arches of the medieval Swarkestone bridge were knocked out by the great flood of 1795 and rebuilt, but the bridge&#x27;s more rural location allowed large portions of the medieval bridge to survive and remain in use today. Crossing a wide flood plain, the bridge is almost long, a laborious project to allow flood waters to pass under it. At Newark, the last bridge on the Trent until modern times, the bridge was rebuilt in 1775. At least one other medieval attempt was made to bridge the Trent near Wilden at Hemington, but this was gone long before the end of the Middle Ages. The complex of three bridges provides evidence of attempts to keep a crossing open over slightly more than two hundred years from 1097, with three bridges constructed on the same site but felled by scouring, floods and course migration of the river to the south eroding the bridgehead. The bridge was probably gone by around 1311 when nearby Wilden ferry, near Shardlow was first recorded, and the site thereafter went without a bridge until Cavendish Bridge opened around 1760. As no archive sources record that the Hemington bridge existed, there may have been other medieval bridge projects now forgotten. (Until the late 18th century, a long period of stagnation for economic and technical reasons limited the number of bridges over the Trent; it has been noted that relatively few bridges were constructed in England on new sites anywhere between around 1250–1300 and 1750.) Cavendish Bridge was itself damaged beyond repair by a flood in March 1947, requiring a temporary Bailey bridge to be used until a new concrete span was constructed in 1957.

When bridge construction resumed, toll bridges were often constructed on the site of ferry routes. Such was the case at Willington, Gunthorpe and Gainsborough.

At Stapenhill near Burton, there were similar calls for a new bridge, a tally of usage showed that the foot ferry was being used 700 times per day. The new Ferry Bridge was opened in 1889, although it needed the financial support of the brewer and philanthropist Michael Bass to pay for the construction, and later in 1898 to purchase the existing ferry rights so that it became free of tolls.

The toll bridges were mostly bought out by the county councils in the 19th century following government reforms, one of the earliest being Willington in 1898, the first toll free crossing was marked by a procession across the bridge and a day of celebration.
The only toll bridge that remains across the Trent is at Dunham, although it is free to cross on Christmas and Boxing Day.

==Power stations==

The tall chimneys and concave shaped cooling towers of the many power stations are a dominant and familiar presence within the open landscape of the Trent valley, which has been widely used for power generation since the 1940s.

The primary reason for locating so many generating stations beside the Trent was the availability of sufficient amounts of cooling water from the river. This combined with the nearby supplies of fuel in the form of coal from the Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire coalfields, and the existing railway infrastructure meant that a string of twelve large power stations were originally constructed along its banks. At one time these sites provided a quarter of the electricity needs of the UK, giving rise to the epithet &#x27;Megawatt Valley&#x27;.

Once these early stations reached the end of their functional life, they were usually demolished, although in some cases the sites have been retained and redeveloped as gas fired power stations.

In downstream order, the power stations that have used the river as their source of cooling water are: Meaford, Rugeley, Drakelow, Willington, Castle Donington, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Wilford, Staythorpe, High Marnham, Cottam, West Burton and Keadby.

There is one hydroelectric power station on the river, Beeston Hydro at Beeston Weir.

==Recreation on the Trent==
Along with other major rivers in the Midlands, the Trent is widely used for recreational activities, both on the water and along its riverbanks. The National Watersports Centre at Holme Pierrepont, near Nottingham combines facilities for many of these sports, including rowing, sailing and whitewater canoeing.

The Trent Valley Way created in 1998 as a long-distance footpath, enables walkers to enjoy the combined attractions of ‘the river’s rich natural heritage and its history as an inland navigation’. Extended in 2012, the route now runs from Trent Lock in the south through to Alkborough where the river meets the Humber. It combines riverside and towpath sections, with other paths to villages and places of interest in the wider valley.

Historically swimming in the river was popular, in 1770 at Nottingham there were two bathing areas on opposite banks at Trent Bridge which were improved in 1857 with changing sheds and an assistant. Similar facilities were present in 1870 on the water meadows at Burton-on-Trent, which also had its own swimming club. Open water swimming still takes place at locations including Colwick Park Lake adjacent to the river, with its own voluntary lifeguards. The first person to swim the entire swimmable length of the Trent was Tom Milner, who swam over nine days in July 2015.

Rowing clubs have existed at Burton, Newark and Nottingham since the mid-1800s, with various regattas taking place between them, both on the river and on the rowing course at the national watersports centre.

Both whitewater and flat water canoeing is possible on the Trent, with published guides and touring routes being listed for the river. There is a canoe slalom course at Stone, a purpose built artificial course at Holme Pierrepont, and various weirs including those at Newark and Sawley are all used for whitewater paddling. Various canoe and kayak clubs paddle on the river including those at Stone, Burton, and Nottingham.


Established in 1886 the Trent valley sailing club is one of two clubs that use the river for dingy sailing, regattas, and events. There are also a number of clubs that sail on the open water that has been created as a result of flooded gravel workings which include Hoveringham, Girton, and Attenborough.

Organised trips on cruise boats have long been a feature of the Trent, at one time steam launches took passengers from Trent Bridge to Colwick Park, similar trips run today but in reverse, starting from Colwick and passing through Nottingham they use boats known as the Trent Princess and Trent Lady. Others trips run from Newark castle, and two converted barges; the Newark Crusader and Nottingham Crusader, provide river cruises for disabled people via the St John Ambulance Waterwing scheme.
==Tributaries==
Although Spenser endowed &#x27;The beauteous Trent&#x27; with &#x27;thirty different streams&#x27; the river is joined by more than twice that number of different tributaries, of which the largest in terms of flow is the Tame which drains most of the West Midlands, including Birmingham and the Black Country. The second and third largest are the Derwent and the Dove respectively; together these two rivers drain the majority of Derbyshire and Staffordshire, including the upland areas of the Peak District.

The River Soar which drains the majority of the county of Leicestershire, could also be considered as the second largest tributary, as it has a larger catchment area than the Dove or Derwent, but its discharge is significantly less than the Derwent, and lower than the Dove.

In terms of rainfall the Derwent receives the highest annual average rainfall, whereas the Devon, which has the lowest average rainfall is the driest catchment of those tabulated.

<doc id="223539" wikidata="Q2584290" url="?curid=223539" title="One Froggy Evening">
<text>One Froggy Evening is a 1955 American Technicolor animated musical short film written by Michael Maltese and directed by Chuck Jones, with musical direction by Milt Franklyn. The short, partly inspired by a 1944 Cary Grant film entitled &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; involving a dancing caterpillar in a small box, marks the debut of Michigan J. Frog: an anthropomorphic frog with a talent for singing and dancing that he demonstrates for no one except whoever possesses the box wherein he resides. This popular short contained a wide variety of musical entertainment, with songs ranging from &quot;Hello! Ma Baby&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;, two Tin Pan Alley classics, to &quot;Largo al Factotum&quot;, Figaro&#x27;s aria from the opera &quot;Il Barbiere di Siviglia&quot; (&quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;). The short was released on December 31, 1955, as part of Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons.

In 1994, it was voted of &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot; of all time by members of the animation field. In 2003, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

The film is included in the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2&quot; DVD box set (Disc 4), along with an audio commentary, optional music-only audio track (only the instrumental, not the vocal), and a making-of documentary, &quot;It Hopped One Night: A Look at &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot;&quot;. It was also featured on the VHS release of &quot;Little Giants&quot;.

== Plot ==
A mid-1950s construction worker involved in the demolition of the &quot;J. C. Wilber Building&quot; pries off the top of the cornerstone and finds a metal box within. The unnamed man opens the box and finds, along with a commemorative document dated April 16, 1892, a live frog inside, who dons a top hat and cane. After the frog suddenly performs a musical number on the spot, the man sees an opportunity to cash in on the frog&#x27;s anthropomorphic talents and sneaks away from the site with the frog in the box under his arm.

Every attempt the man makes to exploit the frog fails: the frog performs exclusively for his owner, and instantly devolves into an ordinary frog the second anyone else sees him. Remaining unaware of this reality, the man takes the frog to a talent agent. After getting kicked out over the frog&#x27;s apparent inability to act, he uses his life savings to rent an abandoned theater so he can showcase the frog on his own. The frog performs atop a high wire behind the closed curtain, while the man struggles to get an audience and succeeds with the promise of &quot;Free Beer&quot;. As the frog winds down the song, the man breaks the cord of the curtain he is trying to open. By the time the man reaches and pulls what remains of the cord, fully revealing the frog to the crowd, the frog has again reverted to his ordinary state. The angry crowd pelts the man with rotten vegetables.

Following these failures, the man is now homeless and living on a park bench; there, the frog still performs only for him. When a policeman overhears the singing in the middle of the night, he approaches the man, who points to the frog as the singer. When the frog again presents himself as ordinary, the policeman arrests the man, ostensibly for vagrancy but also as insane. The man is committed to a &quot;Psychopathic&quot; Hospital along with the frog, who continues serenading the hapless patient. Following his release, the now haggard and destitute man — still carrying the box with the frog inside — notices the construction site where he originally found the box. He joyously dumps it into the new cornerstone for the future &quot;Tregoweth Brown Building&quot; and runs away, finally rid of what has become his burden.

100 years later, in 2056, the Brown Building is being disintegrated by futuristic demolition workers. The box with the frog is discovered again, this time by one of the 21st-century crew members. After envisioning a cash bonanza of his own, the worker absconds with the frog in the box, thus beginning the cycle anew.

== Production notes ==
The cartoon has no spoken dialogue or vocals except by the frog. The frog&#x27;s vocals are provided by singer and bandleader Bill Roberts. The frog had no name when the cartoon was made, but Chuck Jones later named him Michigan J. Frog after the song &quot;The Michigan Rag&quot;, which was written for the cartoon. Jones and his animators studied real-life frogs to achieve the successful transition from an ordinary frog to a high-stepping entertainer. The character became the mascot of The WB television network in the 1990s. In a clip shown in the DVD specials for the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot;, Jones states that he started calling the character &quot;Michigan Frog&quot; in the 1970s. During an interview with writer Jay Cocks, Jones decided to adopt &quot;J&quot; as the Frog&#x27;s middle initial, after the interviewer&#x27;s name.

== Sequel ==
In 1995, Chuck Jones reprised Michigan J. Frog in a cartoon titled Another Froggy Evening, with Jeff McCarthy providing the frog&#x27;s voice. In &quot;Another Froggy Evening&quot;, Michigan is shown to have always existed. Men from the Stone Age (during the erection of Stonehenge), Roman Empire, and American Revolutionary War, all of whom resemble the man from the original short, fail to profit off the singing frog, who still performs early 20th-century-style showtunes regardless of the time period. In some shots, the frog displays a degree of anthropomorphism, but not musical talent, in front of others by willingly hiding himself in his box. Finally, just as Michigan is about to be eaten by a starving Robinson Crusoe on a small, deserted island, he is abducted by Marvin the Martian, who discovers the frog understands the Martian language. The frog invites Marvin to hear him sing, and they perform a duet as the flying saucer zooms away.

The background crowd in the Roman Empire includes caricatures of Jones, animated by Warren O&#x27;Neill, and Siskel and Ebert, animated by Mort Drucker.

== Inspirations ==
The premise of &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; has some similarity to that of the 1944 Columbia Pictures film &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; starring Cary Grant in which a dancing caterpillar is kept in a shoebox. It was common for Warner Bros. to parody scenes from well-known live action films for its &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; productions. &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, in turn, was based on &quot;My Client Curley&quot;, a 1940 radio play adapted by Norman Corwin from a magazine story by Lucille Fletcher. Ol&#x27; Rip, a horned toad &quot;discovered&quot; in an 1897 time capsule inside the cornerstone of the Eastland County, Texas courthouse in 1928, is also said to have inspired the premise.

Some of the Frog&#x27;s physical movements are evocative of ragtime-era greats such as Bert Williams, who was known for sporting a top hat and cane, and performing the type of flamboyant, high-kick cakewalk dance steps demonstrated by the frog in &quot;Hello! Ma Baby&quot;. Williams was also a prominent figure in The Frogs club.

== Reception ==
Film critic Jay Cocks said that the short &quot;comes as close as any cartoon ever has to perfection&quot; in a 1973 &quot;Time&quot; profile of Chuck Jones. In the 2000 documentary film &quot;Chuck Jones: Extremes &amp; Inbetweens – A Life in Animation&quot;, filmmaker Steven Spielberg called the short &quot;the Citizen Kane of the animated short&quot;.

In 1994, it was voted of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.

== Songs featured ==
About half of the songs performed by the frog were written after he was presumably sealed into the cornerstone, dated 1892.

<text>Whitby is a town in Durham Region in Ontario, Canada. Whitby is located in Southern Ontario east of Ajax and west of Oshawa, on the north shore of Lake Ontario and is home to the headquarters of Durham Region. It had a population of 138,501 at the 2021 census. It is approximately east of Toronto, and it is known as a commuter suburb in the Durham Region, a part of the Greater Toronto Area. While the southern portion of Whitby is predominantly urban and an economic hub, the northern part of the municipality is more rural and includes the communities of Ashburn, Brooklin, Myrtle, Myrtle Station, and Macedonian Village.

==History==
Whitby Township (now the Town of Whitby) was named after the seaport town of Whitby, Yorkshire, England.

When the township was originally surveyed in 1792, the surveyor, from the northern part of England, named the townships east of Toronto after towns in the historic North Riding of Yorkshire: York, Scarborough, Pickering, Whitby and Darlington. The original name of &quot;Whitby&quot; is Danish, dating from about 867 AD when the Danes invaded Britain. It is a contraction of &quot;Whitteby&quot;, meaning &quot;White Village&quot;. The allusion may be to the white lighthouse on the pier at Whitby, Yorkshire, and also at Whitby, Ontario. Although settlement dates back to 1800, it was not until 1836 that a downtown business centre was established by Whitby&#x27;s founder Peter Perry.

Whitby&#x27;s chief asset was its fine natural harbour on Lake Ontario, from which grain from the farmland to the north was first shipped in 1833. In the 1840s, a road was built from Whitby Harbour to Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay, to bring trade and settlement through the harbour to and from the rich hinterland to the north. The Town of Whitby was chosen as the seat of government for the newly formed County of Ontario in 1852, and incorporated in 1855. The remainder of Whitby Township remained a separate municipality, although the eastern half surrounding Oshawa was incorporated as the new Township of East Whitby in 1857. In the 1870s, a railway, the &quot;Port Whitby and Port Perry Railway&quot;, was constructed from Whitby harbour to Port Perry, and later extended to Lindsay as the &quot;Whitby, Port Perry and Lindsay Railway&quot;.

Whitby is also the site of Trafalgar Castle School, a private girls&#x27; school founded in 1874. The building, constructed as an Elizabethan-style castle in 1859–62 as a private residence for the Sheriff of Ontario County, is a significant architectural landmark and Whitby&#x27;s only provincial historic site marked with a plaque. The school celebrated its 125th anniversary in 1999.

During the Second World War, Whitby was the location of Camp X, a secret spy training facility established by Sir William Stephenson, the &quot;Man Called Intrepid&quot;. Although the buildings have since been demolished, a monument was unveiled on the site of Camp X in 1984 by Ontario&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor John Black Aird. Following the war, Soviet dissenter Igor Gouzenko was taken to the facility with his wife to live in secretive protective custody after fleeing Ottawa, Ontario.

==Amalgamation==
In 1968, the Town of Whitby and Township of Whitby amalgamated to form the current municipality. Planning for the construction of a town hall intended to centralize municipal staff working in satellite offices began in 1970 under mayor Des Newman. Construction began on the Raymond Moriyama designed building in 1975; it was opened by Mayor Jim Gartshore on January 8, 1977.

Municipal boundaries were not changed during the 1974 formation of the Regional Municipality of Durham (or Durham Region as locals call it), and remain to this day. Today, Whitby is the seat of government in Durham Region.

==Emergency services==
Whitby is policed by the Durham Regional Police&#x27;s Central West Division. There is also a detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police located in Town, mainly to patrol area provincial highways within Durham Region. Whitby Fire &amp; Emergency Services provides firefighting services from five fire stations and ambulance/emergency medical services are provided by Durham Region EMS at the Whitby Paramedic Station (also as EMS Headquarters).

==Economy==
Many residents commute to work in other Greater Toronto Area communities. Whitby itself is home to a steel mill operated by Gerdau Ameristeel, a retail support centre operated by Sobeys, and a major Liquor Control Board of Ontario warehouse. Other companies present in Whitby include pharmaceutical manufacturer Patheon, Lear Corporation, Automodular Assemblies, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, and several others.

==Education==
Public education in Whitby is provided via the Durham District School Board, which also has its headquarters in Whitby. There are twenty-four elementary schools and five secondary schools: Anderson Collegiate Vocational Institute, Brooklin High School, Donald A Wilson Secondary School, Henry Street High School and Sinclair Secondary School.

The Durham Catholic District School Board oversees public Catholic education in Durham Region. There are twelve Catholic elementary schools and two secondary schools- Father Leo J. Austin Catholic Secondary School and All Saints Catholic Secondary School.

Full French-language education is provided by the Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir. There is one elementary school in Whitby, École élémentaire catholique Jean-Paul II (JK-grade 6), as well as a high school, École secondaire catholique St-Charles Garnier (grades 7-12) which services all of Durham Region.

As noted above, Whitby is home to Trafalgar Castle School, an independent school for women that offers grades 4 through 12 in a university preparatory programme. Built in 1859 by the Sheriff of Ontario County, Nelson Gilbert &quot;Iron&quot; Reynolds, Trafalgar Castle remains a unique Canadian treasure. The school opened its doors in 1874 and was called &quot;Ontario Ladies&#x27; College&quot; until 1979 when the name was changed to &quot;Trafalgar Castle School&quot;.

There are also a number of Montessori schools offering programmes for early elementary grades.

Whitby is also the site of the Skills Training Centre of Durham College. The main campus of the college is located in Oshawa, as is Ontario Tech University. Canada Christian College is located in Whitby as well.

==Healthcare==
Although Whitby is one of the 100 largest cities/towns in Canada, it lacks a full-service hospital. The town was served by the Whitby General Hospital until 1998, when Durham hospitals were amalgamated by the Lakeridge Health Corporation, Under the amalgamated system, the hospital became Lakeridge Health Whitby and is a specialized health centre, with the closest full-service hospitals being Lakeridge Health Oshawa, Lakeridge Health Ajax and Pickering and Lakeridge Health Port Perry.

The Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences is located on the lakefront. It was originally called the Whitby Psychiatric Hospital, then Whitby Mental Health Centre.

==Transportation==
Ontario Highway 401 runs through the south end of Whitby, with interchanges at Brock Street and Thickson Road. Ontario Highway 407 was opened in Whitby in 2016. The toll highway passes between Brooklin and the urban portion of the town. Ontario Highway 412, connecting the 401 with the 407, also opened to traffic in the same year. The highway is a north–south route located just east of the Whitby-Ajax boundary and became toll-free on April 22, 2022.

The southern terminus of Highway 12 is also located in Whitby. It originally extended from Highway 401 northward as part of Brock Street, but this portion was downloaded to Durham Region in 1997. The southern terminus is now located just south of Brooklin at Highway 407. Finally, Highway 7 runs east–west between Brooklin and the City of Pickering. At Brooklin, the road changes to a north–south alignment and is multiplexed with Highway 12 to the northern boundary of the Town.

Four railways pass through Whitby. The Toronto-Montreal corridor main lines of the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway both pass east–west through the south end of town. A second CP line running from Toronto to Havelock also passes through the northern part of Whitby. Via Rail trains travel through Whitby, but the nearest station is in Oshawa. Finally, GO Transit provides frequent service via its Lakeshore East line, which (in Whitby) runs parallel to the CN tracks. A GO Station is located in Town.

Local transit services are provided by the region-wide Durham Region Transit. Prior to the Regional service, the Town provided its own service. GO Transit buses also connect Whitby with Durham Region (including Port Perry and Beaverton to the north) and areas further afield.

Whitby Harbour, an important factor in the development of the Town, is now home to a 420-berth recreational marina.

The closest international airport is Toronto Pearson International Airport, located to the west in Mississauga.

==Media==
Until publication ceased on September 15, 2023, Whitby was served by the &quot;Whitby This Week&quot; newspaper, part of the Metroland Media Group. Several other papers have been published in the town over the years, including the Whitby Free Press, which ran from 1971 to 1996. Other GTA media outlets serve the area, but since September 2023 there have been no newspapers serving Whitby.

In North Whitby, the &quot;Brooklin Town Crier&quot; serves approximately 8,000 residents every two weeks. The &quot;Brooklin Town Crier&quot; was established in 2000 by Rhonda Mulcahy, who has since been elected Regional Councillor for Whitby. The paper consists primarily of resident contributions, with occasion updates on local and regional politics from Mulcahy.

This team featured long-time president of the Boston Bruins, Harry Sinden and former mayor of Whitby, Bob Attersley. The Dunlops were revived in 2004 as part of the Eastern Ontario Senior Hockey League.

The Whitby Yacht Club, which offers racing, cruising, social, and sail training programs on Whitby Harbour overlooking the Lake Ontario, was founded in 1966.

Lacrosse is also a prominent sport in Whitby. The Brooklin Redmen Senior A lacrosse club is one of the most successful in Canadian sporting history, while the Junior A Whitby Warriors have been awarded the Minto Cup four times since 1984.

Whitby is also home to the &quot;Iroquois Park Sports Centre&quot;, one of the largest minor sports centres in North America. The facility includes six icepads, a swimming pool named for local Olympian Anne Ottenbrite, six tennis courts, five ball diamonds, three batting cages, a skatepark, a soccer pitch, &quot;The Sports Garden Cafe&quot; restaurant and the Whitby Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Pickering (2021 population 99,186) is a city located in Southern Ontario, Canada, immediately east of Toronto in Durham Region.

Beginning in the 1770s, the area was settled by primarily British colonists. An increase in population occurred after the American Revolutionary War, when the Crown resettled Loyalists and encouraged new immigration. Many of the smaller rural communities have been preserved and function as provincially significant historic sites and museums. The city also includes the development of Durham Live, a multi-billion-dollar casino complex.

==History==
===Early period===
The present-day Pickering was Aboriginal territory for thousands of years. The Wyandot (called the Huron by Europeans), who spoke an Iroquoian language, were the historical people living here in the 15th century. Archeological remains of a large village have been found here, known as the Draper Site. Later, the Wyandot moved northwest to Georgian Bay, where they established their historic homeland. There they encountered French explorers in the early 17th century, followed by missionaries and fur traders.

The first recorded history of this area was made in 1669, when the French Jesuit missionary François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon noted reaching what he called the Seneca (more likely the Onondaga) village of Gandatsetiagon, on the shores of Frenchman&#x27;s Bay (for whom it would be named). The Onondaga (and the Seneca) were among the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Onondaga (and other Iroquois) generally occupied territory to the south and west of Lakes Ontario and Erie in present-day New York that extended into Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley, where they maintained hunting grounds. (The Seneca were located farther west, near Seneca Lake, among the Finger Lakes. Fenelon wintered at the village and started missionary work with this people.)

===Township of Pickering===

The British took over Canada in 1763 following defeat of the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War, known in Colonial America as the French and Indian War. They likely completed survey of the township about 1776. British colonial settlers were steadily migrating into the area from eastern areas of Canada. There is some controversy over the identity of the earliest European settler in the area. One of the candidates is Mike Duffin, who settled in what later became the Pickering Village (now in Ajax), possibly in the 1770s. The other candidate is Benjamin Wilson of Vermont, who probably lived in Pickering for sometime, before moving to Whitby in 1794.

In the 1780s, the present-day Pickering area was a part of the Nassau District of the Province of Quebec. In 1791, Augustus Jones undertook a survey of the area, establishing the baseline and some of the concessions. The same year, the District was transferred to the newly created province of Upper Canada. In 1792, the district was renamed Home District, and Pickering was established as a township.

The township was originally called &quot;Edinburgh&quot; but in 1792 was renamed after Pickering, North Yorkshire. Pickering Village, now part of Ajax, emerged as the major population and commercial centre of the Pickering Township in the early 19th century. The conversion of a local trail into the Kingston Road in 1799 contributed greatly to the increased settlement in the area. In 1807, Quakers led by Timothy Rogers settled in the area, and by 1809, the population of Pickering Township consisted of 180 people, most of whom lived along the Duffins Creek. In 1811, the Pickering Township became a separate municipality. Several sawmills, gristmills, taverns, and other businesses operated in the area. During the War of 1812, the maintenance of the Kingston Road improved because of the increased military traffic and further contributed to the development of the area.

In the 19th century, several other small communities developed in the Duffins Creek watershed, within the Pickering Township. These included Whitevale, Brougham, Green River, Claremont, Altona, Greenwood, and Balsam. A few communities also developed in the smaller Carruthers Creek watershed, including Audley (now part of Ajax), Kinsale, and Salem. In 1849, the village of Dunbarton was established along the Dunbarton Creek. The Grand Trunk Railway reached the Township in 1856.

Pickering was represented in the Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837. One of its leaders, Peter Matthews, had been one of the most prominent members of the community. In 1851, the Pickering Township was severed from the York County, and became a part of the newly established Ontario County.

In the later decades of the 19th century, a fall in the demand for wheat led to economic decline in the primarily-agricultural township. The township lost over 40% of its population in the second half of the 19th century, and the decline continued in the first half of the 20th century.

In the first half of the 20th century, two new communities emerged in the Pickering Township: the cottage community of Pickering Beach and the self-contained community around the federal government-owned Defence Industries Limited Pickering Works munitions plant. Both areas are now part of Ajax. After the World War II, urbanization began in the southern part of Pickering, and later spread to other parts of the Township.

===City of Pickering===
On 1 January 1974, the Ontario County was dissolved, and the area became part of the Regional Municipality of Durham. The southeastern portion of the Pickering Township, including the Pickering Village and Pickering High School, became part of the independent town of Ajax. The rest of the township became the Town of Pickering, which in 2000, became the City of Pickering.

In the last quarter of the 20th century, much of the government-owned land in northern Pickering sat idle because of uncertainty over the proposed Pickering Airport. That included the land expropriated by the federal government for the airport and the adjacent land expropriated by the provincial government for the proposed Seaton community that would benefit from the airport.

The development of Seaton picked up pace in the 21st century, but as of 2022, only 1,549 of the 20,989 planned units had been built. The city also considered the development of a new community called Veraine, to be built in northeastern Pickering. The city also saw a rise in the number of high-rise condos.

==Cityscape==
==Geography==
The city covers an area of 231 square kilometres (89 sq mi) with an elevation of 89 metres (292 ft).

Toronto, Markham, and Rouge Park border Pickering on the west; Ajax and Whitby border Pickering on the east; Uxbridge is to the north; and Lake Ontario forms Pickering&#x27;s southern boundary.

===Communities===
The southern part of the city is mainly suburban, with industrial areas restricted to the area around Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. Most of the suburban areas were built as subdivisions after World War II, starting in the area around Frenchman&#x27;s Bay. Prior to the war, the few suburban areas in the township were the communities of Dunbarton, Fairport Beach, Liverpool Market, and Rouge Hill. Squires Beach, located by the lake shore in the southeast part of the city, is now a ghost town as the area was cleared from 1966 to make way for the construction of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. The only home standing in Squires Beach was built by Timothy Rogers in 1842 and relocated to Montgomery Park Road. Squires Beach Road is now cut off from the lake by a waste water treatment plant.

The northern part of the municipality is mainly rural, primarily used for agricultural purposes. However, a number of residential developments are found in this area, and the locally controversial Seaton area also falls within this part of the city. The primary rural communities in Pickering are Claremont, Brougham, and Whitevale; a number of smaller communities exist throughout northern Pickering, such as Greenwood. John Diefenbaker, a Prime Minister of Canada, lived in Greenwood for a number of years.

The abandoned ghost town of Altona is located there. Cherrywood, another hamlet in Pickering, is one of the few areas that are protected within the Greenbelt.

The communities of Kinsale in the northeast and Green River on the York-Durham town line are other small communities in Pickering, with a population each of between 50 and 100 people. Most of these communities were founded in the 1700s and 1800s and have churches and historic estates that have been restored through government funding. Dixie is a small rural community situated in rural Pickering, with more contemporary buildings.

The film industry has been very active in communities such as Whitevale, since the 1980s, due to the quality of the historical buildings and untouched nature of the landscape. The television shows &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2013–2015) &quot;Suits&quot; (2011–2019), and &quot;American Gods&quot; (2017) have filmed extensively in Whitevale and in other locations in Pickering.

Nautical Village is located at Frenchman&#x27;s Bay and features entertainment, a playground, a boardwalk, restaurants, shops and an art gallery.

==Economy==

Pickering is home to the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, an eight-reactor facility with a capacity of 4,120 megawatts. The first station, Pickering A, opened with four reactors in 1971. Ontario Power Generation, the plants&#x27; operator, is the largest single employer in the city. In 2001, the wind-powered OPG 7 Commemorative Turbine was opened on the generating station site. The nuclear power plant is expected to start decommissioning in 2024.

A number of manufacturers are also located in the city. Major employers include Yorkville Sound (audio equipment), the Canadian headquarters of Purdue Pharma (pharmaceuticals and health &amp; beauty products), Hubbell Canada (electrical equipment), PSB Speakers – Lenbrook (stereo equipment) and Eco-Tec Inc. (industrial water purification and chemical recovery systems).

Pickering is a founding member of the Durham Strategic Energy Alliance or DSEA. The nucleus of the DSEA is primarily Pickering businesses, such as Ontario Power Generation, Veridian, Siemens/Trench, Tetra Tech WEI, AECL, Intellimeter, Areva and Eco-Tec Inc.

Other notable organizations with headquarters in Pickering include: Municipal Property Assessment Corporation. MPAC performs value assessment for property tax purposes for all municipalities in Ontario. In 2012 Search Engine People, Canada&#x27;s largest Internet-marketing company, moved to Pickering&#x27;s downtown. The International Institute of Business Analysis is also headquartered in Pickering.

In 2013, the Region of Durham released its Business Count (Employment Survey), which indicated that Pickering has the most jobs amongst Durham Region municipalities, with 29,000+ positions. This figure represents a near 1/3 ratio of jobs to residents.

With the implementation of Seaton and downtown intensification, the Province of Ontario&#x27;s planning anticipates the creation of 40,000 new jobs for Pickering over the next two decades.

Pickering has planned a downtown intensification program, which includes new condominium developments around the Pickering GO station and Pickering Town Centre. Pickering Town Centre is a two-story mall located in Pickering. An enclosed pedestrian bridge constructed over the 14 lanes of highway 401 was a recent development that has contributed to Pickering&#x27;s push for more density downtown. The project Durham Live in south Pickering received approval for construction in 2017. It will include a water park, film studio, five star hotel, performing arts theater and possibly a casino.

==Government==

The city council consists of a mayor, three regional councillors, and three city councillors. The mayor and regional councillors sit on the council and also represent the city at Durham Regional Council. The city councillors sit on city council only. Pickering is divided into three wards of roughly equal population, with one city councillor and one regional councillor elected to represent each ward, in what are known as single-member districts.

The current mayor, Kevin Ashe, has held the mayoralty since 2022.

==Transportation==

Transit service began in Pickering with the Bay Shores dial-a-bus, which began in 1970–1973. In 2001 Pickering Transit merged with former Ajax Transit to form the Ajax-Pickering Transit Authority (APTA). In 2006, the regional transit system Durham Region Transit took over operations in the Durham Regional Municipality.

The Pickering GO station offers public rail transit on an east–west axis. In 2012, Pickering&#x27;s landmark bridge opened – connecting the Pickering GO station to the city&#x27;s downtown core.

Durham Regional Roads serve the city, north and south. Highway 401 runs near the south end of Pickering and Highway 407 ETR runs through the mid-north of the city.

Pickering Airport was a planned second major airport for the Greater Toronto Area. Lands were expropriated in north Pickering in 1972 but the plan was stopped. As of 2021, no firm plans for the airport exist.

==Infrastructure==
===Emergency services===
Police services in Pickering are provided by the Durham Regional Police from a division office located in the eastern section of the city. Officers from this location also patrol Ajax. Pickering Fire Services operates from four stations with a force of all full-time firefighters. Claremont Fire Hall is now fully staffed by full-time firefighters 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ambulance/emergency medical services are provided by Durham Region.

==Education==
Pickering is served by the Durham District School Board, the Durham Catholic District School Board, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde and the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud. As of early 2007, the public board operates 17 elementary schools and two secondary schools, Dunbarton High School and Pine Ridge Secondary School (Pickering High School was previously located in Pickering, but was transferred to Ajax when the city boundaries were changed). The Catholic board runs eight elementary schools and one secondary school, Saint Mary Catholic Secondary School. The French public school board operates École Ronald-Marion, which serves both elementary and secondary students.

Blaisdale Montessori School, a private school chain, has several locations throughout Pickering serving children from preschool age to grade 8. There is also a private elementary and junior high school there called Montessori Learning Centre. Also serving the Durham Region is Durham Secondary Academy and Middle School, an inspected private high school and middle school for grades 5 to 12.

In September 2012, the Durham College/Centennial College Joint Learning Site opened at the north terminus of the pedestrian bridge. The Joint Learning Site offers primarily graduate certificate programs, with a number of complementary courses and classes. At the time of its opening, it was the only public post-secondary institution in the Province of Ontario with a direct connection to public transit.

<doc id="223578" wikidata="Q776930" url="?curid=223578" title="Peterborough, Ontario">
<text>Peterborough ( ) is a city on the Otonabee River in Ontario, Canada, about 125 kilometres (78 miles) northeast of Toronto. According to the 2021 Census, the population of the City of Peterborough was 83,651. The population of the Peterborough Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), which includes the surrounding Townships of Selwyn, Cavan Monaghan, Otonabee-South Monaghan, and Douro-Dummer, was 128,624 in 2021. In 2021, Peterborough ranked 32nd among the country&#x27;s 41 census metropolitan areas according to the CMA in Canada. The current mayor of Peterborough is Jeff Leal.

Peterborough is known as the gateway to the Kawarthas, &quot;cottage country&quot;, a large recreational region of the province. It is named in honour of Peter Robinson, an early Canadian politician who oversaw the first major immigration to the area. The city is the seat of Peterborough County, though it is politically independent from the county.

Peterborough&#x27;s nickname in the distant past was &quot;The Electric City&quot; as it was the first town in Canada to use electric streetlights. It also underscores the historical and present-day importance of technology and manufacturing as an economic base of the city, which has operations from large multi-national companies such as Siemens, Rolls-Royce Limited, General Electric, and more local businesses such as Merit Precision Ltd., Dynacast and Bryston. Electricity was one of the reasons Quaker Oats moved to the city, and as part of PepsiCo remains a major fixture in the downtown area. However, over the years the number of major manufacturing plants has declined, and General Electric closed its last remaining facility in 2018. As a result, employment has been shifting toward the service industries and tourism is now the leading industry in the area.

==History==
In 1615, Samuel de Champlain travelled through the area, coming down from Lake Chemong and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the Otonabee River and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of Bridgenorth, just north of Peterborough.

===19th century===
In 1818, Adam Scott settled on the west shore of the Otonabee River. The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott&#x27;s Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough&#x27;s Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name &quot;Nogojiwanong&quot; which means &quot;the place at the end of the rapids&quot;.
The year 1825 marked the arrival of Irish immigrants from the City of Cork to Scott&#x27;s Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to Upper Canada.

Peter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott&#x27;s Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson&#x27;s settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age, in good health, and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.

Robinson was urged by landlords to remove the &quot;pauper and undesirables&quot;. He resisted and stated that he had &quot;no wish&quot; to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. But as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood &#x27;people of a good sort&#x27; he called them, &#x27;bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write&#x27;&quot;.

Thomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2,024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.

In 1845, Sandford Fleming, inventor of Standard Time and designer of Canada&#x27;s first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough&#x27;s first resident doctors.

By 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.
Peterborough was incorporated as a town in 1850, with a population of 2,191.

Beginning in the late 1850s, a substantial canoe building industry grew up in and around Peterborough. The Peterborough Canoe Company was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boatbuilding industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.

Peterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at Niagara Falls). Companies like Edison General Electric Company (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become Quaker Oats, and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.

===20th century===

The first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the Peterborough Lift Lock on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize Richard Rogers, conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on Little Lake and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.

On July 1, 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city with a population of about 14,300. The city&#x27;s flag and coat of arms were adopted later, in 1951.

In the 1970s, the Government of Ontario helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an Eaton&#x27;s store until the collapse of the Eaton&#x27;s chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the Ministry of Natural Resources to 300 Water Street, kitty-corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, the Peterborough Regional Health Centre opened.

==Geography==
Peterborough is situated in Central Ontario within the Kawartha Lakes region. Peterborough lies in the St. Lawrence Lowlands ecoregion, just south of the Canadian Shield and approximately north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the Otonabee River, approximately halfway between the river&#x27;s source (Katchewanooka Lake) and its mouth (Rice Lake). The city completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the Trent Canal runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.

===Topography===

Peterborough&#x27;s topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding Wisconsian glaciers 10,000–15,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the city sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough—part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now Lake Huron) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now Lake Ontario). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough Drumlin field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the north and west ends of the city rises to above sea level, with Tower Hill, at above sea level, being the highest point. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in east city, forms the physical obstacle that the Trent-Severn Waterway ascends by way of the Peterborough Lift Lock. The Oak Ridges Moraine is located approximately south of the city.

===Climate===

Peterborough has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough&#x27;s Hardiness zone is 5b. Peterborough&#x27;s climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the city to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the south end and areas south of the city, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the north and west ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the city and county.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was on July 11, 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on December 21, 1871.

====Significant weather events====

In 2004, Peterborough experienced a flood which caused much damage to the city and surrounding areas. On July 15, 2004, the sewage treatment plant recorded of water as opposed to the average. The city recorded of debris added to landfills due to the amount of damage caused by excessive rain and wind.

In May 2022, the City of Peterborough was involved in the May 2022 Canadian derecho. This left citizens without power for several days and an estimated cost of cleanup of $3.3 million.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Peterborough had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Peterborough CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Religion ===
50.9% of Peterborough residents were Christian, down from 67.3% in 2011. 20.6% were Catholic, 19.2% were Protestant, and 6.4% were Christian n.o.s. All other Christian denominations and Christian-related traditions accounted for 4.7% of the population. 43.7% of residents were non-religious or secular, up from 29.9% in 2011. Followers of other religions made up 5.5% of residents, up from 2.7% in 2011. The largest non-Christian religions were Islam (1.5%), Hinduism (1.4%) and Buddhism (0.5%).

=== Ethnicity ===
As of 2021, 85.7% of Peterborough residents were white/European, 9.4% were visible minorities and 5.0% were Indigenous. The largest visible minority groups were South Asian (3.1%), Black (1.4%), and Chinese (1.0%).


=== Language ===
90.2% of the population spoke English as their mother tongue. Other common first languages were French (1.0%), Chinese languages (0.6%), and Arabic (0.5%).

== Economy ==
Service industries are the primary employers. Other leading industries include manufacturing, food processing, automotive supplies, electronics, aerospace and life sciences/biotechnology. Quaker Oats employs 700. The city is a bedroom community for workers commuting to Oshawa and East Toronto via Hwy 115. In 2017, home prices were more affordable than in Durham Region.

The Peterborough Regional Health Centre is the largest employer, with about 2,500 employees and 500 volunteers in 2023. School boards, local government, Trent University and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources are other large employers.

General Electric operated in Peterborough from 1892 to 2018, and employed about 6,000 people at its peak. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of the early 1990s led to shifts in trading patterns for many Canadian companies. Other innovations like just-in-time delivery and pressure to produce ever cheaper goods impacted some of the large multi-nationals in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the 2000s, the city faced high unemployment, and its unemployment rate often led the country for census metropolitan areas in Canada. By December 2017, the rate was roughly on par with the national average at under 5%.

An analysis in 2017 said: &quot;A moderate but improving growth environment is foreseen for the region and the Peterborough CMA in 2017 and 2018. The region’s shift to service-producing industries will continue as in other regions in Ontario and a growing portion of service industries will become export-oriented&quot;.

In 2018, mayor Daryl Bennett said there has been a shift toward employment in smaller manufacturing plants and service industries, leading to a moderate level of unemployment, and that the shift away from manufacturing had started before the NAFTA free trade agreements.

In 2018, the city had plans for a $24-million Canadian Canoe Museum, a new casino, a new library, the VentureNorth building in downtown, and development of lands at Trent University.

Peterborough is a shopping destination for the region, with three shopping centres: Peterborough Square, Portage Place, and Lansdowne Place. Walmart, Costco, Sobey&#x27;s and Real Canadian Superstore have large operations in Peterborough, drawing customers from the surrounding area. Sears, in Landsdowne Place, closed in 2018 due to bankruptcy.

==Attractions==
Peterborough and the Kawarthas offer several attractions. The region is host to an array of museums, cultural exhibitions, indoor and outdoor galleries and theatres, Aboriginal heritage attractions and historical sites, as well as an arts community.

While many buildings in Peterborough that would have served as examples of the city&#x27;s heritage and architectural style have been lost over the years due to renovations and modernization, some examples such as the YMCA building do still stand today as designated architectural landmarks.

The Peterborough Museum &amp; Archives is home to a diverse collection of artifacts. It was established in 1897 and moved to its present site on Armour Hill in 1967. The Archives collection includes items from Catharine Parr Traill, the original Peter Robinson papers, the Park Studio Fonds and the Balsillie collection of Roy Studio Images, over 300,000 film and glass plate negatives dating back to 1896.

Walter Seymour Allward designed a municipal cenotaph, the Peterborough Memorial (1929), &quot;Valour Defeating Barbarism.&quot;

The Trent–Severn Waterway passes through Peterborough and includes the Peterborough Lift Lock, the world&#x27;s largest hydraulic lift lock, which opened in 1904. It was for many years the world&#x27;s highest hydraulic lift lock with a rise of .

Free outdoor events and concerts are held here during the summer months, including the international Peterborough Musicfest (formerly Festival of Lights &amp; Little Lake Musicfest), Wednesday and Saturday evenings from June through August. The Art Gallery of Peterborough, opened in 1974, is situated on the shore of Little Lake beside Del Crary Park and features 1,300 pieces from around the world.

On Little Lake, there is a fountain called Centennial Fountain that runs from May to October yearly. This fountain has lights that are put on at dusk and is considered a local and tourist attraction.

Peterborough offers a sightseeing option called Liftlock and River Boat Cruise. This cruise boat takes passengers through the Peterborough Liftlock while broadcasting various facts about the city&#x27;s sights and history. The cruise operates daily from mid-May to mid-October every year.

=== Public library ===

The Peterborough Mechanics Institute, established in 1868, housed a subscription library that allowed members who paid a fee to borrow books. Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.

Later, the Peterborough Public Library received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.

In February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections—one for children, the other for adults.

The DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made &quot;south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.&quot; Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.

The Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.

The Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked and current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film &quot;Jumper&quot;.

==Sports==

Peterborough has many sports and recreational opportunities.

Peterborough&#x27;s junior level hockey team, the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League, were established in 1956 and have become the longest continuously operating team in the league. They have participated in the Memorial Cup tournament nine times in their history and won it once. The Petes have produced a record number of National Hockey League (NHL) players such as Eric Staal, Jordan Staal, Cory Stillman, Chris Pronger, Steve Yzerman, Bob Gainey, Mike Ricci, Larry Murphy, Tie Domi, Mickey Redmond, Wayne Gretzky (who played three games and achieved three assists), and coaches such as Scotty Bowman, Roger Neilson, Mike Keenan, Gary Green and Dick Todd. They have also graduated 96 players who have played 100 or more games in the NHL.

The Peterborough Memorial Centre, constructed in 1956, is the home of the Peterborough Petes as well as the Peterborough Lakers and was named in honour of the many war veterans who came from the region. It is located at the east of the exhibition grounds at the corner of Lansdowne and George Streets. In 2003, the Memorial Centre was renovated adding 24 box suites, improved concessions, a licensed restaurant, new seats, boards, scoreboard and air conditioning.

Peterborough is also host to the Peterborough Liftlock U11 Hockey Tournament, formerly the Peterborough Liftlock Atom Hockey Tournament. The tournament began in 1958 as a 1-day, 8-team event. The tournament expanded in 1969 to a 2-day, 16-team event, when Jack Guerin, Lloyd Hardy, Dan Dorsett and Howie Eastman made a proposal to the League Executive. Since then, the tournament has grown substantially, hosting 87 teams across 4 days in 2023.

The city also has a girl hockey association (PGHA) known as the IceKats, the PGHA fields approximately 15 representative hockey teams and 9 house league teams. Box lacrosse is also popular in the area. Teams include the Major Series Lacrosse Peterborough Sr. A Lakers and the Peterborough Jr. Lakers, who hold a Junior A record of 12 Canadian Minto Cup championships.

Peterborough also participated in an Olympics-like competition with sister city Ann Arbor, Michigan: the Arborough Games were held annually (later biennially), rotating between the cities starting in 1983. It ended, due to a lack of volunteers, after the 2000 edition.

Peterborough is home to a rowing club with programs for learning to row, recreational rowing, as well as competitive regattas. This club is home to Trent University Rowing and hosts many secondary school teams in the area. This club was established in 1977 and is located along the shores of the Otonabee River in the north end of the city.

In 2021, Electric City FC was founded to play in the semi-professional League1 Ontario, with the potential to move up to a professional division in the future.

PYSC (The Peterborough Youth Soccer Club) offers recreational and competitive soccer for children aged 4 to 18.

==Government==

Peterborough is a single-tier municipality governed by a mayor-council system. The Mayor of Peterborough, Jeff Leal, was elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city. The Peterborough City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising the mayor and ten city councillors representing five geographical wards of the city.

Peterborough City Hall at 500 George Street North in downtown Peterborough houses the municipal government and also the central offices of Peterborough Social Services. The municipal budget for 2008 for the city is projected to be $190.9 million, an increase from 2007&#x27;s actual expenditures of $185.4 million, or 2.9%.

Prior to the city being separated from it, the city was also the seat of Peterborough County. The Peterborough County Court House is located at 470 Water Street and was built between the years of 1838 and 1840 and still holds a portion of the county&#x27;s offices.

At the provincial level, the riding is held by Dave Smith of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, who has held it since the 2018 Ontario election.

In 2014, MP Dean Del Mastro was found guilty of overspending on his 2008 election campaign. This trial and guilty verdict led to his resignation.

===Crime===
Peterborough&#x27;s crime rate in 2013 was 4,489 crimes per 100,000 people, a 3% reduction from 2012, according to Statistics Canada. That was the 19th highest crime rate out of Canada&#x27;s 34 census metropolitan areas. (Peterborough&#x27;s CMA includes the city and four surrounding townships.)

Peterborough had the sixth lowest crime severity rate in 2013 out of Canada&#x27;s 34 census metropolitan areas, according to Statistics Canada. Peterborough&#x27;s crime severity index of 54.4 is a 14% reduction compared to the 2012 rate. Only Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Barrie and Guelph had lower crime severity indexes, according to the survey. None of the census metropolitan areas had increases in crime severity in 2013. The crime severity index is calculated by Statistics Canada and takes into account both the volume and severity, based on average sentences for offenders, of police-reported crime in Canada. Nationally the CSI was down 9% in 2013 compared to 2012 and is 36% lower than 10 years ago.

In 2011, Peterborough had the highest rate of hate crimes reported of any Canadian cities. Peterborough retained this position in 2020, with nearly triple the national rate of hate crimes. In November 2015, Peterborough gained nationwide notoriety after an arson took place at the Masjid Al-Salaam mosque. The resulting community response raised over $110,000 for repairs in less than two days. The mosque has since been rebuilt and reopened.

==Infrastructure==

=== Transportation ===

==== Air ====
Peterborough Airport is located off Highway 115, just south of the city. It is primarily a recreation and business airport, offering no scheduled flights by any airlines. It has two asphalt runways, one and the other . The airport services approximately 25,000–30,000 aircraft movements per year.

==== Bridges ====
There are four road bridges that cross the Otonabee River within the city limits of Peterborough. The most northerly one is the Nassau Mills Road Bridge near Trent University. The next most northerly bridge is the Parkhill Road Bridge. The Hunter Street Bridge crosses the river just north of Little Lake, linking East City with the downtown core. The most southerly bridge is the Lansdowne Street Bridge. In addition, Highway 115 crosses the river near the southern edge of the city. There are also numerous other bridges which cross the Trent Canal (notably the crossing at the lift lock which actually passes under the canal), Jackson Creek and the other minor creeks in the city. There are also numerous other river crossings throughout the CMA, the longest of which is the James A. Gifford Causeway, which crosses Chemong Lake linking Bridgenorth with Ennismore.

==== Canals ====
Otonabee River and Trent Canal are part of the Trent–Severn Waterway, providing a link from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron. The canal runs through the very eastern portion of the city and is home to the Peterborough Lift Lock, formerly the highest hydraulic boat lift in the world. The Peterborough Marina is located on Little Lake near where Jackson Creek drains into the lake, beside Del Crary Park and just east of George Street. It contains 90 slips for docking and a host of amenities.

==== Highways ====
Peterborough is served by provincial Highway 115, a freeway that connects the city to Toronto via Highway 401 and Highway 407 East. Provincial Highway 7, part of the Trans-Canada Highway, connects to Lindsay heading west and eventually to Ottawa heading east. Other Provincial Highways important to Peterborough are Highway 7A, which junctions onto Highway 115 just southwest of the city, and Highway 28, which routes from Highway 7 just east of the city to Lakefield and on further north.

==== Public transit ====
Public transit in the city of Peterborough is run by Peterborough Transit which runs 9 regular bus routes and 3 colour-coded community bus routes throughout the city. Peterborough Transit&#x27;s central terminal is located on Simcoe Street in the city&#x27;s downtown core and includes a customer service desk where passes can be purchased and inquiries can be made during regular business hours. In July 2021, Peterborough city council opted to keep the temporary changes made to the bus routes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This included a change from a radial-based bus network to a grid-based bus network.

Other transit agencies provide service to Peterborough and popular destinations in the region, including Trent University. GO Transit established a bus service from Peterborough to Oshawa starting September 5, 2009 that provides service to Trent University. A rural transit option connecting Curve Lake and Selwyn to Trent University was launched May 3, 2021.

==== Rail ====
Peterborough is served by Canadian Pacific Railway. Via Rail provided train service from Toronto to Havelock via Peterborough from 1978 to 1990. In 2025 the federal government announced plans to reinstate passenger rail service between Toronto and Peterborough as part of a new new high-speed rail route between Toronto and Quebec City, making stops in Ottawa, Montréal and Trois-Rivières. The route is proposed to follow existing rail lines not currently used for passenger train travel.
Then-MP Dean Del Mastro lobbied for passenger rail to be brought back to the small city, and there has been government funding put aside for a Peterborough–Toronto rail link.

The Peterborough&#x27;s disused railway station is historically significant for its association with the early development of the Canadian Pacific Railway and its predecessor the Ontario and Quebec Railway.

==== Walking and cycling ====
Peterborough is home to several multi-use trails for exclusive use by pedestrians and cyclists that crisscross the city and connect to destinations like Trent University, rural farmland, and nearby towns or villages. In 2022 the city is considering adopting a cycling master plan that would add to the existing multi-use trails and add or improve bike routes in the city to increase safety, connections, and year-round maintenance to support year-round use.

The Rotary Greenway Trail is a 25 kilometre stretch of multi-use trail with benches, historic, environmental and ecological signage that travels through the city of Peterborough from Little Lake and continues past Trent University to the village of Lakefield in Selwyn Township.

The Jackson Creek Kiwanis trail is a 10 kilometre stretch of the Trans-Canada Trail that connects from Jackson Park in Peterborough to the towns of Hastings and Lindsay. This multi-use path also travels along the Otonabee River through Millennium park.

The Parkway Trail is a 4 kilometres long multi-use trail that runs between Jackson Park and Riverview Park and Zoo.

The Crawford trail is a multi-use trail that is 2 kilometres long and is being extended between Townsend street and Monaghan road.

From the west end of the city along Technology Drive, you can access a parking lot and trailhead for the 33 km Lang-Hastings Trail.

Since 2013 Peterborough&#x27;s provision of sidewalks policy has required sidewalks be constructed on both sides of any newly constructed street and be provided on both sides of any existing street. This includes a provision to add boulevards where feasible between sidewalks and the roadway to provide a planted buffer between cars and pedestrians.

===Utilities===
Peterborough&#x27;s electricity local distribution company is Hydro One as of April 2020 and was purchased from the Peterborough Utilities Group (PUG), formerly the Peterborough Utilities Commission, for $105 million. Peterborough Utilities continues to provide water to the city and its residents, as well as operate the River Park Zoo where the water filtration plant is also located. It is currently entirely owned by the City of Peterborough. There have been new infrastructure developments that started expanding outside of city water including the development and operation of electricity generation (notably the 8 MW Trent Rapids hydroelectric project [2010] and the 10 MW Lily Lake Solar Farm [2011], which capitalize on the Province of Ontario&#x27;s feed-in tariff program), telecom services, energy equipment rentals, and commercial metering services both in Peterborough and throughout the province. Natural gas for heating is provided locally by Enbridge Inc.

===Healthcare===
Peterborough is home to the Peterborough Regional Health Centre which serves Peterborough, Peterborough County, Northumberland County, the City of Kawartha Lakes, Haliburton County, and Hastings County. It is located at 1 Hospital Drive and, prior to the completion of its new facility in June 2008, also provided some services from the old St. Joseph&#x27;s site at 384 Rogers Street. The PRHC is part of the Central East Local Health Integration Network, provides 400 beds and houses one of the busiest emergency departments in Ontario. Peterborough is home to four methadone clinics and many centres for addiction treatment and counselling.

==Education==
===School boards in Peterborough===
The Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board (KPRDSB) is the public English language school board that serves the local area. Its headquarters are located at 1994 Fisher Drive, Peterborough. Over 35,000 students attend its schools and it encompasses almost 7,000 square kilometres, taking the place of the former Peterborough County Board of Education and Northumberland-Clarington Board of Education. It stretches from the north of Peterborough County south to Lake Ontario, and from Hastings County in the east to the City of Kawartha Lakes and the City of Oshawa in the west. As of 2010, the KPRDSB operates 82 elementary schools, 15 secondary schools and four adult learning centres serving both the urban area and the outlying rural communities. Of those, 16 elementary schools, five secondary schools and one adult learning centre are located within the city. The Board offers a French Immersion program where students learn French and English through elementary and secondary school; in Peterborough, five elementary schools and one high school host this program.

The Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board is the Separate English language school board for the region. It is headquartered at 1355 Lansdowne Street West, Peterborough, and presently operates 33 elementary schools and five secondary schools. Of these, nine elementary and two secondary schools operate within the city.

The Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud is the Separate French language school board for the South-Central region of Ontario, which includes Peterborough. It presently operates 41 elementary schools and eight secondary schools, of which the only school in Peterborough is the elementary school Monseigneur-Jamot.

===Post-secondary institutions===

====Trent University====

Established in 1964, Trent University is a small liberal arts- and science-oriented institution. Trent&#x27;s academic focus is on environmental, cultural and science studies. The main Symons Campus of Trent, located in the city&#x27;s far north end, is approximately , over half of which is a part of Trent&#x27;s Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wildlife nature reserve.

Trent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, Catharine Parr Traill, Otonabee, Peter Gzowski. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government.

====Fleming College====

Established in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:

Sutherland Campus is located on Brealey Drive in the city&#x27;s west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion. The new St. Joseph&#x27;s at Fleming is the first long-term care facility to be built on a college or university campus. In 2005, the Peterborough Sport &amp; Wellness Centre was constructed to accommodate the college&#x27;s athletic needs.

McRae Campus was located in a renovated textile mill located on McDonnel Street near Monaghan Road. Formerly the School of Continuing Education and Skilled Trades, the campus closed in 2014 when the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre opened on the Sutherland Campus.

The college also operates satellite campuses in nearby Lindsay, Cobourg and Haliburton.

====Kawartha Lakes Bible College====

Kawartha Lakes Bible College (KLBC) is a small evangelical Bible college affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren. The school opened in 1973, and moved to its current location in 2001.

No longer operating

====Master&#x27;s College and Seminary====

Master&#x27;s College and Seminary is a Pentecostal Christian institution of higher education that consists of an on-campus bible college, a church-based seminary, and a global distance education program. The school has partnerships with Trent University and Tyndale University College and Seminary.

==Media==
Peterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to Toronto. This is due in part to Peterborough&#x27;s central location in a valley. Peterborough is also home to a single television station, CHEX-DT, which is the local Global O&amp;O; as well as TVCogeco, a local cable television channel operated by Cogeco Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the &quot;Peterborough Examiner&quot;, which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and &quot;Peterborough This Week&quot;, which publishes every Thursday. A non-political publication called SNAP Peterborough is published monthly with sections for home, business, sporting events, etc. with a main focus on providing friendly and photographic news.

==Sister cities==

* Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States since 1983.

==Notable people==
Sandford Fleming originally came to the town in the late 1840s with his first impression finding it to be &quot;rather a poor little place&quot;. However, since, there have been a number of people of note, including athletes, musicians, authors and more who made Peterborough their home. Two of particular note are Catherine Parr Traill, the author of &quot;The Backwoods of Canada&quot;, who was an early settler, and Lester B. Pearson, the former Prime Minister, who attended local school PCVS.

<text>Jerome Richardson (December 25, 1920 – June 23, 2000) was an American jazz musician and woodwind player. He is cited as playing one of the earliest jazz flute recordings with his work on the 1949 Quincy Jones arranged song &quot;Kingfish&quot;.

==Career==
Starting from a young age, he first played alto saxophone, taking Johnny Hodges and Benny Carter as models. By the age of fourteen, he was playing professionally around northern California, and also took up the flute. He studied music at San Francisco State College. While in the navy, he worked under Marshal Royal in the 45-piece regimental band that was attached to the Navy&#x27;s preflight training school for pilots at St. Mary&#x27;s College in Moraga, California. After his discharge, he joined Lionel Hampton`s band in 1949 before moving to New York in 1954. There, he played with Oscar Pettiford and at Minton`s Playhouse doing combo work with Kenny Burrell. He also worked at the Roxy Theatre (New York City) in their R&amp;B productions.

Richardson was the regular saxophonist in the Oscar Pettiford band that one night, being busy with studio recording work, saw him late for the gig at Cafe Bohemia  where Cannonball Adderley and brother Nat Adderley were present in the audience. Cannonball had taken his part and was inadvertently discovered as a result.

Richardson was versed in a variety of instruments in the saxophone, clarinet, and flute families. Early in his career he even sang rock and roll blues vocals. He was an in demand studio musician for television and stage, as well as a session musician in groups outside of jazz. He played with Quincy Jones, Lionel Hampton, Billy Eckstine, Oscar Pettiford, Charles Mingus, Kenny Burrell, The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra (of which he was a founding member), and later with Earl Hines&#x27; small band. 

Richardson was born in Oakland, California, and died in Englewood, New Jersey, of heart failure at the age of 79.

<doc id="223606" wikidata="Q1709356" url="?curid=223606" title="José Luis Ramírez">
<text>José Luis Ramírez (born December 3, 1958) is a Mexican former professional boxer who was a two-time World Lightweight Champion. His most notable fights include two fights each with Edwin Rosario and Pernell Whitaker as well as fights against Ruben Olivares, Alexis Arguello, Ray Mancini, Hector Camacho, Julio Cesar Chavez and Juan Martin Coggi.

==Career==
A native of Huatabampo, Sonora and a resident of Culiacán, Ramírez made his professional debut on March 25, 1973 at the age of 15. He climbed slowly but steadily on boxing&#x27;s rankings. In 1978, as a Featherweight, a 19 year old Ramírez lost by knockout for the only time in his career to legendary three time former world champion Rubén Olivares in two rounds.

After his move in weight to the Lightweights, 21-year-old Ramírez accumulated a record of 67-2, and met another boxing legend inside the ring, when he fought Alexis Argüello. Ramírez dropped Argüello for the first time in his career in round six, but lost a disputed ten round split decision in Miami. He then faced Ray Mancini for the North American Lightweight belt, and lost a 12 round decision in Ohio. By then, Ramírez and Julio César Chávez were gymmates and friends.

Ramírez won his following 10 bouts and on May 1, 1983, he was given the chance at becoming world Lightweight champion for the first time, when he fought Puerto Rican Edwin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Rosario at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente in San Juan, Puerto Rico, for the World Boxing Council&#x27;s championship. Ramírez lost a close 12 round unanimous decision, but on November 3, of 1984, he and Rosario had a rematch, also in San Juan. After rising from two knockdowns, Ramírez rallied back to stagger Rosario in the third round. With Rosario pinned against a corner and Ramírez attacking, referee Steve Crosson stopped the bout in round four, after Ramírez had landed 17 straight punches, making Ramírez a world Lightweight champion for the first time, by a technical knockout. The fight was named the 1984 Ring Magazine fight of the year.

Ramírez then went into training for a defense against Héctor Camacho, another boxer from Puerto Rico. The fight was postponed when Camacho suffered a broken ankle during a pick up basketball game, but it finally came off on August 10, 1985. On his first fight telecast on HBO Boxing, Ramírez was dropped in round three and lost a 12 round unanimous decision.

Ramírez moved to Paris soon after. There, he re-grouped, and was able to regain the WBC&#x27;s world championship when Camacho left it vacant in 1987, by edging out Terrence Alli with another close but unanimous 12 round decision. In his first title defense, he defeated former champion Cornelius Boza-Edwards by fifth round knock out. In his second defense, he was awarded a 12 round split decision victory against future multiple world champion Pernell Whitaker. The consensus among both media and fans was that Whitaker deserved to win the fight.

Back in Mexico, he and Chávez were neighbors. Chávez had lifted the World Boxing Association&#x27;s world Lightweight championship by beating Rosario, and a unification bout between the two friends and neighbors was planned. Ramírez, who is a godfather to one of Chávez&#x27;s sons, lost an 11 round technical decision to Chávez on October 29 of 1988, which marked the last day he would be a world champion.

In 1989, he tried to win the International Boxing Federation&#x27;s belt from Whitaker, in Virginia, but he lost a 12 round decision. Then, in 1990, he returned to France, where he lost to Juan Martin Coggi by a decision in 12 for the WBA&#x27;s world Jr. Welterweight title in Ajaccio. After that bout, he retired.

Ramírez was a member of the less recognized, defunct &quot;World Boxing Hall of Fame&quot; in California, not to be confused with the more widely recognized International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota. In 2003, Ring magazine placed Ramirez on their list of the 100 greatest punchers of all time.

His boxing record is 102–9 (82 KOs). Seven of Ramirez&#x27;s nine career losses came against future Hall Of Fame members.

<text>St. Thomas is a city in southwestern Ontario, Canada. It gained its city charter on March 4, 1881. The city is also the seat for Elgin County, although it is independent of the county.

At the time of the 2021 Census, the population of the city was 42,918.

==History==

The city, located at the intersection of two historical roads, was first settled in 1810. It was named the seat of the new Elgin County in 1844 and was incorporated as a village in 1852, then as a town in 1861. In 1881 St. Thomas became a city. It was named after Thomas Talbot who helped promote the development of this region during the early 19th century.

The founder of the settlement that became St. Thomas was Capt. Daniel Rapelje, descendant of a Walloon family settled in New Amsterdam, now New York City, at its inception in the seventeenth century. In 1820, Rapelje, the town&#x27;s first settler, divided his land into town lots suitable for a village. Owner of the New England Mill, Rapelje subsequently donated two acres of land for the building of Old St. Thomas Church.

In 1871, the developing village of Millersburg, which included these lands east of the London and Port Stanley Railway, amalgamated with St. Thomas.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, several railways were constructed through the city, and St. Thomas became an important railway junction. A total of 26 railways have passed through the city since the first railway was completed in 1856. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the decline of the railway as a mode of transportation, other industry began to locate in the city, principally primary and secondary automotive manufacturing.

Jumbo the circus elephant, said to be the world&#x27;s biggest elephant at the time, died here on September 15, 1885, shortly after being hit by a locomotive. There is a life-sized commemorative statue that was erected in 1985.

In 1824, Charles Duncombe and John Rolph established the first medical school in Upper Canada, in St. Thomas, under the patronage of Colonel Thomas Talbot. Duncombe&#x27;s house now forms part of The Elgin Military Museum complex. Between 1881 and 1988 the city had a private woman&#x27;s school operating called Alma College which was destroyed by fire in 2008.

St. Thomas&#x27; late 19th- early 20th century architecture includes the Elgin County Court House, Wellington Street public school, Myrtle St. School (demolished in 2014), Balaclava St. School, Elmdale School and its city hall, most designated heritage properties and all designed by former resident Neil R. Darrach.

==Government==
Joe Preston is the current mayor of St. Thomas. The City Council consists of the mayor and eight City Councillors, all elected at large, meaning Councillors are elected on a citywide basis.

==Military==
31 Combat Engineer Regiment (The Elgins) was created in 1997 when the former Elgin Regiment (RCAC) was re-roled from an armour tasking. The regiment had been associated with St. Thomas since its creation; St. Thomas is currently home to one of its two component field squadrons. St. Thomas Armoury is a recognized Federal Heritage building 1992 on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, St. Thomas had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the 2011 census, St. Thomas had a population of 37,905 people in 2011, which was an increase of 5.6% from the 2006 census count. The median household income in 2016 for St. Thomas was $71,356.75

In the 2016 Census, more than 10,000 people were age 60 or over.

==Education==
Fanshawe College has a satellite campus in St. Thomas. Catholic schools are controlled by the London District Catholic School Board and public schools are controlled by the Thames Valley District School Board. Arthur Voaden Secondary School, Central Elgin Collegiate Institute and Parkside Collegiate Institute are the three public high schools. St. Joseph&#x27;s High School is a Catholic high school. There are two independent Christian elementary schools, Kings Academy and St. Thomas Community Christian School.

==Economy==
The local economy has been dominated by automotive manufacturing, with two plants operated by Magna International, the Ford St. Thomas Assembly in nearby Talbotville, and a Sterling Trucks assembly plant. However, the 2008 global recession that impacted the auto sector ultimately trickled down to the city; the Sterling plant closed in March 2009, and the Ford plant closed in late 2011 for a loss of 1,400 jobs. A number of other, smaller auto parts plants also closed as a result, putting thousands more out of work. This had a domino effect on the other part manufacturers in town, such as Lear Seating. One automotive materials supplier, A. Schulman, had previously closed its local manufacturing plant in 2008, one of the first actions of a new CEO installed in January.

Masco Canada&#x27;s consolidation of their Canadian operations into the former Sterling Truck assembly plant in 2010 and Toyota supplier Takumi Stamping Canada&#x27;s expansion in the same year brought over 500 jobs to St. Thomas.

A report in June 2019 indicated that a plant for cross-laminated timber (CLT) would be built in town, providing over 60 jobs. The estimated cost of the automated plant was $32 million.

The town&#x27;s Economic Development Corporation has attracted film crews, particularly to the former psychiatric hospital (the Regional Mental Health Centre) on Sunset Drive as a location for filming. A January 2020 report indicated that productions filming in the town have included &quot;The Boys&quot;, Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s &quot;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark&quot; and most recently, a film featuring Jason Momoa that was planning to film in town, frequently outdoors, from February to June 2020.

In April 2023, an announcement was made for the building of a battery plant by PowerCo, a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG and to have it running by 2027. This plant is expected to employ 3,000 and be one of the largest VW plants in the world.

<text>A kobold (; &quot;kobolt&quot;, &quot;kobolde&quot;, cobold) is a general or generic name for the household spirit (&quot;hausgeist&quot;) in German folklore.

It may invisibly make noises (i.e., be a poltergeist), or helpfully perform kitchen chores or stable work. But it can be a prankster as well. It may expect a bribe or offering of milk, etc. for its efforts or good behaviour. When mistreated (cf. fig. right), its reprisal can be utterly cruel.

A  () meaning &quot;little hat&quot; is one subtype; this and other kobold sprites are known for its pointy red cap, such as the &quot;niss&quot; (cognate of nisse of Norway) or &quot;puk&quot; (cognate of puck fairy) which are attested in Northern Germany, alongside &quot;drak&quot;, a dragon-type name, as the sprite is sometimes said to appear as a shaft of fire, with what looks like a head. There is also the combined form Nis Puk.

A house sprite Hinzelmann is a shape-shifter assuming many forms, such as a feather or animals. The name supposedly refers to it appearing in cat-form, Hinz[e] being an archetypical cat name. The similarly named Heinzelmänchen of Cologne (recorded 1826) is distinguished from Hinzelmann.

The Schrat is cross-categorized as a wood sprite and a house sprite, and some regional examples correspond to kobold, e.g., Upper Franconia in northern Bavaria. The kobold is sometimes conflated with the mine demon &quot;kobel&quot; or &quot;Bergmännlein&quot;/&quot;Bergmännchen&quot;, which Paracelsus equated with the earth elemental gnome. It is generally noted that there can be made no clear demarcation between a kobold and nature spirits.

The &quot;Klabautermann&quot; aboard ships are sometimes classed as a kobold.

==Overview==
A kobold is known by various names (discussed under ). As a household spirit, it may perform chores such as tidying the kitchen, but can be prankish, and when mistreated can resort to retribution, sometimes of the utmost cruelty. It is often said to require the household to put out sweet milk (and bread, bread soup) as offering to keep it in good behaviour.

The legend of the house sprite&#x27;s retribution is quite old. The tale of the &quot;hütchen&quot; (or &quot;hodekin&quot; in Low German, meaning &quot;little hat&quot;; tale retold as Grimms &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot; No. 74) is set in the historical background after c. 1130, and attested in a work c. 1500. This sprite that haunted the castle of the Bishop of Hildesheim, retaliated against a kitchen boy who splashed filthy water on it (Cf. fig. top right) by leaving the lad&#x27;s dismembered body cooking in a pot. Likewise the resident of Mecklenburg Castle, in 1327, allegedly chopped up a kitchen boy into pieces after he took and drank the milk offered to the sprite, according to an anecdote recorded by historian Thomas Kantzow (d. 1542).

The story of the &quot;multi-formed&quot; Hinzelmann (Grimms &quot;DS&quot; No. 75) features a typical house sprite, tidying the kitchen, repaying insolence, etc. Though normally invisible, it is a shapeshifter as its byname suggests. When the lord of Hudemühlen Castle flees to Hanover, the sprite transforms into a feather to follow the horse carriage. It also appears as a marten and serpent after attempts at expelling it.

A kobold by the similar name Heintzlein (Heinzlein) was recorded by Martin Luther. Although a group of house sprite names (Heinz, Heinzel, Heinzchen, Heinzelman, Hinzelman, Hinzemännchen, etc.) are considered to derive from diminutive pet name of &quot;Heinrich&quot;, the name Hinzelmann goes deeper, and alludes to the spirit appearing in the guise of a cat, the name Hinz[e] being an archetypical name for cats. Also Hinzelmann and Heinzelmänchen of Cologne are considered different house sprites altogether, the latter categorized as one of &quot;literary&quot; nature. The house sprite names Chim or Chimken, Chimmeken, etc. are diminutive informal names of Joachim.

But its true form is often said to be that of a small child, sometimes only felt to be as such by the touch of the hand, but sometimes a female servant eager to see it is shown a dead body of a child (cf. Hinzelmann). The folklore was current in some regions, e.g. Vogtland that the kobold was the soul of a child who died unbaptized. The Grimms (&quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot;) also seconded the notion of &quot;kobold&quot; appearing as a child wearing a pretty jacket, but Jacob Grimm (&quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;) stated contrarily that kobolds are red-haired and red-bearded, without examples. Later commentators noted that the house sprite Petermännchen sports a long, white beard. The Klabautermann is red-haired and white-bearded according to a published source.

The kobold often has the tendency to wear red pointy hats, a widely disseminated mark of European household spirits under other names such as the Norwegian &quot;nisse&quot;; the North or Northeastern German kobolds named Niss or Puk (cog. puck) are prone to wearing such caps. The combined form Nis Puk is also known. In the north the house sprite may be known by the dragon-like name , said to appear in a form like a fire shaft.

Sometimes household sprites manifests as a noisemaker (poltergeist). It may first be such a rattler, then an invisible speaker, then a sprite doing chores, etc. and gradually making its presence and personality more clear (see Hintzelmann tale). In some regions, the kobold is held to be the soul of a prematurely killed child ().

They may be hard to eradicate, but it is often said that a gift of an article of clothing will cause them to leave.

The &quot;klopfer&quot; is a &quot;noisemaker&quot; or poltergeist type of kobold name, while the &quot;poppele&quot; and &quot;butz&quot; (which Grimm and others considered to be noise inspired) are classed as names referring to a doll or figurine.

The name &quot;kobold&quot; itself might be classed in this &quot;doll&quot; type group, as the earliest instances of use of the word &quot;kobold&quot; in 13th century Middle High German refers jokingly to figurines made of wood or wax, and the word assumptively also meant &quot;household spirit&quot; in MHG, and certainly something of a &quot;household deity&quot; in the post-medieval period (gloss dated 1517).

The etymology of &quot;kobold&quot; that Grimm supported derived the word from Latin &quot;cobalus&quot; (Greek , ), but this was also Georg Agricola&#x27;s Latin/Greek cypher for &quot;kobel&quot;, syn. denoting mine spirits, i.e. gnome. This Greek etymology has been superseded by the Germanic one explaining the word as the compound &quot;kob/kof&quot; &#x27;house, chamber&#x27; + &quot;walt&quot; &#x27;power, authority&#x27; (cf. cobalt#etymology).

The &quot;gütel&quot; has a variant , a hayloft or stable kobold, which tampers with horses.

==Nomenclature and origins==

The &quot;kobold&quot; is defined as the well-known household spirit, descended from household gods and hearth deities, according to Grimms&#x27; dictionary.

However, Middle High German &quot;&quot; is defined as &quot;wooden or waxen figures of a nixie-ish (&quot;neckische&quot;) house spirit&quot;, used in jest.

===Kobold as generic term===

The term &quot;kobold&quot; was being used as general or generic term for &quot;house spirit&quot; known by other names even before Grimm, e.g., Erasmus Francisci (1690) who discusses the &quot;hütchen&quot; tale under the section on &quot;Kobold&quot;. The book &quot;Hintzelmann&quot; (published 1701, second edition 1704) was an expanded reworking by an anonymous author, based on the older-dated diaries of Pastor Feldmann (fl. 1584–1589) also used &quot;kobold&quot; and &quot;poltergeist&quot; in commentary, but this cannot be considered an independent source since the book (i.e., the rewriter) cites Erasmus Francisci elsewhere. Both these were primary sources for the kobold tales in Grimms&#x27; &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot;, No. 74, 75.

Praetorius (1666) discussed the household spirit under names such as (dat. pl. , kobold, &quot;gütgen&quot;, and Latin equivalents.

Steier (1705) glossing kobold as &quot;Spiritus familiaris&quot; perhaps indicates kobold being considered a generic term.

=== Glossed sources ===
It is a relatively late &quot;vocabularius&quot; where &quot;kobelte&quot; is glossed as (i.e., analogized as) the Roman house and hearth deities &quot;Lares&quot; and &quot;Penates&quot;, as in Trochus (1517), or &quot;kobold&quot; with &quot;&quot; as in Steier (1705).

While the term &quot;kobold&quot; is attested in Middle High German glossaries, they may not corroborate a &quot;house spirit&quot; meaning. The terms together with to gloss in Diefenbach&#x27;s source (Breslauer&#x27;s &quot;Vocabularius&quot;, 1340) may (?) suggest &quot;kobold&quot; being regarded more like an alp and mare which are dream demons.

But indications are that these Germanic household deities were current in the older periods, attested by Anglo-Saxon &quot;cofgodu&quot; (glossed &quot;penates&quot;) and Old High German (Old Frankish) for house or hearth deities also glossed as &quot;penates&quot;.

;(Middle High German location spirit &quot;stetewalden&quot;)
There is an attestation to a &quot;kobold&quot;-like name for a house or location spirit, given as by Frater Rudolfus of the 13th century, meaning &quot;ruler of the site&quot; ().

====Ur-origins====
Otto Schrader also observed that &quot;cult of the hearth-fire&quot; developed into &quot;tutelary house deities, localized in the home&quot;, and the German kobold and the Greek &quot;agathós daímōn&quot; both fit this evolutionary path.

===Etymology===
The &quot;kobalt&quot; etymology as consisting of &quot;kob&quot; &quot;chamber&quot; + &quot;walt&quot; &quot;ruler, power, authority&quot;, with the meaning of &quot;household spirit&quot; has been advanced by various authors, as early as (1861–1864) who postulated a form , quoted in Grimms&#x27; dictionary. Other writers such as Müller-Fraureuth (1906) also weighed in on the question of its etymology.

Other linguists such as Otto Schrader (1908) suggested ancestral (Old High German) &quot;the one who rules the house&quot;. Dowden (2002) offers the hypothetical precursor .

The &quot;kob/kub/kuf-&quot; root is possibly related to Old Norse/Icelandic: &quot;kofe&quot; &quot;chamber&quot;, or Old High German: &quot;chubisi&quot; &quot;house&quot;. and the English word &quot;cove&quot; in the sense of &#x27;shelter&#x27;.

This is now accepted as the standard etymology. Even though the Grimm brothers were aware of it, Jacob Grimm seemingly endorsed a different etymology (), though this eventually got displaced.

==== Kobold as doll ====
There are no attested uses of the word &quot;kobold&quot; (Middle High German: &quot;kobolt&quot;) prior to the 13th century. Grimm opines that earlier uses may have existed, but remain undiscovered or lost.

The earliest known uses of the word &quot;kobold&quot; in 13th century Middle High German refer jokingly to figurines made of wood or wax. The exemplum in Konrad von Würzburg&#x27;s poem (&lt;1250) refers to a man as worthless as a kobold-doll made from boxwood.

This use does not directly support the notion of the kobold being regarded as a spirit or deity. The scenario conjectured by Grimm (seconded by Karl Simrock in 1855) was that home sprites used to be carved from wood or wax and set up in the house, as objects of earnest veneration, but as the age progressed, they degraded into humorous or entertaining pieces of décor.

;(Stringed puppet)
The &quot;kobolt&quot; and &quot;Tatrmann&quot; were also boxwood puppets manipulated by wires, which performed in puppet theater in the medieval period, as evident from example usage. The traveling juggler () of yore used to make a kobold doll appear out of their coats, and make faces with it to entertain the crowd.

Thomas Keightley comments that legends and folklore about kobolds can be explained as &quot;ventriloquism and the contrivances of servants and others&quot;.

The 17th century expression &quot;to laugh like a kobold&quot; may refer to these dolls with their mouths wide open, and it may mean &quot;to laugh loud and heartily&quot;.

;(Dumb doll insult)

There are other medieval literary examples using &quot;kobold&quot; or &quot;tatrmann&quot; as a metaphor for mute or dumb human beings.

Note that some of the kobold synonyms are specifically classified as &quot;Kretinnamen&quot;, under the slander for stupidity category in the &quot;HdA&quot;, as aforementioned.

===Grimm&#x27;s alternate etymology===
Joseph Grimm in &quot;Teutonic Mythology&quot; gave the etymology of &quot;kobold/kobolt&quot; as derived from Latin &quot;cobalus&quot; (pl. &quot;cobali&quot;) or rather its antecedent Greek &quot;koba&#x27;los&quot; (pl. &quot;kobaloi&quot;; , plural: ) meaning &quot;joker, trickster&quot;. The final &quot;-olt&quot; he explained as typical German language suffix for monsters and supernaturals.

The derivation of &quot;kobold&quot; from Greek &quot;kobalos&quot; is not original to Grimm, and he credits Ludwig Wachler (1737).

Thus the generic &quot;goblin&quot; is a cognate of &quot;kobold&quot; according to Grimm&#x27;s etymology, and perhaps even a descendant word deriving from &quot;kobold&quot;. The Dutch &quot;kabout&quot;, &quot;kabot&quot;, &quot;kabouter&quot;, &quot;kaboutermanneken&quot;, etc., were also regarded as deriving from &quot;cabolus&quot; by Grimm, citing Dutch linguist Cornelis Kiliaan.

===Conflation with mine spirit===

Jacob Grimm certainly knew that &quot;kobel&quot; and &quot;Bergmännlein&quot; (=&quot;Bergmännchen&quot;) were the proper terms Agricola used for &quot;mine spirits&quot; since his &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot; quoted these terms from Georgius Agricola (16th cent.) in the annotation volume. So to know the actual German terms (&quot;kobel&quot;), one needed to consult the glossary The glossary was later attached to a 1657 omnibus edition consisting of an excerpt of &quot;De animatibus&quot; added to &quot;de re metallica&quot; in XII books, which is clearly Basel 1657 edition Grimm is citing.

But Grimms&#x27; dictionary, while admitting that the mine spirit went by the name &quot;kobel&quot;, considered that word merely to be a variant or offshoot of &quot;kobold&quot; (for the house spirit). The dictionary stated under &quot;kobold&quot; that &quot;kobel&quot; must be a diminutive cognate ). And under &quot;kobalt&quot; it considered the name of cobalt ore derived from the supposed mischief caused by the &quot;kobold&quot; or (mountain manikin, mountain spirit) in these mines.

Thus unsurprisingly, later writers have continued referring to mine spirits as &quot;kobolds&quot;, or to consider &quot;kobold&quot; to be both house spirit and mine spirit in a wider sense (cf. , ). At any rate it is recognized that the original &quot;house spirit&quot; kobold got conflated with the &quot;mine spirit&quot;, also known as &quot;kobel&quot;.

==== Visitors from mines ====
Spiritualist Emma Hardinge Britten (1884) recorded a story about a &quot;kobolds&quot; in the mines who communicated with local German residents (of Harz Mountains?) using banging sounds, and fulfilled the promise to visit their homes. Extracted as real-life experience from a Mrs. Kalodzky, who was visiting peasants named Dorothea and Michael Engelbrecht. As promised, these kobolds appeared in the house in shadow as small human-like figures &quot;more like a little image carved out of black shining wood&quot;. The informant claims she and her husband have both seen the beings since, and described them as &quot;diminutive black dwarfs about two or three feet in height, and at that part which in the human being is occupied by the heart, they carry the round luminous circle&quot;, and the sighting of the circle is more common than the dwarfish beings.

==Subtypes==
;(Other house spirits)

The term &quot;kobold&quot; has slipped into becoming a generic term, translatable as &quot;goblin&quot;, so that all manners of household spirits (&quot;hausgeister&quot;) became classifiable as &quot;types&quot; of kobold. Such alternate names for the &quot;kobold&quot; house sprite are classified by type of naming (A. As doll, B. As pejoratives for stupidity, C. Appearance-based, D. Characteristics-based, E. Diminutive pet name based), etc., in the (&quot;HdA&quot;).

A geographical map of Germany labeled with the different regional appellations has appeared in a 2020 publication.

Grimm, after stating that the list of kobold (or household spirit) in German lore can be long, also adds the names and .

===Doll or puppet names===
The term &quot;kobold&quot; in its earliest usage suggest it to be a wooden doll (Cf. §Origins under below). A synonym for kobold in that sense includes &quot;Tatrmann&quot;, which is also attested in the medieval period.

What is clear is that these kobold dolls were puppets used in plays and by travelling showmen, based on 13th century writings. They were also known as and described as manipulated by wires. Either way, the idol or puppet was invoked rhetorically in writing by the minstrels, etc. to mock clergymen or other people.

The household spirit names &#x27; and &#x27; were thought by Grimm to derive from noise-making, but the &quot;HdA&quot; considers them to be doll names. The &quot;poppele&quot; is thought to be the German word &quot;Puppe&quot; for doll. The term &quot;Butz&quot; meanwhile could refer to a &quot;tree trunk&quot;, and by extension either &quot;overgrown&quot; or &quot;little&quot;, or &quot;stupid&quot; thus is cross-categorized as an example of &quot;cretin names&quot; (category B). Ranke suggests the meaning of (&quot;klutz, hunk of wood&quot;) or a &quot;small being&quot;, with a &quot;noisemaker ghost&quot; is possible by descent from MHG &quot;to beat, strike&quot;.

While the MHG dictionary defines as a &quot;knocking[-sound making] kobold&quot; or poltergeist, or frightening form, Grimm thinks that all MHG usage treats &quot;butze&quot; as a type of bogey or scarecrow (). So in some sense, &quot;Butz&quot;[&quot;e&quot;] is simply a generic bogeyman (German: &quot;Butzemann&quot;). And &quot;butz&quot;[&quot;e&quot;], while nominally a kobold (house spirit), is almost a generic term for all kinds of spectres in the Alps region.

The East Central German name or (diminutive of &quot;god&quot;, i.e. &quot;little god&quot;, var. ) has been suggested as a kobold synonym of the fetish figurine type. Grimm knew the term but placed the discussion of it under the &quot;Wild man of the woods&quot; section conjecturing the use of &quot;güttel&quot; as synonymous to (i.e., sense of &#x27;idol&#x27;) in medieval heroic legend. The term &quot;gütel&quot; answers to Agricola&#x27;s &quot;guteli&quot; (in Latin) as an alternate common name for the mine spirit (&quot;bergmännlein&quot;).

====Mandrake root dolls====
The &quot;HdA&quot; categorizes as a dragon name. In English, &quot;mandrake&quot; is easily seen as a &quot;-drake&quot; or &quot;dragon&quot; name. In German, a reference needs be made to the Latin form &quot;mandragora&quot; where &quot;-dragora&quot; came to be regarded as meaning a dragon.

Since the mandrake do not natively grown in Germany, the so-called &quot;Alrune&quot; dolls were manufactured out of the available roots such as bryony of the gourd family, gentian, and tormentil (&quot;Blutwurz&quot;). The lore surrounding them is thus more like a charm whose possession brought luck and fortune, supposedly through the agency of some spirit, rather than a house-haunting kobold. The alraune doll was also known by names such as (generic name for such dolls) and . It is a mistake to consider such alraun dolls as completely equivalent to the kobald, the household spirit, in Grimm&#x27;s opinion.

But the kobold kind known as Alrune () did indeed exist locally in the folklore of the north, in Saterland, Lower Saxony. Alrune was also recognized as a kobold-name in Friesland, and even Switzerland.

===Cretin names===

The aforementioned &quot;butz&quot; may allude to a wooden object, or a &quot;dolt&quot; by extension. The Schrat (Schratte) is also formally categorized as a &quot;cretin name&quot; type of kobold nomenclature in the &quot;HdA&quot;. However, the term &quot;Schrat&quot; and its variants has remained current in the sense of &quot;house spirit&quot; only in certain parts such as &quot;southeast Germany&quot;: more specifically northern Bavaria including the Upper Palatinate, Fichtel Mountains, Vogtland (into Thuringia), and Austria (Styria and Carinthia) according to the various sources the &quot;HdA&quot; cites.

The tale &quot;Schrätel und wasserbär&quot; (kobold and polar bear) had been recorded in Middle High German, and is recognized as a &quot;genuine&quot; kobold tale. The tale is set in Denmark, whose king received the gift of a polar bear and lodges at a peasant&#x27;s house infested by a &quot;schretel&quot;. But it is driven away by the ferocious bear, which the spirit thinks is a &quot;big cat&quot;. Obviously Scandinavian origin is suspected, with the Norwegian version retaining the polar bear which turns into other beasts in Central European variants. Old Norse/Icelandic &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;sorcerer, giant&quot; has been listed as cognate forms.

There exists a version of this water-bear tale, set in Bad Berneck im Fichtelgebirge, Upper Franconia, where a &quot;holzfräulein&quot; has been substituted for the schrätel, and the haunting occurring at a miller&#x27;s, and the &quot;big cat&quot; dispatching the spirit. Still, the forms and seemed to be current around Fichtelgebirge (Fichtel Mountains), or at least in Upper Franconia region as a sprite haunting a house or stable. The &quot;schrezala&quot; form is recognized in Vogtland also.

Thus &quot;schretzelein&quot; is marked in Upper Franconia (around Hof, Bavaria) in the location map above, based on additional sources. A reputedly haunted a household at near Teuschnitz, Upper Franconia, and tended to cattle, washed the dishes, and put out the fire. But when the mistress of the house well-intendedly gave the gift of clothing to the spirit who looked like a six-year old , it exclaimed it had been now been given payment and must now leave. However, the forms are marked in Upper Franconia and in Lower Franconia on Schäfer et al.&#x27;s map.

Forms of &quot;schrat&quot; as kobold also occurs in Poland as &quot;skrzat&quot;, glossed in a c. 1500 dictionary as a household spirit (), also known by variant &quot;skrot&quot;. The Czech forms (standardized as ) could mean a kobold, but could also denote a &quot;mine spirit&quot; or a hag.

===Pet names===
There is a roster of names of kobolts or little folk derived from shortened affectionate forms of human names, including Chimken (Joachim),
Wolterken (Walter), Niss (Nils).

While Hinz, Hinzelmann, Heinz are categorized as C subtype &quot;beast-shape names&quot; (cat-shape names) in the HdA (Cf. , below),

The HdA does not explicitly include the child-sprite Heintzlein (Heinzlein) mentioned by Martin Luther in his &quot;Table Talk&quot;, which turns out to be the spirit of the unwanted child murdered by its mother (a motif seen by kobolds elsewhere). This spirit is renamed &quot;Heinzchen&quot; in Heine&#x27;s exposition, and perhaps also in Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot; No. 71 as well.

Grimm also lists other variant spellings () to be considered together. Grimm&#x27;s commentary then mentions Heinze as a mountain sprite (&quot;Berggeist&quot;, gnome) in Rollenhagen&#x27;s &quot;Froschmeuseler&quot;, Heinze being a diminutive (or rather more properly the affectionate shortened forms, or hypocorism) of Heinrich.

The kobold Heinzelmännchen (another diminutive of Heinrich) is particularly associated with Cologne, is actually separated out as a &quot;Category H Literary name&quot; in the HdA, apparently regarded as a late literary invention or reconstruction. The Heinzelmännchen is also clearly distinguished from the Hinzelmann in current scholarship, according to modern linguist Elmar Seebold, though they may have beeninterchangeably discussed in the past. Accordingly, a mix of heinzelman, hinzelman&quot; were given as &quot;pet name (shortened human name)&quot; type of kobold names by Grimm, (cf. below and the daughter article Heinzelmännchen).

Chimke (var. Chimken, Chimmeken), diminutive of Joachim is a Niederdeutsch for a poltergeist; the story of &quot;Chimmeken&quot; dates to c. 1327 and recorded in Thomas Kantzow&#x27;s Pomeranian chronicle (cf. ). Chimgen (Kurd Chimgen), and Chim are other forms.

Wolterken, also Low German, is diminutive for Walther, and another piece of household spirit of the pet name type, &quot;Wolterken&quot; glossed as &quot;lares&quot; and attested together with &quot; and &quot; in (1587) &quot;Panurgia lamiarum&quot;.

Nis (Niß) is also explained to be a northern pet name for Nils.

===Apparel names===
Under the classification of household spirit names based on appearance, a subcategory collects names based on apparel, especially the hat (classification C. a), under which are listed , etc. and even , which is one of the names of a cap or cloak of invisibility. To this group belongs the Low Saxon form () of the house sprite Hütchen from Hildesheim, which wears a felt hat (). Grimm also adds the names .

===Cat-shape===
The kobold Hinzelmann or Hintzelmann is completely distinguishable from the &quot;literary&quot; kobold Heinzelmännchen according to modern scholarship (cf. ).

And while the name Heinzelmann (Heinzelmännchen) is forged from diminutives of Heinrich, more importantly, the names Hinzelmann, Heinzelman (or , etc.,) are names alluding to the kobold&#x27;s frequent cat-like shape or transformation, and categorized Under type C &quot;Appearance-based&quot;, subtype &quot;beast-shape based names&quot; in the HdA. The analysis is expounded upon by Jacob Grimm, who notes that Hinze was the name of the cat in the &quot;Reineke&quot; (German version of &quot;Reynard the Fox&quot;) so it was the common pet name for cats. Thus hinzelman, hinzemännchen are recognized as cat-based names, to be grouped with (from &quot;kater&quot; &quot;&quot;) which may be precursor to &quot;tatermann&quot;.

The &quot;katzen-veit&quot; named after a cat is categorized by Grimm as a &quot;wood sprite&quot;, but also discussed under kobold, and classed as a &quot;cat appearance&quot; type kobold name (category C b) in &quot;HdA&quot;. Grimm localized the &quot;katzen-veit&quot; at Fichtelberg, and Prateorius also recognized this as the lore of the Vogtland region, though Praetorius&#x27;s work published (1692) under the pseudonym Lustigero Wortlibio claims &quot;katzen-veit&quot; to be a famous &quot;cabbage spirit&quot; in the Hartzewalde (in Elbingerode, now part of Oberharz am Brocken in the Harz mountains, cf. map).

The &quot;Hitzelmann&quot; that haunted Hudemühlen Castle in Lower Saxony was described at length by Pastor Feldmann &quot;Der vielförmige Hintzelmann&quot; (1704). As the title suggests, this Hinzelmann was a many and varied shapeshifter, transforming into a white feather, or a marten, or a serpent. (cf. ).

The kobold appears in the guise of a cat to eat the panada bribe, in Saintine&#x27;s version.

===Poltergeists===
The &quot;HdA&quot;’s category D consists of kobold names from their behavioural characteristics, and other than some non-German sprites discussed, these are mainly the poltergeists, or noise-making spirits (otherwise, they are names derived after their favourite dish, cf. below). The poltergeists include the (&quot;knocker&quot;), , etc.

Some poltergeists had been assumed to be named after their noise-making nature in the past, but &quot;HdA&quot; re-categorized them otherwise as puppet names. So rather than taking to be a form of &quot;doll&quot;, Grimm argued that the poltergeist (or )　and 　(regionally also , etc.) were related to verb meaning to &#x27;soft-knock or thump repeatedly&#x27; (or , &quot;noisemaking&quot;), with a side meaning of a &#x27;muffled (masked, covered-up) ghost to frighten children&#x27;.

Likewise, though Grimm thought was reference to noise, even though &quot;butz&quot; seems to refer to a &quot;tree trunk&quot; and thus, had been classed as A for doll-name by &quot;HdA&quot;.

Rumpelstilzchen of Grimms&#x27; KHM No. 55 (as well as the Rumpelstilt mentioned by Johann Fischart) are discussed as a poltergeist type of kobold by Grimm as well, though not formally admitted under this poltergeist category of kobold names in the HdA. The name Rumpelstilts is composed of meaning &quot;(crumpled) noise&quot; and with several meanings such as &quot;stilts&quot;, a pair of poles used as extension of legs.

===Milk-lovers===
In category D, there are names deriving from their favorite food being the bowl of milk, namely (&quot;Potjack&quot;)and the Swiss meaning &quot;milk vat&quot; (cf. ).

=== Heinzelmännchen ===

The Heinzelmännchen of Cologne resemble short, naked men. Like typical house sprites, they were said to perform household chores such as baking bread, laundry, etc. But they remained beyond sight of humans. According to Ernst Weyden (1826), bakers in the city until the late 18th century never needed hired help because, each night, the kobolds known made as much bread as a baker could need. However, the people of the various shops could not suppress their curiosity at seeing them, and schemed to see them. A tailor&#x27;s wife strewed peas on the stairs to trip up and hope to see them. Such endeavors caused the sprites to disappear from all the shops in Cologne, before around the year 1780.

This house sprite is included as kobold, but is considered a literary retelling, based on the fact the knowledge about the sprite had been spread by August Kopisch&#x27;s ballad (1836).

===Miscellaneous===
Other house spirits categorized as &quot;K. Other names&quot; by the &quot;HdA&quot; are , , . The &quot;mönch&quot; lore is widespread from Saxony to Bavaria.

King Goldemar, king of dwarfs, is also re-discussed under the household spirit commentary by Grimm, presumably because he became a guest to the human king Neveling von Hardenberg at his Castle Hardenstein for three years, making a dwarf sort of a household spirit on a limited-term basis.

For cognate beings of kobolds or house spirits in non-German cultures, see .

==Characteristics==
The kobold is linked to a specific household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners&#x27; desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale.

Should someone take pity on a kobold in the form of a cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to their house. They must go on St John&#x27;s Day between noon and one o&#x27;clock, into the forest. When they find an anthill with a bird on it, they must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small human. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and they can then transfer the kobold to their home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.

House kobolds usually live in the hearth area of a house, although some tales place them in less frequented parts of the home, in the woodhouse, in barns and stables, or in the beer cellar of an inn. At night, such kobolds do chores that the human occupants neglected to finish before bedtime: They chase away pests, clean the stables, feed and groom the cattle and horses, scrub the dishes and pots, and sweep the kitchen. The is described as a spirit that scrapes the horse (that is to say, with the currycomb or in German, &quot;Striegel&quot;) in their stalls, feeds the swine to fatten them, and draws water and carries it over to the cattle to drink.

Other kobolds help tradespeople and shopkeepers.

Kobolds are spirits and, as such, part of a spiritual realm. However, as with other European spirits, they often dwell among the living. The spirit&#x27;s doings, and how humans interact will be discussed further below ()

Kobolds can take on the appearance of children, be dressed a certain way, or manifest as non-human animals, fire, humans, and objects. This is further discussed below ()

==Physical description==

There seems to be contradictory opinion on whether a kobold should be generally regarded as boyish looking, or more elderly and bearded. An earlier edition (1819) of the &quot;Brockhaus Enzyklopädie&quot; gives the childlike description, however, a later edition (1885) amends to the view of an elderly looking kobold, with a beard. Yet actual instances of a bearded household kobold seems to concentrate on one lone example or two.

The lore that a kobold, when spotted is often seen as a young child wearing a pretty jacket is presented in Grimms &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot; (1816), No.71 &quot;Kobold&quot;. And a cherubic, winged child illustration occurs in the 1704 printed book narrative of the kobold, &quot;Hintzelmann&quot; (cf. right).

The bearded look was underscored by Jacob Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Mythlogie&quot; where the kobold was ascribed red hair and beard, without specific examples. Simrock summarized that &quot;they&quot; (apparently applying broadly to dwarfs, house spirits, wood sprites, and subterranean folk) tend to have red hair and red beard, as well as red clothing. The example of Petermännchen of Schwerin is a story that mentions its white beard, and an instance of a kobold from Mecklenburg, with long white beard and wearing a hood (&quot;&quot;) mentioned by Golther is in fact Petermännchen also. The klabautermann which some reckon to be a ship-kobold has been purported to have a fiery red head of hair and white beard.

On the kobold assuming the guise of small children, there is a piece of lore that the kobolds are the spirits of dead children and often appear with a knife that represents the means by which they were put to death. Cf. 

Other tales describe kobolds appearing as herdsmen looking for work and little, wrinkled old men in pointed hoods.

One 19th century source claimed mine kobolds with black skin were seen by her and her husband multiple times. (cf. ).

===Red cap===
Kobolds supposedly also tend to wear a pointy red hat, though Grimm acknowledges that the &quot;red peaky cap&quot; is also the mark of the Norwegian &quot;nisse&quot;. Grimm mentions the spirit known as (meaning &quot;little hat&quot; of felt, cf. ) immediately after, perhaps as an example of such a cap-wearer.

The kobold wearing a red cap and protective pair of boots is reiterated by, e.g., Wolfgang Golther. Grimm describes household spirits owning fairy shoes or fairy boots, which permits rapid travel over difficult terrain, and compares it to the league boots of fairytale.

There is lore concerning the infant-sized niss-puk ( var. &quot;Neß Puk&quot;, where &quot;Puk&quot; is cognate to English puck) wearing (pointed) red caps localized in various part of the province of Schleswig-Holstein, in northernmost Germany adjoining Denmark.

Karl Müllenhoff provided the &quot;kobold&quot; lore of the of Schleswig-Holstein, in his anthology, this tale localized at Rethwisch, Steinburg (Krempermarsch). The Schwertmann was said to dwell in a (or &quot;donnerloch&quot;, &quot;thunder pit&quot;, i.e., pit in the ground said to be caused by lightning), which Müllenhoff insists was a &quot;large water pit&quot;. It would emerge from this pit-hole and perpetrate mischief on villagers, but could also (try to) be helpful. It could appear in the guise of fire, and appreciated the gift of shoes, though his burning feet quickly turns them into tatters.{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|Note that the English translation of the essay &quot;tales from his own collection, no. 346{{{sic}}..&quot; is a misprint for No. 348 &quot;{{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuxNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA258 |2=Der Teufel in Flehde}} is localized in Rehm-Flehde-Bargen in the Dithmarschen.{{sfnp|Müllenhoff|1845|p=258}} In the Beowulf essay Müllenhoff also cites &quot;{{lang|de|Der Dränger}}&quot; (&quot;the presser&quot;, No. 347), said to breach dams, localized around the mouth of the Eider, close to e.g. Stapelholm.}} According to supposed eyewitness accounts by people in Stapelholm the Niß Puk{{efn|Müllenhoff: {{langx|de|Leute aus..

The lore of the house kobold &quot;puk&quot;{{efn|Also &quot;drak&quot;}} was also current farther east in Pomerania, including now Polish Farther Pomerania.{{sfnp|Berger|2001|pp=163–167}} The kobold-&quot;niss&quot;-&quot;puk&quot; was regarded as wearing a &quot;red jacket and cap&quot; in western Uckermark.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=156}} The tale of {{lang|de|pûks}} told in Swinemünde (now Świnoujście){{efn|Cf.

=== Invisibility and true form ===
The normal invisibility of the &quot;Chimgen&quot; (or &quot;Chim&quot;) kobold is explained in legend which tells of a female servant taking a fancy to her house&#x27;s kobold and asking to see him. The kobold refuses, claiming that to look upon him would be terrifying. Undeterred, the maid insists, and the kobold tells her to meet him later—and to bring along a pail of cold water. The kobold waits for the maid, nude and with a butcher knife in his back. The maid faints at the sight, and the kobold wakes her with the cold water. And she never wished to see the Chimgen{{Refn|name=&quot;chimgen-forms&quot;}} ever again.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=252}}

In one variant, the maid urges her favourite kobold named Heinzchen (or actually Heintzlein) to see him in his natural state, and is then led to the cellar, where she is shown a dead baby floating in a cask full of blood; years before, the woman had borne a bastard child, killed it, and hidden it in such a cask.{{Refm|Martin Luther (1566) &quot;Tischreden&quot; (&quot;Table Talk&quot;), translated in {{harvp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|pp=140–141}}, via Dobeneck.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|Grimm &quot;DS&quot; No. 71 consolidates the versions into the anecdote of &quot;Kurd Chimgen&quot; or &quot;Heinzchen&quot;, since it cites both Praetorius and Martin Luther as sources.{{sfnp|Grimms|1816|p=92}}}}{{Refn|This matches the retelling given by Saintine (1862), accompanied by Gustave Doré&#x27;s illustration of the child floating in its own blood inside a tub (cf. Fig. right), but the text is altered and the illustration omitted in the English translation.}}

==== True identity as child&#x27;s ghost ====
Saintine follows the story above with a piece of lore that kobolds are regarded as (ghosts of) infants, and the tail (&quot;caudal appendage&quot;) that they have represent the knife used to kill them. What Praetorius (1666) stated was that the goblin haunting a house often appeared in the guise of children with knives stuck in their backs, revealing them to be ghosts of children murdered in that manner.{{Refn|name=&quot;praetorius-childghost&quot;}}

The lore that the kobold&#x27;s true identity is the soul of a child who died unbaptized was current in the Vogland (including such belief held for the gutel of Erzgebirge).{{sfnp|Ranke|1910|pp=149–150}} Like the soul, the kobold can assume any shape, even &quot;sheer fire&quot;.{{sfnp|Ranke|1910|p=152}}

Cf. Grimm, the lore that unbaptized children become {{lang|de|pilweisse}} ({{interlanguage link|bilwis|de|lt=&quot;bilwis&quot;}}){{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|The &quot;Pilweise of Lauban&quot; is regarded as being related to the stable-kobold, &quot;schretelein&quot;. Cf. Schrat.}} Also, the &quot;Irrlicht&quot; (≈ will-o&#x27;-the-wisp), called {{lang|de|Dickepôten}} locally in the southern Altmark, were said to be the souls of unbaptized children.{{Refn|Dickepôten described as a name of a &quot;Jack-o&#x27;-Lanterns&quot; by Thorpe.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=158}} This is presumably the will-o&#x27;the-wisp of Altmark referred to by C. P. G. Scott and Ashliman.}}

=== Goldemar&#x27;s traces ===
Although King Goldemar (or Goldmar), a famous kobold from Castle Hardenstein, had hands &quot;thin like those of a frog, cold and soft to the feel&quot;, he never showed himself.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=256}} King Goldemar was said to sleep in the same bed with Neveling von Hardenberg. He demanded a place at the table and a stall for his horses.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=256}} The master of Hudemühlen Castle, where Heinzelmann lived, convinced the kobold to let him touch him one night.

When a man threw ashes and tares about to try to see King Goldemar&#x27;s footprints, the kobold cut him to pieces, put him on a spit, roasted him, boiled his legs and head, and ate him.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|pp=256–257}}

=== Fire phenomena ===

The kobold is said to appear as an oscillating fire-pillar (&quot;stripe&quot;) with a part resembling a head, but appears in the guise of a black cat when it lands and is no longer airborne (Altmark, Saxony).{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=155}} Benjamin Thorpe likens this to similar lore about the &quot;dråk&quot; (&quot;drake&quot;) in Swinemünde (now Świnoujście), Pomerania.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=155}}

A legend from the same period taken from Pechüle, near Luckenwald, says that a &quot;drak&quot; (apparently corrupted from {{lang|de|Drache}} meaning &quot;drake&quot; or &quot;dragon&quot;{{Refn|Ashliman states the kobold is otherwise known as &quot;{{linktext|Drache}}&quot; which is standard non-dialect German for &quot;dragon&quot;, but he prefers to render this as &quot;drake&quot;.}}) or kobold flies through the air as a blue stripe and carries grain. &quot;If a knife or a fire-steel be cast at him, he will burst, and must let fall what which he is carrying&quot;.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=156}} Some legends say the fiery kobold enters and exits a house through the chimney. Legends dating to 1852 from western Uckermark ascribe both human and fiery features to the kobold; he wears a red jacket and cap and moves about the air as a fiery stripe.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=156}} Such fire associations, along with the name &quot;drake&quot;, may point to a connection between kobold and dragon myths.

A {{interlanguage link|fire drake|ja|ファイアー・ドレイク}} could also refer to the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp during the Shakespearean period.{{Refn|Ashliman also makes note that &quot;fire drake&quot; referred to a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp in England too, at one time.}} And &quot;fire drake&quot; was used as shorthand for &quot;dråk&quot; of Pomerania{{efn|Kitteredge cites {{harvp|Jahn|1886}} &quot;Volkssagen aus Pommern und Rügen&#x27;, pp. 105ff, 110, etc.}} by literary scholar George Lyman Kittredge,{{efn|Just as Ashliman used &quot;drake&quot; for the Pomeranian &quot;drak&quot;.}} who went on to explain, that the German wisps, called {{lang|de|Irrlicht}} or {{lang|de|Feuermann}} (&quot;fiery man&quot;) are conflate with, or rather indistinguishable from the German fire-drakes (&quot;dråk&quot;). To the &quot;Irrlicht&quot; is attached a folk belief about the fire-light being the soul of unbaptized children{{Refn|According to the appended note by anthologist Rochholz, cited by Kitteredge.}} a motif already noted for the kobold. And the cited story of the &quot;Feuermann&quot; (Lausitz legend) explains it to be a wood-kobold ({{lang|de|Waldkobold}}) which sometimes entered houses and dwelled in the fireplace or chimney, like the Wendish &quot;drake&quot;.

But the &quot;HdA&quot; does not furnish kobold names for &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;wisp&quot;, and instead, {{lang|de|Dråk, Alf, Rôdjackte}} which are said to fly through air like an enflamed hay-pole ({{lang|de|Wiesbaum}}) laden with grain or gold (according to Pommeranian lore){{sfnp|Ranke|1910|p=159}} have all been categorized under the &quot;I dragon names&quot; category.{{Refn|&quot;HdA&quot;, &quot;Kobold&quot;, n 67) 68) 69) citing Zfdk 1,}} The connection between the fiery drak and the dragon-associated name in the Austrian dialect {{lang|de|Tragerl}} for shooting star is commented on by Ranke.{{sfnp|Ranke|1910|p=159}} (cf. {{section link||Animal form}} below for lore of kobolds hatching from eggs, thus leading to comparisons with basilisks and dragons).

=== Animal form ===

Other kobolds appear as non-human animals.{{sfnp|Lüthi|1986|loc=p. 4, note*}} Folklorist D. L. Ashliman has reported kobolds appearing as wet cats and hens.

In Pomerania there are several tales specimens that a kobold, &quot;puk&quot;, or {{lang|de|rôdjakte/rôdjackte}} hatches from a yolk-less chicken egg ({{lang|de|Spâei, Sparei}}),{{sfnp|Berger|2001|p=163}}{{Refn|More specifically a kobold or {{lang|de|rôdjakte}} from an egg in Jahn, No. 154. from Kratzig (now Kraśnik Koszaliński). and Haas (1896) from Rügen, two tales.}} and in other tales, a kobold (aka &quot;redjacket&quot;) appears in a cat&#x27;s guise or a &quot;puk&quot; appears as a hen.{{sfnp|Berger|2001|p=167}}

The comparison is readily made to the legend of the hen-hatched basilisk, and Polívka makes further comparisons to lore involving hens and dragons.

Thorpe has recorded that the people of Altmark believed that kobolds appeared as black cats while walking the earth.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|pp=155–156}} The kobold Hinzelmann could appear as a black marten ({{langx|de|schwartzen Marder}}) and a large snake.{{rp|111}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|pp=244–245}}

One lexicon glosses the French term for werewolf, &quot;loup-garou&quot;, as kobold.{{Refn|Rädlein (1711), Loup-garou as Bär-Wolff, German Wehr-Wolff and Kobold, cited by Grimm &quot;DW&quot; &quot;Kobold&quot; 1. 1) b).}} This is somewhat underscored by the remark that werewolf transformation was considered an ability of sorcerers with unibrow, which was a physical mark shared with the Schratel spirit (as wood sprite).{{sfnp|Simrock|1855|p=439}}

These do not comprise an exhaustive list of what forms the kobold can take on. The &quot;hinzelmann&quot; besides the cat appears as a &quot;dog, hen, red or black bird, buck goat, dragon, and a fiery or bluish form&quot;, according to an old encyclopedic entry. Ranke (1910) gave a similar list for kobold transformations which includes bumblebee (&quot;{{linktext|Hummel}}&quot;).{{sfnp|Ranke|1910|p=152}}

==Activities and interactions==
=== Offerings and retributions ===
A kobold expects to be fed in the same place at the same time each day.

But it is known that the kobold becomes extremely dedicated to caring for its household, performing the chores and services in its maintenance, as in the case of the Hinzelmann. The association between kobolds and work gave rise to a saying current in 19th-century Germany that a woman who worked quickly &quot;had the kobold&quot; (&quot;sie hat den Kobold&quot;).{{sfnp|Grimms|1816|p=91}}

Legends tell of slighted kobolds becoming quite malevolent and vengeful, afflicting errant hosts with supernatural diseases, disfigurements, and injuries.{{sfnp|Lüthi|1986|p=5}} Their pranks range from beating the servants to murdering those who insult them.{{sfnp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|pp=139–142}}

In the story of the Chimmeken of the Mecklenburg Castle, (&quot;supra&quot;, dated 1327 given by Kantzow) the milk customarily put for the sprite by the kitchen was stolen by a kitchen-boy (&quot;Küchenbube&quot;), and the spirit consequently left the boy&#x27;s dismembered body in a kettle of hot water.{{Refn|A variant about Chimmeke, localized in Loitz also exists.}} In comparison, a more amicable {{lang|de|pück}} anecdotally served monks at Mecklenburg monastery, bargaining for multicolored tunic with lots of bells in return for his services.{{Refn|Comparison made by Haas (1896) The latter tale occurs in Grimm (1854) {{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCqo5yNwmGEC&amp;pg=PA479|2=&quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;, p. 479}}, 3te Ausgabe, Band I, and &quot;II&quot; is a misprint, {{=}} {{harvp|Grimm|Stallybrass tr.|1883}}, {{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8AoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA503 |2=1: 503}}.}}

A similar episode of the vengeful {{lang|de|Hüdeken}}{{Refn|name=&quot;praetorius-feltcap&quot;}} (normalized as {{lang|de|Hütchen}}{{Refn|Grimms &quot;DS&quot;, and Francisci.}}) occurs in a chronicle of Hildesheim, c. 1500,{{Refn|Johannes Trithemius &quot;Chronicon Hirsaugiense, &quot; (1495–1503), translated by Ritson, and called an &quot;old chronicle&quot;, in {{harvp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|pp=141–142}}}}{{Refn|These tales are regurgitated by Praetorius also, marked as #2.{{sfnp|Praetorius|1666|pp=375–378}}}}{{Refn|Also in Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot; &quot;No. 74 Hütchen, a composite from several sources other than Praetorius, including modern oral tradition,{{sfnp|Aschner|1909|p=63}} with the kitchen tale at {{harvp|Grimms|1816|pp=100–101}}.}}{{Refn|One of the Grimms&#x27; DS sources is Erasmus Francisci (1690)&#x27;s version.}} where the sprite exacted vengeance from the kitchen boy of the castle{{Refn|name=&quot;schelwig-stift&quot;}} who had the habit of throwing kitchen filth on him; the sprite strangled the lad in his sleep, leaving the severed body parts cooking in a pot over the fire. The head cook who complained was pushed from the heights to his death.{{Refn|That the kobold &quot;pushed (&quot;{{linktext|stieß}}&quot;)&quot; the master cook off the bridge occurs in Grimms&#x27; &quot;DS&quot;{{sfnp|Grimms|1816|p=101}} as in the various sources, i.e. Francisci,{{sfnp|Francisci|1690|p=796}} Tritemius and Ritson&#x27;s translation, via Weyler. Thus the &quot;illusory&quot; bridge in Heine appears to be an embelishment.{{sfnp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|pp=141–142}}{{Refn|The murder of the &quot;Bishop of Hildesheim&#x27;s Kitchen-boy&quot; is retold in nursery rhyme fashion by M. A. B. Evans (1895).}}

According to Max Lüthi, the household spirits&#x27; being ascribed such abilities reflect the fear of the people who believe in them.{{sfnp|Lüthi|1986|p=5}}

The bribe left to the household spirit was a combination of milk and bread according to multiple sources. In the printed edition of &quot;Der vielförmige Hintzelmann&quot; (1704), Hintzelmann was supposed to be provided with a bowl of sweet milk with white bread crumbled over it (as illustrated in the book).{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|pp=241, 243}} The offering was to be milk and &quot;{{linktext|Semmel}}&quot; (bread roll) also according to a lexicon for Altmark.{{Refn|Danneil, Johann Friedrich (1839), quoted in Grimm, &quot;DW&quot; &quot;Kobold&quot;.}} The offering was described as panada (bread [and milk] soup) in the French retelling by Saintine.

Novelist Heinrich Heine noted in connection with the present (Hildesheim) tale that the favourite food was the gruel for the Scandinavian &quot;nisse&quot;.{{sfnp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|p=142}}

=== Other dairy lore ===
As a sort of the reverse of the offering, one tradition claims that the kobold will strew wood chips (sawdust, {{lang|de|Sägespäne}}) about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. And if the master of the house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold is pleased and takes up residence at the household.{{sfnp|Grimms|1816|p=91}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=239}}{{sfnp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|p=143}}

The bribe put out for the kobold may be butter, for example, the Niß Puk of the Bombüll farmstead at Wiedingharde in Schleswieg-Holstein would tend to the {{linktext|milchcows}}, but demanded a morsel of butter on a plate each evening, and the Puk would choke the best milking cow if it was not provided.

According to the lore from South Tyrol (now part of Italy), the Stierl farmstead at {{ill|Unterinn|de}} experienced the trouble where the farmer&#x27;s wife could not make butter for all her churning in the bucket ({{lang|de|Kübel}}).{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|This is similar to the lore that the mine-kobold (properly &quot;kobel&quot;) was thought responsible for swapping silver with then worthless cobalt; the silver-mining operation also involved used of the bucket &quot;Kübel&quot;, which Muerller-Fraureuth conjecturesd was the root of the sprite&#x27;s name &quot;kobel&quot;.}} The farmer decided it was the doings of a kobold, and went down to the basement where lived Kröll Anderle who was learned in the magic books,{{efn|Of this character, there is a separate legend, &quot;109. Vom Kröll Anderle&quot; is told in Heyl, p. 290.}} and Anderle gave instructions to dip a glowing hot skewer into the liquid while churning the bucket under the eaves, which succeeded. But the kobold driven out repaid the farmer&#x27;s wife with a hot log leaving her a permanent burn injury.

===Good-evil duality===
Archibald MacLaren has attributed kobold behaviour to the virtue of the homeowners; a virtuous house has a productive and helpful kobold; a vice-filled one has a malicious and mischievous pest. If the hosts give up those things to which the kobold objects, the spirit ceases its annoying behaviour.{{sfnp|MacLaren|1857|p=224}} Hinzelmann punished profiligacy and vices such as miserliness and pride;{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=246}} for example, when the haughty secretary of Hudemühlen was sleeping with the chamber maid, the kobold interrupted a sexual encounter and hit the secretary with a broom handle{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=250}} King Goldemar revealed the secret transgressions of clergymen, much to their chagrin.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=256}}

Even friendly kobolds are rarely completely good,{{sfnp|Lüthi|1986|p=4}} and house kobolds may do mischief for no particular reason. They hide things, push people over when they bend to pick something up, and make noise at night to keep people awake.{{sfnp|Saintine|1862|p=290}} The kobold Hödeken of Hildesheim roamed the walls of the castle at night, forcing the watch to be constantly vigilant.{{sfnp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|pp=141–142}} A kobold in a fishermen&#x27;s house on the Wendish Spree, about a German mile ({{convert|7.5|km|mi}}) from the Köpenick quarter of Berlin, reportedly moved sleeping fishermen so that their heads and toes lined up.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|pp=83–84}} King Goldemar enjoyed strumming the harp and playing dice.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=256}}

=== Good fortune ===
A kobold can bring wealth to his household in the form of grain and gold. In this function it often is called Drak. A legend from Saterland and East Friesland tells of a kobold called the &quot;Alrûn&quot; (which is the German term for mandrake). In the tale from Nordmohr/Nortmoor, E. Friesland, now Low Saxony) despite standing only about a foot tall, the creature could carry a load of rye in his mouth for the people with whom he lived and did so daily as long as he received a meal of biscuits (&quot;Zwieback&quot;) and milk.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|pp=156–157}} Kobolds bring good luck and help their hosts as long as the hosts take care of them.

The kobold Hödekin, who lived with the bishop of Hildesheim in the 12th century, once warned the bishop of a murder. When the bishop acted on the information, he was able to take over the murderer&#x27;s lands and add them to his bishopric.{{sfnp|Heine|Mustard tr.|1985|pp=141–142}}

The house-spirit in some areas were called &quot;Alrûn&quot; (&quot;mandrake&quot;), though this was also the name of a trinket sold in bottles,{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=49}} which instead of being genuine mandrake could be any doll shaped from some plant root. And the saying &quot;to have an Alrûn in one&#x27;s pocket&quot; means &quot;to have luck at play&quot;.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|pp=156–157}} However, kobold gifts may be stolen from the neighbours; accordingly, some legends say that gifts from a kobold are demonic or evil. Nevertheless, peasants often welcome this trickery and feed their kobold in the hopes that it continue bringing its gifts. A family coming into unexplained wealth was often attributed to a new kobold moving into the house.

=== Eradication ===
Folktales tell of people trying to rid themselves of mischievous kobolds. In one tale, a man with a kobold-haunted barn puts all the straw onto a cart, burns the barn down, and sets off to start anew. As he rides away, he looks back and sees the kobold sitting behind him. &quot;It was high time that we got out!&quot; it says.{{sfnp|Ashliman|2006|p=47}} A similar tale from Köpenick tells of a man trying to move out of a kobold-infested house. He sees the kobold preparing to move too and realises that he cannot rid himself of the creature.

Exorcism by a Christian priest works in some tales; in certain versions of the Hödekin in the kitchen of the castle enfeoffed to the Bishop of Hildesheim, the bishop managed to exorcise Hödekin using &quot;ecclesiastical censures&quot; or church-spells. The attempts to expel the Hintzelmann from the Castle Hudemühlen by a nobleman and later by an exorcist trying to use a book of holy spells were foiled; it later left of its own will.

Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when someone tried to see his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that the house would now be as unlucky as it had been fortunate under his care.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=257}}

==Other specialized kobolds==
Other than the mine spirit kobold above, there are others &quot;house spirits&quot; that haunt shops, ships , etc. places of various professions.

The Klabautermann (cf. also {{section link||Klabautermann}} below) is a kobold from the beliefs of fishermen and sailors of the Baltic Sea.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=240}} Adalbert Kuhn recognized in northern Germany the form {{lang|de|Klabåtersmanneken}} (syn. {{lang|de|Pûkse}}) which haunted mills and ships, subsisted on the milk put out for them, and in return performed chores such as milking cows, grooming horse, helping the kitchen, or scrubbing the ship.

The &quot;bieresel&quot;, sometimes called a type of kobold{{Refn|name=&quot;kuhn&amp;schwartz-bieresel&quot;}} live in breweries and the beer cellars of inns or pubs, bring beer into the house, clean the tables, and wash the bottles, glasses and casks. The family must leave a can of beer,{{Refn|name=&quot;kuhn&amp;schwartz-bieresel&quot;|Kuhn&amp;Schwartz (1848) under section &quot;XVI. Dråk, kobold&quot;, translated by Thorpe under section &quot;Dråk-Kobold-Fire-drake&quot;.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|p=157}}}} (cf. Hödfellow) and must treat the kobold with respect, never mocking or laughing at the creature.

===Klabautermann===
{{main|Klabautermann}}

The Klabautermann is a spirit that dwells in ships, according to the beliefs of the seafaring folk around the Baltic Sea in Germany and Netherlands, etc.{{sfnp|Kirby|Hinkkanen|2013|p=48}} The spirit has been classed as a ship-kobold{{sfnp|Ranke|1910|pp=162–163}} and is sometimes even called a &quot;kobold&quot;. {{sfnp|Kirby|Hinkkanen|2013|p=48}} The Klabautermann typically appears as a small, pipe-smoking humanlike figure wearing a red or grey jacket, or yellow attire, wearing nightcap-style sailor&#x27;s hat or a pair of yellow hoses and riding boots, and a &quot;steeple-crowned&quot; pointy hat.{{Refn|name=&quot;Obersteuermann-Werner&quot;|Kuhn&amp;Schwartz, with first mate (&quot;Obersteuermann&quot;) Werner from Hamburg as informant.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1852|pp=49–50}}}}

Klabautermanns may be benevolent and aid the ship&#x27;s crews in their tasks, but also be a menace or nuisance. For example, it may help pump water from the hold, arrange cargo, and hammer at holes until they can be repaired. But they can pull pranks with the tackle lines as well.

The Klabautermann is associated with the wood of the ship on which it lives. It enters the ship via the wood used to build it, and it may appear as a ship&#x27;s carpenter. It is said that if an unbaptized child is buried in a heath under a tree, and that timber is used to build a ship, the child&#x27;s soul will become the klabautermann which will inhabit that ship.{{sfnp|Ranke|1910|pp=162–163}}

==Parallels==
Kobold beliefs mirror legends of similar creatures in other regions of Europe, and scholars have argued that the names of creatures such as goblins and &quot;kabouters&quot; derive from the same roots as &quot;kobold&quot;. This may indicate a common origin for these creatures, or it may represent cultural borrowings and influences of European peoples upon one another. Similarly, subterranean kobolds may share their origins with creatures such as gnomes and dwarves.

Sources equate the domestic kobold with creatures such as the Danish {{lang|da|nis}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=239}} and Swedish tomte, Scottish brownie,{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=239}} the Devonshire pixy, English boggart, and English hobgoblin.{{sfnp|Keightley|1850|p=239}}

If the definition of kobold is extended beyond the house sprite and extended to mine spirits and subterranean dwellers (aka gnomes), then the parallels to mine-kobolds can be recognized in the Cornish knocker and the English bluecap as well as the Welsh coblynau.

Irish writer Thomas Keightley argued that the German kobold and the Scandinavian nis predate the Irish fairy and the Scottish brownie and influenced the beliefs in those entities, but modern folklorist Richard Mercer Dorson noted Keightley&#x27;s bias as a strong adherent of Grimm, embracing the thesis of regarding ancient Teutonic mythology as underlying all sorts of folklore.

British antiquarian Charles Hardwick ventured a theory that the spirits like the kobold in other cultures, such as the Scottish bogie, French goblin, and English Puck were also etymologically related.{{Refn|Roby, John (1829). &quot;Traditions of Lancashire&quot;. Quoted in Hardwick, p. 139. The sources spell the word &quot;khobalus&quot;.}} In keeping with Grimm&#x27;s definition, the &quot;kobaloi&quot; were spirits invoked (i.e., used as invective?) by such tongue-wagging rogues.

The &quot;zashiki-warashi&quot; (lit. &#x27;sitting-room lad&#x27;) of Japanese folklore parallels the kobold. Many points of commonality have been pointed out, for instance, the house inhabited by the sprite flourishes, but will fall to ruin once it leaves. The &quot;warashi&quot; is also of prankish nature,{{sfnp|Tsunoda|2007|p=24}} but does not actually help out with household chores.{{sfnp|Tsunoda|2007|p=24}} Both sprites can be appeased by offerings of favorite food, which is {{interlanguage link|sekihan|ja|赤飯|lt=&quot;azuki-meshi&quot;}} (&quot;adzuki rice&quot;) for the Japanese version.{{sfnp|Tsunoda|2007|p=24}}

==In culture==
===Literary references===
German writers have long borrowed from German folklore and fairy lore for both poetry and prose. Narrative versions of folktales and fairy tales are common, and kobolds are the subject of several such tales.
The kobold is invoked by Martin Luther in his Bible, translates the Hebrew &quot;lilith&quot; in Isaiah 34:14 as &quot;kobold&quot;.

In Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, the kobold represents the Greek element of earth.{{Refn|{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;Salamander shall glow,
Undine twine,
Sylph vanish,
Kobold be moving.

Who did not know
The elements...
&lt;/poem&gt;|Goethe|tr. Hayward}}}} This merely goes to show that Goethe saw fit to substitute &quot;kobold&quot; for the gnome of the earth, one of Paracelsus&#x27;s four spirits. In &quot;Faust&quot; Part II, v. 5848, Goethe uses &quot;Gütchen&quot; (syn. &quot;Güttel&quot; above) as synonym for his gnome.

===Theatrical and musical works===
A kobold is musically depicted in Edvard Grieg&#x27;s lyric piece, opus 71, number 3.

&quot;Der Kobold&quot;, Op. 3, is also Opera in Three Acts with text and music by Siegfried Wagner; his third opera and it was completed in 1903.

The kobold characters Pittiplatsch occurs in modern East German puppet theatre. . Pumuckl the kobold originated as a children&#x27;s radio play series (1961).

===Games and D&amp;D literature===
Kobolds also appear in many modern fantasy-themed games like &quot;Clash of Clans&quot; and &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, usually as a low-power or low-level enemy. They exist as a playable race in the &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; video game. They also exist as a non-playable rat-like race in the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; video game series, and also feature in tabletop games such as &quot;&quot;. In &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the kobold appears as an occasionally playable race of lizard-like beings. In &quot;Might and Magic&quot; games (notably &quot;Heroes VII&quot;), they are depicted as being mouse-dwarf hybrids. In the video game Home Safety Hotline, Kobolds appear as humanoid creatures with dog-like faces.

=== Fantasy novels and anime ===
The fantasy novel &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot; adapted into anime depicts kobolds as dog-like, based on earlier versions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, resulting in many Japanese media depictions doing the same.

In the novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, by Neil Gaiman, Hinzelmann is portrayed as an ancient kobold who helps the city of Lakeside in exchange for killing one teenager once a year.

In the novel &quot;The Spirit Ring&quot; by Lois McMaster Bujold, mining kobolds help the protagonists and display a fondness for milk. In an author&#x27;s note, Bujold attributes her conception of kobolds to the Herbert Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover translation of &quot;De re metallica&quot;.

<text>Iman Mohamed Abdulmajid (; born Zara Mohamed Abdulmajid, 25 July 1955), known mononymously as Iman, is a Somali-American model and actress. A muse of the designers Gianni Versace, Thierry Mugler, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, and Yves Saint Laurent, she is also noted for her philanthropic work. She was married to musician David Bowie from 1992 until his death in 2016.

==Early life==
Iman was born Zara Mohamed Abdulmajid () in Mogadishu and raised as a Muslim. She was later renamed Iman, meaning &quot;faith&quot; in Arabic at her grandfather&#x27;s urging, who believed she would &quot;prosper&quot; with a masculine name. Iman is the daughter of Mariam and Mohamed Abdulmajid. Her father, a diplomat, was the Somali ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and her mother was a gynecologist. She has four siblings: two brothers and two sisters, and was the first girl in her family in six generations of sons.

Iman lived with her grandparents during her formative years. At age four she was sent to boarding school in Egypt, where she spent most of her childhood and adolescence. Following political unrest in Somalia, Iman&#x27;s father moved the family back to the country. At his behest, she and her mother and siblings subsequently traveled to Kenya and were later joined by her father and younger sister. She briefly studied political science at the University of Nairobi in 1975.

==Career==
===Modeling===
While she was at university, Iman was discovered by American photographer Peter Beard, and moved to the United States to begin a modeling career. Her first modeling assignment was for &quot;Vogue&quot; a year later in 1976. She soon appeared on the cover of some of the world&#x27;s most prestigious magazines, establishing herself as a supermodel.

With her long neck, slender figure, fine features, and copper-toned skin, Iman was an instant success in the fashion world, though she herself insists that her looks are merely typically Somali. She became a muse to many prominent designers, including Halston, Gianni Versace, Calvin Klein, Issey Miyake and Donna Karan. She was a favourite of Yves Saint-Laurent, who once described her as his &quot;dream woman&quot;. Iman has worked with photographers including Helmut Newton, Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, and Annie Leibovitz.

Iman credits the nurturing she received from various designers with having given her the confidence to succeed in an era when individuality was valued and model-muses were often an integral part of the creative process. She is represented by TESS Management in London.

===Business===
After almost two decades of modeling, Iman started her own cosmetics firm in 1994, focusing on difficult-to-find shades for women. Based on her years of experience mixing her own formulations for make-up artists to use on her, she was closely involved with the final product and also acted as the commercial face of the company. Iman Cosmetics was a $25-million-a-year business by 2010. In early 2012, Iman signed fellow Somali designers Ayaan and Idyl Mohallim, founders of the Mataano fashion company, as brand ambassadors for her cosmetics line. In late 2021, Iman released her signature fragrance, &quot;Love Memoir&quot;. The color of the amber bottle is a nod to the sunsets she and her husband enjoyed. The shape of the bottle is a mimic of two stones, which references to a spiritual ritual where you place flat stones to guide people who come after you. The tradition is also connected to healing from grief. Iman has done this ritual around her and David&#x27;s property.
Iman appeared in two episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, playing Dakotah in &quot;Back in the World&quot; (1985) and Lois Blyth in &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; (1988). She also had a guest role as Mrs. Montgomery on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1985). In 1988, she appeared as Marie Babineaux in an episode of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. In the mid-2000s, Iman spent two years as the host of Bravo TV&#x27;s fashion-themed show, &quot;Project Runway Canada&quot;. In November 2010, along with her friend and colleague, designer Isaac Mizrahi, Iman also began hosting the second season of &quot;The Fashion Show&quot;. Bravo started the series to replace its former hit &quot;Project Runway&quot; that has now moved to the Lifetime network.

Iman first featured in the 1979 British film &quot;The Human Factor&quot;, and had a bit part in the 1985 Oscar-winning film &quot;Out of Africa&quot; starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. She then portrayed Nina Beka in the 1987 thriller &quot;No Way Out&quot; with Kevin Costner, and Hedy in the Michael Caine comedy &quot;Surrender&quot; the same year. During her first year in Hollywood, in 1991, she worked on several film productions. Among them were the Tim Hunter-directed &quot;Lies of the Twins&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, where she played a shapeshifting alien. In 1991, she appeared in &quot;The Linguini Incident&quot; opposite her then-fiancé David Bowie. She had a smaller part in the 1991 comedy &quot;House Party 2&quot; and in the 1994 comedy/romance film &quot;Exit to Eden&quot;.

===Video games===
Iman made a cameo appearance alongside her husband David Bowie in the 1999 Windows 9x and Dreamcast 3D adventure game &quot;&quot;, developed by the video game company Quantic Dream. In the game, she appears as one of the numerous Omikronian citizens the player can &quot;reincarnate&quot; into.

===Philanthropy===
In addition to running her global beauty company, Iman is also actively involved in a number of charitable endeavors. Since September 2019, Iman has held the role of CARE&#x27;s first-ever Global Advocate, where she works alongside CARE to support its mission to create a world where poverty has been overcome and all people live with dignity and security. She is also currently a spokesperson for the Keep a Child Alive program, and works closely with the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund. She also serves as an Ambassador for Save the Children, and has been active in raising awareness of their relief services in the greater East Africa region. Additionally, Iman works with the Enough Project to end the global trade in conflict minerals. She played a key part in the public campaign against blood diamonds through her termination of her contract with the diamonds conglomerate De Beers over a conflict of ethics.

==Awards==
Over the course of her long modeling and philanthropic career, Iman has received many awards. On 7 June 2010, she received a &quot;Fashion Icon&quot; lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), a special prize reserved for &quot;an individual whose signature style has had a profound influence on fashion&quot;. Iman selected her friend, actress and former model Isabella Rossellini, to present the award. Wearing a gown designed by Giambattista Valli with four giant diamond bracelets on each arm, Iman thanked her parents &quot;for giving me a neck longer than any other girl on any go-see anywhere in the world&quot;.

==Personal life==
Iman is a Muslim. She has credited her faith with helping her through dark times. She is fluent in five languages: Somali, Arabic, Italian, French, and English. She also obtained American citizenship when she was in her twenties.

Iman was first married at age 18 to Hassan, a young Somali entrepreneur and Hilton hotel executive. The marriage ended a few years later when she moved to the United States to pursue a modeling career. In 1977, Iman dated the American actor Warren Beatty. Later that year, she became engaged to the American basketball player Spencer Haywood, and they married soon after. Their daughter, Zulekha Haywood (from whom she has a granddaughter), was born in 1978; in February 1987, the couple divorced.

In 1990, Iman met the English musician David Bowie on a surprise blind date set up by a friend in Los Angeles. The friend was hairdresser Teddy Antolin, who invited Iman to a party. When she arrived at the restaurant, there were only four attendees: Antolin, Antolin&#x27;s boyfriend, Iman, and Bowie. At the end of the evening, Bowie offered to drive her home, and she said: &quot;No, I&#x27;m going to drive my car.&quot; He invited her to tea the next day and Iman learned he did not drink tea. They went to a nearby coffee shop. Bowie named his 1991 instrumental piece &quot;Abdulmajid&quot; after her, which was later converted into a symphony by Philip Glass.

On 24 April 1992, Iman married Bowie in a private ceremony in Lausanne, Switzerland. The wedding was solemnized in Florence, Italy on 6 June. Their daughter, Alexandria Zahra Jones, was born 15 August 2000 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Iman is also stepmother to Bowie&#x27;s son from a previous marriage, Duncan Jones. Both children bear Bowie&#x27;s legal surname. Iman and her family resided primarily in Manhattan and London. When Bowie died on 10 January 2016, she wrote in tribute to him that &quot;the struggle is real, but so is God&quot;.

<text>King Camp Gillette (January 5, 1855 – July 9, 1932) was an American businessman who invented a bestselling safety razor. Gillette&#x27;s innovation was the thin, inexpensive, disposable blade of stamped steel. Gillette is often erroneously credited with inventing the so-called razor and blades business model in which razors are sold cheaply to increase the market for blades. However, Gillette Safety Razor Company adopted the business model from its competitors.

== Biography ==
The Gillette paternal ancestors were French Huguenots who sought refuge in England in the late 16th century. One or two generations later, in 1630, Nathan Gillette sailed from England to the newly founded Massachusetts Bay Colony in North America.

King Camp Gillette was born on January 5, 1855, in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and raised in Chicago, Illinois. His family survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

While working as a salesman for the Crown Cork and Seal Company in the 1890s, Gillette saw bottle caps, with the cork seal he sold, thrown away after the bottle was opened. This made him recognize the value in basing a business on a product that was used a few times, then discarded. Men shaved with straight razors that needed sharpening every day using a leather strop. As existing, relatively expensive razor blades dulled quickly and needed continuous sharpening, a razor whose blade could be thrown away when it dulled would meet a real need and likely be profitable.

Safety razors had been developed in the mid-19th century, but still used a forged blade. In the 1870s, the Kampfe Brothers introduced a type of razor along these lines. Gillette improved these earlier safety-razor designs and introduced the high-profit-margin stamped razor blade made from carbon steel sheet. Gillette&#x27;s razor retailed for a substantial $5 (equivalent to $ in ) – half the average working man&#x27;s weekly pay – yet sold by the millions.

The most difficult part of development was engineering the blades, as thin, cheap steel was difficult to work and sharpen. This accounts for the delay between the initial idea and the product&#x27;s introduction. Steven Porter, a machinist working with Gillette, used Gillette&#x27;s drawings to create the first disposable razor blade that worked. William Emery Nickerson, an expert machinist and partner of Gillette, changed the original model, improving the handle and frame so that it could better support the thin steel blade. Nickerson designed the machinery to mass-produce the blades, and he received patents for hardening and sharpening the blades. (Nickerson was later elected to Gillette&#x27;s board of directors.)

To sell the product, Gillette founded the American Safety Razor Company on September 28, 1901 (changing the company&#x27;s name to Gillette Safety Razor Company in July 1902). Gillette obtained a trademark registration (0056921) for his portrait and signature on the packaging. Production began in 1903, when he sold a total of 51 razors and 168 blades.

The second year, he sold 90,884 razors and 123,648 blades, thanks in part to Gillette&#x27;s low prices, automated manufacturing techniques, and good advertising. Sales and distribution were handled by a separate company, Townsend and Hunt, which was absorbed by the parent company for US$300,000 in 1906. By 1908, the corporation had established manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, Britain, France, and Germany. Razor sales reached 450,000 units and blade sales exceeded 70 million units in 1915. In 1917, when the U.S. entered World War I, the company provided all American soldiers with a field razor set, paid for by the government. Gillette vetoed a plan to sell the patent rights in Europe, believing correctly that Europe would eventually provide a very large market. Gillette and John Joyce, a fellow director, battled for control of the company. Gillette eventually sold out to Joyce, but his name remained on the brand. In the 1920s, as the patent expired, the Gillette Safety Razor Company emphasized research to design ever-improved models, realizing that even a slight improvement would induce men to adopt it.

He was almost bankrupt due to spending large amounts of money on property, and to his having lost much of the value of his corporate shares as a result of the Great Depression.

Gillette died on July 9, 1932, in Los Angeles, California. He was interred in the lower levels of the Begonia Corridor in the Great Mausoleum located at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

== Personal life ==

Gillette was also a Utopian Socialist. He published a book titled &quot;The Human Drift&quot; (1894) which advocated that all industry should be taken over by a single corporation owned by the public, and that everyone in the US should live in a giant city called Metropolis powered by Niagara Falls. A later book, &quot;World Corporation&quot; (1910) was a prospectus for a company set up to create this vision. He offered Theodore Roosevelt the presidency of the company, with a fee of one million dollars. (Roosevelt declined the offer.) Gillette&#x27;s last book, &quot;The People&#x27;s Corporation&quot; (1924), was written with Upton Sinclair and later inspired Glen H. Taylor.
Gillette was initiated to the York Rite of Freemasonry, till his elevation to the highest degree of Grand Master.

Gillette married Alanta &quot;Lantie&quot; Ella Gaines (1868–1951) in 1890. They had one child, King Gaines Gillette (1891–1955).

In his later life he traveled extensively and was universally recognized from his picture on the packets of razor blades. People were surprised that he was a real person rather than just a marketing image. A Gillette company history stated that in non-English speaking countries people would often ask for blades of &quot;the kind with the Man&#x27;s Face&quot;.

Around 1922 or 1923, he built a residence at 324 West Overlook Road, in &quot;The Mesa&quot; district of Palm Springs, consisting of a main home and guest house. The homes, sitting on of land, are what remain of the original estate.

== Legacy ==
The company continues in the present day as the Gillette brand of Procter &amp; Gamble.

Gillette is widely credited with creating the &quot;razor-razor blade business model&quot;. Some peers in the marketing industry quote him as one of the innovators who revolutionized the freebie marketing ideas. The Gillette Company continued to thrive and sell products under a variety of brand names including Gillette, Braun, Oral-B, and Duracell. In 2005, the Gillette company was sold to Procter &amp; Gamble for US$57 billion. It is now known as Global Blades &amp; Razors, with the Gillette brand, a business unit of Procter &amp; Gamble.

=== King Gillette Ranch ===

King Gillette purchased property for a large ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains near Calabasas in Southern California in 1926. The master plan and new buildings on the ranch were designed and built for Gillette in the late 1920s by renowned architect Wallace Neff. The architectural style was Spanish Colonial Revival. After his death, his wife sold the home to Clarence Brown, an MGM film director who held A-List Hollywood parties at the ranch. In 1952, Bob Hope bought the property, immediately giving it to the Claretian Order of the Catholic Church, which operated a seminary on the grounds for 25 years. In 1970 Thomas Aquinas College rented the property from the Claretian Order before later moving their campus to Santa Paula in 1977. Elizabeth Clare Prophet, founder of the Church Universal and Triumphant, purchased the property in 1978, and ran her New Age church at the site until 1986 when Soka University of America (SUA) bought the land.

In 1990, SUA announced plans to build a future liberal arts college on campus and plans to expand the facility over the next 25 years to an enrollment of as many as 5,000 students. SUA began making plans to expand the campus infrastructure to accommodate living quarters and classrooms for the proposed expansion, but ran into opposition from some local residents, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, environmentalists, and government representatives. Opponents sought to protect the Chumash ancestral site, the natural habitats and ecology, and the expansive open space viewshed within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and to prevent a development of unprecedented urban density adjacent to Malibu Creek State Park.

In 1992, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA), a joint-powers authority associated with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, resorted to its powers of eminent domain to condemn the core parcel comprising the university and thereby halted SUA&#x27;s plans for expansion. SUA appealed the eminent domain action. The legal debate continued for the remainder of the decade. Soka University was prevented from developing any expansion plans at the Calabasas property and began looking for alternative sites to build a larger campus.

After the university moved to a purpose-built campus, the King Gillette ranch was collaboratively purchased for $35 million by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, National Park Service, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and California State Parks, who then made it available for public use. Those agencies are also funding an $8.4 million visitor&#x27;s center on the property.
On June 30, 2007, the King Gillette Ranch opened to the public as a park. The ranch is situated adjacent to Malibu Creek State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains, at 26800 West Mulholland Highway in Calabasas, California.

Since 2008, the ranch has been used for the NBC reality show &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;. The ranch was also featured in the 2019 &quot;Ratched&quot; Netflix series and in the 2021 &quot;The Starling&quot; movie with Melissa McCarthy.

<doc id="223789" wikidata="Q842829" url="?curid=223789" title="Svalbard and Jan Mayen">
<text>Svalbard and Jan Mayen (, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: SJ, ISO 3166-1 alpha-3: SJM, ISO 3166-1 numeric: 744) is a statistical designation defined by ISO 3166-1 for a collective grouping of two remote jurisdictions of Norway: Svalbard and Jan Mayen. While the two are combined for the purposes of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) category, they are not administratively related. This has further resulted in the country code top-level domain being issued for Svalbard and Jan Mayen, and ISO 3166-2:SJ. The United Nations Statistics Division also uses this code, but has named it the Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands.

Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean under the sovereignty of Norway, but is subject to the special status granted by the Svalbard Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administered by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. 

While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.

== Constituents ==
=== Svalbard ===


Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic about midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. The group of islands range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The area is and there were 2,595 residents in September 2024 Spitsbergen is the largest island, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. The administrative center is Longyearbyen, and other settlements, in addition to research outposts, are the Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research community of Ny-Ålesund and the mining outpost of Sveagruva.

The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 &quot;Svalbard Act&quot; made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. The archipelago is administered by the Governor of Svalbard, which is subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security. Unlike the rest of Norway (including Jan Mayen), Svalbard is a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone, and is not part of the Schengen Area nor the European Economic Area.

=== Jan Mayen ===
Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean located at the border of the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea. The single island covers an area of and is dominated by the tall Beerenberg volcano. The island&#x27;s only population is a combined military and meteorological outpost that operated a LORAN-C transmitter at Olonkinbyen. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute annexed the island for Norway in 1922. On 27 February 1930, the island was made de jure a part of the Kingdom of Norway. Since 1994, the island has been administered by the County Governor of Nordland, with some authority delegated to the station commander. Before 1994, the Governor of Svalbard administered Jan Mayen.

== Application ==
The ISO designation is congruent with an equivalent United Nations Statistics Division category and users of these classification systems may in some cases report separately for &quot;Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands&quot; instead of rolling up this information into the &quot;Norway&quot; category. Neither Svalbard nor Jan Mayen have their own flag or coat of arms, and the flag of Norway is used for both of them, both alone and as a group.

An attempt to change the ISO code to just &quot;Svalbard&quot; has previously failed because of opposition from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, for statistics use within population and trade, &quot;Svalbard and Jan Mayen&quot; essentially means just &quot;Svalbard&quot;.

=== ISO 3166-2 ===
ISO 3166-2:SJ is the entry for Svalbard and Jan Mayen in ISO 3166-2, a system for assigning codes to subnational administrative divisions. However, further subdivision for Svalbard and Jan Mayen occurs under Norway&#x27;s entry, ISO 3166-2:NO:
* Svalbard
* Jan Mayen

The hierarchical administrative subdivision codes for Svalbard is SJ.SV and for Jan Mayen is SJ.JM.

=== Top-level domain ===
By virtue of the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code codice_1, Svalbard and Jan Mayen were grouped together and allocated the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) . Norid, who also administered the Norway&#x27;s ccTLD, was given the responsibility for the .sj and Bouvet Island&#x27;s domain in 1997. Policy prohibits any registration with either of the domains, as institutions connected to Svalbard can use the domain. Norwegian authorities do not want to commercialize the domain resources, and therefore will not be sold to a third party.

<text>In cryptography, a public key certificate, also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate, is an electronic document used to prove the validity of a public key. The certificate includes the public key and information about it, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate&#x27;s contents (called the issuer). If the device examining the certificate trusts the issuer and finds the signature to be a valid signature of that issuer, then it can use the included public key to communicate securely with the certificate&#x27;s subject. In email encryption, code signing, and e-signature systems, a certificate&#x27;s subject is typically a person or organization. However, in Transport Layer Security (TLS) a certificate&#x27;s subject is typically a computer or other device, though TLS certificates may identify organizations or individuals in addition to their core role in identifying devices. TLS, sometimes called by its older name Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is notable for being a part of HTTPS, a protocol for securely browsing the web.

In a typical public-key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the certificate issuer is a certificate authority (CA), usually a company that charges customers a fee to issue certificates for them. By contrast, in a web of trust scheme, individuals sign each other&#x27;s keys directly, in a format that performs a similar function to a public key certificate. In case of key compromise, a certificate may need to be revoked.

The most common format for public key certificates is defined by X.509. Because X.509 is very general, the format is further constrained by profiles defined for certain use cases, such as Public Key Infrastructure (X.509) as defined in .

== Types of certificate ==


=== TLS/SSL server certificate ===
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol – as well as its outdated predecessor, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol – ensures that the communication between a client computer and a server is secure. The protocol requires the server to present a digital certificate, proving that it is the intended destination. The connecting client conducts certification path validation, ensuring that:
# The subject of the certificate matches the hostname (not to be confused with the domain name) to which the client is trying to connect.
# A trusted certificate authority has signed the certificate.
The &quot;Subject&quot; field of the certificate must identify the primary hostname of the server as the &quot;Common Name&quot;. The hostname must be publicly accessible, not using private addresses or reserved domains. A certificate may be valid for multiple hostnames (e.g., a domain and its subdomains). Such certificates are commonly called &quot;Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificates&quot; or &quot;Unified Communications Certificates (UCC)&quot;. These certificates contain the Subject Alternative Name field, though many CAs also put them into the &quot;Subject Common Name&quot; field for backward compatibility. If some of the hostnames contain an asterisk (*), a certificate may also be called a wildcard certificate.

Once the certification path validation is successful, the client can establish an encrypted connection with the server.

Internet-facing servers, such as public web servers, must obtain their certificates from a trusted, public certificate authority (CA).

=== TLS/SSL client certificate ===
Client certificates authenticate the client connecting to a TLS service, for instance to provide access control. Because most services provide access to individuals, rather than devices, most client certificates contain an email address or personal name rather than a hostname. In addition, the certificate authority that issues the client certificate is usually the service provider to which client connects because it is the provider that needs to perform authentication. Some service providers even offer free SSL certificates as part of their packages.

While most web browsers support client certificates, the most common form of authentication on the Internet is a username and password pair. Client certificates are more common in virtual private networks (VPN) and Remote Desktop Services, where they authenticate devices.

=== Email certificate ===
In accordance with the S/MIME protocol, email certificates can both establish the message integrity and encrypt messages. To establish encrypted email communication, the communicating parties must have their digital certificates in advance. Each must send the other one digitally signed email and opt to import the sender&#x27;s certificate.

Some publicly trusted certificate authorities provide email certificates, but more commonly S/MIME is used when communicating within a given organization, and that organization runs its own CA, which is trusted by participants in that email system.

=== Self-signed and root certificates ===
A self-signed certificate is a certificate with a subject that matches its issuer, and a signature that can be verified by its own public key.

Self-signed certificates have their own limited uses. They have full trust value when the issuer and the sole user are the same entity. For example, the Encrypting File System on Microsoft Windows issues a self-signed certificate on behalf of the encrypting user and uses it to transparently decrypt data on the fly. The digital certificate chain of trust starts with a self-signed certificate, called a &quot;root certificate&quot;, &quot;trust anchor&quot;, or &quot;trust root&quot;. A certificate authority self-signs a root certificate to be able to sign other certificates.

An intermediate certificate has a similar purpose to the root certificate – its only use is to sign other certificates. However, an intermediate certificate is not self-signed. A root certificate or another intermediate certificate needs to sign it. 

An end-entity or leaf certificate is any certificate that cannot sign other certificates. For instance, TLS/SSL server and client certificates, email certificates, code signing certificates, and qualified certificates are all end-entity certificates.

=== Subject Alternative Name certificate ===

Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificates are an extension to X.509 that allows various values to be associated with a security certificate using a codice_1 field. These values are called &quot;Subject Alternative Names&quot; (SANs). Names include:

* Email addresses
* IP addresses
* URIs
* DNS names: this is usually also provided as the Common Name RDN within the Subject field of the main certificate.
* Directory names: alternative Distinguished Names to that given in the Subject.
* Other names, given as a &quot;General Name&quot; or &quot;Universal Principal Name&quot;: a registered object identifier followed by a value.

 (May 2000) specifies Subject Alternative Names as the preferred method of adding DNS names to certificates, deprecating the previous method of putting DNS names in the codice_2 field. Google Chrome version 58 (March 2017) removed support for checking the codice_2 field at all, instead only looking at the SANs.

As shown in the picture of Wikimedia&#x27;s section on the right, the SAN field can contain wildcards. Not all vendors support or endorse mixing wildcards into SAN certificates.

===Wildcard certificate===
A public key certificate which uses an asterisk (the wildcard) in its domain name fragment is called a Wildcard certificate.
Through the use of , a single certificate may be used for multiple sub-domains. It is commonly used for transport layer security in computer networking.

For example, a single wildcard certificate for will secure all these subdomains on the domain:
* 
* 

Instead of getting separate certificates for subdomains, you can use a single certificate for all main domains and subdomains and reduce cost. 

Because the wildcard only covers one level of subdomains (the asterisk doesn&#x27;t match full stops), these domains would not be valid for the certificates:
* 
Note possible exceptions by CAs, for example wildcard-plus cert by DigiCert contains an automatic &quot;Plus&quot; property for the naked domain .

====Limitations====
Only a single level of subdomain matching is supported in accordance with .

It is not possible to get a wildcard for an Extended Validation Certificate. A workaround could be to add every virtual host name in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension, the major problem being that the certificate needs to be reissued whenever a new virtual server is added. (See &quot;Transport Layer Security § Support for name-based virtual servers&quot; for more information.)

Wildcards can be added as domains in multi-domain certificates or Unified Communications Certificates (UCC). In addition, wildcards themselves can have extensions, including other wildcards. For example, the wildcard certificate has as a Subject Alternative Name. Thus it secures as well as the completely different website name .

 argues against wildcard certificates on security grounds, in particular &quot;partial wildcards&quot;.

====Further examples====
The wildcard applies only to one level of the domain name. matches but not and not 

The wildcard may appear anywhere inside a label as a &quot;partial wildcard&quot; according to early specifications

: is OK. It will match but not 

: is OK and matches 
: is OK and matches 
: is OK and matches 

However, use of &quot;partial-wildcard&quot; certs is not recommended. As of 2011, partial wildcard support is optional, and is explicitly disallowed in SubjectAltName headers that are required for multi-name certificates. All major browsers have deliberately removed support for partial-wildcard certificates; they will result in a &quot;SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN&quot; error. Similarly, it is typical for standard libraries in programming languages to not support &quot;partial-wildcard&quot; certificates. For example, any &quot;partial-wildcard&quot; certificate will not work with the latest versions of both Python and Go. Thus, 

Do not allow a label that consists entirely of just a wildcard unless it is the left-most label
:&quot;&quot; is not allowed.

A cert with multiple wildcards in a name is not allowed.

A cert with plus a top-level domain is not allowed.

Too general and should not be allowed.

International domain names encoded in ASCII (A-label) are labels that are ASCII-encoded and begin with . URLs with international labels cannot contain wildcards.
: is 
: is not allowed
: is allowed

=== Other certificates ===

* EMV certificate: EMV is a payment method based on a technical standard for payment cards, payment terminals and automated teller machines (ATM). EMV payment cards are preloaded with a card issuer certificate, signed by the EMV certificate authority to validate authenticity of the payment card during the payment transaction.
* Code-signing certificate: Certificates can validate apps (or their binaries) to ensure they were not tampered with during delivery.
* Qualified certificate: A certificate identifying an individual, typically for electronic signature purposes. These are most commonly used in Europe, where the eIDAS regulation standardizes them and requires their recognition.
* Role-based certificate: Defined in the &quot;X.509 Certificate Policy for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)&quot;, role-based certificates &quot;identify a specific role on behalf of which the subscriber is authorized to act rather than the subscriber’s name and are issued in the interest of supporting accepted business practices.&quot;
* Group certificate: Defined in the &quot;X.509 Certificate Policy for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)&quot;, for &quot;cases where there are several entities acting in one capacity, and where non-repudiation for transactions is not desired.&quot;

==Common fields==
These are some of the most common fields in certificates. Most certificates contain a number of fields not listed here. Note that in terms of a certificate&#x27;s X.509 representation, a certificate is not &quot;flat&quot; but contains these fields nested in various structures within the certificate.
* &quot;Serial Number&quot;: Used to uniquely identify the certificate within a CA&#x27;s systems. In particular this is used to track revocation information.
* &quot;Subject&quot;: The entity a certificate belongs to: a machine, an individual, or an organization.
* &quot;Issuer&quot;: The entity that verified the information and signed the certificate.
* &quot;Not Before&quot;: The earliest time and date on which the certificate is valid. Usually set to a few hours or days prior to the moment the certificate was issued, to avoid clock skew problems.
* &quot;Not After&quot;: The time and date past which the certificate is no longer valid.
* &quot;Key Usage&quot;: The valid cryptographic uses of the certificate&#x27;s public key. Common values include digital signature validation, key encipherment, and certificate signing.
* &quot;Extended Key Usage&quot;: The applications in which the certificate may be used. Common values include TLS server authentication, email protection, and code signing.
* &quot;Public Key&quot;: A public key belonging to the certificate subject.
* &quot;Signature Algorithm&quot;: This contain a hashing algorithm and a digital signature algorithm. For example &quot;sha256RSA&quot; where sha256 is the hashing algorithm and RSA is the signature algorithm.
* &quot;Signature&quot;: The body of the certificate is hashed (hashing algorithm in &quot;Signature Algorithm&quot; field is used) and then the hash is signed (signature algorithm in the &quot;Signature Algorithm&quot; field is used) with the issuer&#x27;s private key.

===Example===
This is an example of a decoded SSL/TLS certificate retrieved from SSL.com&#x27;s website. The issuer&#x27;s common name (CN) is shown as codice_4, identifying this as an Extended Validation (EV) certificate. Validated information about the website&#x27;s owner (SSL Corp) is located in the codice_5 field. The codice_6 field contains a list of domain names covered by the certificate. The codice_7 and codice_8 fields show all appropriate uses.


==Usage in the European Union==
In the European Union, (advanced) electronic signatures on legal documents are commonly performed using digital signatures with accompanying identity certificates. However, only qualified electronic signatures (which require using a qualified trust service provider and signature creation device) are given the same power as a physical signature.

==Certificate authorities==
In the X.509 trust model, a certificate authority (CA) is responsible for signing certificates. These certificates act as an introduction between two parties, which means that a CA acts as a trusted third party. A CA processes requests from people or organizations requesting certificates (called subscribers), verifies the information, and potentially signs an end-entity certificate based on that information. To perform this role effectively, a CA needs to have one or more broadly trusted root certificates or intermediate certificates and the corresponding private keys. CAs may achieve this broad trust by having their root certificates included in popular software, or by obtaining a cross-signature from another CA delegating trust. Other CAs are trusted within a relatively small community, like a business, and are distributed by other mechanisms like Windows Group Policy.

Certificate authorities are also responsible for maintaining up-to-date revocation information about certificates they have issued, indicating whether certificates are still valid. They provide this information through Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and/or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). Some of the larger certificate authorities in the market include IdenTrust, DigiCert, and Sectigo.

== Root programs ==
Some major software contain a list of certificate authorities that are trusted by default. This makes it easier for end-users to validate certificates, and easier for people or organizations that request certificates to know which certificate authorities can issue a certificate that will be broadly trusted. This is particularly important in HTTPS, where a web site operator generally wants to get a certificate that is trusted by nearly all potential visitors to their web site.

The policies and processes a provider uses to decide which certificate authorities their software should trust are called root programs. The most influential root programs are:
* Microsoft Root Program
* Apple Root Program
* Mozilla Root Program
* Oracle Java root program
* Adobe AATL Adobe Approved Trust List and EUTL root programs (used for document signing)

Browsers other than Firefox generally use the operating system&#x27;s facilities to decide which certificate authorities are trusted. So, for instance, Chrome on Windows trusts the certificate authorities included in the Microsoft Root Program, while on macOS or iOS, Chrome trusts the certificate authorities in the Apple Root Program. Edge and Safari use their respective operating system trust stores as well, but each is only available on a single OS. Firefox uses the Mozilla Root Program trust store on all platforms.

The Mozilla Root Program is operated publicly, and its certificate list is part of the open source Firefox web browser, so it is broadly used outside Firefox. For instance, while there is no common Linux Root Program, many Linux distributions, like Debian, include a package that periodically copies the contents of the Firefox trust list, which is then used by applications.

Root programs generally provide a set of valid purposes with the certificates they include. For instance, some CAs may be considered trusted for issuing TLS server certificates, but not for code signing certificates. This is indicated with a set of trust bits in a root certificate storage system.

==Revocation==

A certificate may be revoked before it expires, which signals that it is no longer valid. Without revocation, an attacker would be able to exploit such a compromised or misissued certificate until expiry. Hence, revocation is an important part of a public key infrastructure. Revocation is performed by the issuing certificate authority, which produces a cryptographically authenticated statement of revocation.

For distributing revocation information to clients, timeliness of the discovery of revocation (and hence the window for an attacker to exploit a compromised certificate) trades off against resource usage in querying revocation statuses and privacy concerns. If revocation information is unavailable (either due to accident or an attack), clients must decide whether to &quot;fail-hard&quot; and treat a certificate as if it is revoked (and so degrade availability) or to &quot;fail-soft&quot; and treat it as unrevoked (and allow attackers to sidestep revocation).

Due to the cost of revocation checks and the availability impact from potentially-unreliable remote services, Web browsers limit the revocation checks they will perform, and will fail-soft where they do. Certificate revocation lists are too bandwidth-costly for routine use, and the Online Certificate Status Protocol presents connection latency and privacy issues. Other schemes have been proposed but have not yet been successfully deployed to enable fail-hard checking.

==Website security==

The most common use of certificates is for HTTPS-based web sites. A web browser validates that an HTTPS web server is authentic, so that the user can feel secure that his/her interaction with the web site has no eavesdroppers and that the web site is who it claims to be. This security is important for electronic commerce. In practice, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site.

As an example, when a user connects to codice_9 with their browser, if the browser does not give any certificate warning message, then the user can be theoretically sure that interacting with codice_9 is equivalent to interacting with the entity in contact with the email address listed in the public registrar under &quot;example.com&quot;, even though that email address may not be displayed anywhere on the web site. No other surety of any kind is implied. Further, the relationship between the purchaser of the certificate, the operator of the web site, and the generator of the web site content may be tenuous and is not guaranteed. At best, the certificate guarantees uniqueness of the web site, provided that the web site itself has not been compromised (hacked) or the certificate issuing process subverted.

A certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor. In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation. These rigors are loosely agreed upon by voluntary participants in the CA/Browser Forum.

=== Validation levels ===

====Domain validation====

A certificate provider will issue a domain-validated (DV) certificate to a purchaser if the purchaser can demonstrate one vetting criterion: the right to administratively manage the affected DNS domain(s).

====Organization validation====

A certificate provider will issue an organization validation (OV) class certificate to a purchaser if the purchaser can meet two criteria: the right to administratively manage the domain name in question, and perhaps, the organization&#x27;s actual existence as a legal entity. A certificate provider publishes its OV vetting criteria through its certificate policy.

====Extended validation====

To acquire an Extended Validation (EV) certificate, the purchaser must persuade the certificate provider of its legal identity, including manual verification checks by a human. As with OV certificates, a certificate provider publishes its EV vetting criteria through its certificate policy.

Until 2019, major browsers such as Chrome and Firefox generally offered users a visual indication of the legal identity when a site presented an EV certificate. This was done by showing the legal name before the domain, and a bright green color to highlight the change. Most browsers deprecated this feature providing no visual difference to the user on the type of certificate used. This change followed security concerns raised by forensic experts and successful attempts to purchase EV certificates to impersonate famous organizations, proving the inefficiency of these visual indicators and highlighting potential abuses.

===Weaknesses===

A web browser will give no warning to the user if a web site suddenly presents a different certificate, even if that certificate has a lower number of key bits, even if it has a different provider, and even if the previous certificate had an expiry date far into the future. Where certificate providers are under the jurisdiction of governments, those governments may have the freedom to order the provider to generate any certificate, such as for the purposes of law enforcement. Subsidiary wholesale certificate providers also have the freedom to generate any certificate.

All web browsers come with an extensive built-in list of trusted root certificates, many of which are controlled by organizations that may be unfamiliar to the user. Each of these organizations is free to issue any certificate for any web site and have the guarantee that web browsers that include its root certificates will accept it as genuine. In this instance, end users must rely on the developer of the browser software to manage its built-in list of certificates and on the certificate providers to behave correctly and to inform the browser developer of problematic certificates. While uncommon, there have been incidents in which fraudulent certificates have been issued: in some cases, the browsers have detected the fraud; in others, some time passed before browser developers removed these certificates from their software.

The list of built-in certificates is also not limited to those provided by the browser developer: users (and to a degree applications) are free to extend the list for special purposes such as for company intranets. This means that if someone gains access to a machine and can install a new root certificate in the browser, that browser will recognize websites that use the inserted certificate as legitimate.

For provable security, this reliance on something external to the system has the consequence that any public key certification scheme has to rely on some special setup assumption, such as the existence of a certificate authority.

===Usefulness versus unsecured web sites===

In spite of the limitations described above, certificate-authenticated TLS is considered mandatory by all security guidelines whenever a web site hosts confidential information or performs material transactions. This is because, in practice, in spite of the weaknesses described above, web sites secured by public key certificates are still more secure than unsecured http:// web sites.

<doc id="223797" wikidata="Q1200918" url="?curid=223797" title="Trapeze">
<text>A trapeze is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes, metal straps, or chains, from a ceiling support. It is an aerial apparatus commonly found in circus performances. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act.

The name of the apparatus reflects the trapezoid shape made by the horizontal bar, ropes and ceiling support.

==History==
The art of trapeze performance is reported to have been developed by Jules Léotard, a young French acrobat and aerialist, in Toulouse in the mid-19th century. He is said to have used his father&#x27;s swimming pool to practice. However, the name &quot;trapeze&quot; can be found in books dating as far back as twenty years earlier, before Léotard was born. One such example is George Roland&#x27;s “An Introductory Course of Modern Gymnastic Exercises”, published in 1832. Roland proposes the idea that the trapeze might owe its origin to Colonel Amoros, but ultimately deems the question of origin &quot;unimportant to the present subject&quot;.

The name was applied in French () from the resemblance of the apparatus to a trapezium or irregular four-sided figure.

==Types of trapeze==
* &quot;Static trapeze&quot; refers to a trapeze act in which the performer moves around the bar and ropes, performing a wide range of movements including balances, drops, hangs while the bar itself stays generally static. The difficulty on a static trapeze is making every move look effortless. It is like dance, in that most people of a reasonable level of strength can get onto the trapeze bar for the first time and perform some basic tricks, but an experienced artist will do them with much more grace and style.
* &quot;Swinging trapeze&quot; (or &quot;swinging single trapeze&quot;) refers to an act performed on a trapeze swinging in a forward–backward motion. The performer builds up swing from a still position, and uses the momentum of the swing to execute the tricks. Usually tricks on a swinging trapeze are thrown on the peaks of the swing and involve dynamic movements that require precise timing. Most of the tricks begin with the performer sitting or standing on the bar and end with the performer catching the bar in his/her hands or in an ankle hang (hanging by the ankles by bracing them between the rope and the bar). This act requires a great deal of strength, grace, and flexibility. The trapeze bar is weighted and often has cable inside the supporting ropes for extra strength to withstand the dynamic forces of the swing.
* &quot;Flying trapeze&quot; refers to a trapeze act where a performer, or &quot;flier,&quot; grabs the trapeze bar and jumps off a high platform, or pedestal board, so that gravity creates the swing. The swing&#x27;s parts are the &quot;force out&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;cast out&quot;) at the far end of the first swing, the beat back and the rise (also known as &quot;seven&quot;) as the performer swings back above the pedestal board, and then the trick is thrown at the far end of the second swing. The performer often releases the bar and is caught by another performer, the &quot;catcher,&quot; who hangs by their knees on another trapeze, or sometimes on a cradle, which can be either stationary or also swinging. People of any size are able to execute basic trapeze maneuvers. Flying trapeze is generally done over a net, or occasionally over water. However, some smaller rigs, usually created for teaching purposes, use mats instead of a net.
In the UK, many outdoor education centres offer an activity known as &#x27;leap of faith&#x27;. This activity invites participants to climb to the top of a narrow pole and jump, arms outstretched, to grab a trapeze bar. Similar to the flying trapeze, gravity creates the swing. In this type of activity, participants are attached via rope and harness and an added challenge to get your legs over the trapeze can be included.
* &quot;Washington trapeze&quot; (also known as &quot;head trapeze&quot; or &quot;heavy trapeze&quot;) refers to a variation on static and swinging trapeze where the aerialist performs various headstand skills on the bar, which is typically much heavier than a normal trapeze bar and has a small (about 4-inch round) headstand platform on it. The trapeze is supported by wire cables rather than ropes, and the apparatus will often be lifted and lowered during the act.
* &quot;Dance trapeze&quot; (also known as &quot;single-point trapeze&quot;) refers to a trapeze used by many modern dance companies in aerial dance. The ropes of the trapeze are often both attached to a single swivel, allowing the trapeze to spin in either small or large circles.
* &quot;Double trapeze&quot; (also known as the &quot;French trapeze&quot;) is a variation on the static trapeze, and features two performers working together on the same trapeze to perform figures and bear each other&#x27;s weight. It can also be performed swinging, in which case the act is called &quot;swinging double trapeze&quot;.

* &quot;Multiple trapeze&quot; refers to a number of different shapes and sizes of trapeze, including &quot;double trapeze&quot;, &quot;triple trapeze&quot; and larger multiples designed for use by multiple simultaneous flyers. &quot;Shaped trapezes&quot; are apparatuses that can take virtually any shape imaginable.
* &quot;Duplex trapeze&quot; refers to any trapeze with two layers of hand bars, one on top of the other, such that acrobats can jump from the upper bar and land (or be caught by a catcher) on the lower.

<text>Chendamangalam (or Chennamangalam) is a small town and a panchayat in Paravur Taluk, Ernakulam district in the state of Kerala, India.

==Location==
It is about 23 km from Ernakulam. It has three rivers, seven inlets, hillocks and large expanses of green plain. The historic city of Kodungallur is about 9 km from the village.

==Attractions==
The Paliam Palace, residence of the Paliath Achans, hereditary Prime Ministers and Raja under the former Maharajas of Kochi, is one of the architectural splendours of Kerala. The Palace is over 450 years old and houses a collection of historic documents and relics.

==History==
The hillocks at Kottayil Kovilakam are unique as the site of a Hindu temple, a Syrian Christian church, a mosque and a restored Jewish synagogue, all within 1 km of each other. The synagogue was built in 1614 AD and is in a peaceful wooded area. In the courtyard behind the synagogue, it is possible to find old Jewish graves, including one of a Jewish woman, dated 1264 AD.

The Jews arrived in Chendamangalam after the destruction of the second temple and the final desolation of Jerusalem in (AD 69) and founded a colony. They moved to Fort Kochi in 1341 AD after the Great flood. All the 8 synagogues in Kerala built during the recent centuries — located at Chendamangalam, Paravoor, Mala, Kochi and Ernakulam — have similar traditional architectural features: 
* a central bimah of brass or silver metal on a concrete or stone base
* an ark on the western wall
* a balcony above the eastern entry to the sanctuary that is used by the reader on certain holidays. 
* a women&#x27;s gallery behind the balcony, with a stairway leading up to it, usually from outside the building.

Also here are remains of the Vypeenakotta Seminary built for Syrians in the 16th century by the Portuguese. Adjacent to the seminary is an old Syrian Catholic Church built in 1201. It is also the site of the first printing press in India.

Chendamangalam was part of Kanayanur taluk, of the erstwhile Cochin State. The panchayat was formed in 1914. Bordered by rivers on the north, east and south, it is a meeting place of cultural diversity. Jews, Christians, Muslims and several of the distinct Hindu castes lived here harmoniously. The presence of immigrant communities like Konkinis (Gowda Saraswatha Brahmins) Moopans (Kudumbis) and the craftsmen categories viz. Kallasari (masons), Marassari (carpenters), Moosari (moulders), Kollan (blacksmiths), Thattan (goldsmiths), Chalian (weavers), and Kusavan (potters) to this day reminds of past industrial and business importance.

The Jewish community migrated to Israel in the 1950s and 1960s. Their synagogue is presently maintained by the archaeology department. There is also an abandoned Jewish cemetery behind the mosque, about 400 m from the synagogue, which has not been restored yet.

Mar Sleeva Church was established in 1075. The special fortified construction of the old block of the church is believed to have been constructed at the time of Tippu Sultan&#x27;s invasion of Malabar.

Paliyam Satyagraha resulted in the temple entry proclamation in Cochin State. Mattachanda (Barter Market), an annual fair conducted every year on the eve of Vishu, is reminiscent of past history when people came from near and far to buy their domestic needs such as food ingredients, condiments, cutlery, pottery and furniture in exchange for their agricultural produce or hand made products, even though now all transactions are in cash.

The Paliam kovilakam of the Paliath Achan&#x27;s, the hereditary Prime ministers and Raja under the Maharaja of Cochin lies here.

<doc id="223819" wikidata="Q3234742" url="?curid=223819" title="Auf Wiedersehen, Pet">
<text>Auf Wiedersehen, Pet () is a British comedy-drama television programme about seven British construction workers who leave the United Kingdom to search for employment overseas. In the first series, the men live and work on a building site in Düsseldorf. The series was created by Franc Roddam after an idea from Mick Connell, a bricklayer from Stockton-on-Tees, and mostly written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who also wrote &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; and &quot;Porridge&quot;. It starred Tim Healy, Kevin Whately, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Christopher Fairbank, Pat Roach and Gary Holton, with Noel Clarke replacing Holton for series three and four and the two-part finale. The series were broadcast on ITV in 1983–1984 and 1986. After a sixteen-year gap, two series and a Christmas special were shown on BBC One in 2002 and 2004.

In 2000, series 1, set in Germany, was ranked number 46 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in a list compiled by the British Film Institute. In 2015, the 1980s series was voted ITV&#x27;s Favourite TV Programme of all Time in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers&#x27; poll in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the station. The show was the subject of the first episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Drama Connections&quot; in 2005.

==Series 1: 1983–1984==
The first series, co-produced by Witzend Productions and Central Television for ITV in 1983, is the story of seven out-of-work construction workers from various parts of England who are forced to look for work in West Germany as a result of the recession and high unemployment of the early 1980s, although its initial emphasis is on three bricklayers from Newcastle upon Tyne making the journey to Germany, with the others being introduced along the way. (The title refers to their farewells to their wives and girlfriends – &quot;Auf Wiedersehen&quot; being German for &quot;Farewell&quot; or &quot;Goodbye&quot;, or more literally &quot;See you later&quot;, and &quot;Pet&quot; being a North-East English term of endearment.)

They find work on a German building site in Düsseldorf but, despite promises of hostel accommodation, are forced to live in a small hut that reminds them of a World War II POW camp. The rest of the series is driven by the interactions and growing friendships between the various characters. Barry (Timothy Spall), a &quot;spark&quot; from the Black Country, is an obsessive bore; Neville (Kevin Whately), one of the Geordie &quot;brickies&quot;, is an insecure young newlywed; fellow Geordie Oz (Jimmy Nail), another bricklayer, is aggressive and jingoistic; and London &quot;chippy&quot; Wayne (Gary Holton) is a womaniser. Dennis (Tim Healy) is another Geordie bricklayer who, being older, more experienced and generally more mature than the others, becomes the de facto leader of the group. Bristolian &quot;brickie&quot; and wrestler Bomber (Pat Roach) being the oldest is usually the calmest and sense of reason in the group; Scouse ex-con plasterer Moxey (Fairbank) is a jittery, recidivist arsonist. Over the course of 13 episodes the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; enjoy comic, dramatic, and romantic adventures, until a change in German tax laws forces them to return home.

The &quot;building site&quot; used for most of the filming was a set created on the backlot of the former ATV Elstree Studios at Borehamwood in Hertfordshire (then owned by Central). After its sale to the BBC in 1984, the &quot;Albert Square&quot; set of &quot;EastEnders&quot; was built there. Such was the attention to detail that the producers imported thousands of bricks from West Germany as these were slightly bigger than those used on English building sites.

The show was one of the first to use lightweight video cameras, including the Philips LDK 14S, on location in drama production. Previously used in electronic news-gathering they were more versatile and cheaper to use than studio-based cameras. Interior scenes (such as those in the bar) were shot in studios at Borehamwood. Some location filming was conducted in Hamburg, despite the fact that the series was set in Düsseldorf. In these scenes most of the cars&#x27; registration numbers begin with HH denoting Hamburg (HH = Hansestadt Hamburg).

The location sequences in Hamburg and Düsseldorf actually only lasted 10 days. The Intercontinental hotel which Dennis, Wayne and Barry visit in episode 7, titled &quot;Private Lives&quot;, was the same hotel in which the cast and crew stayed while filming there.

In the last episode of the series, &quot;When The Boat Goes Out&quot;, the hut on the site where the gang live accidentally catches fire and burns down. The ruins shown on the end credits were the actual ruins of the hut that was used for filming.

The first series was placed at number 46 in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Greatest British Television Programmes list compiled in 2000.

==Series 2: 1986==
The second series of 13 episodes in 1986 saw the boys reunited, initially to help Barry complete extensive building work on his new home in Wolverhampton. Dennis is working for a crooked businessman, Ally Fraser (played by Bill Paterson), to whom he owes money. Dennis encourages the rest of the gang to help renovate a country manor house owned by Fraser, Thornely Manor, but they end up falling foul of the locals. Fraser then invites the boys to Spain to refurbish his swimming pool at his Spanish villa. Once in Spain, the gang are mistaken for criminals themselves and the series ends with them fleeing the Spanish police in a motor yacht, together with Barry&#x27;s new wife, who had only expected a wedding at sea.

The second series had several on-set problems. Actor Gary Holton died before some of the final indoor scenes were filmed, and the scripts had to be reworked to explain Wayne&#x27;s absence from these indoor scenes. Examples of this include various characters enquiring about Wayne&#x27;s whereabouts, only to be told that he was chatting up a girl in the next room or that he had gone away for the day. A double was used in other scenes, such as one where Bomber manhandles Wayne away from Ally&#x27;s girlfriend in a nightclub. The transmission of the final episode of Series 2 (&quot;Quo Vadis Pet&quot;) saw an introduction by Tim Healy dedicating the episode to Holton.

In his autobiography, Nail said he was glad to be done with filming not just because of Holton&#x27;s death but because he felt the second series lacked the gritty edge of the first series, something Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais later said they agreed with. On the audio commentary for series two, Clement said the series was much more contrived in getting and keeping the gang together, and La Frenais said he felt the gang weren&#x27;t trapped together enough like they were in Germany in the hut. In particular, he felt the Spanish episodes were too luxurious for the gang: instead of sleeping rough, having arguments, and clashing with the Spanish locals, they were often seen relaxing in summer clothes, and occasionally had female partners tagging along, which reduced the impact of the series.

Despite these concerns, the ratings remained high throughout. The episode titled &quot;Marjorie Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, which Clement and La Frenais described as their favourite in the second series because it was &quot;drab and grey looking&quot;, and &quot;added some meat to Oz&#x27;s character&quot;, was not only the most watched episode of the show&#x27;s run but drew in the highest audience percentage out of all the channels on the night of its screening, with sixteen million viewers.

Location scenes in the UK were shot around the villages of Caunton, Nottinghamshire, Redmile, Leicestershire and Denton, Lincolnshire. Roundhill Primary School, Beeston, Nottinghamshire was used as the location for &#x27;Walker Street Middle School&#x27;. Some scenes were also filmed in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire. Location shooting in Newcastle lasted for four days at the end of August 1985. Studio scenes were filmed at Central&#x27;s new studios in Nottingham, replacing those at Borehamwood.

In 1988, ITV decided to use &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; against &quot;EastEnders&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s twice-weekly soap that had grown considerably in popularity since its launch in 1985. The original episodes had been shown in a late evening slot and hence were very adult in content; ITV wanted to show them during family viewing time, and also in a 30-minute slot. Consequently, they cut each 50-minute episode into two 25-minute ones, thus turning the 26 episodes of the first two series into 52. The shows had to be further edited to remove adult language and sexual references to make them suitable for the desired family-viewing timeslot, and hence the plots often became confusing as key scenes were removed and much of the humour was lost. From 5 April 1988, the edited shows began an ITV network run, slotted on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm in direct competition with &quot;EastEnders&quot; on BBC One. There were viewer complaints about the editing, and after a few weeks Thames and TVS both opted out of the run and instead showed the original uncut episodes at 10.30pm on Mondays. The majority of ITV regions stayed with the edited run until its natural end in September.

==&quot;Educating Oz&quot; Sketch==
The Dennis and Oz characters were reunited for a one-off educational sketch for Tyne Tees in 1986. Made at the height of the AIDS epidemic, it consists of &quot;Northern Life&quot; presenter Paul Frost and Peter Jones, director of the Haemophilia Centre in Newcastle, discussing HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention in a TV studio, but cuts back and forth to a skit set in a pub, where Dennis and Oz are watching the broadcast, and are themselves discussing the issues over a pint of beer. In the conversation, Dennis becomes increasingly frustrated at Oz&#x27;s typically ignorant views towards sexual fidelity, safe sex practices, homosexuality and drug abuse. Eventually Jones enters the pub for real and then explains the issues to Oz directly, who eventually takes heed.

==Series 3: 2002==
Sketches written and performed for the &quot;Sunday for Sammy&quot; charity concerts inspired Clement and Le Frenais to revive the series. In 2002, the show was revived, this time as a six-part series produced by Ziji Productions for BBC One. The original writers and all of the surviving cast returned, joined by Noel Clarke as Wayne&#x27;s son Wyman. The characters all appeared to have moved on: Moxey was no longer a wanted criminal; Oz had given up drinking; Barry ran a seemingly successful business exporting out-of-date food and Lada cars back to Russia (in reality smuggling drugs into the country, a fact Barry was unaware of); Neville and his wife Brenda ran a building company called Nevenda Homes supplying pre-built homes from Scandinavia to DIY home builders. Dennis was now a taxi driver whose biggest fare was on Tuesdays and Fridays driving a drug dealer around the area. The series&#x27; storyline revolves around a plan by corrupt politician Jeffrey Grainger (played by Bill Nighy), whom Oz had met in prison, to dismantle the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge (a real-life industrial landmark) and sell it for reconstruction in the Far East. Persuading Oz to get the old gang back together to dismantle the bridge, he then plans to cheat them out of their share of the profits, until a Native American, Joe Saugus (played by Gordon Tootoosis), from Arizona, arrives to buy the bridge for the benefit of his tribe&#x27;s casino after seeing an advert placed online by Oz. The lads fly to his reservation to reconstruct the bridge.

Each episode except the first featured a re-cap of the previous episode&#x27;s events in a voiceover from Dennis, a feature not continued in the fourth series.

The special-effects depicting the dismantling of the bridge were so realistic that many people believed it was really being removed, forcing the BBC to add a caption to the final episode reassuring them that it was still there. Middlesbrough Council also issued a press release stating that the bridge remained in situ.

Despite some initial scepticism that the revival would not work, the show was an immediate hit. It won the National Television Award for Best Drama, and a British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Drama. In a later television documentary, original executive producer Allan McKeown stated that he had been deeply disapproving of the series&#x27; revival and requested that it not be titled &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;. However, this was refused and he fell out with La Frenais as a result, though they later reconciled.

==Comic Relief sketch==
Some of the cast made an appearance on Comic Relief&#x27;s Red Nose Day 2003, in which they find a suitcase full of money in a Miami hotel room and assume it belongs to a drug dealer who wants to shoot them; it actually belongs to U2 who invite them to their penthouse.

==Series 4: 2004==
A fourth series of six episodes was aired on BBC One from 4 January to 8 February 2004. The characters now work as building subcontractors for the British Embassy after a building job in Moscow goes badly wrong and are given a tip off from a friend of Oz who tells them about specialised embassy work. The team are posted to Havana to completely refurbish the British ambassador&#x27;s new residence. They also carry out some unofficial building work for Oz&#x27;s Cuban girlfriend&#x27;s family.

Neville is reluctantly recruited as a spy for British Intelligence before they leave the UK and is duped into working for Tarquin Pearce, the press liaison officer at the Embassy, Oz falls in love with prima ballerina Ofelia Ortiz, Barry finds himself in prison on the edge of a nervous breakdown, Moxey becomes a guinea pig trainer and Dennis ends up in a relationship with Wyman&#x27;s mother.
Despite extensive negotiations between the BBC and the Cuban government, it was not possible to obtain permission to film in Cuba, so the series was filmed in the Dominican Republic.

==&quot;Au Revoir&quot;: The two-part special==
Two one-hour episodes were shot in Bangkok and Chiang Mai in July - August 2004, and broadcast on BBC One on 27 and 28 December. (The episodes had no on-screen titles, but were listed as &quot;Au Revoir&quot; on the official BBC episode guide.) Shooting in Bangkok took place partly in the red-light district Soi Cowboy. Pat Roach, although suffering from cancer, had hoped to appear in the two-part special, but was not well enough and died in July. Instead, Dennis reads a letter from Bomber to the rest of the group while they are dining in a restaurant, where he explains his reasons for not having joined them. The group lift their glasses and drink a toast: &quot;To Bomber!&quot;.

The story sees the remaining six working in a British Embassy somewhere in central Africa that is about to be overrun by rioters. Most of them escape uninjured, except for Oz who sustains a painful injury to the rectum protecting a female staff member (while they are having sex) from a bomb.

The boys then move on to Laos and later Thailand, where Barry&#x27;s Russian ex-wife, Tatiana, turns up to announce that she is carrying his child following a brief &quot;reconciliation&quot; back in the UK. After working for the Australian embassy, Neville accompanies Barry and Tatiana for a journey upon the Eastern and Oriental Express in which they meet, by coincidence, Tarquin Pearce. During a stopover on this trip, Barry is kidnapped and held by guerrillas in a village in the jungle. When the others find out and follow they are also captured. They end up being imprisoned in a bamboo hut but are treated kindly by the local villagers. Eventually, Dennis has an idea (inspired by the film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;) to build a washhouse for the villagers to keep their minds occupied during their ordeal. After obtaining the guerrilla leader&#x27;s satellite phone whilst he is asleep, Neville manages to call for help to Brenda, and as a result the army and the Australian embassy locate them. It turns out that the man who arranged their kidnapping was Neville&#x27;s corrupt handler, Tarquin Pearce (from Series 4). Deprived of their hostages, the guerrillas decide to take Tarquin hostage instead.

In the final scenes Dennis, Neville and Oz ask the embassy to give them an assignment in a nice peaceful country, and return to Germany once more, and the trio are on the ferry from England -just as they were in the opening scene of the first episode of Series 1. Neville is asked what Brenda said to him when he told her he was heading off to Germany; he replies that she said &quot;Auf Wiedersehen... Pet.&quot; Following a dedication to Pat Roach, the closing credits of the final episode are accompanied by the opening theme tune from Series 1, and Dennis produces a photograph that he found in his home, showing the original 3 as they were, in Germany, a throwback to the first episode of &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet.&quot;

==Characters==

===Main cast===
;Dennis Longridge Patterson
:Dennis (Tim Healy) is the reluctant, co-opted leader of the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;. When introduced, he is in the middle of divorcing his wife Vera. He later has an affair with a German on-site secretary named Dagmar, played by Brigitte Kahn. In series two, he is working for a Newcastle upon Tyne gangster, Ally Fraser, to whom he has fallen in debt. Dennis has two children and can sometimes be short-tempered, but is basically a thoughtful man of high moral standards and has good people skills. At the opening of the third series, he is driving a mini-cab for a living and supplementing his income, much to his own shame, by working as a drug-dealer&#x27;s driver.
;Neville Hope
:Neville (Kevin Whately) is often under the thumb of his wife, Brenda. Honest and hard-working, he constantly worries about the welfare of his wife and three children, and his heart is in Newcastle. He married young and has no regrets, although by the third series he is suffering from a mid-life crisis. In series four Neville comes of age working secretly for British Intelligence in Cuba.
;Leonard Jeffrey &quot;Oz&quot; Osborne
:In the original series, Oz (Jimmy Nail) was a loud, belligerent, abrasive, heavy-drinking Geordie lout who showed no fidelity towards his wife or any concern for his son. He had a xenophobic attitude to Germans, and later to Turks and Spaniards. His major passions in life were drinking and supporting Newcastle United football club. At the end of the second series, he wins the Spanish lottery and spends much of his new-found wealth on presents for his friends, but has squandered all his money by the beginning of the third series, in which he re-unites his five surviving pals at his own phoney funeral as a ruse to reunite the entire team. By this time the character has substantially reformed, becoming more mature and thoughtful and less violent, and is prepared to lead his friends off on new adventures overseas. His son, Rod, has grown up, is a singer and is gay, which at first horrifies Oz. After going to see him perform on two occasions, Oz&#x27;s maturity and new-found reformed nature wins through.
;Barry Spencer Taylor
:Barry (Timothy Spall) is a bright, well-meaning West Midlander from the Black Country (he mentions connections with West Bromwich and Wolverhampton and has a poster of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. on the wall of his office). He is an electrician with a large vocabulary and a motorbike, and is also dull, bumbling and bashful. His inadvertent tendency to bore others and to look on the bleak side of things is mocked by his mates, but they retain some affection for him. He has been married twice, first to a local girl named Hazel (played by Melanie Hill), who left him for another woman, which is found out in the third series. He then later marries the glamorous Russian Tatiana played by Branka Katić. Both marriages end in divorce, but, at the end of the special two-part series, he is reconciled with Tatiana, especially now that she is expecting his child a result of an encounter back in the UK.
;Albert Arthur Moxey
:Moxey (Christopher Fairbank) is the only character not introduced in the first episode. He is a Scouse plasterer with bad acne and, originally, a stutter, although he has clearly had it cured by the time of the third series. Despite his friendly exterior, Moxey has a dark side: he is a convicted - albeit reformed - arsonist and does try to explain that it is more of a mental illness and that he always tries to ensure that no-one is in the building to be burned (Series three). At the beginning of the second series, he absconds from an open prison, and is thereafter on the run, under the aliases &quot;Brendan Mulcahy&quot; and &quot;Francis Fogarty&quot;. During series three, it emerges that he is now free from prison but that the local police need Moxey&#x27;s help to gather information against Moxey&#x27;s corrupt employer, Mickey Startup. He emigrates to Australia in the final episode of the special two part series with his new Australian girlfriend.
;Brian &quot;Bomber&quot; Busbridge
:Bomber (Pat Roach) is an easy-going 6&#x27;5&quot; West Country brickie, heavily built and extremely strong, with a bushy beard. He occasionally works as a wrestler in professional wrestling promotions. He follows Bristol City F.C. although he is seen wearing a Bristol Rovers blue and white quartered shirt in series 4. One of the older brickies, he is quiet but friendly, well liked by his workmates, and is often the voice of reason and good sense. When the lads find themselves in trouble, they often turn to Bomber for help, even Oz. He is affectionate with his wife and teenage daughter but has an unfortunate habit of spending his earnings on gambling and prostitutes.
;Wayne Winston Norris
:Wayne (Gary Holton) describes himself as a . A Londoner, he is a carpenter (or &quot;chippy&quot;) by trade and has an obsession for women which often lands him and his friends in trouble. Initially without transport, he relied on friends for lifts but by series 2 he has bought a red BMW 520. At the end of the first series, Wayne marries Christa, (played by Lysette Anthony), a secretary at the building site. The actor Gary Holton died in 1985 after overdosing on drugs and before the filming of the second series finished. Wayne&#x27;s absence in the second series is often explained in dialogue with phrases like &quot;He&#x27;s gone to town to look for girls&quot;. The series was not filmed in chronological order, so he is present in the final episode yet absent during earlier scenes. The last episode is dedicated to Gary Holton.
;Wyman Ian Norris
:Wyman (Noel Clarke) is Wayne&#x27;s son and is introduced in series three at the &quot;funeral for Oz&quot;, where they find out that Wayne died from a congenital heart problem a few years previously. Wyman is a DJ but then decides to join the gang to try to make some money on the bridge job, and to find out more about his father, whom he never knew. In later episodes, when the gang work for the OED, Wyman works as a general labourer.

==Music==
The opening and closing credits for the first two series were each accompanied by songs performed by Joe Fagin. In series one, &quot;Breakin&#x27; Away&quot;, written by David Mackay and Ian La Frenais, accompanied the opening credits. Ken Ashby collaborated with Mackay on &quot;That&#x27;s Livin&#x27; Alright&quot;, a song that closed each episode. The songs were released as a 7&quot; single, and reached number three in the UK Singles Chart in January 1984. It was reissued in 1995 when the show was repeated on Channel 4. With new lyrics by Jimmy Lawless, Fagin released a special version of &quot;That&#x27;s Livin&#x27; Alright&quot; for England&#x27;s national football team&#x27;s 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign. &quot;That&#x27;s England Alright&quot; was released on 5 June 2006.

Mackay and La Frenais also collaborated on &quot;Get it Right&quot;, the song used for the opening credits of series two. Like the first series, Ken Ashby collaborated with Mackay for series two&#x27;s closing credits song, &quot;Back With the Boys Again&quot;. The two tracks were released together as a double-sided single, but only reached number 53 in the UK charts in April 1986.

The tradition of using two separate songs was broken when the BBC revived the show. Instrumental music opened each episode of the third series. However, the closing credits were accompanied by Mark Knopfler&#x27;s song &quot;Why Aye Man&quot;, taken from his album &quot;The Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Incidental music was used for the fourth series and for the special. However, when the character of Dennis reveals a photograph of all of the original group taken in Germany, &quot;Breakin&#x27; Away&quot; begins and continues over the final credits of the show.
A CD is now available entitled &#x27;The Best of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet One &amp; Two&#x27; and contains 29 tracks of vocal music and instrumentals.

==Commercial availability and repeat broadcasts==
&quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; is available on DVD in the UK and US as boxsets and single discs with three episodes on each. The show was largely repeated on ITV1 and ITV4 but the show has not been re-run on these channels since 2008. The programme was shown on Men &amp; Motors for a while, but the channel has since closed.

In June 2012, Digital Channel Yesterday picked up the rights to repeat the first three series of the show; these were then shown at 10 am and 4 pm on Weekdays. Yesterday had to edit the third series&#x27; episodes to fit into their timing schedules; therefore instead of them being 60 minutes in length they were reduced to 45 minutes. This was not apparent with the repeats of the first two series. In January 2013, Yesterday bought the fourth series but, again due to timing, these were also edited from 60 to 45 minutes, meaning several parts of the storyline been cut. From July 2013, Drama picked up the rights to rerun the series as part of its schedules. In January 2017, it was repeated on Yesterday again.

In January 2021, series 1 and 2 were added to the UK’s BritBox and series 3 and 4 were added to the BBC’s iPlayer. In April 2024, the rights to repeat the programme were returned to ITV4, as well made available to stream on ITVX.

<text>Cabrales (Spanish: queso de Cabrales, Asturian: quesu Cabrales) is a blue cheese made in the artisan tradition by rural dairy farmers in Asturias, Spain. This cheese can be made from pure, unpasteurized cow’s milk or blended in the traditional manner with goat and/or sheep milk, which lends the cheese a stronger, spicier flavor.

All of the milk used in the production of Cabrales must come exclusively from herds raised in a small zone of production in Asturias, in the mountains of the Picos de Europa.

==Production==

The milk is first heated and curdled by the addition of rennet. The whey is removed from the curds, which are then packed into cylindrical molds called &quot;arnios&quot;, salted and left to cure and harden. After the initial curing period of around two weeks, the Cabrales is then aged a further two to five months in natural caves in the limestone mountains of the area. The cheeses are placed on wooden shelves known as &quot;talameras&quot;, where they are periodically turned and cleaned. Relative humidity in these caves is typically 90% and the temperature is a cool , conditions favoring the development of penicillium molds that produce blue-green veins throughout the cheese.

Cabrales has a strong flavor, sometimes quite acidic, which can be very complex when made with mixed milks. Like Gorgonzola and Roquefort, it is a famous blue cheese whose name is protected by European law.

At the end of its ripening process, the cheese has the following characteristics:

* Cylindrical shape, 7 to 15 cm. high, variable diameter and weight.
* Soft, thin, creamy rind of gray color with yellow-reddish areas.
* Paste of unctuous consistency, with varying degrees of cohesion, compact and without eyes.
* Fat content is not less than 45% of the dry matter.
* The minimum moisture content of 30%.

==Marketing==
Traditionally, Cabrales was sold wrapped in the moist leaves of &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot; (sycamore maple), but nowadays regulations require that commercially produced Cabrales be sold in a dark-green-colored aluminum foil with the registered official stamp of the PDO &quot;Queso de Cabrales&quot;. Within the production zone it is still possible to encounter Cabrales cheese with the traditional maple leaf wrapping, although it is only ever produced in small batches and not approved for export, as it is ineligible for DO status. The same is true of other Spanish blue cheeses, also traditionally leaf-wrapped, such as Valdeón and Picón Bejes-Tresviso.

A 5.78 lb (2.62 kg) cheese from the Valfríu cheese factory set a Guinness World Record in August 2018 when it sold for €14,300 at auction. In 2020, the same cheese variety set a new world record as it was sold for €20,500 at auction.

In 2019, the last year before supply disruptions due to COVID, 433,000 kg of Cabrales cheese was produced, according to the Consejo Regulador D.O.P. Cabrales (Cabrales Regulatory Council).

<doc id="223834" wikidata="Q828135" url="?curid=223834" title="Ice wine">
<text>Icewine (or ice wine; ) is a type of dessert wine produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine. The sugars and other dissolved solids do not freeze, but the water does, allowing for a more concentrated grape juice to develop. The grapes&#x27; must is then pressed from the frozen grapes, resulting in a smaller amount of more concentrated, very sweet juice. With icewines, the freezing happens before the fermentation, not afterwards. Unlike the grapes from which other dessert wines are made, such as Sauternes, Tokaji, or Trockenbeerenauslese, icewine grapes should not be affected by &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; or noble rot, at least not to any great degree. Only healthy grapes keep in good shape until the opportunity arises for an icewine harvest, which in extreme cases can occur after the New Year, on a northern hemisphere calendar. This gives icewine its characteristic refreshing sweetness balanced by high acidity. When the grapes are free of &quot;Botrytis&quot;, they are said to come in &quot;clean&quot;. This results in a very complex and sweet wine. Much icewine is made from the grapes Riesling, Vidal, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, but there is also icewine made from Shiraz, Merlot, Sangiovese and others.

Icewine production is risky (the frost may not come at all before the grapes rot or are otherwise lost) and requires the availability of a large enough labour force to pick the whole crop within a few hours, at a moment&#x27;s notice, on the first morning that is cold enough. The grapes for icewine must only be harvested when they are frozen naturally and the temperature must be -8 C (20°F) or below when they are picked. This results in relatively small amounts of ice wine being made worldwide, making icewines generally expensive.

Icewine production is limited to that minority of the world&#x27;s wine-growing regions where the necessary cold temperatures can be expected to be reached with some regularity. Canada is the world&#x27;s largest producer of icewine, producing a greater volume of icewine than all other countries combined with Ontario producing over 90% of Canada&#x27;s icewine, followed by Germany.

==History==
There are indications that frozen grapes were used to make wine in Roman times. Pliny the Elder (AD 23 – 79) wrote that certain grape varieties were not harvested before the first frost had occurred. The poet Martial recommended that grapes should be left on the vine until November or until they were stiff with frost. Details as to the winemaking and description of these wines are unknown. It cannot be completely ruled out that the descriptions refer to dried grape wines, a common style of wine in Roman times, where the raisin-like grapes were harvested late enough for the first frost to have fallen. In either case, the method seems later to have been forgotten. Wine from Chiomonte in the Val di Susa was popular in Roman times and this town still today produces one of Italy&#x27;s few ice wines.

It is believed that the first post-Roman icewine was made in Franconia in 1794. Better documentation exists for an ice-wine harvest in Dromersheim close to Bingen in Rheinhessen on February 11, 1830. The grapes were of the 1829 vintage. That winter was harsh and some wine growers had the idea to leave grapes hanging on the vine for use as animal fodder. When it was noticed that these grapes yielded very sweet must, they were pressed and an icewine was produced. Sweet wines produced from late harvested grapes were well-established as the most valued German wine style by the early 19th century, following the discovery of Spätlese at Schloss Johannisberg in Rheingau in 1775, and the subsequent introduction of the Auslese designation. These wines would usually be produced from grapes affected by noble rot. Thus, is a more recent German wine style than the botrytised wines.

===Germany===
Throughout the 19th century and until 1960, harvests were a rare occurrence in Germany. Only six 19th-century vintages with harvests have been documented, including 1858, the first at Schloss Johannisberg. There was little effort to systematically produce these wines during this period, and their production was probably the rare result of freak weather conditions. It was the invention of the pneumatic bladder press which made the production of ice wine practical and led to a substantial increase in the frequency and quantity of production. 

Production of a number of German icewines began to increase in 1961, and the wine increased in popularity in the following years. The production has been assisted by other technological inventions in the form of electric lighting driven by portable generators (to assist harvest in the cold hours of early-morning darkness, before sunrise and the grapes thaw), and remotely-controlled temperature alarms. After re-thawing, the grapes will spoil quickly since ice crystals destroy cell walls. Thus, the harvest must be completed within a few hours on the first morning that is cold enough. Plastic films are used for &quot;packaging&quot; the vines during the waiting period between ripeness and first frost to protect the ripe grapes from being eaten by wildlife.

===Canada===
Icewine was first produced in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia by German immigrant Walter Hainle in 1972. This icewine was the result of an early and unexpected frost, and yielded of wine, which Hainle originally did not intend to sell, although he did so in 1978.

In 1983, Niagara-based wineries Inniskillin&#x27;s and Reif Estate Winery, as well as Hillebrand, and Pelee Island Winery, two wineries with Austrian winemakers situated in another part of Ontario, all left grapes on their vines in an attempt to produce icewine. Inniskillin and Reif lost their entire crop to hungry birds, while Hillebrand and Pelee Island were able to harvest a minuscule amount of frozen grapes. In 1984, Inniskillin winery was the first winery in Canada to produce icewine for commercial purposes, produced in 1984 under the direction of the winery&#x27;s Austrian-born co-owner Karl Kaiser, often being mentioned as Canada&#x27;s first icewine as they were &quot;naturally frozen on the vine&quot;. Kaiser used nets to protect his vines and was able to produce Inniskillin&#x27;s first icewine. This wine was made from Vidal grapes and was labelled &quot;Eiswein&quot;. 

After icewine production established a commercial footing, Canadian icewine quickly became popular with domestic consumers and reviewers. Other Canadian producers and regions picked up the idea since harsh Canadian winters lend themselves to large-scale production. The international breakthrough of Canadian icewine came in 1991, when Inniskillin&#x27;s 1989 Vidal icewine won the at Vinexpo. The Canadian trend towards increased cultivation of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; (European) grape varieties in the 1990s expanded the palette of varieties available to be bitten by frost. By the early 2000s, Canada was established as the largest producer of icewine in the world. In 2001, the EU allowed the importation of Canadian icewine hence recognizing the standard equivalency.

==Ice wine producers==
===Canada===
In contrast to most other wine-producing regions, Canada, particularly the Niagara Peninsula, consistently undergoes freezing in winter and has become the world&#x27;s largest icewine producer. As a result, Canada produces a greater volume of icewine than all other countries combined. Approximately 90 per cent of all icewine produced in Canada originate from Ontario-based wineries, with wineries in Ontario producing approximately of ice wine in 2016. However, it is also produced in all other wine growing provinces of Canada, including British Columbia, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Icewine production is regulated by the VQA in the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. If the sugar level in the grapes measures less than 35° Brix, then they may not be used for icewine, a minimum considerably higher than that of German Eiswein. These grapes are often downgraded to a lower designation, such as Special Select Late Harvest or Select Late Harvest. Canadian rules were further tightened in British Columbia in 2000 after a producer dealt with the mild winter of 1999 by moving grapes up to the mountains to seek freezing temperatures.

Though Pelee Island Winery and Hillebrand were Canada&#x27;s first commercial icewine producers, starting production in 1983, Inniskillin Wines is considered the most widely known Canadian icewine producer as the first Canadian winery to win a major international award, the Grand Prix d’Honneur at 1991 Vinexpo in France, with their 1989 Vidal Icewine (which was technically an illegal import into the EU), placing Canadian icewines on the world stage. Pillitteri Estates Winery has emerged in the 2000s as the world&#x27;s largest estate icewine producer. In November 2006, Canadian producer Royal DeMaria released five cases of Chardonnay icewine with a half-bottle price set at C$ 30,000, making it the world&#x27;s most expensively priced wine.

=== China ===
China is the second largest global producer of ice wine, and produces approximately 40% of the world&#x27;s ice wine, and with significant portions of the industry occurring in Gansu and Liaoning provinces, and smaller portions in Yunnan and Xinjiang. Cold weather in Gansu province requires the trenching of vines to prevent die-off, but the region has conditions that lead to resilience to rots and is low in industrial pollution.

===Europe===
The most famous (and expensive) icewines are German &quot;Eiswein&quot;, but icewine is also made in European countries such as Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland at least in smaller quantity. &quot;Eiswein&quot; is part of the &quot;Prädikatswein&quot; quality category in the German wine classification. The French language term &quot;Vin de glace&quot; is part of the wine classification in Luxembourg, but not in France, but is sometimes found on the rare bottles of icewine produced in Alsace. In most of France, the climate is too warm for icewine production.

=== Japan ===

The Furano region of Central Hokkaido, Japan, produces an icewine each winter at the Furano Winery. Because such a small amount can be made each year, it is produced in limited batches and sold only at the cellar door, 3.3 kilometres from Furano Station. The Furano Wine icewine is produced only in red.

===United States===
Northern Michigan wineries continue to follow the German laws that govern what wine qualifies as icewine, which dictates that icewine must be picked only when the grapes are frozen on the vine. In 2002, six Michigan wineries produced over 13,000 half-bottles of ice wine, a record at that time.
A growing number of wineries near Lake Erie, especially in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ashtabula County, Ohio, also produce icewine.

The US law for icewines specifies that grapes must be naturally frozen. The TTB (Tax and Trade Bureau) regulations state that &quot;Wine made from grapes frozen after harvest may not be labeled with the term &#x27;icewine&#x27; or any variation thereof, and if the wine is labeled to suggest it was made from frozen grapes, the label must be qualified to show that the grapes were frozen postharvest.&quot;

==Production==

Natural icewines require a hard freeze (by law in Canada ) or colder, and in Germany or colder), to occur sometime after the grapes are ripe, which means that the grapes may hang on the vine for several months following the normal harvest. If a freeze does not come quickly enough, the grapes may rot and the crop will be lost. If the freeze is too severe, no juice can be extracted. Vineland Estates Winery in Ontario once broke their pneumatic press in the 1990s while pressing the frozen grapes because they were too hard (the temperature was close to ). The longer the harvest is delayed, the more fruit will be lost to wild animals and dropped fruit. Since the fruit must be pressed while it is still frozen, pickers often must work at night or very early in the morning, harvesting the grapes within a few hours, while cellar workers must work in unheated spaces.

The high sugar level in the must leads to a slower-than-normal fermentation. It may take months to complete the fermentation (compared to days or weeks for regular wines) and special strains of yeasts should be used. Because of the lower yield of grape musts and the difficulty of processing, icewines are significantly more expensive than table wines. They are often sold in half-bottle volume (375 mL) or the even smaller 200ml bottle. New World wineries in particular sometimes bottle 200 mL and 50 mL gift packages.

===Requirements===
The minimum must weight requirements for icewine is as follows, in the measures used in the respective country:
* For German Eiswein, 110 to 128 degrees Oechsle, the same as for Beerenauslese, depending on the region (wine growing zone) and grape variety.
* For Austrian Eiswein, 25 degrees KMW, the same as for Beerenauslese, corresponding to 127 °Oechsle.
* For Canadian Icewine, 35 degrees Brix, corresponding to 153.5 °Oechsle.
* For Luxembourg Vin de glace, 120 °Oechsle.

===Cryoextraction===

In Austria, Germany, the US, and Canada, the grapes must freeze naturally to be called icewine. In other countries, some winemakers use cryoextraction (mechanical freezing) to simulate the effect of a frost and typically do not leave the grapes to hang for extended periods as is done with natural icewines.

Cryoextraction is the process by which grapes are frozen with refrigeration and pressed. Winemakers subject grapes to temperatures around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (or −7 degrees Celsius), and press them while still frozen. Ice crystals remain in the press, while concentrated juice flows out. The resulting wine resembles ice wine. The process of &quot;freeze distillation&quot; is similar in its concentrating effects, although it occurs after fermentation.

These non-traditional wines are sometimes referred to as &quot;icebox wines&quot;. This may be in reaction to restrictions on using the term &quot;ice wine&quot;, such as was ruled in the United States of America in 2002. An example is Bonny Doon&#x27;s &quot;Vin de Glacière&quot; or King Estate&#x27;s Vin Glace (made from Oregon Pinot gris grapes). German wine law entirely bans post-harvest freezing methods, even if not labeled &quot;Eiswein&quot;.

==Grape varieties==

Typical grapes used for icewine production are Riesling, considered to be the noblest variety by German winemakers; Vidal, highly popular in Ontario, Canada; and the red grape Cabernet Franc. Many vintners, especially from the New World, are experimenting with making icewine from other varieties: whites such as Seyval blanc, Chardonnay, Kerner, Gewürztraminer, Muscat Ottonel, Chenin blanc, Pinot blanc, and Ehrenfelser, or reds such as Merlot, Pinot noir, and even Cabernet Sauvignon. Pillitteri Estates Winery from the Niagara-on-the-Lake region of Ontario claim to be the first winery in the world producing Shiraz (Syrah) icewine with the 2004 vintage, Semillion, and Sangiovese in 2007.

Icewines from white varieties tend to be pale yellow or light gold in color when they are young and can maderise (acquiring a deep amber-golden color) as they age. The red varieties tend to have a light burgundy or even pink color like that of rosé wines, since the steeping of the skins in the pressed liquid typically used in red wine making is obviously not possible in ice wine production.

==Characteristics==
Even though it is normal for residual sugar content in icewine to run from 180 g/L up to as high as 320 g/L (with a mean in the 220 g/L range), icewine is very refreshing (as opposed to cloying) due to high acidity. (The titratable acidity in ice wine is almost always above 10 g/L.)

Icewine usually has a slightly lower alcohol content than regular table wine. Some Riesling icewines from Germany have an alcohol content as low as 6%. Icewines produced in Canada usually have higher alcohol content, between 8 and 13 percent. In most years, icewines from Canada generally have higher brix degree (must weight) compared to those from Germany. This is largely due to the more consistent winters in Canada. Must with insufficient brix level cannot be made into icewine, and is thus often sold as &quot;special select late harvest&quot; or &quot;select late harvest&quot; at a fraction of the price that true icewine commands.

<doc id="223845" wikidata="Q855680" url="?curid=223845" title="Mannequin">
<text>A mannequin (sometimes spelled as manikin and also called a dummy, lay figure, or dress form) is a doll, often articulated, used by artists, tailors, dressmakers, window dressers and others, especially to display or fit clothing and show off different fabrics and textiles. Previously, the English term referred to human models and muses (a meaning which it still retains in French and other European languages); the meaning as a dummy dating from the start of World War II.

Life-sized mannequins with simulated airways are used in the teaching of first aid, CPR, and advanced airway management skills such as tracheal intubation. During the 1950s, mannequins were used in nuclear tests to help show the effects of nuclear weapons on humans. Also referred to as mannequins are the human figures used in computer simulation to model the behavior of the human body.

&quot;Mannequin&quot; comes from the French word &#x27;, which had acquired the meaning &quot;an artist&#x27;s jointed model&quot;, which in turn came from the [[Flemish dialects|Flemish]] word&#x27;, meaning &quot;little man, figurine&quot;, referring to late Middle Ages practice in Flanders whereby public display of even women&#x27;s clothes was performed by male pages (boys). Fashion shops in Paris ordered dolls in reed from Flemish merchants. Flanders was in terms of logistics the easiest region to import reed dolls from, as the rivers Schelde and Oise provided easy routes from Flanders to Paris. As the Flemish wrote &quot; for &#x27;little man&#x27; on their invoices, the Parisians pronounced this as &#x27;mannequen&#x27;, hence shifted to &#x27;mannequin&#x27;. A mannequin is thus linguistically masculine, not feminine.

==History==

Shop mannequins are derived from dress forms used by fashion houses for dress making. The use of mannequins originated in the 15th century, when miniature &quot;milliners&#x27; mannequins&quot; were used to demonstrate fashions for customers. Full-scale, wickerwork mannequins came into use in the mid-18th century. Wirework mannequins were manufactured in Paris from 1835.

==Shop display==
The first female mannequins, made of papier-mâché, were made in France in the mid-19th century. Mannequins were later made of wax to produce a more lifelike appearance. In the 1920s, wax was supplanted by a more durable composite made with plaster.

Modern day mannequins are made from a variety of materials, the primary ones being fiberglass and plastic. The fiberglass mannequins are usually more expensive than the plastic ones, tend to be not as durable, but are significantly more realistic. Plastic mannequins, on the other hand, are a relatively new innovation in the mannequin field and are built to withstand the hustle of customer foot traffic usually witnessed in the store they are placed in.
Mannequins are used primarily by retail stores as in-store displays or window decoration. However, many online sellers also use them to display their products for their product photos (as opposed to using a live model).

==Use by artists==
Renaissance artist &quot;Fra Bartolomeo&quot; invented the full-scale articulated mannequin (more properly known as lay figure) as an aid in drawing and painting draped figures. In 18th-century England, lay-figures are known to have been owned by portrait painters such as Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, and Arthur Devis for the arrangement of conversation pieces. 

==Medical education==

Anatomical models such as ivory manikins were used by doctors in the 17th century to study medical anatomy and as a teaching aid for pregnancy and childbirth. Each figure could be opened up to reveal internal organs and sometimes fetuses. There are only 180 known surviving ancient medical manikins worldwide.
Today, medical simulation mannequins, models or related artefacts such as SimMan, the Transparent Anatomical Manikin or Harvey are widely used in medical education. The term &quot;manikin&quot; refers exclusively to these types of models, though &quot;mannequin&quot; is often also used.

In first aid courses, manikins may be used to demonstrate methods of giving first aid (e.g., resuscitation). Fire and coastguard services use mannequins to practice life-saving procedures. The mannequins have similar weight distribution to a human. Special obese mannequins and horse mannequins have also been made for similar purposes.

Over-reliance on mass-produced mannequins has been criticized for teaching medical students a hypothetical &quot;average&quot; that does not help them identify or understand the significant amount of normal variation seen in the real world.

==Representation in art and culture==
 Mannequins were a frequent motif in the works of many early 20th-century artists, notably the metaphysical painters Giorgio de Chirico, Alberto Savinio and Carlo Carrà.
Shop windows displaying mannequins were a frequent photographic subject for Eugène Atget.

Mannequins have been used in horror and science fiction. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The After Hours&quot; (1960) involves mannequins taking turns living in the real world as people. In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970), an alien intelligence attempts to take over Earth with killer plastic mannequins called Autons.

The romantic comedy film &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1987) is a story of a window dresser who falls in love with a mannequin that comes to life. The romantic thriller film &quot;Bommai&quot; (2023) is the story of a person who works in a mannequin factory and falls in love with one of the mannequins, imagining it as his childhood crush.

==Military use==
Military use of mannequins is recorded amongst the ancient Chinese, such as at the siege of Yongqiu. The besieged Tang army lowered scarecrows down the walls of their castles to lure the fire of the enemy arrows. In this way, they renewed their supplies of arrows. Dummies were also used in the trenches in World War I to lure enemy snipers away from the soldiers.

A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report describes the use of a mannequin (&quot;Jack-in-the-Box&quot;) as a countersurveillance measure, intended to make it more difficult for the host country&#x27;s counterintelligence to track the movement of CIA agents posing as diplomats. A &quot;Jack-in-the-Box&quot; – a mannequin representing the upper half of a human – would quickly replace a CIA agent after he left the car driven by another agent and walked away, so that any counterintelligence officers monitoring the agent&#x27;s car would believe that he was still in the car.

<text>Rambling Willie (April 18, 1970 - August 24, 1995) was a harness racing horse, more specifically a bay pacing gelding sired by Rambling Fury and out of Meadow Belle by Meadow Gold.

Rambling Willie was born on a farm in Monroeville, Indiana.

He did not race at age two and as three-year-old was purchased by driver/trainer Robert Farrington for $15,000 who later gifted 50% of the horse to his wife Vivian and sold the other half to Paul Siebert.

He won 128 races in 305 starts, both records, and won the U. S. Pacing Championship in 1976. At the 1975 Canadian Pacing Derby he tied for first in a dead heat with Pickwick Baron, and won outright in 1976 and 1977, setting a best time for the mile of 1:54.3, a world record at the time.

Rambling Willie was &quot;put down&quot; in 1995 because of laminitis (an often fatal hoof disease) and was buried in the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky where he had resided, on permanent exhibition, in the Park&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Champions&quot;, representing the Standardbred breed.

== Awards and recognition ==
He was voted North American aged pacer of the year in 1975, 1976, and 1977, and he retired in 1983 as the leading Standardbred money winner of all time, earning over $2 million. Most of his earnings came from &quot;overnight&quot; invitational races and &quot;late closer&quot; events that carried only a fraction of the dollar amounts of the traditional two- and three-year-old stakes events that make up the vast majority of the earnings of virtually every other record money-winning racehorse. To this day, considering inflation, his earnings from age 4 and up have not been surpassed in North America.

Rambling Willie sustained &quot;bowed tendons&quot; in both front legs early in his ten-plus-year racing career, as well as other nagging injuries expected in a racehorse competing for so long a period. While racing at Hollywood Park Racetrack in California, he suffered such a severe bout of colic that he was operated on in a last effort to save him, euthanasia being the only alternative. Hollywood Park was inundated with letters and calls from his fans for weeks afterward, and the track released frequent bulletins as his condition progressed. The horse recovered and months later won at long odds.

Rambling Willie was inducted into the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1997 and into the Indiana Standardbred Hall of Fame in 2003. Upon the horse&#x27;s death, Bob Farrington, his retired Hall of Fame driver and trainer, was asked what he had seen in Willie that others missed during the early part of his career. Farrington replied in the words of legendary Thoroughbred trainer &quot;Sunny&quot; Jim Fitzsimmons, &quot;The most important thing about a racehorse, you can&#x27;t see.&quot;

A biography of the horse was published: &quot;Rambling Willie: The Horse that God Loved!&quot; ().

<text>An exarch (; 
from Ancient Greek ἔξαρχος &quot;exarchos&quot;) was the holder of any of various historical offices, some of them being political or military and others being ecclesiastical.

In the late Roman Empire and early Byzantine Empire, an &quot;exarch&quot; was a governor of a particular territory. From the end of the 3rd century or early 4th, every Roman diocese was governed by a vicarius, who was titled &quot;exarch&quot; in eastern parts of the Empire, where the Greek language and the use of Greek terminology dominated, even though Latin was the language of the imperial administration from the provincial level up until the 440s (Greek translations were sent out with the official Latin text). In Greek texts, the Latin title is spelled βικάριος (). The office of exarch as a governor with extended political and military authority was later created in the Byzantine Empire, with jurisdiction over a particular territory, usually a frontier region at some distance from the capital Constantinople.

In the Eastern Christian Churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic), the term &quot;exarch&quot; has three distinct uses: a metropolitan who holds the office of exarch is the deputy of a patriarch and holds authority over bishops of the designated ecclesiastical region (thus, a position between that of patriarch and regular metropolitan); or an auxiliary or titular bishop appointed to be exarch over a group of the faithful not yet large enough or organized enough to be constituted an eparchy or diocese (thus the equivalent of a vicar apostolic); or a priest or deacon who is appointed by a bishop as his executive representative in various fields of diocesan administration (in the Byzantine Empire, executive exarchs were usually collecting diocesan revenues for local bishops).

== Political exarchs ==
In the civil administration of the Byzantine Empire the exarch was, as stated above, the imperial governor of a large and important region of the Empire. The Exarchates were a response to weakening imperial authority in the provinces and were part of the overall process of unification of civil and military offices, initiated in early form by Justinian I, which would lead eventually to the creation of the Thematic system by either the Emperor Heraclius or Constans II.

After the dissolution of the Western Empire in the late fifth century, the Eastern Roman Empire remained stable through the beginning of the Middle Ages and retained the ability for future expansion. Justinian I reconquered North Africa, Italy, Dalmatia and finally parts of Spain for the Eastern Roman Empire. However, this put an incredible strain on the Empire&#x27;s limited resources. Subsequent emperors would not surrender the re-conquered land to remedy the situation. Thus the stage was set for Emperor Maurice to establish the Exarchates to deal with the constantly evolving situation of the provinces.

In Italy the Lombards were the main opposition to Byzantine power. In North Africa the Amazigh or Berber princes were ascendant due to Roman weakness outside the coastal cities. The problems associated with many enemies on various fronts (the Visigoths in Spain, the Slavs and Avars in the Balkans, the Sassanid Persians in the Middle East, and the Amazigh in North Africa) forced the imperial government to decentralize and devolve power to the former provinces.

The term Exarch most commonly refers to the Exarch of Italy, who governed the area of Italy and Dalmatia, still remaining under Byzantine control after the Lombard invasion of 568. The exarchate&#x27;s seat was at Ravenna, whence it is known as the &quot;Exarchate of Ravenna&quot;. Ravenna remained the seat of the Exarch until the revolt of 727 over Iconoclasm. Thereafter, the growing menace of the Lombards and the split between eastern and western Christendom that Iconoclasm caused made the position of the Exarch more and more untenable. The last Exarch was killed by the Lombards in 751.

A second exarchate was created by Maurice to administer northern Africa, formerly a separate praetorian prefecture, the islands of the western Mediterranean and the Byzantine possessions in Spain. The capital of the Exarchate of Africa was Carthage. An emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, Heraclius, was the son of the exarch of Africa before Heraclius replaced the usurper emperor Phocas in 610. Phocas had revolted under emperor Maurice who had appointed Heraclius&#x27; father as exarch of Africa. The exarchate proved both financially and militarily strong, and survived until the Arab Muslim conquest of Carthage in 698.

== Ecclesiastical exarchs ==

=== Early tradition ===
The term &#x27;exarch&#x27; entered ecclesiastical language at first for a metropolitan (an archbishop) with jurisdiction not only for the area that was his as a metropolitan, but also over other metropolitans within local political dioceses. Since imperial vicarius (governor of a political diocese) was often called &quot;exarch&quot; in eastern, Greek-speaking parts of the Empire, it became customary for the metropolitans of the diocesan capitals (Ephesus in the Diocese of Asia, Heraclea in the Diocese of Thrace and Caesarea in the Diocese of Pontus) also to use the title &quot;exarch&quot; in order to emphasize their precedence and primatial status over other metropolitans within local political dioceses.

The Council of Chalcedon (451), which gave special authority to the see of Constantinople as being &quot;the residence of the emperor and the Senate&quot;, in its canons spoke of diocesan &quot;exarchs&quot;, placing all metropolitans in dioceses of Asia, Thrace and Pontus (including metropolitans-exarchs of Ephesus, Heraclea and Caesarea) under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Constantinople. Metropolitans-exarchs of Ephesus tried to resist the supreme jurisdiction of Constantinople, but eventually failed since imperial government supported the creation of a centralized Patriarchate.

When the proposed government of universal Christendom by five patriarchal sees (Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, known as the pentarchy), under the auspices of a single universal empire, was formulated in the legislation of Emperor Justinian I (527–565), especially in his Novella 131 (De regulis ecclesiasticis etc., caput III), and received formal ecclesiastical sanction at the Council in Trullo (692), the name &quot;patriarch&quot; became the official one for the heads of major autocephalous churches, and the title of &quot;exarch&quot; was further demoted by naming all metropolitans as &quot;patriarchal exarchs&quot; in their ecclesiastical provinces. The advance of Constantinople put an end to privileges of three older, original exarchates, which fell back to the state of ordinary metropolitan sees.

Local ecclesiastical development in some regions also included the title of exarch. Since the Church of Cyprus was declared autocephalous (431), its Primate received the title of Exarch of Cyprus. On a similar principle the Archbishop of Mount Sinai and Raithu is an exarch, though in this case, as in that of Cyprus, modern Eastern Orthodox usage generally prefers the title &quot;Archbishop&quot;.

=== Eastern Orthodox Churches ===

In modern ecclesiastical practice of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the title of exarch was often used to designate the highest hierarchical office under the rank of patriarch. When Russian Patriarch Adrian of Moscow died in 1700, Emperor Peter the Great abolished the patriarchal office and appointed Metropolitan Stefan Yavorsky as exarch and head of the Most Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church.

After Imperial Russia annexed Georgia (the eastern part in 1801, and the western part in 1810), the ancient Georgian Orthodox Church (autocephalous since 750, whose head was since 1008 styled Catholicos-Patriarchs) was reorganized into the &quot;Georgian Exarchate,&quot; and the newly appointed &quot;Exarch of Georgia&quot; (since 1817 always an ethnic Russian) sat in the Russian Holy Synod at St. Petersburg. Since the entire region of the Caucasus fell under Russian rule, the jurisdiction of the Georgian Exarchate was expanded, encompassing the territories of modern-day Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. On 7 April 1917, the Georgian Patriarchate was restored for the Archbishops of Mtsheta and Tbilisi, with the style Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, and the title &quot;Exarch of Georgia&quot; was extinguished, but only for the Georgian part of the Exarchate. The Russian Orthodox Church and its exarch Platon (Rozhdestvensky) kept their jurisdiction over non-Georgian parts of the Caucasian region, and for those territories the &quot;Caucasian Exarchate&quot; of the Russian Orthodox Church was created in the summer of 1917, with metropolitan Platon as Exarch of the Caucasus. In the spring of 1918, he was succeeded by metropolitan Cyril (Smirnov) as new Exarch of the Caucasus, but after his transfer to another post in the spring of 1920 no new exarch was appointed.

On 28 February 1870 the twenty-year-old struggle between Greeks and Bulgarians for control of the Orthodox Church in Bulgaria culminated when the Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz created an independent Bulgarian ecclesiastical organization, known as the Bulgarian Exarchate. The Orthodox Church in Bulgaria had now become independent of the Greek-dominated Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Bulgarian Exarch, who resided in Constantinople, became the most famous bearer of the title of exarch; his adherents throughout region were called &quot;exarchists&quot;, as opposed to the Greek &quot;patriarchists&quot;. The ensuing struggle, waged especially in Macedonia, was not only religious but had a conspicuous political dimension of a contention between competing Greek and Bulgarian national aims. For more information see Bulgarian Exarchate and Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

In 1921, eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine were reorganized as the Ukrainian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, headed by the patriarchal exarch with his seat in Kiev (Kyiv). The Ukrainian Exarchate existed until 1990 when it was granted a higher degree of ecclesiastical autonomy within the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1989, an autonomous Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church was formed, with jurisdiction over eparchies in Belarus.

During the 20th century, the pentarchy-number principle, already abandoned in the case of Bulgaria (10th century), Serbia (14th century) and Russia (16th century), gave way to the desire of the now politically independent Orthodox nations to see their sovereignty reflected in ecclesiastical autonomy – autocephaly – and the symbolic title to crown it: a &#x27;national&#x27; Patriarch. For example, Bulgarian Exarchate was raised to the rank of Patriarchate in 1953.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the office of exarch can be also given to a special deputy of a Patriarch, with jurisdiction over a community outside the home territory of the Patriarchate. Thus, in the United States there are Exarchs representing, among others, the Serbian, Romanian, Bulgarian and Jerusalem Patriarchs. The style of the Exarchs of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem is &quot;Exarch of the Holy Sepulcher&quot;.

The Mexican Orthodox parishes in five deaneries (Mexico City, D.F., State of Mexico, State of Jalisco, State of Veracruz and State of Chiapas) of the Orthodox Church in America are governed as the &quot;Exarchate of Mexico&quot;, currently under the leadership of Bishop Alejo of Mexico City.

The third officer of the court of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, who examines marriage cases (analogous to the Catholic defensor matrimonii), is called the Exarch.

=== Oriental Orthodox Churches ===
The Oriental Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch currently has under his authority an Exarch in India, known by the ancient title Maphrian, although he is popularly referred to as Catholicos. This is not to be confused with the autocephalous Catholicate of the East, which is also located in India.

=== Latin Church ===
Historically, there have been a very few cases of the civil title of Exarch granted by the civil authority to prelates of the Latin Church, as when Emperor Frederick I named the Archbishop of Lyon as Exarch of Burgundy in 1157.
However, the ecclesiastical title of Exarch has disappeared in the Western Catholic Church, being replaced by the terms &quot;Primate&quot; (ranking above metropolitan archbishop) and &quot;Apostolic Vicar&quot; (ranking below suffragan bishop).

=== Modern Eastern Catholic Churches ===

In Eastern Catholic Churches (of Eastern tradition but in full communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope), the ecclesiastical title of Exarch is in common use, just as with its Orthodox counterparts.

These Churches are, in general, not identified with a particular liturgical rite. Thus, no fewer than fourteen of them use the same Byzantine Rite, mostly in one or other of only two languages, Greek and Church Slavonic, but they maintain their distinct identities. Because of population shifts, half or so of these Churches have not just exarchates but full-scale eparchies (bishoprics) or even archeparchies (archdioceses) outside their original territory.

====Apostolic exarchs====
Apostolic exarch is usually a consecrated bishop of a titular see to whom the Pope, as Bishop of the Roman See of the Apostle Peter, has entrusted the pastoral care of the faithful of an autonomous Eastern Catholic particular Church &quot;sui iuris&quot; in an area, not raised to the rank of eparchy (diocese), that is situated outside the home territory of an Eastern Catholic Church. The office of &quot;apostolic exarch&quot; thus corresponds to what in the Latin Church is called an apostolic vicar. Apostolic exarchates are generally exempt (immediately subject to the Holy See), with limited oversight by the patriarch, major archbishop or metropolitan in chief of the particular Eastern Church. If there is no metropolitan in a particular Eastern Catholic church, apostolic exarchates in their territories are directly subjected to Rome. For example, the Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia belongs to the Byzantine Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia, but since there is no metropolitan in that church, the Apostolic Exarch of Serbia is directly subjected to the Holy See.

====Patriarchal exarchs====
A patriarchal exarch is appointed in those Eastern Catholic churches whose head is styled as patriarch. This office is often (not always) given to a consecrated bishop of a titular see. Their appointments are limited to the traditional territory of their church, with main task of governing the region not yet raised to the rank of eparchy (diocese). They may be suffragan to an archdiocese or archeparchy of the Eastern Catholic Church, or be immediately subject to the Patriarch.

====Archiepiscopal exarchs====
Archiepiscopal exarch is appointed in those Eastern Catholic churches whose head is styled as Major Archbishop. The office of &quot;archiepiscopal exarch&quot; is also usually given to a consecrated bishop of a titular see. Appointment of archiepiscopal exarchs is limited to the traditional territory of their particular church. They also may be suffragans to an archdiocese or archeparchy of their Eastern Catholic Church, or be immediately subject to the Major Archbishop.

====Coadjutor exarchs====
In particular cases, usually because of illness or some other problem, an exarch of any rank can be assisted by the appointment of a colleague who is called &quot;coadjutor exarch&quot;. The position of coadjutor exarch towards his superior exarch is similar to the position of Latin coadjutor bishop towards his superior diocesan bishop. Coadjutor exarchs are appointed with rights of succession. For example, in 1993 titular Bishop Christo Proykov of Briula was appointed Coadjutor to Apostolic Exarch of Sofia, Methodius Stratiev, and when the latter died in 1995 the coadjutor exarch succeeded him as the new Apostolic Exarch.

====Auxiliary exarchs====
In practice, exarch of any rank can be additionally assisted by an auxiliary exarch, who is appointed in order to help the exarch in administration of his exarchate. Position of auxiliary exarch towards his superior exarch is similar to position of Latin auxiliary bishop towards his superior diocesan bishop. Auxiliary exarchs are appointed without the rights of succession.

<text>The United States Open Championship, commonly known as the U.S. Open, is the annual open national championship of golf in the United States. It is the third of the four men&#x27;s major golf championships, and is on the official schedule of both the PGA Tour and the European Tour. Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play (4 rounds on an 18-hole course), with the winner being the player with the lowest total number of strokes. It is staged by the United States Golf Association (USGA) in mid-June, scheduled so that, if there are no weather delays, the final round is played on the third Sunday. The U.S. Open is staged at a variety of courses, set up in such a way that scoring is very difficult, with a premium placed on accurate driving. As of 2024, the U.S. Open awards a $21.5 million purse, the largest of all four major championships.

==History==

The first U.S. Open was played on October 4, 1895, on a nine-hole course at the Newport Country Club in Newport, Rhode Island. It was a 36-hole competition and was played in a single day. Ten professionals and one amateur entered. The winner was Horace Rawlins, a 21-year-old Englishman, who had arrived in the U.S. earlier that year to take up a position at the host club. He received $150 cash out of a prize fund of $335, plus a $50 gold medal; his club received the Open Championship Cup trophy, which was presented by the USGA.

In the beginning, the tournament was dominated by experienced British players until 1911, when John J. McDermott became the first native-born American winner. American golfers soon began to win regularly and the tournament evolved to become one of the four majors.

Since 1911, the title has been won mostly by players from the United States. Since 1950, players from only six countries other than the United States have won the championship, most notably South Africa, which has won five times since 1965. A streak of four consecutive non-American winners occurred from 2004 to 2007 for the first time since 1910. These four players, South African Retief Goosen (2004), New Zealander Michael Campbell (2005), Australian Geoff Ogilvy (2006) and Argentine Ángel Cabrera (2007), are all from countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Northern Ireland&#x27;s Graeme McDowell (2010) became the first European player to win the event since Tony Jacklin of England in 1970; three more Europeans won in the next four editions, making it only three American wins in the 11 tournaments from 2004 to 2014.

U.S. Open play is characterized by tight scoring at or around par by the leaders, with the winner usually emerging at around even par. A U.S. Open course is seldom beaten severely, and there have been many over-par wins (in part because par is usually set at 70, except for the very longest courses). Normally, an Open course is quite long and will have a high cut of primary rough (termed &quot;Open rough&quot; by the American press and fans); undulating greens (such as at Pinehurst No. 2 in 2005, which was described by Johnny Miller of NBC as &quot;like trying to hit a ball on top of a VW Beetle&quot;); pinched fairways (especially on what are expected to be less difficult holes); and two or three holes that are short par fives under regular play would be used as long par fours during the tournament (often to meet that frequently used par of 70, forcing players to have accurate long drives). Some courses that are attempting to get into the rotation for the U.S. Open will undergo renovations to develop these features. Rees Jones is the most notable of the &quot;Open Doctors&quot; who take on these projects; his father Robert Trent Jones had filled that role earlier. As with any professional golf tournament, the available space surrounding the course (for spectators, among other considerations) and local infrastructure also factor into deciding which courses will host the event.

==Qualification==
The U.S. Open is open to any professional, or to any amateur with a USGA Handicap Index not exceeding 0.4. Players (male or female) may obtain a place by being fully exempt or by competing successfully in qualifying. The field is 156 players.

About half of the field is made up of players who are fully exempt from qualifying. The current exemption categories are:
* Winners of the U.S. Open for the last ten years
* Winner and runner-up from the previous year&#x27;s U.S. Amateur and winners of the previous year&#x27;s U.S. Junior Amateur and U.S. Mid-Amateur
** The runner-up from the U.S. Amateur, the winner of the U.S. Junior Amateur, and U.S. Mid-Amateur must remain an amateur. 
** The winner of the U.S. Amateur, however, may turn professional after winning the U.S. Amateur and retain his eligibility.
* Winner of the previous year&#x27;s Amateur Championship
* The previous year&#x27;s Mark H. McCormack Medal winner for the top-ranked amateur golfer in the world
* Winners of each of Masters Tournament, Open Championship and PGA Championship for the last five years
* Winners of the last three Players Championships
* Winner of the current year&#x27;s BMW PGA Championship
* Winner of the last U.S. Senior Open
* Players who win multiple U.S. PGA Tour events during the time between tournaments, provided the tournaments each offer 500 or more points to the winner, and are not opposite-field events.
* In the year after the Olympic golf tournament, the reigning men&#x27;s gold medalist
* Top 10 finishers and ties from the previous year&#x27;s U.S. Open
* Players who qualified for the previous year&#x27;s Tour Championship
* The top 60 in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) as of two weeks before the start of the tournament
* The top 60 in the OWGR as of the tournament date
* The top player in the PGA Tour second-tier developmental series points, based on &quot;combined&quot; points from the Regular Season and Finals, from the previous season (starting in 2023).
* Special exemptions selected by the USGA
* All remaining spots after the second top 60 OWGR cutoff date filled by alternates from qualifying tournaments.

The exemptions for amateurs apply only if the players remain amateurs as of the tournament date, except for the U.S. Amateur champion. On August 5, 2019, the USGA announced a rule change stating a player may turn professional and still retain his U.S. Open exemption. Note that this tournament typically takes place after the collegiate season has ended, so players may turn professional immediately after their last collegiate event (typically the end of the NCAA final of their senior year) in order to maximize the number of FedEx Cup points they may score before the August cutoff to avoid qualifying school.

Before 2011, the sole OWGR cutoff for entry was the top 50 as of two weeks before the tournament. An exemption category for the top 50 as of the tournament date was added for 2011, apparently in response to the phenomenon of golfers entering the top 50 between the original cutoff date and the tournament (such as Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler in 2010).

Through 2011, exemptions existed for leading money winners on the PGA, European, Japanese, and Australasian tours, as well as winners of multiple PGA Tour events in the year before the U.S. Open. These categories were eliminated in favor of inviting the top 60 on the OWGR at both relevant dates. Starting with the 2012 championship, an exemption was added for the winner of the current year&#x27;s BMW PGA Championship, the European Tour&#x27;s equivalent of The Players Championship.

Potential competitors who are not fully exempt must enter the Qualifying process, which has two stages. Firstly there is Local Qualifying, which is played over 18 holes at more than 100 courses around the United States. Many leading players are exempt from this first stage, and they join the successful local qualifiers at the Sectional Qualifying stage, which is played over 36 holes in one day at several sites in the U.S., as well as one each in Europe and Japan. There is no lower age limit and the youngest-ever qualifier was 14-year-old Andy Zhang of China, who qualified in 2012 after Paul Casey withdrew days before the tournament.

===USGA special exemptions===
The USGA has granted a special exemption to 35 players 53 times since 1966. Players with special exemptions include: Arnold Palmer (1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1994), Seve Ballesteros (1978, 1994), Gary Player (1981, 1983), Lee Trevino (1983, 1984), Hale Irwin (1990, 2002, 2003), Jack Nicklaus (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000), Tom Watson (1993, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2010), and Tiger Woods (2024).

Irwin won the 1990 U.S. Open after accepting a special exemption. In 2016, a special exemption was extended to former champion Retief Goosen (2001, 2004). In 2018, a special exemption was extended to former U.S. Open champions Jim Furyk (2003) and Ernie Els (1994, 1997).

==Prizes==
The purse at the 2017 U.S. Open was $12 million, and the winner&#x27;s share was $2.16 million. The European Tour uses conversion rates at the time of the tournament to calculate the official prize money used in their Race to Dubai (€10,745,927 in 2017).

In line with the other majors, winning the U.S. Open gives a golfer several privileges that make his career much more secure if he is not already one of the elite players of the sport. U.S. Open champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the Masters, The Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship) for the next five years. They are also automatically invited to play in The Players Championship for the next five years, and they are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open itself for 10 years.

Winners may also receive a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour, which is automatic for regular members. Non-PGA Tour members who win the U.S. Open have the choice of joining the PGA Tour either within 60 days of winning, or prior to the beginning of any one of the next five tour seasons.

Finally, U.S. Open winners receive automatic invitations to three of the five senior majors once they turn 50; they receive a five-year invitation to the U.S. Senior Open and a lifetime invitation to the Senior PGA Championship and Senior British Open.

The top 10 finishers at the U.S. Open are fully exempt from qualifying for the following year&#x27;s Open, and the top four are automatically invited to the following season&#x27;s Masters.

==Playoff format==
Up to 2017, the U.S. Open retained a full 18-hole playoff the following day (Monday). If a tie existed after that fifth round, then the playoff continued as sudden-death on the 91st hole. The U.S. Open advanced to sudden-death three times (1990, 1994, 2008), most recently when Tiger Woods defeated Rocco Mediate on the first additional playoff hole in 2008. Before sudden-death was introduced in the 1950s, additional 18-hole rounds were played (1925, 1939, 1946 and 1965) to break the tie. When the playoff was scheduled for 36 holes and ended in a tie, as in 1931, a second 36-hole playoff was required.

Since 2018, the USGA adopted a two-hole aggregate playoff format, after consulting fans, players and media partners. Sudden death will still be played if the playoff ends tied.

==Broadcasting==
Beginning with the 2020 tournament, NBCUniversal holds domestic television rights (with coverage on NBC, USA Network and Peacock), having taken over the remainder of the 12-year deal with the USGA signed by Fox Sports in 2013 that gave it exclusive rights to USGA championships from 2015 through 2026. With the postponed 2020 U.S. Open Championship presenting a significant scheduling challenge due to its other fall sports commitments, Fox had held discussions with the USGA over broadcasting the tournament on their cable network FS1 or partnering with NBC. Ultimately, the issues led the network to transfer the final seven years of its contract entirely. In 2020 and 2021, early round NBC cable coverage was carried on Golf Channel, beginning with the 2022 tournament this coverage was moved to the more available USA Network.

Coverage was previously televised by NBC and ESPN through 2014. NBC&#x27;s first period as rightsholder began in 1995; ABC held the broadcast rights from 1966 through 1994.

In Australia, from 2015 Fox Sports Australia is the exclusive broadcaster of the U.S. open until 2018.

<doc id="223861" wikidata="Q5083724" url="?curid=223861" title="Charles Wreford-Brown">
<text>Charles Wreford-Brown (9 October 1866 – 26 November 1951) was an English sportsman. He captained the England national football team and was a county cricketer during the Victorian age, and later acted as a sports legislator during the 20th century. Wreford-Brown is usually credited with inventing the term &quot;soccer&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;association football&quot;.

==Upbringing and amateur status==
Wreford-Brown was born in Bristol went to Charterhouse School before studying at Oriel College, Oxford. Given his privileged economic status at the time of the rise in the popularity of football, Wreford-Brown was one of a select few who were able to play sports for no monetary gain whatsoever.

The educated belief in the purity of a noble athletic spirit untainted by the corrupting influence of money was embodied within the rise of the Corinthian football club that Wreford-Brown played for in the 1890s. Indeed, in 1906 Wreford-Brown was one of the leading figures in the movement to create the Amateur Football Alliance in London in order to keep the amateur game separate from the Football Association, an organisation that the amateur clubs found to be increasingly driven by the financial gain of the professional clubs.

==Sporting Achievement==
He was a keen sportsman at the University of Oxford and played both cricket and football for the university. He also later played cricket for Gloucestershire. His younger brother, Oswald (who died during the first World War in 1916) and son Anthony would, like him, also play for first-class cricket but none were stand-outs with the willow.

However it is as a footballer that he is more recognised. He first played as a goalkeeper but played initially as a stop-gap but later as the mainstay centre-half for the Old Carthusians (the club for ex-Charterhouse boys) (appearing against them in the 1896 London Charity Cup final, Clifton Association (the Association which took in Bristol and its environs and with whom he played in the inaugural Gloucestershire Cup), as well as the Corinthians and captained England twice against Wales in 1894 and 1895 (when the team consisted entirely of amateur players).

Steve Bloomer, one of the leading &quot;players&quot; (professionals) on the England team, recorded in a memoir that, as captain, the patrician Wreford-Brown on one occasion took to the field with a deep pocket in his shorts filled with gold sovereigns and pressed one of the coins into the hand of each professional goalscorer after the man had netted.

==Corinthian FC==

Charles Wreford-Brown was a leading figure for the era&#x27;s most prominent football club, Corinthian FC. A constant figure throughout the club&#x27;s golden era, he played 161 games for the club, scoring 8 goals. In 1894, Corinthian FC became the only club still to this day, to ever fully represent the England National side, and Charles Wreford-Brown would captain the side. He would too, when the extraordinary feat was repeated a year later.

Corinthian FC were strict amateurs who believed in fair play and who had the &quot;Corinthian Spirit&quot; named in their honour. They are the team credited with having popularised the sport around the world with many tours and with them, Wreford-Brown travelled to South Africa, USA, Canada, Sweden and Denmark.

A strong defender, Wreford-Brown played in some of the club&#x27;s famous victories over professional opponents such as Liverpool, Southampton, Sunderland and Spurs.

==Legislator==
He was first appointed to the council of The Football Association to represent the Old Carthusians in 1892 but soon after served as the representative for Oxford University, a position he held until his death some 59 years later. He later became Chairman of the International Selection Committee for England within the Football Association.

He was in attendance at the first meeting of the Athenian League on 27 May 1914. He served as a vice-president of the FA from 1941 until his death in 1951, under Sir Stanley Rous, secretary of the Association. They have been credited with guiding the Association toward a more educated position, promoting youth coaching and training just before hostilities in 1939.

He was also a keen chess player. In 1924, in Paris Charles Wreford-Brown participated in unofficial Chess Olympiad. He took part in the 1933 British Chess Championship, though he had to drop out through illness after two rounds (he had won the first game and drawn the second).

<text>The Carbonari () was an informal network of secret revolutionary societies active in Italy from about 1800 to 1831. The Carbonari may have further influenced other revolutionary groups in France, Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Uruguay, the Ottoman Empire, and Russia. Although their goals often had a patriotic and liberal basis, they lacked a clear immediate political agenda. They were a focus for those unhappy with the repressive political situation in Italy following 1815, especially in the south of the Italian peninsula. Members of the Carbonari, and those influenced by them, took part in important events in the process of Italian unification (called the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;), especially the failed Revolution of 1820, and in the further development of Italian nationalism. The chief purpose was to defeat tyranny and establish a constitutional government. In the north of Italy, other groups, such as the Adelfia and the Filadelfia, were associated organizations.
==Organization==
The Carbonari were a secret society divided into small covert cells scattered across Italy. Although agendas varied, evidence suggests that despite regional variations, most of them agreed upon the creation of a liberal, unified Italy. The Carbonari were anti-clerical in both their philosophy and programme. The Papal constitution Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo and the encyclical &quot;Qui pluribus&quot; were directed against them. The controversial document Alta Vendita, which called for a liberal or modernist takeover of the Catholic Church, was attributed to the Sicilian Carbonari.

==History==

===Origins===
Although it is not clear where they were established, they first came to prominence in the Kingdom of Naples during the Napoleonic wars. Although some of the society&#x27;s documents claimed that it had origins in medieval France, and that its progenitors were under the sponsorship of Francis I of France during the sixteenth century, this claim cannot be verified by outside sources. Although a plethora of theories have been advanced as to the origins of the Carbonari, the organization most probably emerged as an offshoot of Freemasonry, as part of the spread of liberal ideas from the French Revolution. They first became influential in the Kingdom of Naples (under the control of Joachim Murat) and in the Papal States, the most resistant opposition to the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;.

As a secret society that was often targeted for suppression by conservative governments, the Carbonari operated largely in secret. The name &quot;Carbonari&quot; identified the members as rural &quot;charcoal-burners&quot;; the place where they met was called a &quot;Barack&quot;, the members called themselves &quot;good cousins&quot;, while people who did not belong to the Carbonari were &quot;Pagani&quot;. There were special ceremonies to initiate the members.

The aim of the Carbonari was the creation of a constitutional monarchy or a republic; they wanted also to defend the rights of common people against all forms of absolutism. Carbonari, to achieve their purpose, talked of fomenting armed revolts.

The membership was separated into two classes—apprentice and master. There were two ways to become a master: through serving as an apprentice for at least six months or by already being a Freemason upon entry. Their initiation rituals were structured around the trade of charcoal-selling, suiting their name.

In 1814 the Carbonari wanted to obtain a constitution for the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies by force. The Bourbon king, Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, was opposed to them. The Bonapartist Joachim Murat had wanted to create a united and independent Italy. In 1815 Ferdinand I found his kingdom swarming with them. He found an unhoped-for ally in the secret sect of the Calderari, that had separated from the Carbonari in 1813. Staunchly Catholics and legitimists, the Calderari swore to defend the Church and vowed eternal hatred to Freemasons and Carbonari. Society in the &quot;Regno&quot; comprised nobles, officers of the army, small landlords, government officials, peasants, and priests, with a small urban middle class. Society was dominated by the Papacy. On 15 August 1814, Cardinals Ercole Consalvi and Bartolomeo Pacca issued an edict forbidding all secret societies, to become members of these secret associations, to attend their meetings, or to furnish a meeting-place for such, under severe penalties.

===1820 and 1821 uprisings===

The Carbonari first arose during the resistance to the French occupation, notably under Joachim Murat, the Bonapartist King of Naples. However, once the wars ended, they became a nationalist organization with a marked anti-Austrian tendency and were instrumental in organizing revolutions in Italy in 1820–1821 and 1831.

The 1820 revolution began in Naples against King Ferdinand I. Riots, inspired by events in Cádiz, Spain that same year, took place in Naples, bandying anti-absolutist goals and demanding a liberal constitution. On 1 July, two officers, Michele Morelli and Joseph Silvati (who had been part of the army of Murat under Guglielmo Pepe) marched towards the town of Nola in Campania at the head of their regiments of cavalry.

Worried about the protests, King Ferdinand agreed to grant a new constitution and the adoption of a parliament. The victory, albeit partial, illusory, and apparent, caused a lot of hope in the peninsula and local conspirators, led by Santore di Santarosa, marched toward Turin, capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia and 12 March 1821 obtained a constitutional monarchy and liberal reforms as a result of Carbonari actions. However, the Holy Alliance did not tolerate such revolutionary compromises and in February 1821 sent an army that defeated the outnumbered and poorly equipped insurgents in the south. In Piedmont, King Vittorio Emanuele I, undecided about what to do, abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix of Sardinia; but Charles Felix, more resolute, invited an Austrian military intervention. On 8 April, the Habsburg army defeated the rebels, and the uprisings of 1820–1821, triggered almost entirely by the Carbonari, ended up collapsing.

On 13 September 1821, Pope Pius VII with the bull &quot;Ecclesiam a Jesu Christo&quot; condemned the Carbonari as a Freemason secret society, excommunicating its members.

Among the principal leaders of the Carbonari, Morelli and Silvati were sentenced to death; Pepe went into exile; Federico Confalonieri, Silvio Pellico and Piero Maroncelli were imprisoned.

===1831 uprisings===

The Carbonari were beaten but not defeated; they took part in the revolution of July 1830 that supported the liberal policy of King Louis Philippe of France on the wings of victory for the uprising in Paris. The Italian Carbonari took up arms against some states in central and northern Italy, particularly the Papal States and Modena.

Ciro Menotti was to take the reins of the initiative, trying to find the support of Duke Francis IV of Modena, who pretended to respond positively in return for granting the title of King of Italy, but the Duke made the double play and Menotti, virtually unarmed, was arrested the day before the date fixed for the uprising. Francis IV, at the suggestion of the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, had condemned him to death, along with many others among Menotti&#x27;s allies. This was the last major effort by the secret group.

===Aftermath===

In 1820, the Neapolitan Carbonari once more took up arms, to wring a constitution from King Ferdinand I. They advanced against the capital from Nola under a military officer and Abbot Minichini. They were joined by General Pepe and many officers and government officials, and the king took an oath to observe the Spanish constitution in Naples. The movement spread to Piedmont, and Victor Emmanuel resigned from the throne in favour of his brother Charles Felix. The Carbonari secretly continued their agitation against Austria and the governments in a friendly connection with it. Pope Pius VII issued a general condemnation of the secret society of the Carbonari. The association lost its influence by degrees and was gradually absorbed into the new political organizations that sprang up in Italy; its members became affiliated especially with Mazzini&#x27;s &quot;Young Italy&quot;. From Italy, the organization was carried to France where it appeared as the Charbonnerie, which, was divided into verses. Members were especially numerous in Paris. The chief aim of the association in France also was political, namely, to obtain a constitution in which the conception of the sovereignty of the people could find expression. From Paris, the movement spread rapidly through the country, and it was the cause of several mutinies among the troops; it lost its importance after several conspirators were executed, especially as quarrels broke out among the leaders. The Charbonnerie took part in the Revolution of 1830; after the fall of the Bourbons, its influence rapidly declined. After this, a Charbonnerie démocratique was formed among the French Republicans; after 1841, nothing more was heard of it. Carbonari was also to be found in Spain, but their numbers and importance were more limited than in the other Romance countries.

In 1830, Carbonari took part in the July Revolution in France. This gave them hope that a successful revolution might be staged in Italy. A bid in Modena was an outright failure, but in February 1831, several cities in the Papal States rose and flew the Carbonari tricolour. A volunteer force marched on Rome but was destroyed by Austrian troops who had intervened at the request of Pope Gregory XVI. After the failed uprisings of 1831, the governments of the various Italian states cracked down on the Carbonari, who now virtually ceased to exist. The more astute members realized they could never take on the Austrian army in open battle and joined a new movement, Giovane Italia (&#x27;Young Italy&#x27;) led by the nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini, in which many members would trace their origins and inspiration to the Carbonari. Rapidly declining in influence and members, the Carbonari practically ceased to exist, although the official history of this important company had continued, wearily, until 1848. Independent from French Philadelphians were instead the homonymous &quot;carbonara&quot; group born in Southern Italy, especially in Puglia and in the Cilento, between 1816 and 1828. In Cilento, in 1828, an insurrection of Philadelphia, who called for the restoration of the Neapolitan Constitution of 1820, was fiercely repressed by the director of the Bourbon police Francesco Saverio Del Carretto, whose violent retaliation included the destruction of the village of Bosco.
==Holy protector==
The members of Carboneria recognize Theobald of Provins as the patron saint of charcoal burners as well as tanners. In fact, for example, Felice Orsini&#x27;s father, who belonged to Carboneria, wanted to give him the name of Orso Teobaldo Felice.

==Prominent members==

Prominent members of the Carbonari included:
*Gabriele Rossetti
*Amand Bazard
*Silvio Pellico (1788–1854) and Pietro Maroncelli (1795–1846)
: both were imprisoned by the Austrians for years, many of which they spent in Spielberg fortress in Brno, Southern Moravia. After his release, Pellico wrote the book &quot;Le mie prigioni&quot;, describing in detail his ten-year ordeal. Maroncelli lost one leg in prison and was instrumental in translating and editing of Pellico&#x27;s book in Paris (1833).
*Giuseppe Mazzini
*Marquis de Lafayette (hero of the American and French Revolutions),
*Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (the future French emperor Napoleon III) Almost certain but highly disputed.
*French revolutionary Louis Auguste Blanqui.
*Lord Byron
*Giuseppe Garibaldi

==Legacy==

===In Portugal===

The Portuguese Carbonari () was first founded there in 1822 but was soon disbanded.

A new organization of the same name and claiming to be its continuation was founded in 1896 by Artur Augusto Duarte da Luz de Almeida. This organization was active in efforts to educate the people and was involved in various antimonarchist conspiracies. Most notably, &quot;Carbonária&quot; members were active in the assassination of King Charles I and his heir, Prince Louis Philip in 1908. &quot;Carbonária&quot; members also played a part in the 5 October 1910 revolution that deposed the Constitutional Monarchy and implemented the republic. One commonality among them was their hostility to the Church and they contributed to the republic&#x27;s anticlericalism.

===Elsewhere in Europe===
Two results of great importance in the progress of the European Revolution (Revolutions of 1848) proceeded from the events that occurred at Naples in 1820-21. One was the reorganization of the Carbonari, consequent upon the publicity given to their organization when it had brought about the revolution (and the secrecy in which it had hitherto been enveloped was no longer deemed necessary); the other was the extension of the organization beyond the Alps. When the Neapolitan revolution had been effected, the Carbonari emerged from their mystery, published their constitution statutes, and ceased to conceal their program and their cards of membership.

In particular, the dispersion of the Carbonari leaders had, at the same time, the effect of extending their influence in France. General Guglielmo Pepe proceeded to Barcelona when the counter-revolution was imminent at Naples and his life was no longer safe there; and to the same city went several of the Piedmontese revolutionists when the country was Austrianized after the same lawless fashion. The dispersion of Scalvini and Ugoni that took refuge at Geneva and others of the proscribed that proceeded to London added to the progress which Carbonarism was making in France, suggested to General Pepe the idea of an international secret society, which would combine for a common purpose the advanced political reformers of all the European States.

===South America===

Giuseppe Garibaldi has been called the &quot;Hero of the Two Worlds&quot; because of his military enterprises in Brazil, Uruguay and Europe. In 1836, Garibaldi took up the cause of Republic of Rio Grande do Sul in its attempt to separate from the Empire of Brazil, joining the rebels known as the Ragamuffins in the Ragamuffin War (1835-1845). In 1841, Garibaldi moved to Montevideo, Uruguay. In 1842, he took command of the Uruguayan fleet and raised an &quot;Italian Legion&quot; of soldiers for the Uruguayan Civil War (1839-1851). He aligned his forces with a faction composed of the Uruguayan Colorados and the Argentine Unitarios. This faction received support from the French and British Empires in their struggle against the forces of the Uruguayan Government and Argentine Federales.

===In literature===
The story &quot;Vanina Vanini&quot; by Stendhal involved a hero in the Carbonari and a heroine who became obsessed with this. It was made into a film in 1961.

Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s story &quot;The Pavilion on the Links&quot; features the Carbonari as the villains of the plot.

Katherine Neville&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fire&quot; features the Carbonari as part of a plot involving a mystical chess service.

In Wilkie Collins&#x27; &quot;The Woman in White&quot; the character of Professor Pesca is a member of &#x27;The Brotherhood&#x27;, an organization placed contemporaneously with, and similarly featured as, the Carbonari. Clyde Hyder suspects that the model for Prof. Pesca was Gabriele Rossetti, who was a member of the Carbonari, as well as an Italian teacher resident in London during the 1840s.

Anton Felix Schindler&#x27;s biography of Beethoven &quot;Beethoven, as I Knew Him&quot; states that his close connection with the composer began in 1815 when the latter requested an account of Schindler&#x27;s involvement with a riot of Napoleon&#x27;s supporters in Vienna, who were agitating against the Carbonari uprisings. Schindler was arrested and lost a year at college. Beethoven was sympathetic and, as a result, became a close friend of Schindler.

The Carbonari are mentioned prominently in the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Adventure of the Red Circle&quot; (1911), written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

The Carbonari are also mentioned briefly in the book &quot;Resurrection Men&quot; by T. K. Welsh, in which the main character&#x27;s father is a member of the secret organization.

They feature in Tim Powers&#x27; &quot;The Stress of Her Regard&quot; as opponents of the vampire-backed Austrian Empire.

Mr. Settembrini&#x27;s grandfather in Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; is said to be Carbonari.

The Carbonari are mentioned in &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, part of the Aubrey-Maturin series.

Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Cemetery of Prague&quot; mentions the Carbonari, with the main character joining them as a spy.

In The Horseman on the Roof , the character of Angelo Pardi is a young Italian Carbonaro colonel of hussars

They also appear in Carmen Mola&#x27;s novel &quot;La Bestia&quot; (2021).

<text>Warren Augustine Bechtel (September 12, 1872 – August 28, 1933) was the founder of the Bechtel Corporation, the 2nd largest construction company in the United States as of 2022.

== Early life ==
Warren Augustine Bechtel was born on September 12, 1872, on a stock farm in Freeport, Illinois, as the fifth child of Elizabeth (Bentz) and John Moyer Bechtel in a family of two boys and five girls. In 1884, his family moved to Kansas. In 1891, Warren graduated from Peabody High School in Peabody, Kansas. In 1897, Warren married Clara Alice West, from Aurora, Indiana, whom he had met while she visited her uncle (E.F. Davison) in Peabody.

== Career ==
In 1898, Bechtel and his wife moved from their farm near Peabody, Kansas, to the Oklahoma Territory to construct railroads with his own team of mules. Bechtel moved his family frequently between construction sites around the Western United States for the next several years and eventually moved to Oakland, California, in 1904, where he worked as the superintendent on the Western Pacific Railroad on its Richmond and Santa Fe lines. In 1906, W. A. Bechtel won his first subcontract to build part of the Oroville-to-Oakland section of the Western Pacific Railroad. The same year, he bought his own steam shovel, becoming a pioneer of the new technology. He painted &quot;W.A. Bechtel Co.&quot; on the side of the steam shovel, effectively establishing Bechtel as a company though it was not yet incorporated.

Over the next 20 years, Bechtel built a sizable contracting business that specialized in railroad and highway building. One of Bechtel&#x27;s earliest major contracts was grading the site of the Oroville, California, depot for the Western Pacific Railroad, then under construction. In 1919, Warren Bechtel and his partners (including his brother Arthur) built the Klamath Highway in California, and in 1921, Warren Bechtel partners won a contract to build the water tunnels for the Caribou Hydroelectric Facility in that state. In 1925, Warren, his sons Warren Jr, Stephen, Kenneth, and his brother Arthur (Art) joined to incorporate as W.A. Bechtel Company. In 1926, the new company won its first major contract, the Bowman Lake dam in Nevada County, California. The firm would later partner with other companies to form Six Companies to help engineer the famous Hoover Dam over the Colorado River, still considered the largest civil engineering project in US history. In 1930, Bechtel constructed a natural gas pipeline from Tracy, California, to Crockett, California, for Standard Oil and a pipeline from Milpitas, California, to Tres Pinos, California, for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. In 1931, Bechtel replaced William Henry Wattis as president of the Six Companies.

== Death ==

Bechtel died of an accidental insulin overdose on a business visit to Moscow, Soviet Union, to inspect the Dnieprostroi Dam, in 1933. He died in the Hotel National. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.

== Legacy ==
His son, Stephen D. Bechtel Sr., took over the firm upon his father&#x27;s death. The Bechtel Corporation is still owned and operated by the Bechtel family. Its current CEO is Brendan Bechtel.

In 1997, Warren was inducted into the Kansas Business Hall of Fame.

<text>Stephen Davison Bechtel (September 24, 1900 – March 14, 1989) was the son of Clara Alice West and Warren A. Bechtel, founder of the Bechtel Corporation. He was the president of the company from 1933 to 1960.

==Early life==
Stephen Davison Bechtel was born on September 24, 1900, in Aurora, Indiana to Warren A. Bechtel. He grew up in construction camps, living with his father as he traveled to construction projects. He graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1918, and served with the 20th Engineer Brigade, part of the American Expeditionary Force sent to assist France in World War I. In 1919, after the war, he attended the University of California, Berkeley for one year and left to work for his father&#x27;s company full-time.

In 1923, Bechtel married Laura Adeline Peart, a Berkeley alumna, who would help her husband build the family-owned business into one of the world&#x27;s largest engineering and construction firms.

==Bechtel Company==
In 1925, Warren A. Bechtel, his sons Warren Jr, Stephen Sr, Kenneth (Ken), and his brother Arthur (Art) joined to incorporate as &quot;W.A. Bechtel Company&quot;. Stephen Sr. became vice-president of Bechtel in 1925. His father, Warren A. Bechtel, died suddenly while traveling to the Soviet Union in 1933. That came at a critical time for the company: concrete was being poured for the Hoover Dam, Bechtel&#x27;s largest project. Stephen became president in 1935 and saw the company through the construction of the dam.

Over the next 30 years, Stephen expanded Bechtel into a huge and successful engineering company with operations all over the world. He handed the presidency of the company over to his son, Stephen Jr. in 1960 but stayed on as the chairman until 1969.

Berkeley awarded Bechtel an honorary degree in Agricultural Science in 1954, and in 1980, it completed construction of the Bechtel Engineering Center, which was named in his honor. Before this the building was known as the Mechanics Building.

In 1976, Bechtel received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Death and legacy==
Stephen Bechtel died on March 14, 1989, at Merritt Peralta Medical Center in Oakland, California. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.

Stephen was named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.

The undergraduate engineering center of the University of California, Berkeley was named the &quot;Bechtel Engineering Center.&quot;

One of the buildings of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture at the American University of Beirut (AUB) is named &quot;The Bechtel Engineering Building&quot; after its donor, Stephen Bechtel.
