<text>William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, (10 August 1729 – 12 July 1814), was a British Army officer who rose to become Commander-in-Chief of British land forces in the Colonies during the American War of Independence. Howe was one of three brothers who had distinguished military careers. In historiography of the American war he is usually referred to as Sir William Howe to distinguish him from his brother Richard, who was 4th Viscount Howe at that time.

Having joined the army in 1746, Howe saw extensive service in the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven Years&#x27; War. He became known for his role in the capture of Quebec in 1759 when he led a British force to capture the cliffs at Anse-au-Foulon, allowing James Wolfe to land his army and engage the French in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Howe also participated in the campaigns to take Louisbourg, Belle Île and Havana. He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, a post he held until 1795.

Howe was sent to North America in March 1775, arriving in May after the American War of Independence broke out. After leading British troops to a costly victory in the Battle of Bunker Hill, Howe took command of all British forces in America from Thomas Gage in September of that year. Howe&#x27;s record in North America was marked by the successful capture of both New York City and Philadelphia. However, poor campaign planning for 1777 contributed to the failure of John Burgoyne&#x27;s Saratoga campaign, which played a major role in the entry of France into the war. Howe&#x27;s role in developing those plans and the degree to which he was responsible for British failures that year (despite his personal success at Philadelphia) have both been subjects of contemporary and historic debate.

He was knighted after his successes in 1776. He resigned his post as Commander-in-Chief, British land forces in America, in 1777, and the next year returned to England, where he was at times active in the defence of the British Isles. He sat in the House of Commons from 1758 to 1780 for Nottingham. He inherited the Viscountcy of Howe upon the death of his brother Richard in 1799. He married, but had no children, and the viscountcy became extinct with his death in 1814.

==Early life and career==

William Howe was born in England, the third son of Emanuel Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe, and Charlotte, the daughter of Sophia von Kielmansegg, Countess of Leinster and Darlington, an acknowledged illegitimate half-sister of King George I. His mother was a regular in the courts of George II and George III. This connection with the crown may have improved the careers of all four sons, but all were also very capable officers. His father was a politician, who served as Governor of Barbados where he died in 1735. William&#x27;s eldest brother, General George Howe, was killed just before the 1758 Battle of Carillon at Fort Ticonderoga. Another brother, Admiral Richard Howe, rose to become one of Britain&#x27;s leading naval commanders. A third brother, Thomas, commanded ships for the East India Company, Winchelsea in 1762–1764 and Nottingham in 1766, and made observations on Madeira and on the Comoro Islands.

William entered the army when he was 17 by buying a cornet&#x27;s commission in the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s Dragoons in 1746, becoming a lieutenant the following year. He then served for two years in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession. After the war he was transferred to the 20th Regiment of Foot, where he became a friend of James Wolfe.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
During the Seven Years&#x27; War Howe&#x27;s service first brought him to America, and did much to raise his reputation. Promoted to the rank of major in 1756, he joined the newly formed 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot in February 1757, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in December of that year. He commanded the regiment at the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758, leading an amphibious landing under heavy enemy fire. This action won the attackers a flanking position and earned Howe a commendation from Wolfe.

Howe commanded a light infantry battalion under General Wolfe during the 1759 Siege of Quebec. He was in the Battle of Beauport, and was chosen by Wolfe to lead the ascent from the Saint Lawrence River up to the Plains of Abraham that led to the British victory in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on 13 September 1759. After spending the winter in the defence of Quebec City, his regiment fought in the April 1760 Battle of Sainte-Foy and subsequent siege of Quebec. He then led a brigade in the decisive Montreal Campaign under Jeffery Amherst before returning to England. Howe led a brigade in the 1761 Capture of Belle Île, off the French coast, and turned down the opportunity to become military governor after its capture so that he might continue in active service. He served as adjutant general of the force that captured Havana in 1762, playing a part in a skirmish at Guanabacoa.

In 1758, Howe was elected a member of parliament for Nottingham, succeeding to the seat vacated by his brother George&#x27;s death. His election was assisted by the influence of his mother, who campaigned on behalf of her son while he was away at war, and may very well have been undertaken because service in Parliament was seen as a common way to improve one&#x27;s prospects for advancement in the military. In 1764 he was promoted to colonel of the 46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot, and in 1768 he was appointed lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight. As tensions rose between Britain and the colonies in the 1770s, Howe continued to rise through the ranks, and came to be widely regarded as one of the best officers in the army. He was promoted to major general in 1772, and in 1774 introduced new training drills for light infantry companies.

In Parliament he was generally sympathetic to the American colonies. He publicly opposed the collection of legislation intended to punish the Thirteen Colonies known as Intolerable Acts, and in 1774 assured his constituents that he would resist active duty against the Americans and asserted that the entire British army could not conquer America. He also let government ministers know privately that he was prepared to serve in America as second in command to Thomas Gage, whom he knew was unpopular in government circles. In early 1775, when King George called on him to serve, he accepted, claiming publicly that if he did not, he would suffer &quot;the odious name of backwardness to serve my country in distress.&quot; He sailed for America in March 1775, accompanied by Major Generals Henry Clinton and John Burgoyne. In May 1775 his colonelcy was transferred to the 23rd Fusiliers.

==American War of Independence==
Howe was first sent to Boston. Privately, he did not agree with the policy of the government towards the colonists, and regretted in particular that he was sent to Boston, where the memory of his brother George was still cherished by the inhabitants, and General Gage, in whom he had no confidence, was commander-in-chief.
Along with fellow British Army Generals Clinton and Burgoyne, Howe arrived there aboard on 25 May 1775, having learned en route that war had broken out with the skirmishes at the marches to Lexington and Concord in April. The &quot;Cerberus&quot; provided naval reinforcement at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He led a force of 4,000 troops sent to reinforce the 5,000 troops under General Thomas Gage who were besieged in the city after those battles. Gage, Howe, and Generals Clinton and Burgoyne discussed plans to break the siege. They formulated a plan to seize high ground around Boston and attack the besieging colonial militia forces, setting its execution for 18 June. However, the colonists learned of the plan and fortified the heights of Breed&#x27;s Hill and nearby Bunker Hill on the Charlestown peninsula across the Charles River from Boston on the night of 16–17 June, forcing the British leadership to rethink their strategy.

===Bunker Hill and Boston===
In a war council held early on 17 June, the generals developed a plan calling for a direct assault on the colonial fortification, and Gage gave Howe command of the operation. Despite a sense of urgency (the colonists were still working on the fortifications at the time of the council), the attack, now known as the Battle of Bunker Hill, did not begin until that afternoon. With Howe personally leading the right wing of the attack, the first two assaults were firmly repulsed by the colonial defenders. Howe&#x27;s third assault gained the objective, but the cost of the day&#x27;s battle was appallingly heavy. The British casualties, more than 1,000 killed or wounded, were the highest of any engagement in the war. Howe described it as a &quot;success ... too dearly bought.&quot; Although Howe exhibited courage on the battlefield, his tactics and overwhelming confidence were criticised. One subordinate wrote that Howe&#x27;s &quot;absurd and destructive confidence&quot; played a role in the number of casualties incurred.
Although Howe was not injured in the battle, it had a pronounced effect on his spirit. According to British historian George Otto Trevelyan, the battle &quot;exercised a permanent and most potent influence&quot; especially on Howe&#x27;s behaviour, and that Howe&#x27;s military skills thereafter &quot;were apt to fail him at the very moment when they were especially wanted.&quot; Despite an outward appearance of confidence and popularity with his troops, the &quot;genial six-footer with a face some people described as &#x27;coarse, privately often exhibited a lack of self-confidence, and in later campaigns became somewhat dependent on his older brother Richard (the admiral in the Royal Navy, also on station in the Colonies) for advice and approval.

On 11 October 1775, General Gage sailed for England, and Howe took over as Commander-in-Chief of British land forces in America. British military planners in London had, with the outbreak of hostilities, begun planning a massive reinforcement of the troops in North America. Their plans, made with recommendations from Howe, called for the abandonment of Boston and the establishment of bases in New York and Newport, Rhode Island in an attempt to isolate the rebellion to New England. When orders arrived in November to execute these plans, Howe opted to remain in Boston for the winter and begin the campaign in 1776. As a result, the remainder of the Siege of Boston was largely a stalemate. Howe never attempted a major engagement with the Continental Army, which had come under the command of Major General George Washington. He did, however, spend a fair amount of time at the gambling tables, and allegedly established a relationship with Elizabeth Lloyd Loring, the wife of Loyalist Joshua Loring, Jr. Loring apparently acquiesced to this arrangement, and was rewarded by Howe with the position of commissary of prisoners. Contemporaries and historians have criticised Howe for both his gambling and the amount of time he supposedly spent with Mrs. Loring, with some going so far as to level accusations that this behaviour interfered with his military activities; historian John Alden does not give these ideas credence. The alleged relationship is also mentioned in &quot;The Battle of the Kegs&quot;, an American propaganda ballad written by Francis Hopkinson. In January 1776 Howe&#x27;s role as commander in chief was cemented with a promotion to full general in North America.

The siege was broken in March 1776 when Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox brought heavy artillery from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston during the winter, and General Washington used them to fortify Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston and its harbour. Howe at first planned an assault on this position, but a snowstorm interfered, and he eventually decided to withdraw from Boston. On 17 March, British troops and Loyalists evacuated the city, and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

===New York campaign===


Howe and his troops began to arrive outside New York Harbour and made an uncontested landing on Staten Island to the west in early July. Howe, whose orders from Lord George Germain, the Secretary of State responsible for directing the war from Westminster, were fairly clear that he should avoid conflict before the arrival of reinforcements, then waited until those reinforcements arrived in mid-August, along with the naval commander, his brother Richard. This delay proved to be somewhat costly, since the Americans used this time to improve fortifications on northwestern Long Island (at Brooklyn Heights along the East River shoreline) and increased the size of their Continental Army with additional militia. After moving most of his army by amphibious barges across the Verazzano Narrows to southwestern Long Island without opposition, he attacked the American positions on 27 August in what became known as the Battle of Long Island. In a well-executed manoeuvre, a large column led by Howe and Clinton passed around the American left flank and through the lightly guarded Jamaica Pass far to the east (a ridge of hills running east to west bisected the island, with a series of lower entrances that were all guarded by Continentals except inexplicably to the farthest east at Jamaica), catching the Patriots off-guard and routing the Americans from their forward positions back into the entrenchments on Brooklyn Heights. Despite the urging of Clinton and others, Howe decided against an immediate assault on these fortifications, claiming &quot;the Troops had for that day done handsomely enough.&quot; He instead began siege operations, methodically advancing on the entrenched Americans. This decision allowed General Washington to successfully orchestrate a nighttime strategic withdrawal across the East River on the night of 29–30 August, aided by a thick morning fog. Historian George Bilias notes that had Howe attacked Brooklyn Heights, the capture of even half of Washington&#x27;s army, and possibly Washington himself, might have had a significant effect on the rebellion. Some officers, notably General Clinton, were critical of Howe&#x27;s decision not to storm the American works. Howe was knighted as a reward for his victory on Long Island.

Howe and his brother Richard had, as part of their instructions, been assigned roles as peace commissioners, with limited authority to treat with the rebels. After Long Island, they pursued an attempt at reconciliation, sending the captured General John Sullivan to Philadelphia with a proposal for a peace conference. The meeting that resulted, conducted by Admiral Howe, was unsuccessful. The Howes had been given limited powers, as had the Congressional representatives, and the latter were insistent that the British recognise the recently declared colonial independence. This was not within the Howes&#x27; powers, so the conference failed, and Howe then continued the campaign. He first landed troops on Manhattan on 15 September and occupied New York City (which then covered only Lower Manhattan), although his advance northward on Upper Manhattan was checked the next day at Harlem Heights. He paused, spending nearly one month consolidating control of New York City and awaiting reinforcements. During this time he ordered the execution of Nathan Hale for espionage and had to deal with the effects of a major fire in the city. He then attempted a landing on the mainland at Throgs Neck, intending to flank Washington&#x27;s position at Harlem Heights. However, the narrow causeway between the beach and the mainland was well-defended, and he ended up withdrawing the troops. He made a successful landing of troops at Pell&#x27;s Point in Westchester County, but Washington managed to avoid being flanked, retreating to White Plains. Howe successfully forced Washington out of the New York area in the 28 October Battle of White Plains, and then turned his attention to consolidate British hold on Manhattan. In November he attacked the remaining Continental Army stronghold in the Battle of Fort Washington, taking several thousand prisoners.

Washington then retreated across New Jersey, followed by Howe&#x27;s advance forces under Charles Cornwallis. At this point, Howe prepared troops under the command of General Clinton for embarkation to occupy Newport, the other major goal of his plan. Clinton proposed that these troops instead be landed in New Jersey, either opposite Staten Island or on the Delaware River, trapping Washington or even capturing the seat of the Continental Congress, Philadelphia. Howe rejected these proposals, despatching Clinton and General Hugh, Earl Percy, two vocal critics of his leadership, to take Newport. In early December, Howe came to Trenton, New Jersey to arrange the disposition of his troops for the winter. Washington had retreated all the way across the Delaware, and Howe returned to New York, believing the campaign to be ended for the season. When Washington attacked the Hessian quarters at Trenton on 26 December 1776, Howe sent Cornwallis to reform the army in New Jersey and chase after Washington. Cornwallis was frustrated in this, with Washington gaining a second victory at Trenton and a third at Princeton. Howe recalled the army to positions much closer to New York for the winter.

Howe has been criticised by contemporaries and historians for failing to decisively defeat the Continental Army during the New York campaign. Contemporaries complained that his landing in Westchester failed to trap Washington, but failed to understand that his goal in the campaign was to secure Manhattan, and not necessarily to defeat Washington. However, historian George Billias observes that Howe&#x27;s overly rigid adherence to his plans meant that he was unable to capitalise on the opportunities that arose during the campaign for a decisive action.

===Philadelphia campaign===
On 30 November 1776, as Washington was retreating across New Jersey, Howe had written to Germain with plans for the 1777 campaign season. He proposed to send a 10,000-man force up the Hudson River to capture Albany, New York, in conjunction with an expedition sent south from Province of Quebec. He again wrote to Germain on 20 December 1776 with more elaborate proposals for 1777. These again included operations to gain control of the Hudson River, and included expanded operations from the base at Newport, and an expedition to take Philadelphia. The latter Howe saw as attractive, since Washington was then just north of the city: Howe wrote that he was &quot;persuaded the Principal Army should act offensively [against Philadelphia], where the enemy&#x27;s chief strength lies.&quot; Germain acknowledged that this plan was particularly &quot;well digested&quot;, but it called for more men that Germain was prepared to provide. After the setbacks in New Jersey, Howe in mid-January 1777 proposed operations against Philadelphia that included an overland expedition and a sea-based attack, thinking this might lead to a decisive victory over the Continental Army. This plan was developed to the extent that in April, Howe&#x27;s army was seen constructing pontoon bridges; Washington, lodged in his winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey, thought they were for eventual use on the Delaware River. However, by mid-May Howe had apparently abandoned the idea of an overland expedition: &quot;I propose to invade Pennsylvania by sea ... we must probably abandon the Jersies.&quot;

When the campaign season opened in May 1777, General Washington moved most of his army from its winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey to a strongly fortified position in the Watchung Mountains. In June 1777, Howe began a series of odd moves in New Jersey, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington and his army out of that position onto terrain more favourable for a general engagement. His motives for this are uncertain; historian John Buchanan argues that Howe was determined to attempt to draw Washington into a major engagement while both were in northern New Jersey, writing that &quot;Washington&#x27;s shift in position had whetted Howe&#x27;s appetite for a major action when, if everything went right, he would finally accomplish what he and his brother&#x27;s policies had denied him the previous year: the destruction of the Continental Army&quot;, but that Howe&#x27;s underlying campaign goal for the season was Philadelphia. One British major wrote that &quot;[t]he report circulated by those in power is that it was thought necessary to march to Hilsborough to &quot;offer Washington battle.&quot;&quot; Americans like Henry Knox were perplexed but also concluded that was its purpose: &quot;It was unaccountable that [the British] should stop short when they had gone only nine miles ... In the course of a day or two [we] discovered that they ... had come out with an intention of drawing us into the plain.&quot; Washington had intelligence that Howe had moved without taking the heavy river-crossing equipment, and was apparently not fooled at all.

When Washington refused to take the bait, Howe withdrew the army to Perth Amboy, under harassment by Colonel Daniel Morgan&#x27;s skirmisher unit, Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen, who used their superior weapons to snipe at and harry his forces as they moved. Washington moved down to a more exposed position, assuming Howe was going to embark his army on ships. Howe then launched a lightning strike designed to cut Washington&#x27;s retreat off. This attempt was foiled by the Battle of Short Hills, which gave Washington time to retreat to a more secure position. Howe then did in fact embark his army and sailed south with his brother&#x27;s fleet. Howe maintained an effective secrecy surrounding the fleet&#x27;s destination: not only did Washington not know where it was going, neither did many British rank and file.

Howe&#x27;s campaign for Philadelphia began with an amphibious landing at Head of Elk, Maryland, southwest of the city in late August. Although Howe would have preferred to make a landing on the Delaware River below Philadelphia, reports of well-prepared defences dissuaded him, and the fleet spent almost an entire extra month at sea to reach Head of Elk. Howe&#x27;s army left Head of Elk early on 3 September 1777 and pushed back an advance guard of American light infantry at Cooch&#x27;s Bridge. On 11 September 1777, Howe&#x27;s army met Washington&#x27;s near Chadds Ford along the Brandywine Creek in the Battle of Brandywine. Howe established his headquarters at the Gilpin Homestead, where it stayed until the morning of 16 September. In a reprise of earlier battles, Howe once again flanked the Continental Army position and forced Washington to retreat after inflicting heavy casualties.

After two weeks of manoeuvre and engagements (including The Battle of the Clouds, The Battle of Paoli, and an engagement at Valley Forge where Alexander Hamilton was nearly killed in action), Howe triumphantly entered the city on 26 September. The reception Howe received was not quite what he had expected, however. He had been led to believe that &quot;Friends thicker than Woods&quot; would greet him upon his arrival; he instead was greeted by women, children, and many deserted houses. Despite Howe&#x27;s best attempts to minimise any misconduct by his troops (he authorised the execution of violators of his orders against it), marauding soldiers greatly impacted the public opinion of his army.

One week after Howe entered Philadelphia, on 4 October, Washington made a dawn attack on the British garrison at Germantown. He came close to winning the battle before being repulsed by belated reinforcements sent from the city. This forced Howe to withdraw his troops a little closer to the city, where they were also needed to help clear the American Delaware River defences, which were preventing the navy from resupplying the army. It was late November before this task was accomplished, which included a poorly executed attack on Fort Mercer by a division of Hessians commanded by Colonel von Donop and an advance fleet commanded by Admiral Francis Reynolds.

===Impact on Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign===

Concomitant with Howe&#x27;s campaign, General Burgoyne led his expedition south from Montreal to capture Albany. Burgoyne&#x27;s advance was stopped in the Battles of Saratoga in September and October, and he surrendered his army on 17 October. Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender, coupled with Howe&#x27;s near defeat at Germantown, dramatically altered the strategic balance of the conflict. Support for the Continental Congress, suffering from Howe&#x27;s successful occupation of Philadelphia, was strengthened, and the victory encouraged France to enter the war against Britain. Burgoyne&#x27;s loss also further weakened the British government of Lord North.

Burgoyne made his advance under the assumption that he would be met in Albany by Howe or troops sent by Howe. Burgoyne was apparently not aware that Howe&#x27;s plans had evolved as they had. Although Germain knew what Howe&#x27;s plans were, whether he communicated them to Burgoyne is unclear. Some sources claim he did while others state that Burgoyne was not notified of the changes until the campaign was well underway. Whether Germain, Howe and Burgoyne had the same expectations about the degree to which Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear. Some historians argue that Howe failed to follow instructions and essentially abandoned Burgoyne&#x27;s army, while others suggest that Burgoyne failed on his own and then tried to shift the blame to Howe and Clinton.

Howe&#x27;s decision to focus his own activity on an expedition to Philadelphia may have been motivated by competition with General Burgoyne, who was given command of the northern force despite lobbying by Howe for its command to be given to Clinton. John Alden notes the jealousies among the British leaders, saying, &quot;It is likely that [Howe] was as jealous of Burgoyne as Burgoyne was of him and that he was not eager to do anything which might assist his junior up the ladder of military renown.&quot; Along the same lines historian Don Higginbotham concludes that in Howe&#x27;s view, &quot;It [the northern campaign] was Burgoyne&#x27;s whole show, and consequently he [Howe] wanted little to do with it. With regard to Burgoyne&#x27;s army, he would do only what was required of him (virtually nothing).&quot;

Howe himself wrote to Burgoyne on 17 July that he intended to stay close to Washington: &quot;My intention is for Pennsylvania, where I expect to meet Washington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to my expectations, and you can keep him at bay, be assured I shall soon be after him to relieve you.&quot; This suggested that Howe would follow Washington if he went north to assist in the defence of the Hudson. Howe, however, sailed from New York on 23 July. On 30 August, shortly after his arrival at Head of Elk, Howe wrote to Germain that he would be unable to assist Burgoyne, citing a lack of Loyalist support in the Philadelphia area.
A small force sent north from New York by General Clinton in early October was also unable to assist Burgoyne.

===Resignation===
In October 1777 Howe sent his letter of resignation to London, complaining that he had been inadequately supported in that year&#x27;s campaigns. He was finally notified in April 1778 that his resignation was accepted. A grand party, known as the &quot;Mischianza&quot;, was thrown for the departing general on 18 May. Organized by his aides John André and Oliver De Lancey Jr., the party featured a grand parade, fireworks, and dancing until dawn. Washington, aware that the British were planning to evacuate Philadelphia, sent the Marquis de Lafayette out with a small force on the night of the party to determine British movements. This movement was noticed by alert British troops, and Howe ordered a column out to entrap the marquis. In the Battle of Barren Hill, Lafayette escaped the trap with minimal casualties.

On 24 May, the day Howe sailed for England, General Clinton took over as commander-in-chief of British armies in America, and made preparations for an overland march to New York. Howe arrived back in England on 1 July, where he and his brother faced censure for their actions in North America. It is likely that the resignation of both William and his brother Richard was due to their desire to hurry home to vindicate their conduct during the campaign. In 1779 Howe and his brother demanded a parliamentary inquiry into their actions. The inquiry that followed was unable to confirm any charges of impropriety or mismanagement levelled against either of them. Because of the inconclusive nature of the inquiry, attacks continued to be made against Howe in pamphlets and the press, and in 1780 he published a response to accusations levelled by Loyalist Joseph Galloway, who issued a reply that harshly criticized the general&#x27;s conduct and accused him of deliberately undermining the war effort for the benefit of the anti-war Whig faction in Parliament.

==Later life==
In 1780, Howe lost in his bid to be re-elected to the House of Commons. In 1782, he was named lieutenant general of the ordnance and appointed to the Privy Council. His colonelcy was transferred from the 23rd Fusiliers to the 19th Light Dragoons in 1786. He resumed limited active duty in 1789, when a crisis with Spain over territorial claims in northwestern North America threatened to boil over into war. He was placed in command of the forces organized for action against Spain, but the crisis was resolved and Howe did not see further action until 1793, when the French Revolutionary Wars involved Britain. He was promoted to full general in 1793, and commanded Northern District from 1793 and Eastern District from 1795. In 1795, he was appointed governor of Berwick-on-Tweed.

When his brother Richard died in 1799 without surviving male issue, Howe inherited the Irish titles and became the 5th Viscount Howe and Baron Clenawly. In 1803, he resigned as lieutenant general of the ordnance, citing poor health. In 1808, he was appointed governor of Plymouth. He died at Twickenham in 1814 after a long illness.

Howe had married Frances Connolly, often referred to as Fanny, in 1765. Their marriage was childless. Therefore, his titles died with him. His wife survived him by three years. Both are buried in Twickenham.

==In popular culture==
Howe appears as an antagonist in the supernatural television series &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, played in flashbacks by Nicholas Guest and depicted as a ruthless, cruel leader who was acquainted with protagonist Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) before Crane defected to the United States during the War of Independence; he is later resurrected in the present as a zombie, but is destroyed by Crane using Greek fire.

Howe&#x27;s remains are a plot point in the &quot;Bones&quot; episode &quot;The Resurrection in the Remains&quot;, a crossover with &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, in which Howe&#x27;s decapitated skull is used as a murder weapon. The series also establishes that he was buried beneath an American church instead of Twickenham.

Howe is also featured in &quot;Howe&#x27;s Masquerade&quot; and &quot;Old Esther Dudley&quot;, two of the stories that make up Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;Legends of the Province House&quot;, a quartet of tales that first appeared in 1838–1839.

<text>The Public Record Office (abbreviated as PRO, pronounced as three letters and referred to as &quot;the&quot; PRO), Chancery Lane in the City of London, was the guardian of the national archives of the United Kingdom from 1838 until 2003, when it was merged with the Historical Manuscripts Commission to form The National Archives, based in Kew. It was under the control of the Master of the Rolls, a senior judge. The Public Record Office still exists as a legal entity, as the enabling legislation has not been modified.

==History==
===19th century===

The Record Commissions were a series of six royal commissions of Great Britain and (from 1801) the United Kingdom which sat between 1800 and 1837 to inquire into the custody and public accessibility of the state archives. The Commissions emphasised the poor conditions and variety of places in which records were held. As a result, the (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 94) was passed to &quot;keep safely the public records&quot;.

The act established the Public Record Office, a non-ministerial department under the keepership of the Master of the Rolls, a senior judge whose job originally had included responsibility for keeping the records of the Court of Chancery, who appointed a Deputy Keeper as Chief Record Keeper. The first Master of the Rolls to take on this responsibility was Lord Langdale (d.1851) although his Deputy Keeper, the historian Sir Francis Palgrave (who wrote a voluminous work on ancient writs, many of which were housed in the PRO), had full-time responsibility for running the Office.

The Office&#x27;s original premises were the mediaeval Rolls Chapel (the former Domus Conversorum, a chapel for Jews who had converted to Christianity), on Chancery Lane at the western extremity of the City of London, near the border with the City of Westminster.

Some of the records were court or departmental archives (established for several centuries) which were well-run and had good or adequate catalogues; others were little more than store-rooms. Many of the professional staff of these individual archives simply continued their existing work in the new institution. Many documents were transferred from the Tower of London and the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey, though Domesday Book was not moved from Westminster Abbey until 1859, when proper storage had been prepared.

Until 1852 no right existed for the general public to consult the records freely, even for scholarly purposes, despite the intention of the Public Record Office Act 1838 to enable public access. Fees were payable by lawyers who in return were permitted to consult a limited number of documents. These charges were abolished for serious historical and literary researchers after a petition was signed in 1851 by 83 people including Charles Dickens and the historians Lord Macaulay and Thomas Carlyle.

Between 1851 and 1858 a purpose-built archive repository was built next to the Rolls Chapel, to the design of the architect Sir James Pennethorne, and following the chapel&#x27;s demolition due to structural unsoundness, was extended onto that original site between 1895 and 1900.

===20th century===

The growing size of the archives held by the PRO and by government departments led to the Public Records Act 1958, which sought to avoid the indiscriminate retention of huge numbers of documents by establishing standard selection procedures for the identification of those documents of sufficient historical importance to be kept by the PRO. Even so, growing interest in the records produced a need for the Office to expand, and in 1977 a second building was opened at Kew in south-west London. The Kew building was expanded in the 1990s and by 1997 all records had been transferred from Chancery Lane either to Kew or to the Family Records Centre in Islington, North London. The Chancery Lane building was acquired by King&#x27;s College London in 2001, and is now the Maughan Library, the university&#x27;s largest library.

===Merger with the Historical Manuscripts Commission===
In April 2003 the PRO merged with the Historical Manuscripts Commission (HMC) to form The National Archives. The HMC moved from its previous office, also located off Chancery Lane, to Kew in 2004. The National Archives of Scotland and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland were and remain separate institutions.

==Functions==
The archive held the official collection of records of public business for England, Wales and the central UK government, including the records of court proceedings going back to the Middle Ages, and the original manuscript of Domesday Book.

==Public access==
Under the 1958 act, most documents held by the PRO were kept &quot;closed&quot; (or secret) for 50 years: under an amending act of 1967 this period was reduced to 30 years (the so-called &quot;thirty year rule&quot;). These provisions changed significantly when the UK&#x27;s Freedom of Information Act 2000 came into full effect in 2005: the 30 year rule was abolished and closed records in The National Archives became subject to the same access controls as other records of public authorities. Some records do remain closed for longer periods, however: individual census returns, for example, are kept closed for 100 years.

==Deputy Keepers and Keepers==
From 1838 to 1958 the nominal head of the office, known as the Keeper of the Records, was the Master of the Rolls of the day. The chief executive officer who oversaw the office&#x27;s day-to-day operations was known as the Deputy Keeper of the Records. Deputy Keepers from 1838 to 1958 were:
*1838–1861: Sir Francis Palgrave
*1861–1878: (Sir) Thomas Duffus Hardy
*1878–1886: (Sir) William Hardy
*1886–1926: (Sir) Henry Maxwell Lyte
*1926–1938: Alfred Edward Stamp
*1938–1947: (Sir) Cyril Thomas Flower
*1947–1954: (Sir) Hilary Jenkinson
*1954–1958: (Sir) David Lewis Evans

The 1958 act transferred responsibility for the PRO from the Master of the Rolls to the Lord Chancellor; and the title of the chief executive was changed to Keeper of Public Records. The Keepers from 1958 to 2003 were:
*1958–1960: Sir David Lewis Evans
*1960–1966: Stephen Wilson
*1966–1970: Harold Cottam Johnson
*1970–1978: Jeffery Raymond Ede
*1978–1982: Alfred Mabbs
*1982–1988: Geoffrey Martin
*1988–1991: Michael Roper
*1991–2003: Sarah Tyacke (became Chief Executive of The National Archives, and retired 2005)

<text>Scandinavium () is an indoor arena located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Construction on Scandinavium began in 1969 after decades of setbacks, and was inaugurated on 18 May 1971.

Scandinavium has been selected as a championship arena at least fifty times, hosting events such as World Championships in handball and ice hockey, European championships, Davis Cup finals, and in 1985 the Eurovision Song Contest. Scandinavium is the home arena for Frölunda HC of Swedish Hockey League and venue for the annual Göteborg Horse Show. Frölunda has won the Le Mat Trophy, awarded to the winner of the SHL, four times since it began playing at the venue, most recently in 2019.

== History ==
Plans to build an arena at the site were part of a proposal originating from 1931 to build a swimming hall and other municipally owned facilities for sport and recreation next to the exhibition center Svenska Mässan. In 1936 a preplanning process for the swimming hall and the adjunct area started, but was put on hold due to the precarious situation in Europe at the time and eventually canceled following the outbreak of World War II. In 1948 an architectural design competition was announced for an indoor arena with the project name Valhalla Inomhusarena (), the winning design was presented by a work group led by architect Poul Hultberg, who was working for Nils Olsson&#x27;s architect firm in Gothenburg. Financing for the arena and other proposed facilities became a subject of public and political debate, the plans to build the arena were postponed indefinitely. The Valhalla Swimming Hall, which was the primary building in the 1931 proposal, was the only proposed facility to be built during the 1950s due to capacity problems at other central swimming facilities.

In the 1962 election campaign the Swedish Social Democratic Party guaranteed that they would build the arena if they won the election. The Social Democrats won the election and a pre-planning process was started but financing was still an issue and the plans were yet again put on hold. In 1968 a committee assigned to plan the 350th year celebration of Gothenburg considered that it was a good idea to build the arena in time for the celebrations in 1971, making it a lasting memory of the anniversary. A company responsible for the construction was formed by the municipality and private investors, while Hultberg was asked to revise his 23-year-old designs. An estimated construction cost of twenty-three million SEK caused wild protests and intense debates but did not delay the progress. In May 1969 it was discovered that there was no construction permit for the arena, delaying the start of construction for a few weeks. When tartan tracks were installed near the end of construction, the concentration of flammable gases in the building was so high that one spark could have potentially blown up the entire structure. When construction was completed in May 1971, Scandinavium stood as the largest covered arena in northern Europe with an attendance capacity of 14,000 spectators. The construction cost totaled 31 million SEK, which resulted in an eight million SEK budget deficit.

In May 2023, the Gothenburg city council approved the construction of a new sports facility on the site of the Valhalla Swimming Hall, which will be followed by the demolition of the current arena.

== Structure and facilities ==

Scandinavium&#x27;s &quot;sweeping appearance&quot; comes from the hyperbolic paraboloid shaped saddle roof, which resembles other arenas such as the Saddledome in Calgary. The roof is supported by a prestressed cable net, with a nearly constant spacing of four meters in both directions, anchored in a space curved reinforced concrete ring beam with a rectangular cross-section of 3.5 meters × 1.2 meters (11.5 ft × 4 ft). The hanging cables rise ten meters to the top from the saddle point and the bracing cables fall four meters to the valley of the ring beam. The building is 14 meters (46 ft) tall, from the event floor to the pinnacle of the roof. The ring beam is supported by forty circular columns and four stiff pylons, all visible in the arenas facade. The pylons consist of radially oriented concrete walls, with a length of 3.5 meters (11.5 ft), which stores ventilation equipment. The video board, lights, and sound system is suspended in a radially oriented cable system anchored in the four pylons. It was not consider stable enough for colour telecasting to attach these components directly to the roof. The cable system also serves as tension rods for the ring beam.

The seating in Scandinavium is arranged in a one-level monolithic grandstand. The round design of the structure and the symmetric oval shape of the arena floor results in more rows along the length of the floor. The first six rows are telescopic seating which can be electrically retracted. There are forty-four executive boxes in the arena, located between the two northern pylons.

The ice hockey rink measures 61 meters × 30 meters (200 ft × 98.5 ft) which is standard international size. New double frame half boards were installed in 2001, designed to switch to NHL rink dimensions or to be easily removed when other events than ice hockey take place. To maximize the view for spectators, a seamless protective glass barrier consisting of tempered glass panels clipped together at their top corners with clear plastic brackets is used instead of traditional Plexiglas with metal dividers.

For the 2011 Göteborg Horse Show a new equestrian surface was purchased for two million SEK.

The arena also contains a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, and the familiar golden arches are placed atop the arena&#x27;s street sign.

== Location and transportation ==

Scandinavium is located in central Gothenburg, in the Heden district of the borough Centrum. Scandinavium is one of the center pieces of the event district called Evenemangsstråket, with Ullevi Stadium, Liseberg, Universeum, the Museum of World Culture, and Bergakungen nearby. Public transport is easily accessible; Just outside there is a tram stop named after the arena, which serves tram lines two, six, eight, thirteen, and fourteen. Tram lines four and five stops 250 meters from the arena at Korsvägen, a major public transport hub, which serves more than fifteen different bus lines, and will have an underground rapid transit station once Västlänken is completed. Approximately one and one half kilometer north west from Scandinavium is the Gothenburg Central Station and the Nils Ericson Terminal, one half kilometer south east is the Liseberg station serving the Gothenburg commuter rail.

When Frölunda and the Ottawa Senators played an exhibition game on 2 October 2008, spectators could use their game tickets for free travel with public transportation within Gothenburg&#x27;s municipality, before and after the game. Extra trams and buses were in traffic during this time. The campaign was a test to see if it would be possible to include a public transportation fee on tickets to future events.

Due to Scandinavium&#x27;s central location the arena site itself does not have any public parking spaces, parking is only provided for sponsors, the press, and event personnel at a guard-gated parking lot next to Valhalla IP. Visitors are guided to eighteen nearby parking lots and parking garages—with a total of 7,000 parking spaces—by the event districts parking guidance and information system. The system has a total of 130 digital signs, located on motorways with information about which exit to use, and on streets in the city with more detailed information about directions and number of available parking spaces.

==Notable events==

The arena has also hosted a heat of Melodifestivalen every year since the introduction of the current format, except 2002, 2021 and 2022 (the latter two due to the COVID-19 pandemic). It was also considered to host the final of Melodifestivalen 2010, but scheduling conflicts ruled this out. The arena has hosted the annual Göteborg Horse Show since 1977.

The arena has hosted concerts by many famous artists, spanning many different genres. Some of the first major concerts to take place at the venue were performed by The Who, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin during their 1972 and 1973 European Tours respectively. In May 1988, pop/R&amp;B superstar, Whitney Houston, would set the record attendance with 14,606 tickets sold on her Moment of Truth World Tour. Iron Maiden have performed at the arena the most with a total of nine times, the latest being in 2006.

The arena was one of the potential candidate venues to host the Eurovision Song Contest in and again in . In the end, the Malmö Arena was chosen to host the contest on both occasions. However, the venue eventually hosted the second heat of Melodifestivalen 2024.

<text>Ullevi, sometimes known as Nya Ullevi (, &quot;New Ullevi&quot;), is a multi-purpose stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was built for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, but since then has also hosted the World Allround Speed Skating Championships six times; the 1995 World Championships in Athletics and the 2006 European Athletics Championships; the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals in 1983 and 1990; the UEFA Euro 1992 final, the UEFA Cup final in 2004; and annually hosted the opening ceremony of the Gothia Cup, the world&#x27;s largest football tournament in terms of the number of participants. IFK Göteborg has also played two UEFA Cup finals at the stadium, in 1982 and 1987, but then as &quot;home game&quot; in a home and away final. The stadium has hosted several events, including football, ice hockey, boxing, racing, athletics and concerts.

The stadium is one of the biggest in the Nordic countries, with a seating capacity of 43,000 and a total capacity of 75,000 for concerts.

==History==

===Sport===
The ground opened for the 1958 FIFA World Cup held across Sweden. It hosted four matches in Group D, including a play-off. It also held a quarter-final, a semi-final and the third-place match. The stadium&#x27;s record attendance for football is 52,194, set on 3 June 1959 when Örgryte IS played against IFK Göteborg. The stadium hosted the 1983 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final, which saw Scotland&#x27;s Aberdeen defeat Spanish giants Real Madrid 2–1 after extra time. It also hosted the first leg of the 1987 UEFA Cup Final between IFK Göteborg and Dundee United of Scotland. The hosts won the game 1-0 thanks to a goal from Stefan Pettersson. The Swedish side would go on to lift the trophy for the second time in their history after a 1–1 draw at Tannadice Park, Dundee in the second leg.

It was also the venue for the first game between National Football League teams to be played on the European continent, organised by Swedish motor company Volvo. In a pre-season game on 14 August 1988, the Minnesota Vikings won 28–21 against the Chicago Bears. The 1990 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final was also held at the stadium. It saw Sampdoria of Italy defeat Anderlecht of Belgium 2-0 after extra-time.

Ullevi held three Group B matches at UEFA Euro 1992 as well as a semi-final, and the final itself on 26 June in which Denmark won the trophy against Germany. The 2004 UEFA Cup Final was held at the stadium on 19 May of that year. Valencia of Spain defeated Marseille of France, 2–0. The annual Världsungdomsspelen (translation: World Youth Games) track and field competition is held at the stadium and the mass event has around 3000 athletes competing each year.

===Music===
Ullevi nearly collapsed during a Bruce Springsteen concert on 8 June 1985 due to the rhythmic movement of tens of thousands of people in the audience and the clay soil on which the stadium is built. The concert also caused nearly £3 million in damages, while David Bowie&#x27;s Glass Spider Tour in June 1987 was relocated from Ullevi to Eriksberg because of fears about the safety of the structure. Since then, the concrete pillars supporting the stadium have been extended down to the bedrock. Springsteen has performed at the stadium on subsequent tours in 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2023.

Pink Floyd performed at Ullevi on 27 August 1994 as part of their The Division Bell Tour. Michael Jackson came to Ullevi on 16 August 1997, as part of his HIStory World Tour, performing for a crowd of 50,000 people. Elton John hosted a sell-out concert in 1998. It was part of the Face-To-Face Tour with Billy Joel, although Joel was unable to perform because of illness. John played for over three hours. Tina Turner came to Ullevi on 0 August 1996, as part of her Wildest Dreams Tour and 5 August 2000, as part of her Twenty Four Seven Tour with a sold-out crowd of 55,180.

The &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal (Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth and Metallica) played in the stadium on 3 July 2011. U2 have performed at the stadium four times: the first occasion was on 2 August 1997 during their PopMart Tour, in front of a crowd of 46,658 people. The second was on 29 July 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a sold-out crowd of 58,478 people. The third and the fourth were on 31 July and 1 August 2009 during their U2 360° Tour, in front of a total sold-out crowd of 119,297 people. The performance of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; from the first 2009 show was recorded for the group&#x27;s live album &quot;U22&quot;.

Foo Fighters performed at the venue on 12 June 2015 on the Sonic Highways World Tour. However, Dave Grohl fell off stage during the second song of the concert, breaking his leg. He was treated in the stadium before returning to the stage to continue the rest of the concert sitting down in a chair while a medic applied a cast. Despite Grohl&#x27;s injuries, the band was able to complete the concert.

Iron Maiden performed at the stadium five times. The first was on 9 July 2005 during their Eddie Rips Up the World Tour. The second time was on 26 July 2008 during their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour. The third time was on 1 July 2011 during The Final Frontier World Tour. The fourth time was on 17 June 2016 during The Book of Souls World Tour. The fifth time was on 22 July 2022 as a part of Legacy of the Beast Tour before more than 60,000 fans.

The Swedish artist Håkan Hellström has in 2014, 2016 and 2022 broken the attendance record thanks to a small stage which gave room for more spectators.

The Gothenburg-raised artist Laleh became the first Swedish female to headline Ullevi, with a concert held on her 40th birthday on 10 June 2022. When the tickets were released, 15,000 were sold in the first hour. The concert, which featured orchestration from the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, was broadcast on SVT1 on 2 January 2023 and made available on SVT Play on 28 December 2022. An accompanying documentary directed by Sara Aren going behind the scenes of the concert preparations was also broadcast on SVT2 on 30 December 2022 under the title &quot;Laleh – välkommen hem&quot;. She played a second concert at Ullevi on 26 August 2023 as part of a national summer tour.

===Innovation===
In March 2007, Ullevi installed what whas then one of Sweden&#x27;s largest solar power plants, consisting of 600m² of photovoltaic panels situated on the roof of the luxury boxes section. The peak power is 86.4 kW and the yield is supposed to cover the total power used by the artificial lighting for events, with a surplus.

==Speedway==
Ullevi has also hosted Motorcycle speedway and hosted the Speedway World Championship on no less than eight occasions, second only to the old Wembley Stadium in London, England which hosted the World Final a record 26 times. The track is a dirt surface laid out over the athletics track and is officially long with a track record of 69.4 seconds (4 laps clutch start).

The first Championship World Final to be held at Ullevi was the inaugural Speedway World Team Cup competition in 1960. Led by reigning world champion Ove Fundin and his teammates Olle Nygren, Rune Sörmander and Björn Knutson, Sweden swept to victory over England, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Ullevi would have to wait 26 years before World Team Cup competition returned with the stadium hosting the first round of the three round 1986 Final.

The first ever Individual World Final staged at Ullevi was in 1964 when New Zealand&#x27;s Barry Briggs won with a 15-point maximum. The largest attendance for a World Final at Ullevi occurred in 1974 when 38,390 turned out to see Sweden&#x27;s own Anders Michanek win his only World Championship with an unbeaten 15 point maximum. No World Championship winners at Ullevi dropped more than one point in their five rides with five of the seven World Finals being won with a 15-point maximum. The stadium also hosted other qualifying rounds for the Individual World Final including the inaugural running of the Intercontinental Final in 1975 won by New Zealand legend Ivan Mauger.

Since the World Championship was changed in 1995 from a single meeting Final to the Speedway Grand Prix (SGP), Ullevi has hosted a round of the series in 2002, 2003, 2004 (Grand Prix of Scandinavia), 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 (Grand Prix of Sweden).

Ullevi hosted its only World Pairs Championship Final in 1983 when Peter Collins and Kenny Carter won England&#x27;s 6th Pairs crown.

<doc id="218888" wikidata="Q450734" url="?curid=218888" title="Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)">
<text>General Sir Henry Clinton, KB (16 April 1730 – 23 December 1795) was a British Army officer and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1772 and 1795. He is best known for his service as a general during the American War of Independence. He arrived in Boston in May 1775 and was the British Commander-in-Chief in America from 1778 to 1782. He was a Member of Parliament for many years due to the influence of his cousin Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. Late in life, he was named Governor of Gibraltar, but he died before assuming the post.

==Early life==
=== Birth ===
Henry Clinton was born on 16 April 1730, to Admiral George Clinton
and Anne Carle, the daughter of a general. Clinton claimed in a notebook found in 1958 to be born in 1730, and that evidence from English peerage records places the date of birth as 16 April. Willcox also notes that none of these records give indication of the place of Clinton&#x27;s birth. Historian John Fredriksen claims that Clinton was born in Newfoundland; his father was posted there from 1732 to 1738.

Little is known of the earliest years of Clinton&#x27;s life, or of his mother and the two sisters that survived to adulthood. Given his father&#x27;s naval career, where the family lived is uncertain. They were obviously well-connected to the seat of the Earls of Lincoln, from whom his father was descended, or the estate of the Dukes of Newcastle, to whom they were related by marriage.
=== Education and career ===
In 1739 his father, then stationed at Gibraltar, applied for the governorship of the Province of New York. He won the post in 1741 with the assistance of the Duke of Newcastle (who was his brother&#x27;s brother-in-law). He did not actually go to New York until 1743. He took young Henry with him, having failed to acquire a lieutenant&#x27;s commission for the 12-year-old. Henry&#x27;s career would also benefit from the family connection to the Newcastles.

Records of the family&#x27;s life in New York are sparse. He is reported to have studied under Samuel Seabury on Long Island, suggesting the family may have lived in the country outside New York City. Clinton&#x27;s first military commission was to an independent company in New York in 1745. The next year his father procured for him a captain&#x27;s commission, and he was assigned to garrison duty at the recently captured Fortress of Louisbourg. In 1749, Clinton went to Britain to pursue his military career. It was two years before he received a commission as a captain in the Coldstream Guards. His father, after he returned to London when his term as New York governor was over, procured for Clinton a position as aide to Sir John Ligonier in 1756.

== Early military service ==
===Seven Years&#x27; War===
By 1758 Clinton had risen to be a lieutenant colonel in the 1st Foot Guards, which was later renamed the Grenadier Guards, and was a line company commander in the 2nd Battalion and was based in London. The 2nd Battalion, 1st Foot Guards, was deployed to Germany to participate in the Seven Years&#x27; War, arriving at Bremen on 30 July 1760 then joining the main Army, operating under Conway&#x27;s Corps near Warberg. George II died on 25 October 1760 and Clinton, along with all Officers of the Regiment, was amongst those listed in the renewal of commissions to George III, in London, on 27 October 1760.

Clinton was back with the 2nd Battalion coming out of winter quarters, at Paderborn in February 1761 and with the unit at the Battle of Villinghausen on 16 July 1761, then under Prince Ferdinand, the Hereditary Crown Prince, at the crossing of the Diemel, near Warburg, in August, before wintering near Bielefeld. His father died this year necessitating a return to England to resolve family affairs.

In 1762 the unit, part of the force led by Prince Ferdinand, was in action at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal on 24 June 1762. After this action they participated in cutting the French supply lines at the heights of Homberg on 24 July 1762 and secured artillery into position. It was after this engagement that the unit lost its commanding officer, Major General Julius Caesar who died at Elfershausen and is buried there. Clinton, now a colonel (seniority dated to 24 June 1762), was appointed as aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand by the start of 1762 and was with him when he attacked Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé at the Battle of Nauheim on 30 August 1762. Prince Ferdinand was wounded during this engagement and Clinton severely wounded forcing him to quit the field. This and the consequent siege of Cassel, were the last actions of the 1st Foot Guards in the Seven Years&#x27; War and Clinton returned to England. Clinton had distinguished himself as an aide-de-camp to Brunswick, with whom he established an enduring friendship.

During these early years, he formed a number of friendships and acquaintances, mostly with other officers serving in Brunswick&#x27;s camp. These included Charles Lee and William Alexander, who styled himself &quot;Lord Stirling&quot;; both of these men would face Clinton as enemies in North America. He formed long-lasting and deep friendships with John Jervis, and William Phillips; Phillips later served under Clinton in North America, and Jervis rose to prominence in the Royal Navy. He also made the acquaintance of Charles Cornwallis, who would famously serve under him as well.

===Family and marriage===
While Clinton was campaigning with the army in 1761, his father died. As the new head of the family, he had to unwind his father&#x27;s affairs, which included sizable debts as well as arrears in pay. Battles he had with the Board of Trade over his father&#x27;s unpaid salary lasted for years, and attempts to sell the land in the colonies went nowhere; these lands were confiscated during the American Revolution, and even his heirs were unable to recover any kind of compensation for them. His mother, who had a history of mental instability and played only a small part in his life, died in August 1767.

On 12 February 1767, Clinton married Harriet Carter, the daughter of landed gentry, and the couple settled into a house in Surrey. There is some evidence that the marriage was performed in haste; six months later, the household accounts contain evidence of a son, Frederick. Frederick died of an illness in 1774, two years after his mother. Although Clinton did not write of his marriage, it was apparently happy. The couple produced five children: Frederick, Augusta (1768), William Henry (1769), Henry Jr. (1771), and Harriet (1772). Clinton&#x27;s wife died on 29 August 1772, eight days after giving birth to Harriet. It took him over a year to recover from the grief. He took his in-laws into his house, and his wife&#x27;s sisters took over the care of his children. His second and third sons later continued the family tradition of high command.

== Post-war service ==
===Patronage===
Upon the death of the Duke of Newcastle, his patronage was taken up by the latter&#x27;s nephew and successor Henry Pelham-Clinton. Although he was sometimes instrumental in advancing Clinton&#x27;s career, the new duke&#x27;s lack of attention and interest in politics would at times work against Clinton. Clinton also complicated their relationship by treating the young duke more as an equal than as a noble who should be respected. A second patron was King George III&#x27;s brother the Duke of Gloucester. Clinton was appointed Gloucester&#x27;s Groom of the Bedchamber in 1764, a position he continued to hold for many years. However, some of Gloucester&#x27;s indiscretions left him out of favour at court, and he was thus not an effective supporter of Clinton.

===Peacetime service===
In 1769, Clinton&#x27;s regiment was assigned to Gibraltar, and Clinton served as second in command to Edward Cornwallis. During this time, Newcastle asked him to see after one of his (Newcastle&#x27;s) sons who was serving in the garrison. The young man, described by his father as having &quot;&quot;sloth&quot; and &quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;despicable behavior&quot;&quot;, was virtually unmanageable, and Clinton convinced the duke to put him into a French academy.

Clinton was promoted to major-general in 1772, and in the same year he obtained a seat in Parliament through Newcastle&#x27;s influence. He remained a Member of Parliament until 1784, first for Boroughbridge and subsequently for Newark-on-Trent. In April 1774 he went on a military inspection tour of the Russian army in the Balkans. He inspected some of the battlefields of the Russo-Turkish War with his friend Henry Lloyd, a general in the Russian army, and had an audience with Joseph II in Vienna. He very nearly had the chance to watch an artillery bombardment, but it was called off by the onset of peace negotiations. Clinton was at one point introduced to the Turkish negotiators, of whom he wrote that &quot;they stared a little, but were very civil.&quot; He returned to England in October 1774, and in February 1775 was ordered by King George to prepare for service in North America.

In a 1775 correspondence, Clinton curiously described himself as &quot;a shy bitch.&quot;

==American War of Independence==

===Boston===

Clinton, along with Major Generals William Howe and John Burgoyne, was sent with reinforcements to strengthen the position of General Thomas Gage in Boston. They arrived on 25 May, having learned en route that the American War of Independence had broken out, and that Boston was under siege. Gage, along with Clinton and Generals Howe and Burgoyne discussed plans to break the siege. Clinton was an advocate for fortifying currently unoccupied high ground surrounding Boston, and plans were laid to occupy those spots on 18 June. However, the colonists learned of the plan and fortified the heights of the Charlestown peninsula on the night of 16–17 June, forcing the British leadership to rethink their strategy.
In a war council held early on 17 June, the generals developed a plan calling for a direct assault on the colonial fortification, and Gage gave Howe command of the operation. Despite a sense of urgency (the colonists were still working on the fortifications at the time of the council), the attack did not begin until that afternoon. Clinton was assigned the role of providing reserve forces when requested by Howe. After two assaults failed, Clinton, operating against his orders from General Gage, crossed over to Charlestown to organize wounded and dispirited troops milling around the landing area.

On the third and successful assault against the redoubt on Breed&#x27;s Hill, the position was taken and these troops, having rallied, arrived and drove the rebels back to Bunker Hill. The battle was a victory for the British, but only at the heavy cost of over 1,000 casualties. Clinton famously wrote of the battle that it was &quot;A dear bought victory, another such would have ruined us.&quot;

For the remainder of 1775 the siege became little more than a standoff, with the sides either unwilling or unable to mount an effective attack on the other. After Howe took command of the forces following General Gage&#x27;s recall in September, the two of them established a working relationship that started out well, but did not take long to begin breaking down. Howe gave Clinton the command of Charlestown, but Clinton spent most of his time in Boston. He occupied the house of John Hancock, which he scrupulously cared for. He hired a housekeeper named Mary Baddeley, the wife of a man who had supposedly been demoted because she refused an officer&#x27;s advances. Clinton also hired Thomas Baddeley as a carpenter; the relationship Clinton established with Mary lasted the rest of his life, although it was only platonic during his time in Boston.

Cracks had already begun to form in his relationship with Howe when plans were developed for an expedition to the southern colonies, command of which went to Clinton. He asked Howe for specific officers to accompany him and authority that an independent commander might normally have, but Howe rebuffed him on all such requests. In January 1776, Clinton sailed south with a small fleet and 1,500 men to assess military opportunities in the Carolinas. During his absence his fears about the situation in Boston were realized when the Dorchester Heights were occupied and fortified by the rebels in early March, causing the British to evacuate Boston and retreat to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

===Campaigns in 1776===
Clinton&#x27;s expedition to the Carolinas was expected to meet a fleet sent from Europe with more troops for operations in February 1776. Delayed by logistics and weather, this force, which included Major General Charles Cornwallis as Clinton&#x27;s second in command and Admiral Sir Peter Parker did not arrive off the North Carolina coast until May. Concluding that North Carolina was not a good base for operations, they decided to assault Charleston, South Carolina, whose defenses were reported to be unfinished. Their assault, launched in late June, was a dismal failure. Clinton&#x27;s troops were landed on an island near Sullivan&#x27;s Island, where the rebel colonists had their main defenses, with the expectation that the channel between the two could be waded at low tide. This turned out not to be the case, and the attack was reduced to a naval bombardment. The bombardment in its turn failed because the spongy palmetto logs used to construct the fort absorbed the force of the cannonballs without splintering and breaking.
Clinton and Parker rejoined the main fleet to participate in General Howe&#x27;s August 1776 assault on New York City. Clinton pestered Howe with a constant stream of ideas for the assault, which the commander in chief came to resent. Howe did however adopt Clinton&#x27;s plan for attacking George Washington&#x27;s position in Brooklyn. At the 27 August Battle of Long Island, British forces led by Howe and Clinton, following the latter&#x27;s plan, successfully flanked the American forward positions, driving them back into their fortifications on Brooklyn Heights. However, Howe refused Clinton&#x27;s recommendation that they follow up the overwhelming victory with an assault on the entrenched Americans, due to a lack of intelligence as to their strength and a desire to minimize casualties. Instead, Howe besieged the position, which the Americans abandoned without loss on 29 August. General Howe was rewarded with a knighthood for his success.

Howe then proceeded to take control of New York City, landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay on Manhattan, with Clinton again in the lead. Although Clinton again suggested moves to cut Washington&#x27;s army off, Howe rejected them. In October Clinton led the army ashore in Westchester County in a bid to trap Washington between the Hudson and Bronx Rivers. However, Washington reached White Plains before Clinton did. After a brief battle in which Washington was pushed further north, Howe turned south to consolidate control of Manhattan. By this time the relationship between the two men had broken down almost completely, with Howe, apparently fed up with Clinton&#x27;s constant stream of criticisms and suggestions, refusing to allow Clinton even minor deviations in the army&#x27;s marching route.

In November Howe ordered Clinton to begin preparing an expedition to occupy Newport, Rhode Island, desired as a port by the Royal Navy. When Howe sent General Cornwallis into New Jersey to chase after Washington, Clinton proposed that, rather than taking Newport, his force should be landed in New Jersey in an attempt to envelop Washington&#x27;s army. Howe rejected this advice, and Clinton sailed for Newport in early December, occupying it in the face of minimal opposition.

===Campaigns in 1777===

In January 1777 Clinton was given leave to return to England. Planning for the 1777 campaign season called for two campaigns, one against Philadelphia, and a second that would descend from Montreal on Lake Champlain to Albany, New York, separating the New England colonies. Since General Howe was taking leadership of the Philadelphia campaign, Clinton contested for command of the northern campaign with Burgoyne. Howe supported him in this effort, but Burgoyne convinced King George and Lord Sackville to give him the command. The king refused Clinton&#x27;s request to resign, and ordered him back to New York to serve again as Howe&#x27;s second in command. He was placated with a knighthood, but was also forbidden to publish accounts of the disastrous Charleston affair. He was formally invested with the Order of the Bath on 11 April, and sailed for New York on the 29th.

When Clinton arrived in New York in July, Howe had not yet sailed for Philadelphia. Clinton was surprised and upset that he would be left to hold New York with 7,000 troops, dominated by Loyalist formations and Hessians, an arrangement he saw as inadequate to the task. He also quite bluntly informed Howe of the defects he saw in Howe&#x27;s plan, which would isolate Burgoyne from any reasonable chance of support by either Howe or Clinton. He presciently wrote after learning that much of Washington&#x27;s force had left the New York area, &quot;I fear it bears heavy on Burgoyne ... If this campaign does not finish the war, I prophesy that there is an end of British dominion in America.&quot;

Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign ended in disaster; Burgoyne was defeated at Saratoga and surrendered shortly after. Clinton attempted to support Burgoyne, but the delay in arrival of reinforcements put off the effort. In early October, Clinton captured two forts in the Hudson River highlands, and sent troops up the river toward Albany. The effort was too little and too late, and was cut off when he received orders from Howe requesting reinforcements. Howe&#x27;s campaign for Philadelphia had been a success, but he had very nearly suffered a defeat in the Battle of Germantown.

As the commander in New York, Clinton lived at No. 1 Broadway, on Bowling Green, a house occupied by later commandants General Robertson and General Pattison. He was obligated to do a certain amount of entertaining. This he did, although he chafed at the costs involved. He was eventually joined by the Baddeleys. Mary Baddeley resumed her role as housekeeper, which he appreciated in part because of her excellent managerial skills. She apparently rebuffed Clinton&#x27;s romantic overtures until she discovered her husband had been cheating on her. Clinton procured a position in one of the Loyalist regiments for her husband, and tried without success to get him transferred out of New York.

===Commander-in-Chief===

General Howe submitted his resignation as Commander-in-Chief in America in the wake of the 1777 campaigns, and Clinton was on the short list of nominees to replace him—despite being mistrusted by Prime Minister North, principally over his many complaints and requests to resign. Clinton was formally appointed to the post on 4 February 1778. Word of this did not arrive until April, and Clinton assumed command in Philadelphia in May 1778. France had formally entered the war on the American side by this time. Clinton was consequently ordered to withdraw from Philadelphia and send 5,000 of his troops to the economically important Caribbean. For the rest of the war, Clinton received few reinforcements as a consequence of the globalisation of the conflict with France. His orders were to strengthen areas in America that were firmly under British control, and do no more than conduct raiding expeditions in the American-controlled areas.

There was a shortage of transports for all of the Loyalists fleeing Philadelphia, so Clinton acted against his direct orders and decided to move the army to New York by land instead of by sea. He marched to New York and fought a battle with Washington&#x27;s army at Monmouth Court House on 28 June. Clinton burnished his reputation at home by writing a report on the movement that greatly exaggerated the size of Washington&#x27;s Continental Army and minimised the British casualties at Monmouth.

Arriving in New York, he and Admiral Howe were faced with a French fleet outside the harbour. Fortunately, Admiral d&#x27;Estaing decided against crossing the bar into the harbour, and sailed instead for Newport. Once Clinton learned of his destination, he marshalled troops to reinforce the Newport garrison while Lord Howe sailed to meet d&#x27;Estaing. Both fleets were scattered by a storm, and the Americans failed to take Newport before Clinton arrived. Clinton sent the supporting force on a raid of nearby communities, while he returned to New York to organize the troops that were to be sent southward.

Clinton sent a detachment to strike at Georgia that took Savannah in December, and it gained a tenuous foothold at Augusta in January 1779. He also detached troops for service in the West Indies in a plan to capture St. Lucia; the expedition was a success, compelling a French surrender not long before the French fleet arrived.

Clinton managed to establish a harmonious relationship with William Eden, a member of the Carlisle Peace Commission. This commission had been sent in a vain attempt at reconciliation with the American Congress. Despite its failures, Eden and Clinton got along, and Eden promised to make sure that Clinton&#x27;s dispatches received favourable distribution in England.

Clinton found himself dealing with the tit-for-tat murders taking place between the Patriots and Loyalists, and he was in office when Captain Huddy was murdered, which eventually led to the Asgill Affair. His dealings with the Board of Associated Loyalists and their President Governor William Franklin were his priority in the weeks before his departure. By mid-May 1782, Clinton informed the Secretary for the Colonies in Whitehall of the situation regarding Huddy&#x27;s murder. He wrote to the Right Honourable Wellbore Ellis on 11 May 1782: 

===Politics===

With the 1778 campaign season closed, Clinton considered options for action in 1779. Although he felt that Britain would be best served by withdrawing to the frontiers, popular opinion at home, as well as that of the king and George Germain, dictated otherwise. Germain felt that raiding expeditions should be conducted &quot;with spirit and humanity&quot; to destroy American commerce and privateering; this strategy was one Clinton disliked. Militarily, Clinton and Washington did little more than stare at each other across the lines of New York City. Clinton ordered two major raiding expeditions, one against Connecticut, the other against Chesapeake Bay, while Washington detached troops to deal with the increasing frontier war, which was primarily orchestrated from Quebec.

Early in 1779 Clinton sent his trusted aide, Lieutenant Duncan Drummond, to England in order to argue Clinton&#x27;s request to be recalled. Drummond was unsuccessful in this: despite the intervention of the Duke of Newcastle, the king refused to even consider granting Clinton leave, claiming that Clinton was &quot;the only man who might still save America&quot;. William Eden also interceded in an attempt to improve Clinton&#x27;s situation, but political divisions in the government and the prospect of Spanish entry into the war meant that Clinton ended up with very little support. Clinton also complained about the lack of naval support being provided by Admiral James Gambier, with whom he also had a difficult relationship. He eventually sent London a list of admirals he thought he could work with. None of them were chosen, and Gambier was replaced temporarily by George Collier before his permanent replacement, Mariot Arbuthnot, arrived.

After the Chesapeake raid Clinton drove the Americans from a key crossing of the Hudson River at Stony Point, New York. Clinton had hoped that, with an expected reinforcement of troops from Europe, he could then attack either Washington&#x27;s army or its supply lines, forcing Washington out of his well-defended mountain positions. However, the reinforcements, including Admiral Arbuthnot, were late in arriving, and Stony Point was retaken by the Americans after Clinton weakened its garrison to supply men for the Connecticut raids. The Americans chose not to hold Stony Point, and Clinton reoccupied it. However, Clinton&#x27;s opponents used the American success to criticise him, calling him &quot;undetermined&quot; and &quot;feeble&quot;. A similar action against a British outpost in New Jersey gave them further ammunition, and soured British morale. Further actions from New York were rendered impossible by the need for the naval squadron to address the American expedition to dislodge a newly established British outpost in Penobscot Bay.

On 30 June 1779, Clinton issued what has become known as the Philipsburg Proclamation (so named because it was issued from his headquarters at the Philipsburg Manor House in Westchester County, New York). This proclamation resurrected a similar offer of freedom to enlisted runaway slaves that had been made in a similar proclamation by Virginia Governor Lord Dunmore in 1775. Clinton justified this offer by citing the fact that the Continental Army was also actively employing slave labor to assist their war effort (the Continental Army would never fully accept enslaved men in its ranks). The proclamation led to a flood of fugitive slaves making their way to British lines, requiring Clinton and his commanders to almost immediately broaden its interpretation to include all enslaved people, not just men who chose to serve in the British ranks. Consequently, tens of thousands of enslaved men, women, and children gained freedom -- immediate and without condition -- behind British lines, resulting in what historian Cassandra Pybus has called &quot;the single greatest act of abolition in early American history.&quot; While its immediate military impact is debated, the Proclamation underlined the role of enslavement in the American Revolution, added a moral dimension to British war aims, and profoundly influenced Clinton’s legacy as a British commander who recognized—and exploited—the contradictions between Patriot rhetoric and the realities of slavery.

===Southern strategy===
Clinton&#x27;s relationship with Arbuthnot got off to a bad start. Rumors of a French fleet headed for northern ports (Halifax, Newport, or New York) pulled the leaders in different directions, and put off plans to withdraw from Newport for the purposes of strengthening the New York garrison (which had been weakened by disease) on at least one occasion. However, the French instead besieged Savannah, Georgia, with American assistance, and failed disastrously in the attempt. This convinced Clinton that an expedition against South Carolina held promise. Loyalist support was said to be strong there, and the people were said to be &quot;sick of their opposition to government&quot; and the British blockade of their ports.

Clinton began to assemble a force an expedition to take Charleston, withdrawing the forces from Newport for the purpose. Clinton took personal command of this campaign, and the task force with 14,000 men sailed south from New York at the end of the year. By early 1780, Clinton had brought Charleston under siege. In May, working together with Admiral Arbuthnot, he forced the surrender of the city, with its garrison of 5,000, in a stunning and serious defeat for the rebel cause. Arbuthnot and Clinton did not work together well during the siege, and their feuding lasted into 1781, with disastrous results for the unity of the British high command. Clinton&#x27;s relationship with Cornwallis also deteriorated further during the siege, improving slightly after the American surrender and Clinton&#x27;s departure for New York.

From New York, he oversaw the campaign in the South, and his correspondence to Cornwallis throughout the war showed an active interest in the affairs of his southern army. However, as the campaign progressed, he grew further and further away from his subordinate. As the campaign drew to a close, the correspondence became more and more acrimonious. Part of this may be due to George Germain, whose correspondence with Cornwallis may have convinced the junior officer to start disregarding the orders of his superior and consider himself to be an independent command.

In 1782, after fighting in the North American theater ended with the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, Clinton was replaced as Commander-in-Chief by Sir Guy Carleton, and he returned to England.

==Later career==
In 1783, Clinton published a &quot;Narrative of the Campaign of 1781 in North America&quot; in which he attempted to lay the blame for the 1781 campaign failures on General Cornwallis. This was met with a public response by Cornwallis, who leveled his own criticisms at Clinton. Clinton also resumed his seat in Parliament, serving until 1784.

Not much is known about what Clinton did from 1784 until he was re-elected to Parliament in 1790 for Launceston in Cornwall, a pocket borough controlled by his cousin Newcastle. Three years later, in October 1793, Clinton was promoted to full general. The following July he was appointed Governor of Gibraltar, but he died at Portland Place before he was able to assume that post.

He was buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

==Legacy==
Sir Henry Clinton&#x27;s legacy in the eyes of historians has been mixed. He held the command in America for four years, ending in disaster, and as a result, he is widely seen to share in the blame for the defeat. The biographer William Willcox, in his analysis of Clinton&#x27;s tenure in North America, observes that at times, &quot;Sir Henry&#x27;s ideas were not carried out for reasons that lay to some extent within himself&quot; and that he and Admiral Graves &quot;apparently ignored the danger&quot; of de Grasse in 1781. However, Willcox notes that campaign plans Clinton formulated for 1777, 1779 and 1780 were frustrated by external events that he could not control, and Willcox generally blames Cornwallis for the failure of the Carolina campaign. In contrast, Cornwallis&#x27; biographers Franklin and Mary Wickwire point out that Cornwallis&#x27;s failures are at least partially attributable to directives of Clinton that left him with relatively inadequate troop strength and irregular supply lines.

Major James Wemyss, who served under Clinton, wrote that he was &quot;an honourable and respectable officer of the German school; having served under Prince Ferdinand of Prussia and the Duke of Brunswick. Vain, open to flattery; and from a great aversion to all business not military, too often misled by aides and favourites.&quot; However, he also pointed out that Clinton&#x27;s interests were narrow and that he was crippled by self-distrust. Colonel Sir Charles Stuart described him as &quot;fool enough to command an army when he is incapable of commanding a troop of horse.&quot; However, the historian Piers Mackesy writes that he was &quot;a very capable general in the field.&quot;

Letters from General Sir Henry Clinton during the Revolutionary War can be found in the political papers of his cousin, Henry Pelham-Clinton, in the Newcastle (Clumber) Collection held at Manuscripts and Special Collections, University of Nottingham Information Services.

In 1937, the William L. Clements Library at University of Michigan library acquired a number of manuscripts belonging to Clinton. They were first sorted and organized by the colonial American historian Howard Henry Peckham and are now part of the collection of this library.

<doc id="218906" wikidata="Q1232202" url="?curid=218906" title="Irish Crown Jewels">
<text>The Jewels of the Order of St Patrick, commonly called the Irish Crown Jewels, were the heavily jewelled badge and star created in 1831 for the Grand Master of the Order of St Patrick, an order of knighthood established in 1783 by George III to be an Irish equivalent of the English Order of the Garter and the Scottish Order of the Thistle. The office of Grand Master was held by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

The jewels were stolen from Dublin Castle in 1907, along with the collars of five knights of the order. The theft has never been solved, and the items have never been recovered.

==History==
The original regalia of the Grand Master were only slightly more opulent than the insignia of an ordinary member of the order; the king&#x27;s 1783 ordinance said they were to be &quot;of the same materials and fashion as those of Our Knights, save only those alterations which befit Our dignity&quot;. The regalia were replaced in 1831 by new ones presented by William IV as part of a revision of the order&#x27;s structure. They were delivered from London to Dublin on 15 March by the Earl of Erroll in a mahogany box together with a document titled &quot;A Description of the Jewels of the Order of St. Patrick, made by command of His Majesty King William the Fourth, for the use of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and which are Crown Jewels.&quot; They contained 394 precious stones taken from the English Crown Jewels of Queen Charlotte and the Order of the Bath star of her husband George III. The jewels were assembled by Rundell &amp; Bridge. On the badge, of St Patrick&#x27;s blue enamel, the green shamrock was of emeralds and the red saltire of rubies; the motto of the order was in pink diamonds and the encrustation was of Brazilian diamonds of the first water. Notices issued after the theft described the jewels thus:

When not being worn or cleaned, the insignia of the Grand Master and those of deceased knights were in the custody of the Ulster King of Arms, the senior Irish herald, and kept in a bank vault. The description &quot;Crown Jewels&quot; was officially applied to the star and badge regalia in a 1905 revision of the order&#x27;s statutes. The label &quot;Irish Crown Jewels&quot; was publicised by newspapers after their theft.

==Theft==

In 1903, the Office of Arms, the Ulster King of Arms&#x27;s office within the Dublin Castle complex, was transferred from the Bermingham Tower to the Bedford or Clock Tower. The jewels were transferred to a new safe, which was to be placed in the newly constructed strongroom. The new safe was too large for the doorway to the strongroom, and Sir Arthur Vicars, the Ulster King of Arms, instead had it placed in his library. Seven latch keys to the door of the Office of Arms were held by Vicars and his staff, and two keys to the safe containing the regalia were both in the custody of Vicars. Vicars was known to get drunk on overnight duty and he once awoke to find the jewels around his neck. It is not known whether this was a prank or practice for the actual theft.

The regalia were last worn by the Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Aberdeen, on 15 March 1907, at a function to mark St Patrick&#x27;s Day. They were last known to be in the safe on 11 June, when Vicars showed them to a visitor to his office. The jewels were discovered to be missing on 6 July 1907, four days before the start of a visit by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra to the Irish International Exhibition; Lord Castletown was set to be invested into the order during the visit. The theft is reported to have angered the king, but the visit went ahead. However, the investiture ceremony was cancelled. Some family jewels inherited by Vicars and valued at £1,500 () were also stolen, along with the collars of five members of the order: four living (the Marquess of Ormonde and the Earls of Howth, Enniskillen, and Mayo) and one deceased (the Earl of Cork). These were valued at £1,050 ().

===Investigation===

A police investigation was conducted by the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Posters issued by the force depicted and described the missing jewels. Detective Chief Inspector John Kane of Scotland Yard arrived on 12 July to assist. His report, never released, is said to have named the culprit and to have been suppressed by the Royal Irish Constabulary. Vicars refused to resign his position, and similarly refused to appear at a Viceregal Commission under Judge James Johnston Shaw into the theft held from 10 January 1908. Vicars argued for a public Royal Commission instead, which would have had power to subpoena witnesses. He publicly accused his second in command, Francis (Frank) Shackleton, Dublin Herald of Arms, of the theft. Kane explicitly denied to the Commission that Shackleton, brother of the explorer Ernest Shackleton, was involved. Shackleton was exonerated in the commission&#x27;s report, and Vicars was found to have &quot;not exercise[d] due vigilance or proper care as the custodian of the regalia.&quot; Vicars was compelled to resign, as were all the staff in his personal employ.

===Rumours and theories===
In 1908, the Irish journalist Bulmer Hobson published an account of the theft in a radical American newspaper, &quot;The Gaelic American&quot;, using information he had received from Vicars&#x27; half-brother Pierce O&#x27;Mahony. It stated that the culprits were Shackleton and a military officer, Richard Gorges. The two men allegedly obtained access to the safe by plying Vicars with whiskey until he fell unconscious, at which point they removed the key from his pocket. Once the jewels had been extricated, Shackleton transported them to Amsterdam, where he sold them for £20,000. Hobson claimed that the men escaped prosecution due to Shackleton threatening to expose the &quot;discreditable doings&quot; of various high-ranking personages with whom he was acquainted. Hobson repeated the allegations in a formal statement to officials in 1955, and in his autobiography.

Officials were aware of the homosexuality of Shackleton, Gorges and Vicars and the claim that the investigation was compromised to avoid a greater scandal, such as the Dublin Castle homosexual scandals of 1884, was also made by Vicars, including in his will. The Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s son, Lord Haddo, had been a participant in the parties at the castle, and King Edward VII&#x27;s allegedly bisexual brother-in-law the Duke of Argyll was known to Frank Shackleton, through a friendship with the prominent social figure Lord Ronald Gower.

Of the persons alleged to be involved in the theft:
* Sir Arthur Vicars was killed by the IRA in County Kerry in April 1921.
* Frank Shackleton defrauded Lord Ronald Gower of his fortune between 1910 and 1913. Shackleton was eventually prosecuted and imprisoned, but only for defrauding a spinster friend of Gower&#x27;s, even though it was for a far smaller sum. It has been surmised this legal oddity was due to the British Government&#x27;s desire not to provoke Shackleton unduly, or probe Gower, over fear prominent names might be voiced. Upon release from prison, Shackleton changed his name to Mellor and became an antiques dealer in Chichester, England, until his death on 24 June 1941, aged 64.
* Richard Gorges shot and killed Detective Constable Arthur Young July 14 1915, and served 10 years of a 12-year sentence. In May 1941, Gorges was arrested and again sent to gaol for obtaining clothes from Simpsons of Piccadilly with a worthless cheque. In January 1944 he was killed after being run over by a train in the London Underground.

Only a short time after the theft, accusations began to be made, most especially by overseas press, that proper investigation of the theft was being suppressed by the British Government to protect prominent names. This led to such claims regularly being made in Parliament by Irish MPs for several years.

There was a theory that the jewels were stolen by political activists who were in the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In the House of Commons in August 1907, Pat O&#x27;Brien, MP, blamed &quot;loyal and patriotic Unionist criminals&quot;. Lord Haddo, the son of the Lord Lieutenant, was alleged by some newspapers to have been involved in the theft; Augustine Birrell, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, stated in the Commons that Haddo had been in Great Britain throughout the time period within which the theft took place. In 1912 and 1913, Laurence Ginnell suggested that the police investigation had established the identity of the thief, that his report had been suppressed to avoid scandal, and that the jewels were &quot;at present within the reach of the Irish Government awaiting the invention of some plausible method of restoring them without getting entangled in the Criminal Law&quot;. In an adjournment debate in 1912 he alleged:

His speech was curtailed when a quorum of forty MPs was not present in the chamber. He elaborated the following week on the alleged depravity of &quot;two of the characters&quot;, namely army captain Richard Gorges (&quot;a reckless bully, a robber, a murderer, a bugger, and a sod&quot;) and Shackleton (&quot;One of [Gorges&#x27;] chums in the castle, and a participant in the debauchery&quot;). Birrell denied any cover-up and urged Ginnell to give to the police any evidence he had relating to the theft or any sexual crime. Walter Vavasour Faber also asked about a cover-up; Edward Legge supported this theory.

On 23 November 1912, the &quot;London Mail&quot; alleged that Vicars had allowed a woman reported to be his mistress to obtain a copy to the key to the safe and that she had fled to Paris with the jewels. In July 1913, Vicars sued the paper for libel; it admitted that the story was completely baseless and that the woman in question did not exist; Vicars was awarded damages of £5,000. Vicars left nothing in his will to his half-brother Pierce O&#x27;Mahony, on the grounds that O&#x27;Mahony had repudiated a promise to recompense Vicars for the loss of income caused by his resignation.

After Frank Shackleton was imprisoned in 1914 for passing a cheque stolen from a spinster, Earl Winterton asked for the judicial inquiry demanded by Vicars.

A 1927 memo of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, released in the 1970s, stated that W. T. Cosgrave &quot;understands that the Castle jewels are for sale and that they could be got for £2,000 or £3,000.&quot; However, it has been suggested that this is a misunderstanding, the memorandum having resulted from a communication to Cosgrave from a Dublin jeweller, James Weldon, who had been theoretically offered the jewels by a man fitting the description of Frank Shackleton, but in 1908.
In 1965, &quot;Vicious Circle: The Case of the Missing Irish Crown Jewels&quot; was published. While not ascribing definitive responsibility for the theft, it was the most detailed account to that date. In 2002, another published account, &quot;Scandal &amp; Betrayal: Shackleton And The Irish Crown Jewels&quot; suggested the theft was a Unionist plot to embarrass the Liberal government. A reviewer called it &quot;speculation and allegation dressed up as history&quot;. A 2003 study, &quot;The Stealing Of The Irish Crown Jewels&quot;, stated that while Shackleton and Gorges may have been shielded from prosecution due to fears they would expose homosexuality in prominent figures, this was only speculation, and the police may simply not have had enough evidence against them. In 2023, &quot;A Secret Between Gentlemen&quot; further detailed the British Government&#x27;s suppression of the case, and its hesitancy in prosecuting Shackleton in 1913 over his defrauding of Gower&#x27;s fortune. It served to strengthen Bulmer Hobson&#x27;s allegation over the reason for the Government&#x27;s behaviour in 1908.

Folklore within the Genealogical Office of the Republic of Ireland, the successor to the Office of Arms, was that the jewels were never removed from the Clock Tower, but were merely hidden. In 1983, when the Genealogical Office vacated its structurally unsound premises inside the Clock Tower, Donal Begley, the then-Chief Herald of Ireland supervised the removal of walls and floorboards, in case the jewels were found, but they were not.

===Fictional accounts===
A 1967 book suggests that the 1908 Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; was inspired by the theft; author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a friend of Vicars, and the fictional Valentine Walters, who steals the Plans but is caught by Holmes, has similarities with Francis Shackleton.

&quot;Jewels&quot;, a Bob Perrin novel based on the theft, was published in 1977.

&quot;The Case of the Crown Jewels&quot; by Donald Serrell Thomas, a Sherlock Holmes story based on the theft, was published in 1997.

<text>The Battle of Princeton was a battle of the American Revolutionary War, fought near Princeton, New Jersey on January 3, 1777, and ending in a small victory for the Colonials. General Lord Cornwallis had left 1,400 British troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton. Following a surprise attack at Trenton early in the morning of December 26, 1776, General George Washington of the Continental Army decided to attack the British in New Jersey before entering the winter quarters. On December 30, he crossed the Delaware River back into New Jersey. His troops followed on January 3, 1777. Washington advanced to Princeton by a back road, where he pushed back a smaller British force but had to retreat before Cornwallis arrived with reinforcements. The battles of Trenton and Princeton boosted the morale of the patriot cause, leading many recruits to join the Continental Army in the spring.

After defeating the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26, 1776, Washington withdrew back to Pennsylvania. He subsequently decided to attack the British forces before going into winter quarters. On December 29, he led his army back into Trenton. On the night of January 2, 1777, Washington repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek. That night, he evacuated his position, circled General Cornwallis&#x27; army, and attacked the British garrison at Princeton.

On January 3, Brigadier General Hugh Mercer of the Continental Army clashed with two regiments under the command of Mawhood. Mercer and his troops were overrun, and Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent a brigade of militia under Brigadier General John Cadwalader to help them. On seeing the flight of Mercer&#x27;s men, the militia began to flee. Washington rode up with reinforcements and rallied the fleeing militia. He then led the attack on Mawhood&#x27;s troops, driving them back. Mawhood gave the order to retreat, and most of the troops tried to flee to Cornwallis in Trenton.

In Princeton, Brigadier General John Sullivan encouraged some British troops who had taken refuge in Nassau Hall to surrender, ending the battle. After the battle, Washington moved his army to Morristown, and with their third defeat in 10 days, the British evacuated Central Jersey. The battle (while considered minor by British standards) was the last major action of Washington&#x27;s winter New Jersey campaign.

==Background==
===Victories at Trenton===
On the night of December 25–26, 1776, General George Washington, Commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, led 2,400 men across the Delaware River. After a nine-mile march, they seized the town of Trenton on the morning of December 26, killing or wounding over 100 Hessians and capturing 900 more. Soon after capturing the town, Washington led the army back across the Delaware into Pennsylvania. On December 29, Washington once again led the army across the river and established a defensive position at Trenton. On December 31, Washington appealed to his men, whose enlistments expired at the end of the year, &quot;Stay for just six more weeks for an extra bounty of ten dollars.&quot; His appeal worked, and most of the men agreed to stay. Also that day, Washington learned that Congress had voted to give him wide-ranging powers for six months that are often described as dictatorial.

In response to the loss at Trenton, General Cornwallis left New York City and reassembled a British force of more than 9,000 at Princeton to oppose Washington. Leaving 1,200 men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Mawhood at Princeton, Cornwallis left Princeton on January 2 in command of 8,000 men to attack Washington&#x27;s army of 6,000 troops. Washington sent troops to skirmish with the approaching British to delay their advance. It was almost nightfall by the time the British reached Trenton. After three failed attempts to cross the bridge over the Assunpink Creek, beyond which were the primary American defenses, Cornwallis called off the attack until the next day.

===Evacuation===

During the night, Washington called a council of war and asked his officers whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the back roads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition at the end of December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best option was to attack Princeton.

Washington ordered that the excess baggage be taken to Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it possible to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British think that they were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.

By 2:00 am, the entire army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through what is now Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded, and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, as some of the route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip and men to break through ice on ponds.

===Plan of attack===
As dawn came, the army approached a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, off to the right of this road, there was an unused road that crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.

However, Washington was running behind schedule as he had planned to attack and capture the British outposts before dawn and capture the garrison shortly afterward. By the time dawn broke he was still two miles from the town. According to the standard account of the battle, Washington sent 350 men under the command of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer to destroy the bridge over Stony Brook in order to delay Cornwallis&#x27;s army when he found out that Washington had escaped. According to a newer analysis, however, Brigadier General Thomas Mifflin was tasked with the bridge, and Mercer&#x27;s forces did not break off from the main column until later.

Shortly before 8:00 am, Washington wheeled the rest of the army to the right down the unused road. First in the column went General John Sullivan&#x27;s division consisting of Arthur St. Clair&#x27;s and Isaac Sherman&#x27;s brigades. Following them were John Cadwalader&#x27;s brigade and then Daniel Hitchcock&#x27;s.

===Mawhood&#x27;s reaction===
Cornwallis had sent orders to Mawhood to bring the 17th and 55th British regiments to join his army in the morning. Mawhood had moved out from Princeton to fulfill these orders when his troops climbed the hill south of Stony Brook and sighted the main American army. Unable to figure out the size of the American army because of the wooded hills, he sent a rider to warn the 40th British Regiment, which he had left in Princeton, then wheeled the 17th and 55th Regiments around and headed back to Princeton. That day, Mawhood had called off the patrol which was to reconnoiter the area from which Washington was approaching.

Mercer received word that Mawhood was leading his troops back to Princeton. Mercer, on orders from Washington, moved his column to the right in order to hit the British before they could confront Washington&#x27;s main army. Mercer moved towards Mawhood&#x27;s rear, but when he realized he would not be able to cut off Mawhood in time, he decided to join Sullivan. When Mawhood learned that Mercer was in his rear and moving to join Sullivan, Mawhood detached part of the 55th Regiment to join the 40th Regiment in the town and then moved the rest of the 55th, the 17th, fifty cavalry, and two artillery pieces to attack Mercer.

==Battle==
===Mawhood overruns Mercer===
Mawhood ordered his light troops to delay Mercer, while he brought up the other detachments. Mercer was walking through William Clark&#x27;s orchard when the British light troops appeared. The British light troops&#x27; volley went high, which gave time for Mercer to wheel his troops around into battle line. Mercer&#x27;s troops advanced, pushing back the British light troops. The Americans took up a position behind a fence at the upper end of the orchard. However, Mawhood had brought up his troops and his artillery. The American gunners opened fire first, and for about ten minutes, the outnumbered American infantry exchanged fire with the British. However, many of the Americans had rifles which took longer to load than muskets. Mawhood ordered a bayonet charge, and because many of the Americans had rifles, which could not be equipped with bayonets, they were overrun. Both of the Americans&#x27; cannon were captured, and the British turned them on the fleeing troops. Mercer was surrounded by British soldiers, and they shouted at him &quot;Surrender, you damn rebel!&quot; Declining to ask for quarter, Mercer chose to resist instead. The British, thinking they had caught Washington, bayoneted him and then left him for dead. Mercer&#x27;s second in command, Colonel John Haslet, was shot through the head and killed.

===Cadwalader&#x27;s arrival===
Fifty light infantrymen were in pursuit of Mercer&#x27;s men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen under the command of Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line, but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men reached the top of the hill and saw Mercer&#x27;s men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.

===Washington&#x27;s arrival===
As Cadwalader&#x27;s men began to flee, the American guns opened fire onto the British, who were preparing to attack, and the guns were able to hold them off for several minutes. Cadwalader was able to get one company to fire a volley but it fled immediately afterwards. At this point, Washington arrived with the Virginia Continentals and Edward Hand&#x27;s riflemen. Washington ordered the riflemen and the Virginians to take up a position on the right hand side of the hill, and then Washington quickly rode over to Cadwalader&#x27;s fleeing men. Washington shouted, &quot;Parade with us my brave fellows! There is but a handful of the enemy and we shall have them directly!&quot;. Cadwalader&#x27;s men formed into battle formation at Washington&#x27;s direction. When Daniel Hitchcock&#x27;s New England Continentals arrived, Washington sent them to the right, where he had put the riflemen and the Virginians.

Washington, with his hat in his hand, rode forward and waved the Americans forward. At this point, Mawhood had moved his troops slightly to the left to get out of the range of the American artillery fire. Washington gave orders not to fire until he gave them the signal, and when they were thirty yards away, he turned around on his horse, facing his men and said &quot;Halt!&quot; and then &quot;Fire!&quot;. At this moment, the British also fired, obscuring the field in a cloud of smoke. One of Washington&#x27;s officers, John Fitzgerald, pulled his hat over his eyes to avoid seeing Washington killed, but when the smoke cleared, Washington appeared, unharmed, waving his men forward.

===British collapse===
On the right, Hitchcock&#x27;s New Englanders fired a volley and then advanced again, threatening to turn the British flank. The riflemen were slowly picking off British soldiers while the American artillery was firing grapeshot at the British lines. At this point, Hitchcock ordered his men to charge, and the British began to flee. The British attempted to save their artillery, but the militia also charged, and Mawhood gave the order to retreat. The British fled towards the Post Road followed by the Americans. Washington reportedly shouted, &quot;It&#x27;s a fine fox chase my boys!&quot; Some Americans had swarmed onto the Post Road in order to block a British retreat across the bridge, but Mawhood ordered a bayonet charge and broke through the American lines, escaping across the bridge. Some of the Americans, Hand&#x27;s riflemen among them, continued to pursue the British, and Mawhood ordered his dragoons to buy them some time to retreat; however, the dragoons were pushed back. Some Americans continued to pursue the fleeing British until nightfall, killing some and taking some prisoners. After some time, Washington turned around and rode back to Princeton.

At the edge of town, the 55th Regiment received orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, on the north side of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.

==Aftermath==
After entering Princeton, the Americans began to loot the abandoned British supply wagons and the town. With news that Cornwallis was approaching, Washington knew he had to leave Princeton. Washington wanted to push on to New Brunswick and capture a British pay chest of 70,000 pounds, but Major Generals Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene talked him out of it. Instead, Washington moved his army to Somerset Courthouse on the night of January 3, then marched to Pluckemin by January 5, and arrived at Morristown by sunset the next day for winter encampment. After the battle, Cornwallis abandoned many of his posts in New Jersey and ordered his army to retreat to New Brunswick. The next several months of the war consisted of a series of small scale skirmishes known as the Forage War.

==Casualties==
General Howe&#x27;s official casualty report for the battle stated 18 killed, 58 wounded and 200 missing. Mark Boatner says that the Americans took 194 prisoners during the battle, while the remaining 6 &quot;missing&quot; men may have been killed. A civilian eyewitness (the anonymous writer of &quot;A Brief Narrative of the Ravages of the British and Hessians at Princeton in 1776–1777&quot;) wrote that 24 British soldiers were found dead on the field. Washington claimed that the British had more than 100 killed and 300 captured. William S. Stryker follows Washington in stating that the British loss was 100 men killed, 70 wounded and 280 captured.

Washington reported his own army&#x27;s casualties as 6 or 7 officers and 25 to 30 enlisted men killed, giving no figures for the wounded. Richard M. Ketchum states that the Americans had &quot;30 enlisted men and 14 officers killed&quot;; Henry B. Dawson gives 10 officers and 30 enlisted men killed; while Edward G. Lengel gives total casualties as 25 killed and 40 wounded. The Loyalist newspaper, &quot;New York Gazette and Weekly Mercury&quot;, reported on January 17, 1777, that the American losses at Princeton had been 400 killed and wounded.

The colonnade on the Princetown Battlefield Monument marks the common grave of 15 Americans and 21 British killed. In addition, one British officer, Captain William Leslie, died of his wounds and was buried at Pluckemin, New Jersey.

==Consequences==
The British viewed Trenton and Princeton as minor American victories, but with these victories, the Americans believed that they could win the war. American historians often consider the Battle of Princeton a great victory, on par with the Battle of Trenton, because of the subsequent loss of control of most of New Jersey by the Crown forces. Ira D. Gruber pronounced that the battles of &quot;Trenton and Princeton were supremely important: destroying the illusion of British invincibility, making patriots of potential loyalists, and spoiling [British] hopes for an end to the war and a start toward a lasting reunion.&quot; Some other historians, such as Edward Lengel, consider Princeton to be even more impressive than Trenton. A century later, British historian Sir George Otto Trevelyan wrote in a study of the American Revolution, when talking about the impact of the victories at Trenton and Princeton, that &quot;It may be doubted whether so small a number of men ever employed so short a space of time with greater and more lasting effects upon the history of the world.&quot;

==Legacy==
Part of the battlefield is now preserved in Princeton Battlefield State Park, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Another section of the battlefield adjacent to the state park was embroiled in a development controversy. The Institute for Advanced Study, which owns the property, had planned a housing project on land where George Washington charged with his men during the battle. Historians, the Department of the Interior and archaeological evidence confirm the land&#x27;s significance. Several national and local preservation organizations worked to prevent construction on the property, and the Princeton Battlefield Society had legal action pending as of summer 2016. On December 12, 2016, the American Battlefield Trust announced that through its Campaign 1776 project to preserve land at battlefields of the Revolutionary War and War of 1812, it had reached an agreement to purchase almost 15 acres of land from the Institute for Advanced Study valued at $4 million. This purchase would increase the size of the state park by 16%. Seven of the planned single family dwellings would be replaced with townhouses and a total of 16 housing units would be constructed. The compromise arrangement was subject to approval by the Princeton Planning Board and Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission. The Trust had already acquired and preserved nine other acres of the Princeton battlefield. On May 30, 2018, the Trust announced that it had finalized the purchase after raising almost $3.2 million from private donors, which was matched by an $837,000 grant from the National Park Service and the Mercer County Open Space Assistance Program. The completed purchase ended the long dispute over how and whether the battlefield land would be developed. As of mid-2023, the Trust and its partners had preserved more than 24 acres of the battlefield.

The equestrian statue of George Washington at Washington Circle in Washington, D.C. depicts him at the Battle of Princeton. Sculptor Clark Mills said in his speech at the statue&#x27;s dedication ceremony on February 22, 1860, &quot;The incident selected for representation of this statue was at the battle of Princeton where Washington, after several ineffectual attempts to rally his troops, advanced so near the enemy&#x27;s lines that his horse refused to go further, but stood and trembled while the brave rider sat undaunted with reins in hand. But while his noble horse is represented thus terror stricken, the dauntless hero is calm and dignified, ever believing himself the instrument in the hand of Providence to work out the great problem of liberty.&quot;

Eight current Army National Guard units (101st Eng Bn, 103rd Eng Bn, A/1-104th Cav, 111th Inf, 125th QM Co, 175th Inf, 181st Inf and 198th Sig Bn) and one currently-active Regular Army Artillery battalion (1–5th FA) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Princeton.

A famous story, possibly apocryphal, states that during the Battle of Princeton, Alexander Hamilton ordered his cannon to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall. As a result, one of the cannonballs was shot through the head of the portrait of King George II that hung in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington. Tangentially, a few years earlier Hamilton had been refused accelerated study at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) housed in Nassau Hall.

<doc id="218914" wikidata="Q914218" url="?curid=218914" title="Isauria">
<text>Isauria ( or ; ), in ancient geography, is a rugged, isolated district in the interior of Asia Minor, of very different extent at different periods, but generally covering what is now the district of Bozkır and its surroundings in the Konya Province of Turkey, or the core of the Taurus Mountains. In its coastal extension it bordered on Cilicia.
It derives its name from the warlike Isaurian tribe and the twin settlements &quot;Isaura Palaea&quot; (Ἰσαυρα Παλαιά, Latin: &quot;Isaura Vetus&quot; &#x27;Old Isaura&#x27;) and &quot;Isaura Nea&quot; (Ἰσαυρα Νέα, Latin: &quot;Isaura Nova&quot; &#x27;New Isaura&#x27;).
The Isaurians were fiercely independent mountain people who marauded and created havoc in neighboring districts under Macedonian and Roman occupations.

== History ==

=== Early ===
The permanent nucleus of Isauria was north of the Taurus range which lies directly south of Iconium and Lystra. Lycaonia had all the Iconian plain; but Isauria began as soon as the foothills were reached. Its two original towns, Isaura Nea and Isaura Palaea, lay, one among these foothills (Doria) and the other on the watershed (Zengibar Kalesi), located at approximately 37°29′N 32°12′E near Bozkir.

In the 4th century BC, Isauria was the wild district about Isaura Palaea and the heads of the Calycadnus. When the capital, Isaura (also known as Isaura Vetus or Isaura Palaea), a strongly fortified city at the foot of Mt. Taurus, was besieged by Perdiccas, the Macedonian regent after Alexander the Great&#x27;s death, the Isaurians set the place alight and let it perish in flames rather than submit to capture.

=== Roman rule ===

When the Romans first encountered the Isaurians (early in the 1st century BC), they regarded Cilicia Trachea as part of Isauria, which thus extended to the Mediterranean Sea; and this extension of the name continued to be in common use for two centuries. The whole basin of the Calycadnus was reckoned Isaurian, and the cities in the valley of its southern branch formed what was known as the Isaurian Decapolis.

The Isaurians were brought partially under control (76–75 BC) by the Romans. During the war of the Cilician and other pirates against Rome, the Isaurians took so active a part that the proconsul P. Servilius deemed it necessary to follow them into their rugged strongholds, and compel the whole people to submission, an exploit for which he received the title of Isauricus (75 BC).

In the year AD 6, Cassius Dio mentions that the Isaurians were marauding through the province of Asia until they were faced with open war and were defeated.

The Isaurians were afterwards placed for a time under the rule of Amyntas, king of Galatia; but it is evident that they continued to retain their predatory habits and virtual independence. In the 3rd century they sheltered the rebel emperor Trebellianus.

In the early 4th century, all Cilicia was detached by order of Diocletian for administrative purposes from the northern slope of Taurus. A province called at first Isauria-Lycaonia, and later Isauria alone, extended up to the limits of Galatia, but not past Taurus on the south. Pisidia, part of which had hitherto been included in one province with Isauria, was also detached, and made to include Iconium; Isauria received the eastern part of Pamphylia. The coastal Metropolis of Seleucia was designated as Isauria&#x27;s provincial capital.

In the 4th century they were still described by Ammianus Marcellinus as the scourge of the neighbouring provinces of Asia Minor, with a major series of raids occurring from AD 404 to 409, including one campaign to eradicate them led by the Eastern Roman general Arbazacius, but they were said to have been effectually subdued in the reign of Justinian I.

Some Byzantine emperors were of Isaurian descent: Zeno, whose native name was Tarasicodissa Rousoumbladadiotes; his son, Leo II; and perhaps Leontius, who reigned from 695 to 698. The empire used Isaurians as soldiers, generals and at one point they even formed part of the emperor&#x27;s personal guard, the Excubitores. However, the population of Constantinople considered the Isaurians as barbarians, and emperor Anastasius I had to fight a long war against Isaurian rebels (Isaurian War, 492–497).

=== Later ===
The ruins of Isaura Palaea are mainly remarkable for their fine situation, fortifications and tombs. Those of Isaura Nea have disappeared, but numerous inscriptions and many sculpture stelae, built into the houses of Dorla, prove the site. It was the latter, and not the former town, that Servilius reduced by cutting off the water supply. J. R. S. Sterrett explored in the highland of Isauria in 1885 but it was not exhaustive. The site was identified by W. M. Ramsay in 1901.

Ramsay discovered there more than fifty Greek inscriptions, the greater number Christian, as well as magnificent tombs. These monuments date from the third, fourth, and fifth centuries.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
It is argued that Paul evangelised in Claudiopolis, the only Roman colony in the region by that time.

The Isaurian church was originally under the authority of the Patriarch of Antioch, but was attached to the Patriarch of Constantinople in the late 7th or early 8th century.

Because Aetius, fl 451. is called in inscriptions bishop of Isauropolis and Isaura Palaea and as no &quot;Notitia episcopatuum&quot; makes mention of Isaura, or Isauropolis, Ramsay supposes that the Diocese of Isaura Nova was early joined with that of Leontopolis, the more recent name of Isaura Palaea which is mentioned in all the &quot;Notitiae&quot;.

<doc id="218924" wikidata="Q2345155" url="?curid=218924" title="Tsutomu Shimomura">
<text>is a Japanese-born physicist and computer security expert. He is known for helping the FBI track and arrest hacker Kevin Mitnick. &quot;Takedown&quot;, his 1996 book on the subject with journalist John Markoff, was later adapted for the screen in &quot;Track Down&quot; in 2000.

Shimomura was a founder of semiconductor company Neofocal Systems, and was CEO and CTO until 2016.

==Biography==
Born in Japan, Shimomura is the son of Osamu Shimomura, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, and attended Princeton High School.

At Caltech he studied under Nobel laureate Richard Feynman. After Caltech, he went on to work at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he continued his hands-on education in the position of staff physicist with Brosl Hasslacher and others on subjects such as lattice gas automata.

In 1989, he became a research scientist in computational physics at the University of California, San Diego, and senior fellow at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Shimomura also became a noted computer security expert, working for the National Security Agency.

In 1992, he testified before Congress on issues regarding the privacy and security (or lack thereof) on cellular telephones. Author Bruce Sterling described his first meeting with Shimomura in the documentary &quot;Freedom Downtime&quot;:

He is best known for events in 1995, when he assisted with tracking down the computer hacker Kevin Mitnick. In that year Shimomura also received prank calls which popularized the phrase &quot;My kung fu is stronger than yours&quot;, equating it with hacking. Shimomura and journalist John Markoff wrote a book, &quot;&quot;, about the pursuit, and the book was later adapted into a movie with a very similar name, &quot;Track Down&quot;. Shimomura, himself, appeared in a brief cameo in the movie. 

Shimomura worked for Sun Microsystems during the late 1990s.

Shimomura was a founder of privately held fabless semiconductor company Neofocal Systems, and was CEO and CTO until 2016.

==Criticism==
Kevin Mitnick and others have raised legal and ethical questions concerning Shimomura&#x27;s involvement in his case. California author Jonathan Littman wrote a 1996 book about the case called &quot;The Fugitive Game: Online with Kevin Mitnick&quot;, in which he presented Mitnick&#x27;s side of the story, which was a very different version from the events written in Shimomura and Markoff&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. In his book, Littman made allegations of journalistic impropriety against Markoff and questioned the legality of Shimomura&#x27;s involvement in the matter, as well as suggesting that many parts of &quot;Takedown&quot; were fabricated by its authors for self-serving purposes. Mitnick&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Ghost in the Wires&quot;, further expands on concerns that Shimomura&#x27;s involvement in the case was both unethical and illegal.

<text>The World Athletics Championships, known as the IAAF World Championships in Athletics until 2019, are a biennial athletics competition organized by World Athletics, formerly International Association of Athletics Federations. Alongside Olympic Games, the championships represents the highest level of senior international outdoor athletics competition for track and field athletics globally, including marathon running and race walking. Separate World Championships are held by World Athletics for certain other outdoor events, including cross-country running and half-marathon, as well as indoor and age-group championship.

The World Championships were started in 1976 in response to the International Olympic Committee dropping the men&#x27;s 50 km walk from the Olympic programme for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, despite its constant presence at the games since 1932. The IAAF chose to host its own world championship event, a month and a half after the Olympics. It was the first World Championships that the IAAF had hosted separately from the Olympic Games.

A second limited event was held in 1980, and the inaugural championships in 1983, with all the events, is considered the official start of the competition. Until 1980, the Olympic champions were also considered as reigning world champions.

At their debut, these championships were then held every four years, until 1991 when they switched to a two-year cycle. In 2024, World Athletics announced that the new biennial competition, World Athletics Ultimate Championship, featuring only up to 16 of the world&#x27;s top-ranked athletes per discipline, would be held every even year from 2026 onwards.

==History==

The idea of having an Athletics World Championships was around well before the competition&#x27;s first event in 1983. In 1913, the IAAF decided that the Olympic Games would serve as the World Championships for athletics. This was considered suitable for over 50 years until in the late 1960s the desire of many IAAF members to have their own World Championships began to grow. In 1976 at the IAAF Council Meeting in Puerto Rico an Athletics World Championships separate from the Olympic Games was approved.

Following bids from both Stuttgart, West Germany and Helsinki, Finland, the IAAF Council awarded the inaugural competition to Helsinki, to take place in 1983 and be held in the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (where the 1952 Summer Olympics had been held).

Two IAAF world championship events preceded the inaugural edition of the World Championships in Athletics in 1983. The 1976 World Championships had just one event – the men&#x27;s 50 kilometres walk which was dropped from the Olympic programme for the 1976 Summer Olympics and the IAAF responded by setting up their own contest. Four years later, the 1980 World Championships contained only two newly approved women&#x27;s events, (400 metres hurdles and 3000 metres), neither of which featured on the programme for the 1980 Summer Olympics.

Over the years the competition has grown in size. In 1983 1,333 athletes from 153 countries participated. By the 2003 competition, in Paris, it had grown to 1,679 athletes from 198 countries with coverage being transmitted to 179 countries.

From 2019 to 2022 the championships were sponsored by Qatar National Bank, which has been described as being part of Qatar&#x27;s soft power policy.

There has also been a change in composition over the years, with several new events, all for women, being added. By 2005, the only differences were men&#x27;s competition in the 50 km walk, and equivalent events in women&#x27;s 100 m hurdles and heptathlon to men&#x27;s 110 m hurdles and decathlon.

The following list shows when new events were added for the first time.

*1987, women&#x27;s 10,000 m and 10 km walk were added.
*1993, women&#x27;s triple jump was added.
*1995, women&#x27;s 3,000 m was replaced by the 5000 m.
*1999, women&#x27;s pole vault and hammer were added and the women&#x27;s 20 km walk replaced the 10 km walk.
*2005, women&#x27;s 3000 m steeplechase was added.
*2017, women&#x27;s 50 km walk was added.
*2019, mixed 4 × 400 m relay was added.
*2022, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s 35 km walk replaced the 50 km walk.

==All-time placing table==
In the &quot;IAAF placing table&quot; the total score is obtained from assigning eight points to the first place and so on to one point for the eight placed finalists. Points are shared in situations where a tie occurs. However, the IAAF site shows all points rounded to the nearest integer.

&quot;Updated after the 2022 Championships&quot;
;Notes
* including points earned by athletes from East Germany (510 pts) and West Germany (191.5 pts) at the 1976, 1980, 1983 and 1987 Championships.
* including points earned by Authorised Neutral Athletes (103.5 pts) at the 2017 and 2019 Championships.

==World records==
A total of 36 world records have been set or equalled at the competition: 18 by men, 15 by women, and 3 in the mixed relay.

The first world record to be set at the World Championships was by Jarmila Kratochvílová of Czechoslovakia, who ran 47.99 seconds to win the 1983 women&#x27;s 400 m final.

A peak of five world records came at the 1993 Championships.

The most recent world record was in the Mixed 4 × 400 metres relay in 2023, when the US team set a time of 3:08.80. World records have become less common as the history of the event has expanded, with no world records set in the 1997, 2001, 2007 or 2013 editions.

American athletes have been the most successful with fifteen world records, followed by Jamaica and Great Britain on four each. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt has broken the most world records at the competition, at four, while American Carl Lewis set three. Jonathan Edwards holds the distinction of breaking the world record twice in one championships: improving upon his own newly-set world record in the 1995 men&#x27;s triple jump final. The men&#x27;s 4 × 100 metres relay has yielded the most world records, with five set between 1983 and 2011.

Ben Johnson&#x27;s time of 9.83 seconds at the 1987 World Championships men&#x27;s 100 m final was initially considered to be a world record, but this was rescinded in 1989 after Johnson admitted to steroid use between 1981 and 1988.

Also, the 2009 Jamaican men&#x27;s 4 × 100 metres relay team time of 37.31 seconds was retrospectively recognised to as the world record after the team&#x27;s time of 37.10 at the 2008 Olympics was rescinded after the disqualification of Nesta Carter (who was not present in the World Championships team).

<doc id="218930" wikidata="Q875724" url="?curid=218930" title="Railgun">
<text>A railgun or rail gun, sometimes referred to as a rail cannon, is a linear motor device, typically designed as a weapon, that uses electromagnetic force to launch high-velocity projectiles. The projectile normally does not contain explosives, instead relying on the projectile&#x27;s high kinetic energy to inflict damage. The railgun uses a pair of parallel rail-shaped conductors (simply called rails), along which a sliding projectile called an armature is accelerated by the electromagnetic effects of a current that flows down one rail, into the armature and then back along the other rail. It is based on principles similar to those of the homopolar motor.

As of 2020, railguns have been researched as weapons utilizing electromagnetic forces to impart a very high kinetic energy to a projectile (e.g. APFSDS) rather than using conventional propellants. While explosive-powered military guns cannot readily achieve a muzzle velocity of more than ≈, railguns can readily exceed . For a similar projectile, the range of railguns may exceed that of conventional guns. The destructive force of a projectile depends upon its kinetic energy (proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity) at the point of impact. Because of the potentially higher velocity of a railgun-launched projectile, its force may be much greater than conventionally launched projectiles of the same mass. The absence of explosive propellants or warheads to store and handle, as well as the low cost of projectiles compared to conventional weaponry, are also advantageous.

Railguns are still very much at the research stage after decades of R&amp;D, and it remains to be seen whether they will be deployed as practical military weapons in the foreseeable future. Any trade-off analysis between electromagnetic (EM) propulsion systems and chemical propellants for weapons applications must also factor in its durability, availability and economics, as well as the novelty, bulkiness, high energy demand, and complexity of the pulsed power supplies that are needed for electromagnetic launcher systems.

==Basics==
The railgun in its simplest form differs from a traditional electric motor in that no use is made of additional field windings (or permanent magnets). This basic configuration is formed by a single loop of current and thus requires high currents (on the order of one million amperes) to produce sufficient accelerations (and muzzle velocities). A relatively common variant of this configuration is the &quot;augmented railgun&quot; in which the driving current is channeled through additional pairs of parallel conductors, arranged to increase (&#x27;augment&#x27;) the magnetic field experienced by the moving armature. These arrangements reduce the current required for a given acceleration. In electric motor terminology, augmented railguns are usually series-wound configurations. Some railguns also use strong neodymium magnets with the field perpendicular to the current flow to increase the force on the projectile.

The armature may be an integral part of the projectile, but it may also be configured to accelerate a separate, electrically isolated or non-conducting projectile. Solid, metallic sliding conductors are often the preferred form of railgun armature but plasma or &#x27;hybrid&#x27; armatures can also be used. A plasma armature is formed by an arc of ionised gas that is used to push a solid, non-conducting payload in a similar manner to the propellant gas pressure in a conventional gun. A hybrid armature uses a pair of plasma contacts to interface a metallic armature to the gun rails. Solid armatures may also &#x27;transition&#x27; into hybrid armatures, typically after a particular velocity threshold is exceeded. The high current required to power a railgun can be provided by various power supply technologies, such as capacitors, pulse generators and disc generators.

For potential military applications, railguns are usually of interest because they can achieve much greater muzzle velocities than guns powered by conventional chemical propellants. Increased muzzle velocities with better aerodynamically streamlined projectiles can convey the benefits of increased firing ranges while, in terms of target effects, increased terminal velocities can allow the use of kinetic energy rounds incorporating hit-to-kill guidance, as replacements for explosive shells. Therefore, typical military railgun designs aim for muzzle velocities in the range of with muzzle energies of 5–50 megajoules
(MJ). For comparison, 50MJ is equivalent to the kinetic energy of a school bus weighing 5 metric tons, traveling at . For single loop railguns, these mission requirements require launch currents of a few million amperes, so a typical railgun power supply might be designed to deliver a launch current of 5 MA for a few milliseconds. As the magnetic field strengths required for such launches will typically be approximately 10 tesla (100 kilogauss), most contemporary railgun designs are effectively air-cored, i.e., they do not use ferromagnetic materials such as iron to enhance the magnetic flux. However, if the barrel is made of a magnetically permeable material, the magnetic field strength increases because of the increase in permeability (&quot;μ&quot; = &quot;μ&quot;0*&quot;μ&quot;r, where &quot;μ&quot; is the effective permeability, &quot;μ&quot;0 is the permeability constant and &quot;μ&quot;r is the relative permeability of the barrel, and formula_1 ). The field &#x27;felt&#x27; by the armature is proportional to formula_2, so the increased field increases the force on the projectile.

Railgun velocities generally fall within the range of those achievable by two-stage light-gas guns; however, the latter are generally only considered to be suitable for laboratory use, while railguns are judged to offer some potential prospects for development as military weapons. A light gas gun, the Combustion Light Gas Gun in a 155 mm prototype form was projected to achieve 2500 m/s with a 70 caliber barrel. In some hypervelocity research projects, projectiles are &#x27;pre-injected&#x27; into railguns, to avoid the need for a standing start, and both two-stage light-gas guns and conventional powder guns have been used for this role. In principle, if railgun power supply technology can be developed to provide safe, compact, reliable, combat survivable, and lightweight units, then the total system volume and mass needed to accommodate such a power supply and its primary fuel can become less than the required total volume and mass for a mission equivalent quantity of conventional propellants and explosive ammunition. Arguably such technology has been matured with the introduction of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) (albeit that railguns require much higher system powers, because roughly similar energies must be delivered in a few milliseconds, as opposed to a few seconds). Such a development would then convey a further military advantage in that the elimination of explosives from any military weapons platform will decrease its vulnerability to enemy fire.

==History==
The concept of the railgun was first introduced by French inventor André Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplée, who created a small working model in 1917 with the help of the &quot;Société anonyme des accumulateurs Tudor&quot; (now Tudor Batteries). During World War I, the French Director of Inventions at the Ministry of Armaments, Jules-Louis Brenton, commissioned Fauchon-Villeplee to develop a 30-mm to 50-mm electric cannon on 25 July 1918, after delegates from the Commission des Inventions witnessed test trials of the working model in 1917. However, the project was abandoned once World War I ended later that year on 11 November 1918. Fauchon-Villeplee filed for a US patent on 1 April 1919, which was issued in July 1922 as patent no. 1,421,435 &quot;Electric Apparatus for Propelling Projectiles&quot;. In his device, two parallel busbars are connected by the wings of a projectile, and the whole apparatus surrounded by a magnetic field. By passing current through busbars and projectile, a force is induced which propels the projectile along the bus-bars and into flight.

In 1923, Russian scientist A. L. Korol&#x27;kov detailed his criticisms of Fauchon-Villeplee&#x27;s design, arguing against some of the claims that Fauchon-Villeplee made about the advantages of his invention. Korol&#x27;kov eventually concluded that while the construction of a long-range electric gun was within the realm of possibility, the practical application of Fauchon-Villeplee&#x27;s railgun was hindered by its enormous electric energy consumption and its need for a special electric generator of considerable capacity to power it.

In 1944, during World War II, Joachim Hänsler of Germany&#x27;s Ordnance Office proposed the first theoretically viable railgun. By late 1944, the theory behind his electric anti-aircraft gun had been worked out sufficiently to allow the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Flak Command to issue a specification, which demanded a muzzle velocity of and a projectile containing of explosive. The guns were to be mounted in batteries of six firing twelve rounds per minute, and it was to fit existing 12.8 cm FlaK 40 mounts. It was never built. When details were discovered after the war it aroused much interest and a more detailed study was done, culminating with a 1947 report which concluded that it was theoretically feasible, but that each gun would need enough power to illuminate half of Chicago.

During 1950, Sir Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist and first director of the Research School of Physical Sciences at the new Australian National University, initiated the design and construction of the world&#x27;s largest (500 megajoule) homopolar generator. This machine was operational from 1962 and was later used to power a large-scale railgun that was used as a scientific experiment.

In 1980, the Ballistic Research Laboratory (later consolidated to form the U.S. Army Research Laboratory) began a long-term program of theoretical and experimental research on railguns. The work was conducted predominantly at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, and much of the early research drew inspiration from the railgun experiments performed by the Australian National University. Topics of research included plasma dynamics, electromagnetic fields, telemetry, and current and heat transport. While military research into railgun technology in the United States ensued continuously in the following decades, the direction and focus that it took shifted dramatically with major changes in funding levels and the needs of different government agencies. In 1984, the formation of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization caused research goals to shift toward establishing a constellation of satellites to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles. As a result, the U.S. military focused on developing small guided projectiles that could withstand the high-G launch from ultra-high velocity plasma armature railguns. But after the publication of an important Defense Science Board study in 1985, the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, and DARPA were assigned to develop anti-armor, electromagnetic launch technologies for mobile ground combat vehicles. In 1990, the U.S. Army collaborated with the University of Texas at Austin to establish the Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT), which focused on research involving solid and hybrid armatures, rail-armature interactions, and electromagnetic launcher materials. The facility became the Army&#x27;s first Federally Funded Research and Development Center and housed a few of the Army&#x27;s electromagnetic launchers, such as the Medium Caliber Launcher.

Since 1993 the British and American governments have collaborated on a railgun project at the Dundrennan Weapons Testing Centre that culminated in the 2010 test where BAE Systems fired a 3.2 kg (7 pound) projectile at 18.4-megajoules []. In 1994, India&#x27;s DRDO&#x27;s Armament Research and Development Establishment developed a railgun with a 240 kJ, low inductance capacitor bank operating at 5 kV power able to launch projectiles of 3–3.5 g weight to a velocity of more than . In 1995, the Center for Electromagnetics at the University of Texas at Austin designed and developed a rapid-fire railgun launcher called the Cannon-Caliber Electromagnetic Gun. The launcher prototype was later tested at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, where it demonstrated a breech efficiency over 50 percent.

In 2010, the United States Navy tested a BAE Systems-designed compact-sized railgun for ship emplacement that accelerated a 3.2 kg (7 pound) projectile to hypersonic velocities of approximately , or about , with 18.4MJ of kinetic energy. It was the first time in history that such levels of performance were reached. They gave the project the motto &quot;Velocitas Eradico&quot;, Latin for &quot;I, [who am] speed, eradicate&quot;—or in the vernacular, &quot;Speed Kills&quot;.
An earlier railgun of the same design (32-megajoules) resides at the Dundrennan Weapons Testing Centre in the United Kingdom.

Low power, small scale railguns have also made popular college and amateur projects. Several amateurs actively carry out research on railguns.

==Design==

===Theory===
A railgun consists of two parallel metal rails (hence the name). At one end, these rails are connected to an electrical power supply, to form the breech end of the gun. Then, if a conductive projectile is inserted between the rails (e.g. by insertion into the breech), it completes the circuit. Electrons flow from the negative terminal of the power supply up the negative rail, across the projectile, and down the positive rail, back to the power supply.

This current makes the railgun behave as an electromagnet, creating a magnetic field inside the loop formed by the length of the rails up to the position of the armature. In accordance with the right-hand rule, the magnetic field circulates around each conductor. Since the current is in the opposite direction along each rail, the net magnetic field between the rails (B) is directed at right angles to the plane formed by the central axes of the rails and the armature. In combination to all with the current (I) in the armature, this produces a Lorentz force which accelerates the projectile along the rails, always out of the loop (regardless of supply polarity) and away from the power supply, toward the muzzle end of the rails. There are also Lorentz forces acting on the rails and attempting to push them apart, but since the rails are mounted firmly, they cannot move.

By definition, if a current of one ampere flows in a pair of ideal infinitely long parallel conductors that are separated by a distance of one meter, then the magnitude of the force on each meter of those conductors will be exactly 0.2 micro-newtons. Furthermore, in general, the force will be proportional to the square of the magnitude of the current and inversely proportional to the distance between the conductors. It also follows that, for railguns with projectile masses of a few kg and barrel lengths of a few m, very large currents will be required to accelerate projectiles to velocities of the order of 1000 m/s.

A very large power supply, providing on the order of one million amperes of current, will create a tremendous force on the projectile, accelerating it to a speed of many kilometers per second (km/s). Although these speeds are possible, the heat generated from the propulsion of the object is enough to erode the rails rapidly. Under high-use conditions, current railguns would require frequent replacement of the rails, or to use a heat-resistant material that would be conductive enough to produce the same effect. At this time it is generally acknowledged that it will take major breakthroughs in materials science and related disciplines to produce high-powered railguns capable of firing more than a few shots from a single set of rails. The barrel must withstand these conditions for up to several rounds per minute for thousands of shots without failure or significant degradation. These parameters are well beyond the state of the art in materials science.

===Design considerations===
The power supply must be able to deliver large currents, sustained and controlled over a useful amount of time. The most important gauge of power supply effectiveness is the energy it can deliver. As of December 2010, the greatest known energy used to propel a projectile from a railgun was 33 megajoules. The most common forms of power supplies used in railguns are capacitors and compulsators which are slowly charged from other continuous energy sources.

The rails need to withstand enormous repulsive forces during shooting, and these forces will tend to push them apart and away from the projectile. As rail/projectile clearances increase, arcing develops, which causes rapid vaporization and extensive damage to the rail surfaces and the insulator surfaces. This limited some early research railguns to one shot per service interval.

The inductance and resistance of the rails and power supply limit the efficiency of a railgun design. Currently different rail shapes and railgun configurations are being tested, most notably by the U.S. Navy (Naval Research Laboratory), the Institute for Advanced Technology at the University of Texas at Austin, and BAE Systems.

===Materials used===
The rails and projectiles must be built from strong conductive materials; the rails need to survive the violence of an accelerating projectile, and heating because of the large currents and friction involved. Some erroneous work has suggested that the recoil force in railguns can be redirected or eliminated; careful theoretical and experimental analysis reveals that the recoil force acts on the breech closure just as in a chemical firearm. The rails also repel themselves via a sideways force caused by the rails being pushed by the magnetic field, just as the projectile is. The rails need to survive this without bending and must be very securely mounted. Currently published material suggests that major advances in material science must be made before rails can be developed that allow railguns to fire more than a few full-power shots before replacement of the rails is required.

===Heat dissipation===
In current designs massive amounts of heat are created by the electricity flowing through the rails, as well as by the friction of the projectile leaving the device. This causes three main problems: melting of equipment, decreased safety of personnel, and detection by enemy forces owing to increased infrared signature.
As briefly discussed above, the stresses involved in firing this sort of device require an extremely heat-resistant material. Otherwise the rails, barrel, and all equipment attached would melt or be irreparably damaged.

In practice, the rails used with most railgun designs are subject to erosion from each launch. Additionally, projectiles can be subject to some degree of ablation, and this can limit railgun life, in some cases severely.

==Applications==
Railguns have a number of potential practical applications, primarily for the military. However, there are other theoretical applications currently being researched.

===Launch or launch assist of spacecraft===
Electrodynamic assistance to launch rockets has been studied. Space applications of this technology would likely involve specially formed electromagnetic coils and superconducting magnets. Composite materials would likely be used for this application.

For space launches from Earth, relatively short acceleration distances (less than a few km) would require very strong acceleration forces, higher than humans can tolerate. Other designs include a longer helical (spiral) track, or a large ring design whereby a space vehicle would circle the ring numerous times, gradually gaining speed, before being released into a launch corridor leading skyward. Nevertheless, if technically feasible and cost effective to build, imparting hyper-velocity escape velocity to a projectile launching at sea level, where the atmosphere is the most dense, may result in much of the launch velocity being lost to aerodynamic drag. In addition, the projectile might still require some form of on-board guidance and control to realize a useful orbital insertion angle that may not be achievable based simply on the launcher&#x27;s upward elevation angle relative to the surface of the earth, (see practical considerations of escape velocity).

In 2003, Ian McNab outlined a plan to turn this idea into a realized technology. Because of strong acceleration, this system would launch only sturdy materials, such as food, water, and—most importantly—fuel. Under ideal circumstances (equator, mountain, heading east) the system would cost $528/kg, compared with $5,000/kg on the conventional rocket. The McNab railgun could make approximately 2000 launches per year, for a total of maximum 500 tons launched per year. Because the launch track would be 1.6 km long, power will be supplied by a distributed network of 100 rotating machines (compulsator) spread along the track. Each machine would have a 3.3-ton carbon fibre rotor spinning at high speeds. A machine can recharge in a matter of hours using 10 MW power. This machine could be supplied by a dedicated generator. The total launch package would weigh almost 1.4 tons. Payload per launch in these conditions is over 400 kg. There would be a peak operating magnetic field of 5 T—half of this coming from the rails, and the other half from augmenting magnets. This halves the required current through the rails, which reduces the power fourfold.

NASA has proposed to use a railgun to launch &quot;wedge-shaped aircraft with scramjets&quot; to high altitude at Mach 10, where it would then launch a small payload into orbit using conventional rocket propulsion. The extreme g-forces involved with direct railgun ground-launch to space may restrict the usage to only the sturdiest of payloads. Alternatively, very long rail systems may be used to reduce the required launch acceleration.

===Weaponry===
Railguns are being researched as weapons with projectiles that do not contain explosives or propellants, but are given extremely high velocities: (approximately Mach 7 at sea level) or more. For comparison, the M16 rifle has a muzzle speed of , and the 16-inch/50-caliber Mark 7 gun that armed World War II American battleships has a muzzle speed of , which because of its much greater projectile mass (up to 2,700 pounds) generated a muzzle energy of 360 MJ and a downrange kinetic impact of energy of over 160 MJ (see also Project HARP). By firing smaller projectiles at extremely high velocities, railguns may yield kinetic energy impacts equal or superior to the destructive energy of 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 45 Naval guns, (which achieve up to 10MJ at the muzzle), but with greater range. This decreases ammunition size and weight, allowing more ammunition to be carried and eliminating the hazards of carrying explosives or propellants in a tank or naval weapons platform. Also, by firing more aerodynamically streamlined projectiles at greater velocities, railguns may achieve greater range, less time to target, and at shorter ranges less wind drift, bypassing the physical limitations of conventional firearms: &quot;the limits of gas expansion prohibit launching an unassisted projectile to velocities greater than about 1.5 km/s and ranges of more than from a practical conventional gun system.&quot;

Current railgun technologies necessitate a long and heavy barrel, but a railgun&#x27;s ballistics far outperform conventional cannons of equal barrel lengths. Railguns can also deliver area of effect damage by detonating a bursting charge in the projectile which unleashes a swarm of smaller projectiles over a large area.

Assuming that the many technical challenges facing fieldable railguns are overcome, including issues like railgun projectile guidance, rail endurance, and combat survivability and reliability of the electrical power supply, the increased launch velocities of railguns may provide advantages over more conventional guns for a variety of offensive and defensive scenarios. Railguns have limited potential to be used against both surface and airborne targets.

The first weaponized railgun planned for production, the General Atomics Blitzer system, began full system testing in September 2010. The weapon launches a streamlined discarding sabot round designed by Boeing&#x27;s Phantom Works at (approximately Mach 5) with accelerations exceeding 60,000 gn. During one of the tests, the projectile was able to travel an additional downrange after penetrating a thick steel plate. The company hopes to have an integrated demo of the system by 2016 followed by production by 2019, pending funding. Thus far, the project is self-funded.

In October 2013, General Atomics unveiled a land based version of the Blitzer railgun. A company official claimed the gun could be ready for production in &quot;two to three years&quot;.

Railguns are being examined for use as anti-aircraft weapons to intercept air threats, particularly anti-ship cruise missiles, in addition to land bombardment. A supersonic sea-skimming anti-ship missile can appear over the horizon 20 miles from a warship, leaving a very short reaction time for a ship to intercept it. Even if conventional defense systems react fast enough, they are expensive and only a limited number of large interceptors can be carried. A railgun projectile can reach several times the speed of sound faster than a missile; because of this, it can hit a target, such as a cruise missile, much faster and farther away from the ship. Projectiles are also typically much cheaper and smaller, allowing for many more to be carried (they have no guidance systems, and rely on the railgun to supply their kinetic energy, rather than providing it themselves). The speed, cost, and numerical advantages of railgun systems may allow them to replace several different systems in the current layered defense approach. A railgun projectile without the ability to change course can hit fast-moving missiles at a maximum range of . As is the case with the Phalanx CIWS, unguided railgun rounds will require multiple/many shots to bring down maneuvering supersonic anti-ship missiles, with the odds of hitting the missile improving dramatically the closer it gets. The Navy plans for railguns to be able to intercept endoatmospheric ballistic missiles, stealthy air threats, supersonic missiles, and swarming surface threats; a prototype system for supporting interception tasks is to be ready by 2018, and operational by 2025. This timeframe suggests the weapons are planned to be installed on the Navy&#x27;s next-generation surface combatants, expected to start construction by 2028.

BAE Systems was at one point interested in installing railguns on their Future Fighting Vehicle.

India has successfully tested their own railgun. Russia, China, Turkey&#x27;s ASELSAN and Yeteknoloji are also developing railguns.

Germany, France and Japan will jointly develop a railgun weapon.

=== Helical railgun ===

Helical railguns are multi-turn railguns that reduce rail and brush current by a factor equal to the number of turns. Two rails are surrounded by a helical barrel and the projectile or re-usable carrier is also helical. The projectile is energized continuously by two brushes sliding along the rails, and two or more additional brushes on the projectile serve to energize and commute several windings of the helical barrel direction in front of and/or behind the projectile. The helical railgun is a cross between a railgun and a coilgun. They do not currently exist in a practical, usable form.

A helical railgun was built at MIT in 1980 and was powered by several banks of, for the time, large capacitors (approximately 4 farads). It was about 3 meters long, consisting of 2 meters of accelerating coil and 1 meter of decelerating coil. It was able to launch a glider or projectile about 500 meters.

=== Plasma railgun ===
A plasma railgun is a linear accelerator and a plasma energy weapon which, like a projectile railgun, uses two long parallel electrodes to accelerate a &quot;sliding short&quot; armature. However, in a plasma railgun, the armature and ejected projectile consists of plasma, or hot, ionized, gas-like particles, instead of a solid slug of material. MARAUDER (&quot;Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed Energy and Radiation&quot;) is, or was, a United States Air Force Research Laboratory project concerning the development of a coaxial plasma railgun. It is one of several United States Government efforts to develop plasma-based projectiles. The first computer simulations occurred in 1990, and its first published experiment appeared on 1 August 1993. As of 1993 the project appeared to be in the early experimental stages. The weapon was able to produce doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning that exploded with devastating effects when hitting their target. The project&#x27;s initial success led to it becoming classified, and only a few references to MARAUDER appeared after 1993.

==Tests==

Full-scale models have been built and fired, including a bore, 9 megajoule kinetic energy gun developed by the US DARPA. Rail and insulator wear problems still need to be solved before railguns can start to replace conventional weapons. Probably the oldest consistently successful system was built by the UK&#x27;s Defence Research Agency at Dundrennan Range in Kirkcudbright, Scotland. This system was established in 1993 and has been operated for over 10 years. 

China is now one of the major players in electromagnetic launchers; in 2012 it hosted the 16th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology (EML 2012) at Beijing. Satellite imagery in late 2010 suggested that tests were being conducted at an armor and artillery range near Baotou, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

===United States Armed Forces===
The United States military have expressed interest in pursuing research in electric gun technology throughout the late 20th century, since electromagnetic guns do not require propellants to fire a shot as conventional gun systems do, significantly increasing crew safety and reducing logistics costs, as well as provide a greater range. In addition, railgun systems have shown to potentially provide higher velocity of projectiles, which would increase accuracy for anti-tank, artillery, and air defense by decreasing the time it takes for the projectile to reach its target destination. During the early 1990s, the U.S. Army dedicated more than $150 million into electric gun research. At the University of Texas at Austin Center for Electromechanics, military railguns capable of delivering tungsten armor-piercing bullets with kinetic energies of nine megajoules (9 MJ) have been developed. Nine megajoules is enough energy to deliver of projectile at —at that velocity, a sufficiently long rod of tungsten or another dense metal could easily penetrate a tank, and potentially pass through it, (see APFSDS).

====Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division====
The United States Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division demonstrated an 8 MJ railgun firing projectiles in October 2006 as a prototype of a 64 MJ weapon to be deployed aboard Navy warships. The main problem the U.S. Navy has had with implementing a railgun cannon system is that the guns wear out because of the immense pressures, stresses and heat that are generated by the millions of amperes of current necessary to fire projectiles with megajoules of energy. While not nearly as powerful as a cruise missile like a BGM-109 Tomahawk, that will deliver 3,000 MJ of energy to a target, such weapons would, in theory, allow the Navy to deliver more granular firepower at a fraction of the cost of a missile, and will be much harder to shoot down versus future defensive systems. For context, another relevant comparison is the Rheinmetall 120mm gun used on main battle tanks, which generates 9 MJ of muzzle energy.

In 2007, BAE Systems delivered a 32 MJ prototype (muzzle energy) to the U.S. Navy. The same amount of energy is released by the detonation of of C4.

On 31 January 2008, the U.S. Navy tested a railgun that fired a projectile at 10.64 MJ with a muzzle velocity of . The power was provided by a new 9-megajoule prototype capacitor bank using solid-state switches and high-energy-density capacitors delivered in 2007 and an older 32-MJ pulse power system from the US Army&#x27;s Green Farm Electric Gun Research and Development Facility developed in the late 1980s that was previously refurbished by General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (EMS) Division. It is expected to be ready between 2020 and 2025.

A test of a railgun took place on 10 December 2010, by the U.S. Navy at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division. During the test, the Office of Naval Research set a world record by conducting a 33 MJ shot from the railgun, which was built by BAE Systems.

Another test took place in February 2012, at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division. While similar in energy to the aforementioned test, the railgun used was considerably more compact, with a more conventional looking barrel. A General Atomics-built prototype was delivered for testing in October 2012.
In 2014, the U.S. Navy had plans to integrate a railgun that has a range of over onto a ship by 2016. This weapon, while having a form factor more typical of a naval gun, was to utilize components largely in common with those developed and demonstrated at Dahlgren. The hyper-velocity rounds weigh , are , and are fired at Mach 7.

A future goal was to develop projectiles that were self-guided – a necessary requirement to hit distant targets or intercept missiles. When the guided rounds are developed, the Navy is projecting each round to cost about $25,000, though developing guided projectiles for guns has a history of doubling or tripling initial cost estimates. Some high velocity projectiles developed by the Navy have command guidance, but the accuracy of the command guidance is not known, nor even if it can survive a full power shot.

In 2014, the only U.S. Navy ships that could produce enough electrical power to get the desired performance were the three s (DDG-1000 series); they can generate 78 megawatts of power, more than is necessary to power a railgun. However, the Zumwalt has been canceled and no further units will be built. Engineers are working to derive technologies developed for the DDG-1000 series ships into a battery system so other warships can operate a railgun. As of 2014 most destroyers can spare only nine megawatts of additional electricity, while it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range (i.e., to launch 32MJ projectiles at a rate of 10 shots per minute). Even if ships, such as the , can be upgraded with enough electrical power to operate a railgun, the space taken up on the ships by the integration of an additional weapon system may force the removal of existing weapon systems to make room available. The first shipboard tests was to be from a railgun installed on an (EPF), but this was later changed to land based testing.

Though the 23 lb projectiles have no explosives, their Mach 7 velocity gives them 32 megajoules of energy, but impact kinetic energy downrange will typically be 50 percent or less of the muzzle energy. The Navy looked into other uses for railguns, besides land bombardment, such as air defense; with the right targeting systems, projectiles could intercept aircraft, cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. The Navy is also developing directed-energy weapons for air defense use, but it will be years or decades before they will be effective.

The railgun would be part of a Navy fleet that envisions future offensive and defensive capabilities being provided in layers: lasers to provide close range defense, railguns to provide medium range attack and defense, and cruise missiles to provide long-range attack; though railguns will cover targets up to 100 miles away that previously needed a missile. The Navy may eventually enhance railgun technology to enable it to fire at a range of and impact with 64 megajoules of energy. One shot would require 6 million amps of current, so it will take a long time to develop capacitors that can generate enough energy and strong enough gun materials.

The most promising near-term application for weapons-rated railguns and electromagnetic guns, in general, is probably aboard naval ships with sufficient spare electrical generating capacity and battery storage space. In exchange, ship survivability may be enhanced through a comparable reduction in the quantities of potentially dangerous chemical propellants and explosives employed. Ground combat forces, however, may find that co-locating an additional electrical power supply on the battlefield for every gun system may not be as weight and space efficient, survivable, or convenient a source of immediate projectile-launching energy as conventional propellants, which are manufactured safely behind the lines and delivered to the weapon, pre-packaged, through a robust and dispersed logistics system.

In July 2017, Defensetech reported that the Navy wished to push the Office of Naval Research&#x27;s prototype railgun from a science experiment into useful weapon territory. The goal, according to Tom Beutner, head of Naval Air Warfare and Weapons for the ONR, was ten shots per minute at 32 megajoules. A 32 megajoule railgun shot is equivalent to about 23,600,000 foot-pounds, so a single 32 MJ shot has the same muzzle energy as about 200,000 .22 rounds being fired simultaneously. In more conventional power units, a 32 MJ shot every 6 s is a net power of 5.3 MW (or 5300 kW). If the railgun is assumed to be 20% efficient at turning electrical energy into kinetic energy, the ship&#x27;s electrical supplies will need to provide about 25 MW for as long as firing continues.

, the Navy had spent $500m on rail gun development over 17 years. The Navy was focusing on firing hypersonic projectiles from existing conventional guns already available in numbers. On 1 June 2021, &quot;The Drive&quot; reported that the US navy&#x27;s proposed 2022 fiscal year budget had no funding for railgun research and development. Technical challenges could not be overcome, such as the massive forces of firing wearing out the barrel after only one or two dozen shots, and a rate of fire too low to be useful for missile defense. Priorities had also changed since railgun development started, with the Navy putting more focus on longer range hypersonic missiles compared to comparatively shorter range railgun projectiles.

==== Army Research Laboratory ====
Research on railgun technology served as a major area of focus at the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) throughout the 1980s. In addition to analyzing the performance and electrodynamic and thermodynamic properties of railguns at other institutions (like Maxwell Laboratories&#x27; CHECMATE railgun), BRL procured their own railguns for study such as their one-meter railgun and their four-meter rail gun. In 1984, BRL researchers devised a technique to analyze the residue left behind on the bore surface after a shot was fired in order to investigate the cause of the bore&#x27;s progressive degradation. In 1991, they determined the properties required for developing an effective launch package as well as the design criteria necessary for a railgun to incorporate finned, long rod projectiles.

Research into railguns continued after the Ballistic Research Laboratory was consolidated with six other independent Army laboratories to form the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in 1992. One of the major projects in railgun research that ARL was involved in was the Cannon-Caliber Electromagnetic Gun (CCEMG) program, which took place at the Center for Electromechanics at the University of Texas (UT-CEM) and was sponsored by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center. As part of the CCEMG program, UT-CEM designed and developed the Cannon-Caliber Electromagnetic Launcher, a rapid-fire railgun launcher, in 1995. Featuring a 30-mm roundbore, the launcher was capable of firing three, five-round salvos of 185-g launch packages at a muzzle velocity of 1850 m/s and a firing rate of 5 Hz. Rapid-fire operation was achieved by driving the launcher with multiple 83544 peak pulses provided by the CCEMG compulsator. The CCEMG railgun included several features: ceramic sidewalls, directional preloading, and liquid cooling. ARL was responsible for assessing the performance of the launcher, which was tested at the ARL Transonic Experimental Facility in Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory also monitored electromagnetic and electrothermal gun technology development at the Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) at the University of Texas at Austin, one of five university and industry laboratories that ARL federated to procure technical support. It housed the two electromagnetic launchers, the Leander OAT and the AugOAT, as well as the Medium Caliber Launcher. The facility also provided a power system that included thirteen 1- MJ capacitor banks, an assortment of electromagnetic launcher devices and diagnostic apparatuses. The focus of the research activity was on designs, interactions and materials required for electromagnetic launchers.

In 1999, a collaboration between ARL and IAT led to the development of a radiometric method of measuring the temperature distribution of railgun armatures during a pulsed electrical discharge without disturbing the magnetic field. In 2001, ARL became the first to obtain a set of accuracy data on electromagnetic gun-launched projectiles using jump tests. In 2004, ARL researchers published papers examining the interaction of high temperature plasmas for the purpose of developing efficient railgun igniters. Early papers describe the plasma-propellant interaction group at ARL and their attempts to understand and distinguish between the chemical, thermal, and radiation effect of plasmas on conventional solid propellants. Using scanning electron microscopy and other diagnostic techniques, they evaluated in detail the influence of plasmas on specific propellant materials.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
China is developing its own railgun system. According to a CNBC report from U.S. intelligence, China&#x27;s railgun system was first revealed in 2011, and ground testing began in 2014. Between 2015 and 2017, the weapon system gained the ability to strike over extended ranges with increased lethality. The weapon system was successfully mounted on a Chinese Navy ship in December 2017, with sea trials happening later.

In early February 2018, pictures of what is claimed to be a Chinese railgun were published online. In the pictures the gun is mounted on the bow of a Type 072III-class landing ship &quot;Haiyangshan&quot;. Media suggests that the system is or soon will be ready for testing. In March 2018, it was reported that China confirmed it had begun testing its electromagnetic rail gun at sea.

=== India ===
In November 2017, India&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Organisation carried out a successful test of a 12 mm square bore electromagnetic railgun. Tests of a 30 mm version are planned to be conducted. India aims to fire a one kilogram projectile at a velocity of more than 2,000 m/s using a capacitor bank of 10 megajoules. Electromagnetic guns and directed energy weapons are among the systems which Indian Navy aims to acquire in its modernisation plan up to 2030.

=== Japan ===

The Japanese Ministry of Defense started its survey on railgun-related technology domestically and internationally by 2015, while conducting basic research using a small caliber railgun with a 16mm bore.

By 2016, the government of Japan had concluded that technological cooperation with the U.S. was necessary for deployment of railguns, and such cooperation would require technological know-how on the Japanese side. Therefore, full-scale development began in that year. From FY2016 to FY2022, research on electromagnetic acceleration systems was conducted and the target was set to increase the projectile&#x27;s initial velocity and improve the rail&#x27;s durability on a single-shot-type 40mm caliber railgun. Test results published later showed that the railgun had a stable initial velocity of over 2000 m/s during 120 rounds of repeated fire, which was the target velocity. The railgun also had presented no significant damage on the rail near the starting position of the projectile, whereas previous studies have shown significant erosion, confirming the reduction in rail damage. The test utilized a single 20-ft cargo container that served as a charger and a 5 MJ-capacity capacitor consisting of three 20-ft cargo containers to fire two types of projectiles (total length about 160 mm, mass about 320 g): a separated projectile (分離弾), which would be similar to actual use and has armor piercing in mind, and an integrated projectile (一体弾), which was simplifed from the separated projectile to reduce cost. The gun is about 6 meters long and has the mass of 8 tons.

In the Preliminary Project Evaluation for fiscal year 2021, published by the MoD in September 2, 2022, it was announced that it will conduct research on railguns from FY2022 to FY2026. The research is aimed at &quot;future railguns capable of firing hypersonic projectiles with a high fire rate to counter threats such as hypersonic missiles&quot;. Specifically, research on mechanism for continuous fires, flight stability outside the barrel, fire control and damage of the railgun had been mentioned as points of interests.

On October 17, 2023, the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency (ALTA) announced on its official X account that they had &quot;accomplished ship-board firing test of railgun first time in the world&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;) with video footage of a railgun firing rounds into the ocean from a vessel. The JMSDF&#x27;s Self Defense Fleet had later hinted in a press release the involvement of the &quot;JS Asuka&quot; in the ship-board firing test.

==Issues==

===Major difficulties===

Major technological and operational hurdles must be overcome before railguns can be deployed:

# Railgun durability: To date, public railgun demonstrations have not shown an ability to fire multiple full power shots from the same set of rails. However, the United States Navy has claimed hundreds of shots from the same set of rails. In a March 2014 statement to the Intelligence, Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, Chief of Naval Research Admiral Matthew Klunder stated, &quot;Barrel life has increased from tens of shots to over 400, with a program path to achieve 1000 shots.&quot; However, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) will not confirm that the 400 shots are full-power shots. Further, there is nothing published to indicate there are any high megajoule-class railguns with the capability of firing hundreds of full-power shots while staying within the strict operational parameters necessary to fire railgun shots accurately and safely. Railguns should be able to fire 6 rounds per minute with a rail life of about 3000 rounds, tolerating launch accelerations of tens of thousands of g&#x27;s, extreme pressures and megaampere currents, but this is not feasible with current technology.
# Projectile guidance: A future capability critical to fielding a real railgun weapon is developing a robust guidance package that will allow the railgun to fire at distant targets or to hit incoming missiles. Developing such a package is a significant challenge. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s RFP Navy SBIR 2012.1 – Topic N121-102 for developing such a package gives a good overview of just how challenging railgun projectile guidance is:

:The package must fit within the mass (&lt; 2 kg), diameter (&lt; 40 mm outer diameter), and volume (200 cm3) constraints of the projectile and do so without altering the center of gravity. It should also be able to survive accelerations of at least 20,000 g (threshold) / 40,000 g (objective) in all axes, high electromagnetic fields (E &gt; 5,000 V/m, B &gt; 2 T), and surface temperatures of &gt; 800 deg C. The package should be able to operate in the presence of any plasma that may form in the bore or at the muzzle exit and must also be radiation hardened owing to exo-atmospheric flight. Total power consumption must be less than 8 watts (threshold)/5 watts (objective) and the battery life must be at least 5 minutes (from initial launch) to enable operation during the entire engagement. In order to be affordable, the production cost per projectile must be as low as possible, with a goal of less than $1,000 per unit.

On 22 June 2015, General Atomics&#x27; Electromagnetic Systems announced that projectiles with on-board electronics survived the whole railgun launch environment and performed their intended functions in four consecutive tests on 9 and 10 June at the U.S. Army&#x27;s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The on-board electronics successfully measured in-bore accelerations and projectile dynamics, for several kilometers downrange, with the integral data link continuing to operate after the projectiles impacted the desert floor, which is essential for precision guidance.

<text>Walpurgis Night (), an abbreviation of Saint Walpurgis Night (from the German ), also known as Saint Walpurga&#x27;s Eve (alternatively spelled Saint Walburga&#x27;s Eve) and Walpurgisnacht, is the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga, an 8th-century abbess in Francia, and is celebrated on the night of 30 April and the day of 1 May. This feast commemorates the canonization of Saint Walpurga and the movement of her relics to Eichstätt, both of which occurred on 1 May 870.

Saint Walpurga was hailed by the Christians of Germany for battling &quot;pest, rabies, and whooping cough, as well as against witchcraft&quot;. Christians prayed to God through the intercession of Saint Walpurga in order to protect themselves from witchcraft, as Saint Walpurga was successful in converting the local populace to Christianity. In parts of Europe, people continue to light bonfires on Saint Walpurga&#x27;s Eve in order to ward off evil spirits and witches. Others have historically made Christian pilgrimages to Saint Walpurga&#x27;s tomb in Eichstätt on the Feast of Saint Walpurga, often obtaining vials of Saint Walpurga&#x27;s oil.

It is suggested that Walpurgis Night is linked with older May Day festivals in northern Europe, which also involved lighting bonfires at night, for example the Gaelic festival Beltane.

Local variants of Walpurgis Night are observed throughout Northern and Central Europe in the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, and Estonia. In Finland, Denmark and Norway, the tradition with bonfires to ward off the witches is observed as Saint John&#x27;s Eve, which commemorates the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist.

==Name==
The date of Saint Walpurga&#x27;s canonization came to be known as (&quot;Saint Walpurga&#x27;s night&quot;) in German. The name of the holiday is often shortened to (German), (&quot;Valborg&#x27;s Mass Eve&quot;, Swedish), (Finland Swedish), (Finnish), (Estonian), (Lithuanian), or (Latvian), and or (Czech). In English, it is known as Saint Walpurga&#x27;s Night, Saint Walburga&#x27;s Night, Walpurgis Night, Saint Walpurga&#x27;s Eve, Saint Walburga&#x27;s Eve, the Feast of Saint Walpurga or the Feast of Saint Walburga. The Germanic term is recorded in 1668 by Johannes Praetorius as or . An earlier mention of and is in the 1603 edition of the of Johann Coler, who also refers to the following day, 1 May, as , feast day of the apostles James the Less and Philip in the Western Christian calendar of saints.

== History ==


The festival of Walpurgis Night is named after the English Christian missionary Saint Walpurga ( 710 – 777/9). The daughter of Saint Richard the Pilgrim and sister of Saint Willibald, Saint Walpurga (also known as Saint Walpurgis or Walburga) was born in Devon, England, in AD 710. Born into a prominent Anglo-Saxon family, Saint Walpurga studied medicine and became a Christian missionary to Germany, where she founded a double monastery in Heidenheim. As such, Christian artwork often depicts her holding bandages in her hand. As a result of Saint Walpurga&#x27;s evangelism in Germany, the people there converted to Christianity from heathenism. In addition, &quot;the monastery became an education center and &#x27;soon became famous as a center of culture. Saint Walpurga was also known to repel the effects of witchcraft. Saint Walpurga died on 25 February 777 (some sources say 778 or 779) and her tomb, to this day, produces holy oil (known as Saint Walburga&#x27;s oil), which is said to heal sickness; Benedictine nuns distribute this oil in vials to Christian pilgrims who visit Saint Walpurga&#x27;s tomb.

The canonization of Walpurga and the movement of her relics to Eichstätt occurred on 1 May in the year 870, thus leading to the Feast of Saint Walpurga and its eve, Walpurgis Night, being popularly observed on this date. She quickly became one of the most popular saints in England, Germany, and France. When the bishop had Saint Walpurga&#x27;s relics moved to Eichstätt, &quot;miraculous cures were reported as her remains traveled along the route&quot;. Miracle cures were later reported from ailing people who anointed themselves with a fluid known as Walburga&#x27;s oil that drained from the rock at her shrine at Eichstatt.

The date of Walpurgis Night coincided with an older May Eve festival, celebrated in much of northern Europe with the lighting of bonfires at night. A variety of festivals of pre-Christian origin had been celebrated at this time (halfway between the spring equinox and summer solstice) to mark the beginning of summer, including Beltane in Ireland and Britain. Folklorist Jack Santino says &quot;Her day and its traditions almost certainly are traceable to pre-Christian celebrations that took place at this time, on the first of May&quot;. Art historian Pamela Berger noted Walpurga&#x27;s association with sheaves of grain, and suggested that her cult was adapted from pagan agrarian goddesses.

In modern times, many Christians continue to make religious pilgrimages to Saint Walburga&#x27;s tomb in Eichstätt on Saint Walburga&#x27;s Day; in the 19th century, the number of pilgrims travelling to the Church of St. Walpurgis was described as &quot;many thousand&quot;. Due to 1 May being the date of Saint Walpurga&#x27;s feast, it has become associated with other May Day celebrations and regional traditions, especially in Finland and Sweden. Given that the intercession of Saint Walpurga was believed to be efficacious against evil magic, medieval and Renaissance tradition held that, during Walpurgis Night, witches celebrated a sabbath and evil powers were at their strongest. In German folklore, Walpurgis Night was believed to be the night of a witches&#x27; meeting on the Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz mountains, a range of wooded hills in central Germany. To ward off evil and protect themselves and their livestock, people would traditionally light fires on the hillsides, a tradition that continues in some regions today. In Bavaria, the feast day is sometimes called (), literally &quot;Witches&#x27; Night&quot;, on which revelers dress as witches and demons, set off fireworks, dance and play loud music, which is said to drive the witches and winter spirits away.

== Regional variations ==
=== Czech Republic ===

30 April is (&#x27;Burning of the witches&#x27;) or (&#x27;The witches&#x27;) in the Czech Republic. Huge bonfires up to tall with a witch figure are built and burnt in the evening, preferably on top of hills. Young people gather around. Sudden black and dense smoke formations are cheered as &quot;a witch flying away&quot;. An effigy of a witch is held up and thrown into a bonfire to burn.

In some places, it is customary to burn a puppet representing a witch on the bonfire. It is still a widespread feast in the Czech Republic, practiced since the pagan times.

As evening advances to midnight and fire is on the wane, it is time to go search for a cherry tree in blossom. This is another feast, connected with 1 May. Young women should be kissed past midnight (and during the following day) under a blossoming cherry (or if unavailable, another blossoming) tree, as they &quot;will not dry up&quot; for an entire year. The First of May is celebrated then as &quot;the day of those in love&quot;, in reference to the famous incipit of the poem &quot;Máj&quot; by Karel Hynek Mácha (; &quot;Late evening, on the first of May— / The twilit May—the time of love&quot;, translation by Edith Pargeter).

===England===
In Lincolnshire, Walpurgis Night was observed in rural communities until the second half of the 20th century, with a tradition of hanging cowslips to ward off evil.

=== Estonia ===

In Estonia, is celebrated throughout the night of 30 April and into the early hours of 1 May, where 1 May is a public holiday called &quot;Spring Day&quot; (). is an important and widespread celebration of the arrival of spring in the country. Influenced by German culture, the night originally stood for the gathering and meeting of witches. Modern people still dress up as witches to wander the streets in a carnival-like mood.

The celebrations are especially vigorous in Tartu, the university town in southern Estonia. For Estonian students in student corporations (Estonian fraternities and sororities), the night starts with a traditional procession through the streets of Tartu (during which the governing of the city is symbolically handed over to the students for the night by the mayor of Tartu), followed by visiting each other&#x27;s corporation houses throughout the night.

=== Finland ===


In Finland, Walpurgis night (; , &quot;valborg&quot;) is one of the four biggest holidays along with Christmas Eve, New Year&#x27;s Eve, and Midsummer (, ). Walpurgis witnesses the biggest carnival-style festival held in Finland&#x27;s cities and towns. The celebration, which begins on the evening of 30 April and continues on 1 May, typically centres on the consumption of sima, sparkling wine and other alcoholic beverages. Student traditions, particularly those of engineering students, are one of the main characteristics of . Since the end of the 19th century, this traditional upper-class feast has been appropriated by university students. Many high school alumni wear the black and white student cap and many higher education students wear student coveralls. One tradition is to drink sima, a home-made low-alcohol mead, along with freshly cooked tippaleipä.

In the capital, Helsinki, and its surrounding region, fixtures include the capping (on 30 April at 6 pm) of Havis Amanda, a nude female statue in Helsinki, and the biennially alternating publications of ribald matter called and , by engineering students of Aalto University. Both are sophomoric; but while is a standard magazine, is always a gimmick. Classic forms have included an printed on toilet paper and on a bedsheet. Often, has been stuffed inside standard industrial packages, such as sardine cans and milk cartons. For most university students, starts a week before the day of celebration. The festivities also include a picnic on 1 May, which is sometimes more lavish, particularly in Ullanlinnanmäki in central Helsinki.

In Turku, it has become a tradition to cap the Posankka statue.

 coincides with the socialist International Workers&#x27; Day parade. Expanding from the parties of the left, the whole of the Finnish political scene has adopted as the day to go out on stumps and agitate. This is not limited only to political activists; many institutions, such as the Lutheran Church of Finland, have followed suit, marching and making speeches. Left-wing activists of the 1970s still party on May Day. Carnivals are arranged, and many radio stations play leftist songs, such as The Internationale.

Traditionally, 1 May is celebrated by the way of a picnic in a park. For most, the picnic is enjoyed with friends on a blanket with food and sparkling wine. Some people arrange extremely lavish picnics with pavilions, white tablecloths, silver candelabras, classical music, and extravagant food. The picnic usually starts early in the morning, where some of the previous night&#x27;s party-goers continue their celebrations from the previous night.

Some student organisations reserve areas where they traditionally camp every year. Student caps, mead, streamers and balloons have their role in the picnic and the celebration as a whole.

=== Germany ===

On the Feast of Saint Walburga, &quot;many thousand&quot; people have made Christian pilgrimages to Saint Walburga&#x27;s tomb in Eichstätt on the Feast of Saint Walburga, often obtaining vials of Saint Walburga&#x27;s oil.

In Germany, (&#x27;Witches&#x27; Night&#x27;), the night from 30 April to 1 May, is the night when witches are reputed to hold a large celebration on the Brocken and await the arrival of spring and is held on the same night as Saint Walpurgis Night ().

A scene in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust Part One&quot; is called &quot;,&quot; and one in &quot;Faust Part Two&quot; is called &quot;Classical .&quot; The last chapter of book five in Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; is also called &quot;.&quot; In Edward Albee&#x27;s 1962 play &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,&quot; Act Two is entitled &quot;.&quot;

From Bram Stoker&#x27;s short story, &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest&quot;, an Englishman (whose name is never mentioned) is on a visit to Munich before leaving for Transylvania. It is Walpurgis Night, and in spite of the hotelier&#x27;s warning not to be late coming back, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned &quot;unholy&quot; village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.

In some parts of northern coastal regions of Germany, the custom of lighting huge fires is still kept alive to celebrate the coming of May, while most parts of Germany have a derived Christianized custom around Easter called &quot;Easter fires&quot; ().

In rural parts of southern Germany, it is part of popular youth culture to play pranks such as tampering with neighbours&#x27; gardens, hiding possessions, or spraying graffiti on private property.

In Berlin, traditional leftist May Day riots usually start at Walpurgis Night in the Mauerpark in Prenzlauer Berg. There is a similar tradition in the &quot;Schanzenviertel&quot; district of Hamburg, though in both cases, the situation has significantly calmed down in the past few years.

=== Hungary ===
In Hungary elderberries decorated the houses, which were used to ward off witches this day, because the Hungarians believed that different plants can protect against various diseases or supernatural dangers. But most witchcraft traditions occurred earlier in the spring festival cycle, on St George&#x27;s Day (Szent György napja), because of the proximity of May Day and Pentecost.

In some places, these beliefs have not yet died out on Wilpurgis Night. In Késmárk the Hungarian population still knows about the fairy of the Thököly castle (Thököly vár), who sweeps the area around the Hungarian well at the dawn of Pentecost, and they still know about the witches who walk on May Day and Pentecost, but in most places, the source of evil was replaced by fire, ice, caterpillars and diseases as the country become more secular. 

=== Netherlands ===
As in all Germanic countries, was celebrated in areas of what is now the Netherlands. It has not been celebrated recently due to the national (Queen&#x27;s Day) falling on the same date, though the new (King&#x27;s Day) is on 27 April. The island of Texel celebrates a festival known as the &quot; (roughly translated as &#x27;May-Blaze&#x27;) on that same day, where bonfires are lit near nightfall, just as on Walpurgis, but with the meaning to drive away the remaining cold of winter and welcome spring. Occasional mentions to the ritual occur, and at least once a feminist called group co-opted the name to call for attention to the position of women (following the example of German women&#x27;s organizations), a variety of the Take Back the Night phenomenon.

Still, in recent years a renewed interest in pre-Christian religion and culture has led to renewed interest in (Witch&#x27;s Night) as well. In 1999, suspicions were raised among local Reformed party members in Putten, Gelderland of a Heksennacht festival celebrated by Satanists. The party called for a ban. That such a festival even existed, however, and that it was &#x27;Satanic&#x27; was rejected by most others. The local Church in Dokkum, Friesland, organized a Service in 2003 to pray for the Holy Spirit to, according to the church, counter the Satanic action.

=== Sweden ===

While the name &quot;Walpurgis&quot; is taken from the 8th-century British Dumnonian Christian missionary Saint Walburga, , as it is called in Swedish, also marks the arrival of spring. The forms of celebration vary in different parts of the country and between different cities. Walpurgis celebrations are not a family occasion but rather a public event, and local groups often take responsibility for organising them to encourage community spirit in the village or neighbourhood. Celebrations normally include lighting the bonfire, choral singing and a speech to honour the arrival of the spring season, often held by a local celebrity.
In the Middle Ages, the administrative year ended on 30 April. Accordingly, this was a day of festivity among the merchants and craftsmen of the town, with trick-or-treat, dancing and singing in preparation for the forthcoming celebration of spring. Sir James George Frazer in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; writes, &quot;The first of May is a great popular festival in the more midland and southern parts of Sweden. On the eve of the festival, huge bonfires, which should be lighted by striking two flints together, blaze on all the hills and knolls.&quot;

Walpurgis bonfires are part of a Swedish tradition dating back to at least the early 18th century. At Walpurgis (), farm animals were let out to graze and bonfires (, ) lit to scare away predators. In Southern Sweden, an older tradition, no longer practiced, was for the younger people to collect greenery and branches from the woods at twilight. These were used to adorn the houses of the village. The expected reward for this task was to be paid in eggs.
Choral singing is a popular pastime in Sweden, and on Walpurgis Eve virtually every choir in the country is busy. Singing traditional songs of spring is widespread throughout the country. The songs are mostly from the 19th century and were spread by students&#x27; spring festivities. The strongest and most traditional spring festivities are also found in the old university cities, such as Uppsala and Lund, where undergraduates, graduates, and alumni gather at events that last most of the day from early morning to late night on 30 April, or (&quot;The Last Day of April&quot;) as it is called in Lund, or as it is called in Uppsala. For students, Walpurgis Eve heralds freedom. Traditionally the exams were over and only the odd lecture remained before term ends. On the last day of April, the students don their characteristic white caps and sing songs of welcome to spring, to the budding greenery and to a brighter future.

More modern &quot;valborg&quot; celebrations, particularly among Uppsala students, often consist of enjoying a breakfast including champagne and strawberries. During the day, people gather in parks, drink considerable amounts of alcoholic beverages, barbecue, and generally enjoy the weather, if it happens to be favorable.

In Uppsala, since 1975, students honor spring by rafting on Fyris river through the center of town with rickety, homemade, in fact quite easily wreckable, and often humorously decorated rafts.
Several nations also hold &quot;Champagne Races&quot; (), where students go to drink and spray champagne or sparkling wine on each other. The walls and floors of the old nation buildings are covered in plastic for this occasion, as the champagne is poured around recklessly and sometimes spilled enough to wade in. Spraying champagne is, however, a fairly recent addition to the Champagne Race. The name derives from the students running down the slope from the Carolina Rediviva library to drink champagne, toward the student nations.

In Linköping many students and former students begin the day at the park Trädgårdsföreningen, in the field below Belvederen where the city laws permit alcohol, to drink champagne breakfast in a similar way to Uppsala. Later, at three o&#x27;clock, the students and public gather at the courtyard of Linköping Castle. Spring songs are sung by the Linköping University Male Voice Choir, and speeches are made by representatives of the students and the university professors.

In Gothenburg, the carnival parade, The Cortège, which has been held since 1909 by the students at Chalmers University of Technology, is an important part of the celebration. It is seen by around 250,000 people each year. Another major event is the gathering of students in Garden Society of Gothenburg to listen to student choirs, orchestras, and speeches. An important part of the gathering is the ceremonial donning of the student cap, which stems from the time when students wore their caps daily and switched from black winter cap to white summer cap.

In Umeå, there is an old tradition of having local bonfires. During recent years, however, there has also been a tradition of celebrating Walpurgis at the Umeå University campus. The university organizes student choir singing, as well as other types of entertainment and a speech by the president of the university. Different stalls sell hot dogs, candy, soft drinks, etc.

=== United States ===
The Church of Satan was founded on Sankt Walpurgisnacht in 1966. Founder Anton Szandor LaVey states in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; that besides one&#x27;s own birthday, Walpurgisnacht ranks as an important Satanic holiday, noting the Eve of May has been memorialized as &quot;symbolizing the fruition of the spring equinox&quot;, and chose the date well aware of the date&#x27;s traditional association with witchcraft.

Additionally, The Satanic Temple celebrates Hexennacht as &quot;a solemn holiday to honor those who were victimized by superstition&quot;.

==Cultural legacy in literature and music==
*The event was the inspiration for a poem, &quot;Die erste Walpurgisnacht,&quot; by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In turn, composer Felix Mendelssohn in 1831 took the poem and set it to music, as a secular cantata (or &quot;Sinfonie-Ballade&quot; in the composer&#x27;s correspondence) for soloists (alto, tenor, baritone, bass), chorus and orchestra.
*The novel by James Branch Cabell begins on &quot;Walburga&#x27;s Eve, when almost anything is rather more than likely to happen&quot;

<doc id="218937" wikidata="Q532024" url="?curid=218937" title="Angel of Death (Slayer song)">
<text>&quot;Angel of Death&quot; is the opening track on American thrash metal band Slayer&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. The lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. They detail the Nazi physician Josef Mengele&#x27;s human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.

&quot;Angel of Death&quot; led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing and racism against the band, which they vigorously denied but which followed them throughout their early career. Despite the controversy and the resulting delay in the release of &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, the song remained a live favorite, and has appeared on all of Slayer&#x27;s live albums.

The song has been described as highly influential in the development of thrash metal or speed metal, and is highly regarded by some critics; AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey called it a classic and the album &quot;the pinnacle of speed metal&quot;. The half-time riff was sampled by Public Enemy in their song &quot;She Watch Channel Zero?!&quot; from the 1988 album &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;.

==Composition and origins==

Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote &quot;Angel of Death&quot; after reading books about Nazi physician Josef Mengele while on tour with the band. He said that he remembered &quot;stopping someplace where I bought two books on Mengele. I thought, &#x27;This has gotta be some sick shit.&#x27; So when it came time to do the record, that stuff was still in my head—that&#x27;s where the lyrics to &#x27;Angel of Death&#x27; came from.&quot;

The lyrics are written both from Mengele&#x27;s point of view and from that of a detached observer condemning his actions. They detail Mengele&#x27;s surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Mengele&#x27;s explorations were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins, and included both physical and psychological examinations. Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in &quot;Angel of Death&quot; are experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia, transfusion of blood between twins, isolation endurance, gassing, injections with lethal germs, sex change operations, the removal of organs and limbs, and abacination.

==Controversy==
The lyrics of &quot;Angel of Death&quot; delayed the release of &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; which was originally scheduled for April 1986. The band was signed to Def Jam Records, whose distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to its subject matter and artwork, which they believed were &quot;too graphic&quot;. &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986, but it did not appear on Geffen Records&#x27; official release schedule because of the controversy.

&quot;Angel of Death&quot; caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well as their families and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. In 1987, Hanneman told the &quot;NME&quot; magazine:
People took Hanneman&#x27;s interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals (his most prized item being a German Knight&#x27;s Cross) as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating:
 According to guitarist Kerry King: &quot;Yeah, &#x27;Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists&#x27;—all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, &#x27;Read the lyrics and tell me what&#x27;s offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer&#x27;s preaching fucking World War II?&#x27; People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you&#x27;ll never talk them out of it.&quot;
The song drew accusations of racism, which the band has denied. The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews, and have stated numerous times that they do not condone racism and are merely interested in the subject.
Hanneman also wrote &quot;SS-3&quot;, a song about senior SS commander Reinhard Heydrich, which appeared on the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Divine Intervention&quot;. The song &quot;Jihad&quot; from their 2006 album &quot;Christ Illusion&quot; has drawn comparison to &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. &quot;Jihad&quot; deals with the September 11, 2001, attacks, and is told from a terrorist&#x27;s perspective. Araya expected the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, but it did not materialize—in part, he believes, due to people&#x27;s view that the song is &quot;just Slayer being Slayer&quot;.

==Music and structure==

At 4 minutes and 51 seconds, &quot;Angel of Death&quot; is the longest track on the album, which is 29 minutes in total. It is one of the most structurally conventional songs on the album, featuring prominent verses and choruses, which most of the songs eschew. Araya&#x27;s vocal performance begins with a piercing, wordless scream. &quot;[G]uitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs [and] drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded&quot; at 210 beats per minute.

When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992, they recruited a full-time replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph. Bostaph made one mistake out of the nine songs the band trialled him with, on &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Before the &quot;big double bass part&quot; there is a lead section, which Bostaph could not understand, as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo. Bostaph could not tell how many revolutions the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence. The band members told him there were eight, &quot;perfecting&quot; the song afterwards.

The song is also linguistically significant for containing the only recorded use of the word &quot;abacinate&quot;, as mentioned in Christopher Foyle&#x27;s &quot;Foyle&#x27;s Philavery: A Treasury of Unusual Words&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
Although &quot;Angel of Death&quot; did not chart, it was highly praised by critics reviewing &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. Clay Jarvas of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; observed how the song &quot;smokes the asses of any band playing fast and/or heavy today. Lyrically outlining the horrors to come, while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record: fast, lean and filthy.&quot; Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; remarked that &quot;There&#x27;s no better song to kick things off than the masterful &#x27;Angel of Death&#x27;, one of the most monumental songs in metal history.&quot;

The song was notably sampled for use as the main riff in the 1990 song &quot;Godlike&quot; by industrial act KMFDM.

The same riff has been sampled by many other artists including Public Enemy for their track &quot;She Watch Channel Zero&quot;.

&quot;Angel of Death&quot; was featured in the opening scene of the 2002 stunt comedy &quot;&quot;, where Johnny Knoxville rents and modifies a car before engaging in a crash-up derby.

<text>The Mausoleum of Theodoric () is an ancient monument just outside Ravenna, Italy. It was built in AD 520 by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, as his future tomb.

==Description==
The mausoleum&#x27;s current structure consists of two decagonal orders, one above the other made of Istrian stone, sourced from a quarry approximately away by land journey. The mausoleum&#x27;s roof consists of a single carved stone in diameter weighing 230 tonnes. A niche leads down to a room that was probably a chapel for funeral liturgies; an external stair leads to the upper floor. Located in the centre of the upper floor is a fragmentary ancient Roman porphyry tub, likely from a bath complex, in which Theodoric was buried. His remains were removed during Byzantine rule, when the mausoleum was turned into a Christian oratory. In the late 19th century, silting from a nearby rivulet that had partly submerged the mausoleum was drained and excavated.

==Recognition==
It was inscribed with seven other &quot;Early Christian Monuments and Mosaics of Ravenna&quot; buildings as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1996. According to the ICOMOS evaluation, &quot;the significance of the mausoleum lies in its Gothic style and decoration, which owe nothing to Roman or Byzantine art, although it makes use of the Roman stone construction technique of opus quadratum, which had been abandoned four centuries before&quot; and in the fact that &quot;it is the only surviving example of a tomb of a king of this period.&quot;

<doc id="218947" wikidata="Q353511" url="?curid=218947" title="Derek Jeter">
<text>Derek Sanderson Jeter ( ; born June 26, 1974), nicknamed &quot;the Captain&quot;, is an American former professional baseball shortstop, businessman, and baseball executive. As a player, Jeter spent his entire 20-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the New York Yankees. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2020; he received 396 of 397 possible votes, the second-highest percentage in MLB history (behind only teammate Mariano Rivera) and the highest by a position player. He was the chief executive officer (CEO) and part owner of the league&#x27;s Miami Marlins from September 2017 to February 2022.

A five-time World Series champion with the Yankees, Jeter is regarded as a central contributor to the franchise&#x27;s dynasty during the late 1990s and early 2000s for his hitting, base-running, fielding, and leadership. He is the Yankees&#x27; all-time career leader in hits (3,465), doubles (544), games played (2,747), stolen bases (358), times on base (4,716), plate appearances (12,602) and at bats (11,195). His accolades include 14 All-Star selections, five Gold Glove Awards, five Silver Slugger Awards, two Hank Aaron Awards, and a 2009 Roberto Clemente Award. Jeter was the 28th player to reach 3,000 hits and finished his career ranked sixth in MLB history in career hits and first among shortstops. In 2017, the Yankees retired his uniform number 2.

The Yankees drafted Jeter out of high school in 1992, and he debuted in the major leagues at age 20 in 1995. The following year, he became the Yankees&#x27; starting shortstop, won the Rookie of the Year Award, and helped the team win the 1996 World Series over the Atlanta Braves. Jeter continued to excel during the team&#x27;s championship seasons of 1998–2000; he finished third in voting for the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 1998, recorded multiple career-high numbers in 1999, and won both the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards in 2000. He consistently placed among the AL leaders in hits and runs scored for most of his career, and served as the Yankees&#x27; team captain from 2003 until his retirement in 2014. Throughout his career, Jeter contributed reliably to the Yankees&#x27; franchise successes. He holds many postseason records, and has a .321 batting average in the World Series. Jeter has earned the nicknames &quot;Captain Clutch&quot; and &quot;Mr. November&quot; due to his outstanding play in the postseason.

Internationally, Jeter represented the United States. Jeter was one of the earliest and greatest advocates for International Baseball competition, being the first player to support the creation of the World Baseball Classic. Speaking on the impact of Jeter&#x27;s support, current World Baseball Classic President said “To have someone like Derek Jeter vote yes on international baseball, vote yes to country vs country championships meant everything to us because it opened a door.&quot; Jeter competed in the 2006 and 2009 editions of the Classic, where he was named captain of the United States team for the latter edition.

Jeter is one of the most heavily marketed athletes of his generation and is involved in numerous product endorsements. As a celebrity, his personal life and relationships with other celebrities have drawn the attention of the media.

==Early life and education==

Derek Sanderson Jeter was born on June 26, 1974, in Pequannock Township, New Jersey, the son of accountant Dorothy (née Connors) and substance abuse counselor Sanderson Charles Jeter. His mother is of English, German, and Irish ancestry, while his father is African-American. They met while serving in the United States Army in Germany. His father played baseball at Fisk University in Tennessee as a shortstop, and holds a PhD. When Jeter was a child, his parents made him sign a contract every year that defined acceptable and unacceptable forms of behavior. Dorothy instilled a positive attitude in her son, insisting that he not use the word &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;. It was a baseball family, and Jeter&#x27;s younger sister Sharlee (born 1979) was a softball star in high school.

The Jeters lived in New Jersey until Derek was four, at which point they moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan. At age five, Jeter began playing little league baseball. The children lived with their parents during the school year and spent their summers with their grandparents in West Milford, New Jersey. Attending New York Yankees games with his grandparents, Jeter became a passionate fan of the team. Watching star outfielder Dave Winfield inspired him to pursue a career in baseball.

Jeter attended Kalamazoo Central High School, where he ran cross country in the fall, played basketball in the winter and baseball in the spring. Jeter posted high batting averages for the school&#x27;s baseball team; he batted .557 in his sophomore year and .508 as a junior. In his senior year, he batted .508 and compiled 23 runs batted in (RBIs), 21 walks, four home runs, a .637 on-base percentage (OBP), a .831 slugging percentage (SLG), 12 stolen bases (in 12 attempts), and only one strikeout.

Jeter received several honors after his senior season, including the Kalamazoo Area B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Award for Scholar Athlete, the 1992 High School Player of the Year Award from the American Baseball Coaches Association, the 1992 Gatorade High School Player of the year award, and &quot;USA Today&quot;″s High School Player of the Year. He also received an All-State honorable mention in basketball. Jeter earned a baseball scholarship to attend the University of Michigan and play college baseball for the Michigan Wolverines.

==Professional career==
===Draft===
The Houston Astros held the first overall pick in the 1992 MLB draft. Hall of Fame pitcher Hal Newhouser, who worked for the Astros as a scout, evaluated Jeter extensively and lobbied team management to select him. Fearing Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1 million to forgo college for a professional contract, they chose Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter&#x27;s potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.

The Yankees, who selected sixth, also rated Jeter highly. Yankees scout Dick Groch, assigned to scout in the Midwest, watched Jeter participate in an all-star camp held at Western Michigan University. Though Yankees officials were concerned that Jeter would attend college instead of signing a professional contract, Groch convinced them to select him, saying, &quot;the only place Derek Jeter&#x27;s going is to Cooperstown.&quot; The second through fifth picks were Paul Shuey, B. J. Wallace, Jeffrey Hammonds, and Chad Mottola; those five would combine for two All-Star Game appearances (Nevin and Hammonds). The Yankees drafted Jeter, who chose to turn pro, signing for $800,000.

===Minor leagues (1992–1995)===
Jeter played four seasons in Minor League Baseball, formally known as the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL). Jeter began the 1992 season with the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, based in Tampa, Florida. In his first professional game, Jeter failed to get a hit in seven at-bats, going 0-for-7, while striking out five times. Jeter continued to struggle during the rest of the season, batting .202 in 47 games. Manager Gary Denbo benched Jeter in the season&#x27;s final game to ensure his average would not drop below .200, known in baseball as the Mendoza Line. Homesick and frustrated by his lack of success, Jeter accrued $400-per-month phone bills from daily calls to his parents.

The Yankees promoted Jeter to the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) to give him more at-bats. He batted .247 in his first 11 games with Greensboro, and struggled defensively, making nine errors in 48 chances. Weighing , Jeter had a scrawny appearance that did not match his reputation as the Yankees&#x27; future leader. Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte, who played for the Hornets that season, at first questioned the hype surrounding Jeter, but recognized his talent and poise.

Jeter focused the next offseason on his fielding. &quot;Baseball America&quot; rated Jeter among the top 100 prospects in baseball before the 1993 season, ranking him 44th. Returning to the Hornets in 1993, his first full season of professional baseball, Jeter hit .295 with five home runs, 71 RBIs, and 18 stolen bases; SAL managers voted him the &quot;Most Outstanding Major League Prospect&quot; in the league. He finished second in the SAL in triples (11), third in hits (152), and 11th in batting average, and was named to the postseason All-Star team. Jeter committed 56 errors, a SAL record. Despite this, he was named the SAL&#x27;s Best Defensive Shortstop, Most Exciting Player, and Best Infield Arm by &quot;Baseball America&quot;.

Coming off his strong 1993 season, &quot;Baseball America&quot; rated Jeter as the 16th-best prospect in baseball. Jeter played for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL), the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League, and the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League during the 1994 season, combining to hit .344 with five home runs, 68 RBIs, and steal 50 bases across the three levels. He was honored with Minor League Player of the Year Awards by &quot;Baseball America&quot;, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and Topps/NAPBL. He was also named the most valuable player of the FSL.

Considered the fourth-best prospect in baseball by &quot;Baseball America&quot; heading into the 1995 season, Jeter was projected as the starting shortstop for the Yankees. However, he suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League after the conclusion of the 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees&#x27; general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and he did not cross the picket line.

===New York Yankees (1995–2014)===
====1995–1998====

Early in the 1995 season, Fernández and infielder Pat Kelly were injured. Consequently, Jeter made his MLB debut on May 29, 1995. He was assigned uniform number 2, which was most recently worn by Mike Gallego from 1992 to 1994. Batting ninth, he went hitless in five at bats, striking out once. The following day, he recorded his first two major league hits and scored his first two career runs. Jeter batted .234 and committed two errors in 13 games before being returned to Class AAA Columbus; Fernández replaced Jeter at shortstop. He finished the 1995 season with a .250 average without a home run in 15 games in the major leagues. The Yankees advanced to the postseason in 1995. Jeter traveled with the team during the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS), though he was not on the active roster. The Yankees lost to the Seattle Mariners.

After Fernández batted a disappointing .245 and appeared in only 108 games due to injuries in 1995, newly hired Yankees manager Joe Torre turned to Jeter for the 1996 season, hoping for a .250 batting average and dependable defense. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, often skeptical of younger players, was unconvinced. After Clyde King, a close Steinbrenner advisor, observed Jeter for two days in spring training in 1996, he came away with the impression that Jeter was not yet ready to contribute at the major league level. To provide depth to the team at the shortstop position after an injury to Fernández, Steinbrenner approved a trade that would have sent pitcher Mariano Rivera to the Mariners for shortstop Félix Fermín, but Michael, by then the vice president of scouting, and assistant general manager Brian Cashman convinced Steinbrenner to give Jeter an opportunity.
Rated the sixth-best prospect in baseball by &quot;Baseball America&quot; heading into the 1996 season, Jeter started on Opening Day, the first Yankee rookie to start as shortstop for the team since Tom Tresh in 1962. He hit his first MLB home run that day. With his speed and ability to execute the hit and run, Jeter served as a complement to leadoff hitter Tim Raines while batting in the ninth spot in the batting order. By year&#x27;s end, Jeter batted .314 with 10 home runs, 104 runs scored, and 78 RBIs. He was named the unanimous AL Rookie of the Year, receiving all 28 first-place votes in only the fifth sweep in the honor&#x27;s 50-year history.

The Yankees reached the 1996 postseason, and Torre batted Jeter in the leadoff spot based on his strong year-long performance. During Game 1 of the 1996 American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Yankees trailed the Baltimore Orioles 4–3 in the eighth inning when Jeter hit a fly ball to right field that was ruled a home run by the umpires after 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to catch the ball. Though the ball would have remained in play if not for Maier, and could have been caught by Tony Tarasco, the home run stood as called, tying the game. It marked the first home run of Jeter&#x27;s postseason career. The Yankees won the game and defeated the Orioles in five games. Overall, Jeter batted .361 in the 1996 postseason, helping to lead the Yankees offensively with Bernie Williams, as Wade Boggs, Paul O&#x27;Neill, and Tino Martinez struggled. The Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 World Series to win their first championship since the 1978 World Series.

Following his Rookie of the Year season, Jeter was considered to be among a &quot;new crop&quot; of MLB shortstops on the rise, along with Alex Rodriguez and Nomar Garciaparra, as the careers of older shortstops such as Cal Ripken Jr., Barry Larkin, Ozzie Smith, and Alan Trammell were concluding. Rodriguez, the first overall selection in the 1993 MLB draft, first contacted Jeter about his experiences as a high first-round pick. The two became friends to the extent that &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Jack Curry commented &quot;[r]arely have two higher-profile opponents been as close.&quot; Rodriguez described Jeter as being &quot;like my brother,&quot; even though they were on-field adversaries.

Before the 1997 season, Jeter and the Yankees agreed on a $540,000 contract with performance bonuses. Becoming the Yankees&#x27; leadoff batter, Jeter batted .291, with 10 home runs, 70 RBIs, 116 runs, and 190 hits. Though he hit two home runs during the 1997 American League Division Series, the Yankees lost to the Cleveland Indians, three games to two.

Jeter earned $750,000 for the 1998 season. That year, Jeter was selected for his first All-Star Game. In the regular season, he batted .324 with a league-leading 127 runs, 19 home runs, and 84 RBIs, for a team that won 114 games during the regular season and is widely considered to be one of the greatest of all time. In the playoffs, Jeter hit only .176 in the 1998 ALDS and ALCS, but batted .353 in the World Series, as the Yankees defeated the San Diego Padres in four games. At season&#x27;s end, Jeter finished third in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.

====1999–2002====

Eligible for salary arbitration for the first time before the 1999 season, Jeter was awarded a $5 million salary. Jeter led the AL in hits that season with 219, while finishing second in the league in batting average (.349) and runs scored (134), appearing in his second All-Star game that year. His season totals in batting average, runs, hits, runs batted in, doubles (37), triples (9), home runs (24), SLG (.552), and OBP (.438) are all personal bests. Jeter also drove in 102 runs. In the postseason, Jeter batted .455 in the ALDS, .350 in the ALCS, and .353 in the World Series, as the Yankees defeated the Braves to win another championship.

During the 1999–2000 offseason, the Yankees negotiated with Jeter, tentatively agreeing to a seven-year, $118.5 million contract. However, because Steinbrenner did not want to set a record for the largest contract, Steinbrenner waited while Juan González and the Detroit Tigers negotiated on a reported eight-year, $143 million contract extension. When that agreement fell through, so did Jeter&#x27;s tentative deal. To avoid arbitration, Jeter and the Yankees agreed to a one-year deal worth $10 million.
Jeter batted a team-best .339 in the 2000 regular season and added 15 home runs, 73 RBIs, 119 runs scored, and 22 stolen bases. In the 2000 MLB All-Star Game, he recorded three hits, including a two-run single that gave his team the lead and victory. The performance earned him the All-Star Game MVP Award, the first time a Yankee won the award. During the postseason, he batted only .211 in the ALDS against the Oakland Athletics, but rebounded to hit .318 in the Championship Series against the Seattle Mariners, and .409 in the World Series against the New York Mets. Jeter added two home runs, a triple, and two doubles in the World Series, including a leadoff home run on the first pitch of Game 4 and a triple later in the third inning. His home run in Game 5 tied the game and extended his World Series hitting streak to 14 games. The Yankees defeated the Mets in five games for their third consecutive title and fourth in Jeter&#x27;s first five full seasons. Jeter won the World Series MVP Award, becoming the first (and so far only) player to win the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards in the same season.

With one year remaining until he would become eligible for free agency, Jeter signed a ten-year, $189 million contract before the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees. Alex Rodriguez had signed a ten-year, $252 million contract with the Texas Rangers earlier in the offseason, setting the market for Jeter&#x27;s negotiations. Jeter became the second-highest-paid athlete across all team sports and auto racing, trailing only Rodriguez. The $18.9 million average annual value of Jeter&#x27;s contract was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2 million) and Manny Ramirez ($20 million).

In 2001, Jeter batted .311 with 21 home runs, 74 RBIs, 110 runs scored, and 27 stolen bases. He played in the 2001 MLB All-Star Game, hitting a home run off of Jon Leiber in his only at bat. Jeter made a defensive assist in Game 3 of the ALDS against the Athletics. With Jeremy Giambi on first base, Oakland right fielder Terrence Long hit a double off Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina into the right-field corner. As Giambi rounded third base and headed for home plate, Yankees right fielder Shane Spencer retrieved the ball and made a wild throw that missed cut-off man Tino Martinez and dribbled down the first-base line. Jeter ran from shortstop to grab the ball and flipped it backhanded to catcher Jorge Posada, rather than throwing it overhand. Posada tagged Giambi out on the leg just before he crossed home plate, preserving the Yankees&#x27; one-run lead. Facing elimination, the Yankees eventually won the game, as well as the series. The play, known as &quot;The Flip&quot;, was later voted seventh in &quot;Baseball Weekly&quot;″s 10 Most Amazing Plays of all time, and won the 2002 Best Play ESPY Award.
As a result of the September 11 attacks, the start of the playoffs was delayed and the season&#x27;s end was extended past the usual October timeframe. The Yankees advanced to the 2001 World Series to face the Arizona Diamondbacks. Game 4 marked the first time that any non-exhibition MLB game had been played in the month of November. In extra innings, Jeter hit a game-winning home run off of Byung-hyun Kim. The words &quot;Mr. November&quot; flashed on the scoreboard, alluding to former Yankee Reggie Jackson&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Mr. October&quot;. Despite the home run, Jeter slumped at the plate; he denied injuries were a factor, though a fall into a photographer&#x27;s box trying to catch a foul ball may have aggravated an earlier hamstring injury. Jeter batted .148 in the World Series, as the Yankees lost in seven games.

Jeter batted .297, with 18 home runs, 75 RBIs, 124 runs scored, 191 hits, and a career-best 32 stolen bases during the 2002 regular season. He led the majors in stolen base percentage (91.4%), getting caught only three times. He made his fifth All-Star appearance. In the 2002 postseason, the Anaheim Angels defeated the Yankees in the ALDS on their way to winning the World Series.

====2003–2008====
On Opening Day of the 2003 season, Jeter dislocated his left shoulder when he collided with Toronto Blue Jays catcher Ken Huckaby at third base. He was placed on the disabled list for six weeks and missed 36 games; he had never played fewer than 148 games in the prior seven full seasons. Jeter returned to bat .324, finishing third in batting average to Bill Mueller, who batted .326. Ramirez finished second.

Steinbrenner named Jeter the captain of the Yankees on June 3, 2003, following eight seasons without a captain after Don Mattingly retired in 1995. That postseason, Jeter batted .314 with two home runs, five RBIs, and 10 runs scored across 17 playoff games, including three hits in Game 3 of the 2003 World Series against the Florida Marlins – the only three hits Josh Beckett allowed during the game. Jeter committed a crucial error in a Game 6 loss, and the Marlins won the series in six games.
The Yankees acquired Rodriguez from the Texas Rangers during the 2003–04 offseason. Rodriguez had won two Gold Glove Awards at shortstop and was considered the best shortstop in baseball. Jeter—who had no Gold Gloves at the time—remained the team&#x27;s starting shortstop while Rodriguez moved to third base. Rodriguez&#x27;s fielding range allowed Jeter to cede ground to his right to Rodriguez and cheat to his left: fielding balls hit to his left is a weakness identified by scouts. The 2004 season began with Jeter mired in a slump, at one point getting only one hit in a span of 36 at-bats; through April, he batted .168. His batting average improved to .277 by the All-Star break in July.

Jeter made the All-Star team and finished the season with a .292 average; 23 home runs, the second-most of his career; 78 RBIs; 111 runs scored; and a career-best 44 doubles. He batted .316 with a team-leading four RBIs as the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins in the 2004 ALDS. Jeter struggled in the 2004 ALCS, batting .200 with one extra base hit, as the Yankees lost the series to the Red Sox in seven games, despite winning the first three games.

In the 12th inning of a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop fly down the left field line. Jeter ran from his position at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees went on to win the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted the Play of the Year in the &quot;This Year in Baseball Awards&quot; competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced sabermetric statistics, such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).

Jeter was second in the AL in runs scored (122) in the 2005 season, and was third in the league in both at bats (654) and hits (202). Though his critics continued to see Jeter as a liability defensively, he won his second consecutive Gold Glove in 2005. Orlando Cabrera of the Angels had a higher fielding percentage and committed fewer errors, but voters noted that Jeter had more assists. Though Jeter batted .333 during the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees lost to the Angels.

For the 2006 season, the Yankees signed Johnny Damon to play center field and lead off, moving Jeter to the second position in the batting lineup. During the 2006 season, Jeter recorded his 2,000th career hit, becoming the eighth Yankee to reach the milestone. Jeter finished the season second in the AL in both batting average (.343) and runs scored (118), third in hits (214), and fourth in OBP (.417), earning his seventh All-Star selection. Jeter batted .500 with one home run in the 2006 ALDS, including a perfect 5-for-5 performance in Game 1, making him the sixth player to record five hits in one postseason game. The Yankees lost to the Detroit Tigers, three games to one.

Many expected Jeter would win the AL MVP Award for 2006. In a close vote, Jeter finished second in the voting to Justin Morneau of the Twins. Though he lost the MVP Award, he won the Hank Aaron Award, given for superior offensive performance. He also won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.
Though the Yankees continued to struggle with postseason failures, Jeter remained a consistent contributor. During the 2007 season, Jeter was third in the AL with 203 hits, his third consecutive season and sixth overall, with at least 200 hits. He also finished ninth in batting average (.322). He was selected for his eighth All-Star appearance. In the field, he was involved in turning a career-high 104 double plays. He struggled during the 2007 ALDS, batting 3-for-17 (.176) with one RBI, as the Indians defeated the Yankees.

Jeter hit his 400th career double on June 27, 2008, and his 200th home run on July 12. Jeter&#x27;s slugging percentage (SLG) dropped to .410 in the 2008 season, his lowest mark since 1997. Jeter was elected to his ninth All-Star game as the starting shortstop. He finished the season with a .300 batting average.

Jeter tied Lou Gehrig&#x27;s record for hits at Yankee Stadium (1,269) with a home run off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price on September 14, 2008. On September 16, he broke the record against Chicago White Sox pitcher Gavin Floyd. The Yankees were eliminated from postseason contention, the only full season in Jeter&#x27;s career where he did not compete in the playoffs. Following the final game in Yankee Stadium history, Jeter made a speech at the request of the Yankees, thanking the Yankees fans for their support—a moment later voted by fans as the Moment of the Year in MLB.com&#x27;s This Year in Baseball Awards:
====2009–2013====
For the 2009 season, Yankees manager Joe Girardi switched Jeter and Damon in the batting order, with Damon moving to second and Jeter to the leadoff role. Jeter batted .334, third-best in the AL, with a .406 OBP, an .871 OPS, 18 home runs, 66 RBIs, 30 stolen bases in 35 attempts, 107 runs scored, 72 walks, and 212 hits (second in MLB). Defensively, Jeter committed a career-low eight errors, and his .986 fielding percentage was his career best. The addition of Gold Glove-winning first baseman Mark Teixeira allowed second baseman Robinson Canó to shift his focus to his right, helping Jeter. During the season, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; named Jeter eighth on their list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.
Jeter achieved two career hit milestones in the second half of the 2009 season. On August 16, 2009, against the Seattle Mariners, Jeter doubled down the right-field line for his 2,675th hit as a shortstop, breaking Luis Aparicio&#x27;s previous major league record. Then, Jeter became the all-time hits leader as a member of the Yankees (2,722), passing Lou Gehrig on September 11, 2009. The hit was a single off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman in the third inning.

In the 2009 postseason, Jeter batted .355, including .407 in the 2009 World Series, as he won his fifth World Series championship. He was named Sportsman of the Year for 2009 by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and won the Roberto Clemente Award, Hank Aaron Award, his fourth Gold Glove Award and his fourth Silver Slugger Award. Jeter also finished third in the AL MVP voting, behind Minnesota&#x27;s Joe Mauer and Yankee teammate Mark Teixeira. It was also the fifth championship for Pettitte, Posada, and Rivera, who along with Jeter were referred to as the &quot;Core Four&quot;.

In 2010, Jeter, along with Posada and Rivera, became the first trio of teammates in any of the four major league sports in North America (MLB, NFL, NBA, or NHL) to play in at least 16 consecutive seasons on the same team as teammates. The 2010 season was statistically Jeter&#x27;s worst in many respects. The Yankee captain batted .270 with a .340 OBP and .370 SLG, all career lows, as he hit more ground balls than usual. Despite this, Jeter was elected to start at shortstop in the All-Star Game. He rebounded to bat .342 in his last 79 at-bats after making adjustments to his swing with the help of Kevin Long, the Yankees hitting coach, who had successfully helped Nick Swisher and Curtis Granderson make adjustments that improved their production. With Long, Jeter changed the way he strode with his left leg. Following the season, Jeter won his fifth Gold Glove award. Jeter committed six errors during the season, his lowest total in 15 full seasons.

After the 2010 season, Jeter became a free agent for the first time in his career. At age 36, Jeter appeared to be in decline; Joe Sheehan of &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot; suggested that Jeter, once a &quot;good, not great&quot; shortstop, had declined to become &quot;below average&quot; defensively, to the extent that he would likely need to change positions; Cashman later acknowledged that Jeter might need to shift to the outfield. Though Jeter stated that he wanted to remain with the Yankees, negotiations became tense. Jeter&#x27;s agent, Casey Close, stated that he was &quot;baffled&quot; by the Yankees&#x27; approach to the negotiations, and Cashman, now the team&#x27;s general manager, responded publicly that Jeter should test the open market to ascertain his value, which angered Jeter. According to reports, Jeter initially sought a four-year contract worth between $23 million and $25 million per season. He reached an agreement with the Yankees on a three-year contract for $51 million with an option for a fourth year. He spent the offseason working with Long on adjustments to his swing.

The adjustments left Jeter frustrated, as he batted .242 in the first month of the 2011 season. As he struggled, it appeared that the 2011 season was the continuation of Jeter&#x27;s decline. Jeter broke Rickey Henderson&#x27;s franchise record for stolen bases when he stole his 327th base against the Mariners on May 28, 2011. He suffered a calf injury on June 13 that required his fifth stint on the 15-day disabled list, and his first since 2003. At that point, he was batting .260 for the 2011 season with a .649 OPS. Rehabilitating from his injury in Tampa, Jeter worked on his swing with Denbo, his former minor league manager. With Denbo, Jeter returned to the mechanics he used in his minor league days. Following his activation from the disabled list, he hit .326 with an .806 OPS in his last 64 games of the season. Jeter finished the year with a .297 batting average, six home runs, 61 runs batted in, 84 runs, and 16 stolen bases. He credited the turnaround to his work with Denbo; Long acknowledged that his attempt to adjust Jeter&#x27;s swing did not work.

On July 9, 2011, Jeter recorded his 3,000th career hit, a home run off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits on the day he achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter&#x27;s five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is the only member of the 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees. Jeter joined Honus Wagner as only the second regular shortstop to reach the 3,000 hit plateau. Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit. MLB and HBO produced &quot;Derek Jeter 3K&quot;, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.

Fatigued from the stress of chasing 3,000 career hits and wanting to rest his calf, Jeter opted not to attend the 2011 MLB All-Star Game. Jeter and Posada played their 1,660th game together on July 14, 2011, breaking the previous franchise record of 1,659 by Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri. Jeter played his 2,402nd game with the Yankees on August 29, 2011, breaking Mickey Mantle&#x27;s record for most games played as a Yankee. He finished the 2011 season with 162 hits, his 16th consecutive season with 150 hits, which tied him with Pete Rose for the second-most consecutive 150-hit seasons, one behind Hank Aaron for the MLB record. Jeter was honored with the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, given in recognition of charitable endeavors.
Despite continuing concerns about his age, the beginning of the 2012 season saw Jeter on a hot streak: he batted .420 through April 25. Rodriguez commented that Jeter is playing as he did in 1999, while Girardi said Jeter looks like he is 25 years old. In the 2012 MLB All-Star Game, Jeter recorded his 11th All-Star hit, passing Mantle for the most All-Star Game hits in Yankees history. Jeter went 1-for-2 in the game, moving into fourth all-time with a .458 average among players with a minimum of 12 plate appearances in the All-Star Game.

Jeter finished the 2012 season with the most hits in MLB (216). Against the Tampa Bay Rays on September 14 of that year, he moved into the Top 10 on the all-time hit list, surpassing Willie Mays by beating out an infield single for his 3,284th career hit. After hitting .364 in the 2012 ALDS, Jeter fractured his left ankle during Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS against the Detroit Tigers reaching for a ground ball, an injury which ended his season. Jeter had received a cortisone shot to treat a bone bruise in his left foot in September, which could have contributed to the break. Jeter had surgery on his broken left ankle on October 20, with an expected recovery time of four to five months.

While rehabilitating, Jeter suffered a small crack in the area of his previous ankle fracture. As a result, Jeter began the 2013 season on the disabled list. The Yankees activated Jeter on July 11, but after playing in one game, Jeter returned to the disabled list with a quadriceps strain. He returned to the Yankees lineup on July 28, hitting a home run on the first pitch off of Matt Moore of Tampa Bay. Jeter was again placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 5 due to a Grade 1 calf strain, and after a brief return to the lineup, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list for a third time on September 11 due to problems with his ankle, ending his season. On September 14, 2013, Jeter was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. Jeter batted .190 in only 17 games played during the 2013 season.

==== 2014: Final season ====

Jeter re-signed with the Yankees on a one-year, $12 million contract for the 2014 season. Jeter announced on his Facebook page on February 12, 2014, that the 2014 season would be his last. During his final season, each opposing team honored Jeter with a gift during his final visit to their city, which has included donations to Jeter&#x27;s charity, the Turn 2 Foundation.

On July 10, Jeter recorded his 1,000th career multi-hit game, becoming the fourth player to do so. He was elected to start at shortstop in the 2014 All-Star Game, and batted leadoff for the AL. Jeter went 2-for-2, scored one run and received two standing ovations in the four innings he played at the 2014 All-Star Game. As a result, Jeter&#x27;s .481 career All-Star batting average (13-for-27) ranked him fifth all-time (among players with at least 10 at-bats). At 40, Jeter also became the oldest player to have two or more hits in an All-Star Game. In July, Jeter broke Omar Vizquel&#x27;s MLB career record of 2,609 games started at shortstop, and Gehrig&#x27;s franchise career record of 534 doubles. On July 17, Derek scored the 1,900th run of his career becoming the 10th player in MLB history to do so. Jeter passed Carl Yastrzemski for seventh place on MLB&#x27;s all-time career hit list on July 28 and on August 11 he passed Honus Wagner climbing to sixth on the all-time hits list.
The Yankees honored Jeter with a pregame tribute on September 7. Beginning with that day&#x27;s game, the Yankees wore a patch on their hats and uniforms honoring Jeter for the remainder of the season. In the final week of Jeter&#x27;s career, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig honored him as the 15th recipient of the Commissioner&#x27;s Historic Achievement Award for being &quot;one of the most accomplished shortstops of all-time.&quot;

During Jeter&#x27;s final series at Yankee Stadium, Louisville Slugger announced they would retire their &quot;P72&quot; model baseball bat, the bat Jeter uses, though it will be sold under the name &quot;DJ2,&quot; in Jeter&#x27;s honor. The average ticket price for Jeter&#x27;s final home game, on September 25, reached $830 on the secondary market. In his final game at Yankee Stadium, Jeter hit a walk-off single against Orioles pitcher Evan Meek to win the game, 6–5.

Jeter decided to play exclusively as the designated hitter in the final series of his career, at Fenway Park in Boston, so that his final memories of playing shortstop would be at Yankee Stadium. The Red Sox honored Jeter with a pregame ceremony including Red Sox retired stars Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, Luis Tiant and Rico Petrocelli, the Boston Bruins&#x27; Bobby Orr, New England Patriots receiver Troy Brown and the Boston Celtics&#x27; Paul Pierce, while many Boston fans at Fenway Park loudly cheered for Jeter and gave him a standing ovation. In his final at-bat, he hit an RBI infield single against Clay Buchholz, before being substituted for pinch runner Brian McCann; he received an ovation from the Red Sox fans as he exited the field.

===World Baseball Classic===
Jeter started at shortstop for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. He hit 9-for-20 (.450) and scored five runs in six games. Only teammate Ken Griffey Jr. (.524) and Cuba&#x27;s Yoandy Garlobo (.480) had a higher batting average with a minimum of 20 at-bats. Jeter&#x27;s play earned him recognition as the shortstop selection on the All-Tournament Team.

In the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Jeter again started at shortstop. He was named captain of the United States team by manager Davey Johnson, and he batted 8-for-29 (.276) in eight games. Jeter and the United States team faced the Yankees at Steinbrenner Field in an exhibition game, the only time Jeter played against the Yankees.

==Player profile==

Jeter is considered to be one of the most consistent baseball players of all time. For his career, he averaged 204 hits, 113 runs scored and 21 stolen bases per 162 games. He is currently sixth on the all-time hits list in MLB history. Highly competitive, Jeter once said, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to play at all, you&#x27;re out to win. Baseball, board games, playing &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, I hate to lose.&quot; Jeter has been viewed as one of the best players of his generation.

An aggressive hitter, Jeter swung at most pitches in the strike zone and many near it. Though right-handed hitters often pull the ball into left field, Jeter&#x27;s signature inside-out swing, dubbed the &quot;Jeterian Swing&quot;, resulted in most of his hits going to center and right field. Similarly, most of his home runs were hit to right field rather than to center or to left, as his swing took advantage of Yankee Stadium&#x27;s close right-field fences.
Jeter is also known for his professionalism. In an age where professional athletes often found themselves in personal scandals, he mostly avoided major controversy in a high-profile career in New York City while maintaining a strong work ethic. Due to his style of play, opponents and teammates held him in high esteem. A clubhouse leader, Jeter often defused confrontations between teammates.

===Postseason performance===
Jeter is noted for his postseason performances and has earned the titles of &quot;Captain Clutch&quot;, and &quot;Mr. November&quot; due to his outstanding postseason play. He had a career .309 postseason batting average, and a .321 batting average in the World Series. Except for 2008, 2013 and 2014, the Yankees qualified for the postseason every year of Jeter&#x27;s major league career. He holds MLB postseason records for games played (158), plate appearances (734), at-bats (650), hits (200), singles (143), doubles (32), triples (5), runs scored (111), total bases (302) and strikeouts (135). Jeter is also fourth in home runs (20) and runs batted in (61), fifth in base on balls (66) and sixth in stolen bases (18).

===Defense===

Jeter won five Gold Glove Awards, trailing only Vizquel, Ozzie Smith, Luis Aparicio, Dave Concepción, and Mark Belanger for most by a shortstop. He was credited with positioning himself well and for a quick release when he threw the ball. One of his signature defensive plays is the &quot;jump-throw&quot;, by which he leapt and threw to first base while moving towards third base.

Despite this, Jeter&#x27;s defense was the subject of criticism from a number of sabermetricians, including Rob Neyer and the publication &quot;Baseball Prospectus&quot;. The 2006 book &quot;The Fielding Bible&quot; by John Dewan contains an essay by Bill James in which he concluded that Jeter &quot;was probably the most ineffective defensive player in the major leagues, at any position&quot; over his entire career. A 2008 study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that, from 2002 through 2005, Jeter was the worst defensive shortstop in MLB. Two sites that rely on advanced defensive statistics, FanGraphs.com and FieldingBible.com, rated Jeter below middle-of-the-pack status in 2010, despite his receiving his fifth Gold Glove Award that season.

Jeter committed 18 errors in 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Cashman and his staff saw Jeter&#x27;s defense as an area that needed to be addressed. At the Yankees&#x27; request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness. Jeter&#x27;s ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.

When asked to respond to criticism of his defense, Jeter replied: &quot;I play in New York, man. Criticism is part of the game, you take criticism as a challenge.&quot; Jeter further asserted that many defensive factors cannot be quantified. The controversy over Jeter&#x27;s fielding became a flash point for the debate over whether the analyses of statistics or subjective observation is the better method to assess a player&#x27;s defensive ability and for criticism of the Gold Glove Award.
==Personal life==
Jeter has owned homes in Marlboro Township, New Jersey; Greenwood Lake, New York; and the Davis Islands neighborhood of Tampa, Florida. He previously owned a penthouse apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s Trump World Tower. Jeter settled a tax dispute regarding his official residence with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in 2008. New York State alleged that Jeter should have paid state income tax from 2001 to 2003, as Jeter resided in the Manhattan apartment he bought in 2001; Jeter claimed to have established his residence in Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1994, and that he was still a resident of Florida at the time. Florida has no state income tax. , Jeter and his wife (the former model Hannah Davis) reside in Miami. In September 2020, the couple listed their waterfront Tampa home for $29 million. They subsequently listed their Greenwood Lake home in March 2021.

In December 2002, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner criticized Jeter for staying out until 3 a.m. at a birthday party during the 2002 season, saying that his star shortstop &quot;wasn&#x27;t totally focused&quot; and that &quot;it didn&#x27;t sit well&quot; with him. The two mocked the incident in a May 2003 Visa commercial, similar to the manner in which Steinbrenner and former Yankees manager Billy Martin made light of their feud in a Miller Lite commercial during the 1970s.
Jeter&#x27;s personal life has been a frequent topic in gossip columns and celebrity magazines since his rookie year in 1996. He had a well-publicized relationship with singer-songwriter Mariah Carey from 1997 to 1998. Carey cowrote the song &quot;The Roof (Back in Time)&quot; about their first kiss. Jeter has also dated model Vida Guerra, former Miss Universe Lara Dutta, singer Joy Enriquez, television personality Vanessa Minnillo, and the actresses Jordana Brewster, Jessica Biel, and Minka Kelly.

Jeter is Catholic, having been raised in the faith, attending Catholic schools as a child and identifying with the faith while playing for the Yankees.

Jeter and &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; cover model Hannah Davis, who had been dating since 2012, became engaged in 2015. In July 2016, the two married. They have three daughters, born in August 2017, January 2019, and December 2021, and a son, born in May 2023.

==Business interests==

During his injury-shortened 2013 season, Jeter arranged a partnership with Simon &amp; Schuster to form an imprint called Jeter Publishing. He called it &quot;the blueprint for postcareer&quot;. It will begin publishing nonfiction books for adults, children&#x27;s picture books, elementary grade fiction, and books for children who are learning to read. Eventually, the partnership could lead to film and television productions.

On October 1, 2014, Jeter&#x27;s new website, ThePlayersTribune.com, appeared online; it was billed as &quot;a new media platform that will present the unfiltered voice of professional athletes, bringing fans closer to the games they love than ever before.&quot; It was reported by the Tampa Bay Business Journal in March 2015 that Jeter had partnered with Concessions Tampa to bid for a space within the Tampa International Airport, and plans to open a restaurant named after his website.

Jeter also serves as a brand development officer for Luvo Inc. and has investment interests in multi-channel video network company, Whistle Sports Network. He explored purchasing the Buffalo Bills football team in 2014.

Jeter joined the board of Rockefeller Capital Management in April 2021.

===Miami Marlins===
In July 2017, Jeter engaged in the bidding for ownership of the Miami Marlins. In August 2017, Jeter and Bruce Sherman finalized a deal to purchase the Miami Marlins. The sale was completed in September 2017, following unanimous approval of the other 29 MLB team owners. Though Jeter only owned a 4% stake in the franchise, he was named chief executive officer (CEO) of the team, and Sherman, the controlling owner, entrusted him to oversee day-to-day operations of the team.

On February 28, 2022, Jeter announced that he would no longer serve as CEO of the Marlins or hold any shares in the club. After more than four years as the Miami Marlins&#x27; chief executive, he ended the relationship and sold his 4% ownership in the team.

===Arena Club===
On September 8, 2022, Jeter announced that he joined entrepreneur Brian Lee and multiple capital venture firms in launching a card grading, storage vault, and marketplace platform named Arena Club.

==Appearances outside of baseball==
===Philanthropy===
Jeter created the Turn 2 Foundation, a charitable organization, in 1996. It was established to help children and teenagers avoid drug and alcohol addiction, and to reward those who show high academic achievement. In 2012, Jeter received an honorary doctorate from Siena College honoring him for his foundation&#x27;s work.

Since 2009, Jeter has served as an ambassador for Weplay, a website designed to encourage children to get involved in sports. Jeter, along with Japanese baseball player Hideki Matsui, took part in a charity baseball game at Tokyo Dome to raise funds for survivors of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

In 2018, Jeter donated furniture and household items to families forced to relocate by Hurricane Irma. In July 2019, Jeter donated $3.2 million from the Turn 2 Foundation to the Kalamazoo Public School District to renovate the school&#x27;s baseball and softball complex.

===Endorsements===
Jeter has appeared in national ad campaigns for Nike, Gatorade, Fleet Bank, Subway, Ford, VISA, Discover Card, Florsheim, Gillette, Skippy, and XM Satellite Radio. He endorses a cologne named &quot;Driven&quot;, designed in collaboration with and distributed by Avon. Jeter has his own Jumpman shoe. To commemorate Jeter&#x27;s final year, the Jordan brand made a tribute commercial titled &quot;#RE2PECT&quot;, which had many baseball players (such as Jon Lester) and celebrities, even rival Boston Red Sox fans, tip their caps.

In 2006, Jeter was the second-highest paid endorser in baseball, behind Ichiro Suzuki, who received endorsement deals in Japan. He was ranked as the most marketable player in baseball according to the 2003, 2005, and 2010 Sports Business Surveys. A 2011 list by the marketing firm Nielsen ranked Jeter as the most marketable player in baseball, accounting for personal attributes such as sincerity, approachability, experience, and influence.

===Other appearances===
Jeter has appeared on television as a guest actor in the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in the episode titled, &quot;The Abstinence&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show, in episode 7 during season 27. He had cameo appearances in the comedy films &quot;Anger Management&quot; and &quot;The Other Guys&quot;. Jeter was the subject of a 2005 segment on the TV news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and a 2014 episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television series. Jeter also appears as a character in the Broadway play &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot;. Jeter made an appearance alongside Peyton Manning to celebrate &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s 40th Anniversary in February 2015.

Video games have featured Jeter on their cover, including 2K Sports&#x27; &quot;MLB 2K5&quot;, &quot;MLB 2K6&quot;, and &quot;MLB 2K7&quot;, Acclaim Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Baseball&quot; series of video games, and Gameloft&#x27;s wireless phone baseball game, &quot;Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2008&quot;. A wax figure immortalizes Jeter at the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in New York, and a sculpture at the Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory in Louisville, Kentucky.

&quot;The Captain&quot;, a documentary miniseries about Jeter&#x27;s life and career, debuted on ESPN on July 18, 2022.

During Fox Sports&#x27; pregame coverage of Super Bowl LVII, Jeter announced that he would be joining Fox Sports as a studio analyst for MLB on Fox.

==Career highlights==
===Honors===

Kalamazoo Central High School inducted Jeter into its athletic hall of fame in 2003 and renamed its baseball field in his honor in 2011. In 2015, Jeter was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The Yankees retired Jeter&#x27;s uniform number and unveiled a plaque in his honor that was installed at Monument Park in a pregame ceremony on May 14, 2017.

On January 21, 2020, Jeter was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as part of its class of 2020 in his first year of eligibility, only one vote shy of being only the second unanimous selection in Hall of Fame history. His 99.7% of the vote was second only to Mariano Rivera (100%), and ahead of Ken Griffey (99.3%) in the history of Hall of Fame voting. He was formally enshrined in a ceremony on September 8, 2021, in Cooperstown, New York.

<text>The Pact of Steel (, ), formally known as the Pact of Friendship and Alliance between Germany and Italy (, ) was a military and political alliance between Italy and Germany, signed in 1939.

The pact was initially drafted as a tripartite military alliance between Japan, Italy and Germany. While Japan wanted the focus of the pact to be aimed at the Soviet Union, Italy and Germany wanted the focus of it to be aimed at the British Empire and France. Due to that disagreement, the pact was signed without Japan and, as a result, it became an agreement which only existed between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, signed on 22 May 1939 by foreign ministers Galeazzo Ciano of Italy and Joachim von Ribbentrop of Germany.

Together with the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Tripartite Pact, the Pact of Steel was one of the three agreements forming the main basis of the Axis alliance. The pact consisted of two parts. The first section was an open declaration of continuing trust and co-operation between Germany and Italy. The second section, the &quot;Secret Supplementary Protocol&quot;, encouraged a union of policies concerning the military and the economy.

==Background==
Germany and Italy fought against each other in World War I. Popularity and support for radical political parties (such as the Nazis of Adolf Hitler and the Fascists of Benito Mussolini) exploded after the Great Depression had severely hampered the economies of both countries.

In 1922, Mussolini secured his position as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy. His first actions made him immensely popular - massive programs of public works providing employment and transforming Italy&#x27;s infrastructure. In the Mediterranean, Mussolini built a powerful navy, larger than the combined might of the British and French Mediterranean fleets.

When he was appointed Chancellor in 1933, Hitler initiated a huge wave of public works and secret rearmament. Although Italy initially signed the Italo-Soviet Pact aimed against Germany when Hitler came to power, Mussolini’s attitude changed. Fascism and Nazism shared similar principles and Hitler and Mussolini met on several state and private occasions in the 1930s. On 23 October 1936, Italy and Germany signed a secret protocol aligning their foreign policy for the first time on such issues as the Spanish Civil War, the League of Nations and the Abyssinia Crisis.

==Japan==
In 1931, Japanese forces invaded the region of Manchuria because of its rich grain fields and reserves of raw minerals. This, however, provoked a diplomatic clash with the Soviet Union, which bordered Manchuria. To combat this Soviet threat, the Japanese signed a pact with Germany in 1936. The aim of the pact was to guard against any attack from Soviet Russia were it to move on China.

Japan elected to focus on anti-Soviet alliances instead of anti-Western alliances like Italy and Germany. Germany, however, feared that an anti-USSR alliance would create the possibility of a two-front war before they could conquer Western Europe. So when Italy invited Japan to sign the Pact of Steel, it demurred.

==Clauses==
Officially, the Pact of Steel obliged Germany and Italy to aid the other country militarily, economically or otherwise in the event of war, and to collaborate in wartime production. The Pact aimed to ensure that neither country was able to make peace without the agreement of the other. The agreement was based on the assumption that a war would not occur within three years. When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and war broke out on 3 September, Italy was not yet prepared for conflict and had difficulty meeting its obligations. Consequently, Italy did not enter World War II until June 1940, with a delayed invasion of Southern France.

===Secret supplementary protocols===
The secret supplementary protocols of the Pact of Steel, which were split into two sections, were not made public at the time of the signing of the Pact.

The first section urged the countries to quicken their joint military and economic cooperation whilst the second section committed the two countries to cooperate in &quot;matters of press, the news service and the propaganda&quot; to promote the power and image of the Rome-Berlin Axis. To aid in this, each country was to assign &quot;one or several specialists&quot; of their country in the capital city of the other for close liaisons with the Foreign Minister of that country.

==Name change==
After being told the original name, &quot;Pact of Blood&quot;, would likely be poorly received in Italy, Mussolini proposed the name &quot;Pact of Steel&quot;, which was ultimately chosen.

==Dissolution==
According to Article VII, the pact was to last 10 years, but this did not happen. In November 1942, the Axis forces in North Africa, were decisively defeated by the British and British Commonwealth forces at the Second Battle of El Alamein. In July 1943 the Western Allies opened up a new front by invading Sicily. In the aftermath of this, Mussolini was overthrown by 19 members of the Gran Consiglio who voted in favour of the Ordine Grandi. The new Italian government, under Field Marshal Pietro Badoglio, signed an armistice with the Allies in September and became a non-belligerent, thus effectively ending Italy&#x27;s involvement in the pact.

Although a puppet government under Mussolini, the Italian Social Republic, was established in Northern Italy by Nazi Germany, Italy continued as a member of the pact in name only.

<doc id="218955" wikidata="Q176647" url="?curid=218955" title="Erica arborea">
<text>Erica arborea, the tree heath or tree heather, is a species of flowering plant (angiosperms) in the heather family Ericaceae, native to the Mediterranean Basin and Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania in East Africa. It is also cultivated as an ornamental.

The wood, known as briar root (French: bruyère, Catalan: bruc, Portuguese: betouro, Spanish: brezo), is extremely hard and heat-resistant, and is used for making smoking pipes. Leaf fossils attributed to this species were described for the Mio-Pleistocene deposit of São Jorge in Madeira Island.

== Description ==
&quot;Erica arborea&quot; is an upright evergreen shrub or small tree with a typical height in the wild of some , especially in Africa, but more typically in gardens. It bears dark green needle-like leaves and numerous small honey-scented bell-shaped white flowers. It is a calcifuge, preferring acid soil in an open sunny situation.

==Distribution and habitat==
The heather has a disjunct distribution, including Macaronesia, the Mediterranean Basin, Western Caucasus, eastern Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;br&gt;

In Macaronesia, it occurs in thermophilous forests, dominating dry and shallow soils, southern aspects, and forest margins.
Throughout the Mediterranean Basin, its distribution is not continuous, extending from the Atlantic coasts of Portugal and Spain to the coast of the Black Sea in Turkey and Georgia. The heather occurs within the Mediterranean maquis shrublands in semi-arid habitats but can also be found in forest undergrowth up to 1400 m a.s.l. in fresher and more humid environments. It prefers acidic or acidified soils derived from siliceous substrates. 
It is also present in an isolated population in the Tibesti Mountains (Chad) in the Sahara, where it occurs at the top of upper montane desert steppe vegetation between 2500 and 3000 m a.s.l.
In eastern Africa is normally referred to as giant heather. It occurs in the Ethiopian highlands, in the highest mountains along the East African Rift System, from southern Uganda to northern Malawi. It is also present in the Sarawat Mountains in the southwestern Arabian Peninsula, including Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the heather is a constituent of the tropical alpine vegetation, dominating the shrubland above the treeline in mountain areas between 3000 and 4000 m a.s.l.&lt;br&gt;

Naturalised populations occur in south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, where tree heath is seen as a potential environmental weed.

==Cultivars==
&quot;Erica arborea&quot; was being cultivated as early as 1658. Several cultivars and hybrids have been developed for garden use, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 
*&quot;E. arborea&quot; &#x27;Estrella Gold&#x27; (gold-tipped leaves)
*&quot;E. arborea&quot; var. &quot;alpina&quot; 
*&quot;E. arborea&quot; var. &quot;alpina&quot; f. aureifolia &#x27;Albert&#x27;s Gold&#x27; (gold-leaved)
*&quot;E.&quot; × &quot;veitchii&quot; &#x27;Gold Tips&#x27; (&quot;E. arborea&quot; × &quot;E. lusitanica&quot;)

Other tall growing heaths, including the Portugal Heath (&quot;Erica lusitanica&quot;) and channel heath (&quot;Erica canaliculata&quot;) may also sometimes be called tree heath.

==Uses==
The wood, known as &quot;briar root&quot;, is extremely hard, dense and heat-resistant, and is primarily used for making smoking pipes, as it does not affect the aroma of tobacco. The football-sized tubers are harvested at the age of 30 to 60 years. They are cooked for several hours, then dried for several months before they are further processed. 

The wood is also used for making jewellery, fountain pens and knife handles.

The festival starts on the Friday before the third Sunday of July and lasts until and including the fourth Sunday of July. The date originally had no reference to 21 July, Belgian National Day, but that holiday is always included. The festival starts on &quot;the (Fri)day before the Saturday before 21 July&quot; and lasts ten days.

The last day (until recently always a Monday) is known as &quot;de dag van de lege portemonnees&quot; (&quot;the day of the empty wallets&quot;) alluding to the fact that many people have spent their last penny at the festival and is seen by the people of Ghent as &quot;their&quot; day while visitors leave.

==History==
The first Gentse Feesten was held in 1843, about 400 people attended. The intensity of the festivities changed throughout the years. The modern Gentse Feesten was started in the summer of 1969 by Ghent singer Walter De Buck and ex-wife Paula Monsart with people from Café Trefpunt. 

In the beginning the festival consisted of one stage near the Saint Jacob&#x27;s Church. Since the late 1980s the festival has grown to now cover the whole inner city of Ghent. Although the festival has become a mass event, it has retained some of the rebellious and anarchistic atmosphere of the early days. 

About 2 million visitors attend the festival every year, making it one of the biggest cultural and popular festivals in Europe. The number of visitors on top nights surpasses 250,000. In a 2005 ranking by localfestivities.com, the Gentse Feesten was called the third biggest city festival in Europe, preceded by the Fallas in Valencia and the Oktoberfest in Munich.

The festival did not take place in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, being held again in the summer of 2022, after a two-year break.

==Festivals within the Gentse Feesten==
Traditionally the shows at the festival have been free, but in later years a number of side festivals have chosen the period of the Gentse Feesten to organize separate events.

<text>The Bayreuth Festspielhaus or Bayreuth Festival Theatre (, ) is an opera house north of Bayreuth, Germany, built by the 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner and dedicated solely to the performance of his stage works. It is the venue for the annual Bayreuth Festival, for which it was specifically conceived and built. Its official name is . It is the home of the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra.

==Design==

Wagner adapted the design of the &quot;Festspielhaus&quot; from an unrealised project by Gottfried Semper for an opera house in Munich, without the architect&#x27;s permission, and supervised its construction. Ludwig II of Bavaria provided the primary funding for the construction. The foundation stone was laid on 22 May 1872, Wagner&#x27;s 59th birthday. The building was first opened for the premiere of the complete four-opera cycle of (&quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;), from 13 to 17 August 1876.

Only the entry façade exhibits the typical late-19th-century ornamentation, while the remainder of the exterior is modest and shows mostly undecorated bricks. The interior is mainly wood and has a reverberation time of 1.55 seconds. The Festspielhaus is one of the largest free-standing timber structures ever erected. Unlike the traditional opera house design with several tiers of seating in a horseshoe shaped auditorium, the Festspielhaus&#x27;s seats are arranged in a single steeply-shaped wedge, with galleries or boxes along the back wall only. This is also known as continental seating. Many contemporary movie theaters have adopted this style of seating, which gives every seat an equal and uninterrupted view of the stage. The capacity of the Festspielhaus is 1,925 and it has a volume of 10,000 cubic metres.

The Festspielhaus features a double proscenium, which gives the audience the illusion that the stage is further away than it actually is. The double proscenium and the recessed orchestra pit create – in Wagner&#x27;s term – a &quot;mystic gulf&quot; between the audience and the stage. This gives a dreamlike character to performances, and provides a physical reinforcement of the mythic content of most of Wagner&#x27;s operas. The architecture of Festpielhaus accomplished many of Wagner&#x27;s goals and ideals for the performances of his operas including an improvement on the sound, feel, and overall look of the production.

The Festpielhaus was originally planned to open in 1873, but by that time Wagner had barely raised enough money to put up the walls of his theatre. He began to raise money by traveling and putting on concerts in various cities and countries throughout Europe. There are, however, some documents concerning the donation and aid (900 thaler) to Wagner for that matter by the Sultan Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire. Even after Ludwig began funding the project, Wagner had to continue putting on concerts to keep the building project financially afloat. The tours were very taxing on Wagner&#x27;s health and would eventually be a key element to his death later on in 1883.

==Orchestra pit==

A significant feature of the Festspielhaus is its unusual orchestra pit. It is recessed under the stage and covered by a hood, so that the orchestra is completely invisible to the audience. This feature was a central preoccupation for Wagner, since it made the audience concentrate on the drama onstage, rather than the distracting motion of the conductor and musicians. The design also corrected the balance of volume between singers and orchestra, creating ideal acoustics for Wagner&#x27;s operas, which are the only operas performed at the Festspielhaus. However, this arrangement has also made it the most challenging to conduct in, even for the world&#x27;s best conductors. Not only is the crowded pit enveloped in darkness, but the acoustic reverberation makes it difficult to synchronise the orchestra with the singers. Conductors must therefore retrain themselves to ignore cues from singers.

The orchestra layout deployed at Bayreuth is unusual in three ways:

# The first violins are positioned on the right-hand side of the conductor instead of their usual place on the left side. This is in all likelihood because of the way the sound is intended to be directed towards the stage rather than directly on the audience. This way the sound has a more direct line from the first violins to the back of the stage where it can be then reflected to the audience.
# Double basses, cellos and harps (when more than one used, e.g. &quot;Ring&quot;) are split into groups and placed on either side of the pit.
# The rest of the orchestra is located directly under the stage. This makes communication with the conductor vital as most of the players are unable to see or hear the singers, but creates the huge, rich sounds Wagner sought to compose.

==Bayreuth Festival==
The Festspielhaus remains the venue of the annual Bayreuth Festival, during which Wagner&#x27;s later operas, such as the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle and &quot;Parsifal&quot;, are given on a repertory basis.

==Recent history==

In early 2012, Katharina Wagner mentioned the need for repairs to the building, with mention specifically of roof leaks and crumbling of the red brick facade. In 2014, funding for restoration was announced at a level of approximately €30 million, primarily from public funding shared between Germany and the state of Bavaria, with the German national government and the Bavarian state government holding majority shares.

Repairs were completed on 26 July 2015 and the building is fully restored.

<text>Immanuel or Emmanuel (, &quot;God [is] with us&quot;; Koine Greek: ) is a Hebrew name that appears in the Book of Isaiah (7:14) as a sign that God will protect the House of David.

The Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 1:22–23) interprets this as a prophecy of the birth of the Messiah and the fulfillment of Scripture in the person of Jesus. &quot;Immanuel&quot; &quot;God (apostle) with us&quot; is one of the &quot;symbolic names&quot; used by Isaiah, alongside Shearjashub, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, or Pele-joez-el-gibbor-abi-ad-sar-shalom.
It has no particular meaning in Jewish messianism.

In Christian theology by contrast, based on its use in Isaiah 7:14, the name has come to be read as a prophecy of the Christ, following Matthew 1:23, where &quot;Immanuel&quot; () is translated as (KJV: &quot;God with us&quot;), and also Luke 7:14–16 after the raising of the dead man in Nain, where it was rumoured throughout all Judaea that &quot;God has visited his people&quot; (KJV).

==Isaiah 7–8==

===Summary===
The setting is the Syro-Ephraimite War, 735-734 BCE, which saw the Kingdom of Judah pitted against two northern neighbors, the kingdoms of Israel (called Ephraim in the prophecy) and Syria (also known as Aram or Aram-Damascus or Syria-Damascus). tells how the kings of Ephraim and Syria attack Jerusalem when Ahaz refuses to join them in their anti-Assyrian alliance. Ahaz wishes to ask Assyria for help, but Isaiah, at God&#x27;s command, takes his son Shear-jashub (a symbolic name meaning &quot;a remnant shall return&quot;) and assures Ahaz that the two enemy kings will not succeed (). Isaiah tells Ahaz of the apparent sign by which he will know that this is a true prophecy: a young woman will give birth to a child whom she will name Immanuel (another symbolic name, meaning &quot;God with us&quot;), and the lands of the &quot;two kings you dread&quot; will be laid waste before the child is old enough to &quot;reject the wrong and choose the right&quot; (). 

 follows with a further prophecy that at some unspecified future date God will call up Assyria against Judah: &quot;The Lord will cause to come upon you and your people and your ancestral house such days as have not been seen since Ephraim broke away from Judah—the king of Assyria&quot; (verse ). Verses describe the desolation that will result: &quot;In that day a man will save alive a young cow and two sheep…in that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines…will be turned over to thorns and briars&quot; (verses ). continues the previous chapter: the prophet tells of the birth of another child, his own son named Maher-shalal-hash-baz (a third symbolic name), then predicts that after Ephraim and Syria are destroyed the Assyrians will come like a river in flood to &quot;cover the breadth of your land, Immanuel&quot; ().

A fourth, even longer, prophetic &quot;name&quot;, is found in Isaiah 9:6 with &quot;Pele-joez-el-gibbor-abi-ad-sar-shalom&quot;. This is generally translated fully in English Bible versions such as &quot;his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace&quot; (KJV).

===Interpretation===
, is on the surface set in the time of king Ahaz, and a prophecy concerning the two kings whom Ahaz dreads, namely Pekah and Rezin. The defeat and death of both these kings at the hands of the Assyrians is dated around 732 BCE, placing the birth of the Immanuel child late in the reign of Ahaz.

Scholars generally date the written version of these events from the reign of Ahaz&#x27;s son Hezekiah some thirty years later, the purpose being to persuade Hezekiah not to join with other kings who intended to rebel against their joint overlord, Assyria. Isaiah points to the dreadful consequences that followed for Judah&#x27;s northern neighbours, the kingdom of Israel and Aram-Damascus (Syria) when they rebelled in the days of Ahaz and brought the Assyrians down on themselves. In the event, Hezekiah ignored Isaiah and joined the rebels, and the prophet&#x27;s warning came true: the Assyrians ravaged Judah and Hezekiah barely escaped with his throne. A century later, in the time of Josiah, the prophecy was revised to present Ahaz as the faithless king who rejected God&#x27;s promise of protection for Jerusalem and the house of David, with the result that God brought Assyria to devastate the land until a new and faithful king (presumably Josiah) would arise.

Isaiah 7–8 mentions three children with symbolic names: Shear-jashub, meaning &quot;a remnant shall return&quot;; Immanuel, &quot;God is with us&quot;; and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, &quot;the spoil speeds, the prey hastens&quot;. informs the reader that Isaiah and his children are signs (&quot;Here am I, and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the Lord Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion&quot;). The meaning of these name-signs is not clear: Shear-jashub has been variously interpreted to mean that only a remnant of Ephraim and Syria will survive the Assyrian invasion, or that a remnant of Judah will repent and turn to God, while in it seems to mean that a remnant of Israel will return to the Davidic monarchy. Maher-shalal-hash-baz is more clearly related to the expected destruction of Ephraim and Syria. As for Immanuel, &quot;God is with us&quot;, Isaiah might mean simply that any young pregnant woman in 734 BCE would be able to name her child &quot;God is with us&quot; by the time he is born; but if a specific child is meant, then it might be a son of Ahaz, possibly his successor Hezekiah (which is the traditional Jewish understanding); or, since the other symbolic children are Isaiah&#x27;s, Immanuel might be the prophet&#x27;s own son. However this may be, the significance of the sign changes from Isaiah 7, where Immanuel symbolises the hope of imminent defeat for Syria and Ephraim, to Isaiah 8:8, where Immanuel is addressed as the people whose land is about to be overrun by the Assyrians.

==Matthew 1:22–23==

The Gospel of Matthew cites the prophecy of the sign of Immanuel from Isaiah, using a Greek translation rather than the original Hebrew. Matthew begins with a genealogy of Jesus from Abraham through David to Joseph, with Jesus as &quot;the son of David&quot;, (Matthew 1:1) a member of the &quot;house of David&quot; () to whom the sign of Immanuel was given. Matthew 1:16 indicates that Jesus is not Joseph&#x27;s natural son, and Matthew never refers to Joseph as Jesus&#x27;s father. Verses turn to Mary, the future mother of Jesus, betrothed (engaged) to Joseph, but &quot;found with child of the Holy Ghost&quot; before she and Joseph &quot;came together&quot;. (v.18) Joseph was about to break the engagement, but an angel appeared to him in a dream and told him of the child&#x27;s divine origin, and Matthew 1:22–23 declares how this was the fulfillment of Scripture:
:22 &quot;Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,&quot;
:23 &quot;Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.&quot;

The gospel of Matthew was written by an author who believed that Jesus was the promised Messiah, &quot;God with us&quot;. At first, titles such as &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;son of God&quot; had described Jesus&#x27;s future nature at the &quot;deutera parousia&quot;, the Second Coming; but very soon he came to be recognised as having become the Son of God at the resurrection; then, in Mark, he becomes known as Son of God at his baptism; and finally Matthew and Luke add infancy narratives in which Jesus is the Son of God from the very beginning, long before being conceived of a virgin mother without a human father.

<text>The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is a large species of goose with a black head and neck, white cheeks, white under its chin, and a brown body. It is native to the arctic and temperate regions of North America, and it is occasionally found during migration across the Atlantic in northern Europe. It has been introduced to France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, Japan, Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands. Like most geese, the Canada goose is primarily herbivorous and normally migratory; often found on or close to fresh water, the Canada goose is also common in brackish marshes, estuaries, and lagoons.

Extremely adept at living in human-altered areas, Canada geese have established breeding colonies in urban and cultivated habitats, which provide food and few natural predators. The success of this common park species has led to it often being considered a pest species because of its excrement, its depredation of crops, its noise, its aggressive territorial behavior toward both humans and other animals, and its habit of stalking and begging for food, the latter a result of humans disobeying artificial feeding policies toward wild animals.

==Nomenclature and taxonomy==

The Canada goose was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It belongs to the &quot;Branta&quot; genus of geese, which contains species with largely black plumage, distinguishing them from the gray species of the genus &quot;Anser&quot;.

&quot;Branta&quot; was a Latinized form of Old Norse , &quot;burnt (black) goose&quot; and the specific epithet &quot;canadensis&quot; is a Neo-Latin word meaning &quot;from Canada&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first citation for the &#x27;Canada goose&#x27; dates back to 1772. The Canada goose is also colloquially referred to as the &quot;Canadian goose&quot;. This name may annoy some birders.

The cackling goose was originally considered to be the same species or several subspecies of the Canada goose, but in July 2004, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union&#x27;s Committee on Classification and Nomenclature split them into two species, making the cackling goose into a full species with the scientific name &quot;Branta hutchinsii&quot;. The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union followed suit in June 2005.

The AOU has divided the many subspecies between the two species. The subspecies of the Canada goose were listed as:
* Atlantic Canada goose (&quot;B. c. canadensis&quot;) 
* Interior Canada goose (&quot;B. c. interior&quot;) 
* Giant Canada goose (&quot;B. c. maxima&quot;) 
* Moffitt&#x27;s Canada goose (&quot;B. c. moffitti&quot;) 
* Vancouver Canada goose (&quot;B. c. fulva&quot;) 
* Dusky Canada goose (&quot;B. c. occidentalis&quot;) 
* Lesser Canada goose (&quot;B. c. parvipes&quot;) 

The distinctions between the two geese have led to confusion and debate among ornithologists. This has been aggravated by the overlap between the small types of Canada goose and larger types of cackling goose. The old &quot;lesser Canada geese&quot; were believed to be a partly hybrid population, with the birds named &quot;B. c. taverneri&quot; considered a mixture of &quot;B. c. minima&quot;, &quot;B. c. occidentalis&quot;, and &quot;B. c. parvipes&quot;. The holotype specimen of &quot;taverneri&quot; is a straightforward large pale cackling goose however, and hence the taxon is still valid today and was renamed &quot;Taverner&#x27;s cackling goose&quot;.

In addition, the barnacle goose (&quot;B. leucopsis&quot;) was determined to be a derivative of the cackling goose lineage, whereas the Hawaiian goose (&quot;B. sandvicensis&quot;) originated from ancestral Canada geese. Thus, the species&#x27; distinctness is well evidenced. Ornithologist Harold C. Hanson, who had rediscovered wild populations of the Giant Canada Goose, proposed splitting Canada and cackling goose into six species and 200 subspecies. The radical nature of this proposal has been controversial; Richard Banks of the AOU urges caution before any of Hanson&#x27;s proposals are accepted. International Code of Zoological Nomenclature has suppressed Hanson&#x27;s proposals, based on the criticisms of Banks and other ornithologists.

==Description==


The black head and neck with a white &quot;chinstrap&quot; distinguish the Canada goose from all other goose species except the cackling goose and barnacle goose (the latter, however, has a black breast and gray rather than brownish body plumage). Some Canada geese come with a pepper-spotted or brown neck with brown plumage, and these are assumed to be a leucistic variety.

The seven subspecies of this bird vary widely in size and plumage details, but all are recognizable as Canada geese. Some of the smaller races can be hard to distinguish from the cackling goose, which slightly overlap in mass. However, most subspecies of the cackling goose (exclusive of Richardson&#x27;s cackling goose, &quot;B. h. hutchinsii&quot;) are considerably smaller. The smallest cackling goose, &quot;B. h. minima&quot;, is scarcely larger than a mallard. In addition to the size difference, cackling geese also have a shorter neck and smaller bill, which can be useful when small Canada geese comingle with relatively large cackling geese. Of the &quot;true geese&quot; (i.e., the genera &quot;Anser&quot; and &quot;Branta&quot;), the Canada goose is on average the largest living species, although some other species that are geese in name, if not of close relation to these genera, are on average heavier, such as the spur-winged goose and Cape Barren goose.
Canada geese range from in length and have a wingspan. Among standard measurements, the wing chord can range from , the tarsus can range from and the bill can range from . The largest subspecies is &quot;B. c. maxima&quot;, or the giant Canada goose, and the smallest (with the separation of the cackling goose group) is &quot;B. c. parvipes&quot;, or the lesser Canada goose. An exceptionally large male of race &quot;B. c. maxima&quot;, which rarely exceed , weighed and had a wingspan of . This specimen is the largest wild goose ever recorded of any species.

The male Canada goose usually weighs , averaging amongst all subspecies . The female looks virtually identical, but is slightly lighter at , averaging amongst all subspecies , and generally 10% smaller in linear dimensions than the male counterparts. The &quot;honk&quot; refers to the call of the male Canada goose, while the call refers to the female goose. The calls are similar, however, the is shorter and more high-pitched than the &quot;honk&quot; of males. When agitated or aggressively defending territory, Canada geese will typically initiate an encounter with a high-pitched hiss. Canada geese communicate with ten different vocalizations, each in response to a different situation confronting them.

==Distribution and habitat==


This species is native to North America. It breeds in Canada and the northern United States in a wide range of habitats. The Great Lakes region maintains a large population of Canada geese. Canada geese live year-round in the southern part of their breeding range, including the northern half of the United States&#x27; eastern seaboard and Pacific Coast, and areas in between. Between California and South Carolina in the southern United States and in northern Mexico, Canada geese are mainly present as migrants from further north during the winter.

By the early 20th century, overhunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had resulted in a serious decline in the numbers of this bird in its native range. The giant Canada goose subspecies was believed to be extinct in the 1950s until, in 1962, a small flock was discovered wintering in Rochester, Minnesota, by Harold Hanson of the Illinois Natural History Survey. 

In 1964, the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center was built near Jamestown, North Dakota. Its first director, Harvey K. Nelson, talked Forrest Lee into leaving Minnesota to head the center&#x27;s Canada goose production and restoration program. Forrest soon had 64 pens with 64 breeding pairs of screened, high-quality birds. The project involved private, state, and federal resources and relied on the expertise and cooperation of many individuals. By the end of 1981, more than 6,000 giant Canada geese had been released at 83 sites in 26 counties in North Dakota.

In recent years, Canada goose populations in some areas have grown substantially, so much so that many consider them pests for their droppings, bacteria in their droppings, noise, and confrontational behavior. This problem is partially due to the removal of natural predators and an abundance of safe, human-made bodies of water near food sources, such as those found on golf courses, in public parks and beaches, on sports fields, and in planned communities. Due in part to the interbreeding of various migratory subspecies with the introduced non-migratory giant subspecies, Canada geese are frequently a year-round feature of such urban environments.

Contrary to its normal migration routine, large flocks of Canada geese have established permanent residence along the Pacific coast of North America from British Columbia&#x27;s Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island area south to the San Francisco Bay area of Northern California. There are also resident Atlantic coast populations, such as on Chesapeake Bay, in Virginia&#x27;s James River regions, and in the Triangle area of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill), and nearby Hillsborough. Some Canada geese have taken up permanent residence as far south as Florida, in places such as retention ponds in apartment complexes. In 2015, the Ohio population of Canada geese was reported as roughly 130,000, with the number likely to continue increasing. Many of the geese, previously migratory, reportedly had become native, remaining in the state even in the summer. The increase was attributed to a lack of natural predators, an abundance of water, and plentiful grass in manicured lawns in urban areas. 

Canada geese were eliminated in Ohio following the American Civil War but were reintroduced in 1956 with 10 pairs. The population was estimated at 18,000 in 1979. The geese are considered protected, though a hunting season is allowed from September 1–15, with a daily bag limit of five. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources recommends several non-lethal scare and hazing tactics for nuisance geese, but if such methods have been used without success, they may issue a permit which can be used from March 11 through August 31 to destroy nests, conduct a goose roundup or exterminate geese.

===Outside North America===

====Eurasia====

Canada geese have reached Northern Europe naturally, as has been proved by ringing recoveries. The birds include those of the subspecies &quot;B. c. parvipes&quot;, and possibly others. These geese are also found naturally on the Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Siberia, and eastern China.

Canada geese have also been introduced in Europe in the early 17th century by explorer Samuel de Champlain who sent several pairs of geese to France as a present for King Louis XIII. The geese were first introduced in Great Britain in the late 17th century as an addition to King James II&#x27;s waterfowl collection in St. James&#x27;s Park. By the middle of the 18th century, the Canada geese have established populations in France and Great Britain, but also in Ireland. They were also introduced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Scandinavia, and Finland in the 20th Century, starting in Sweden in 1929. Most European populations are not migratory, but those in more northerly parts of Sweden and Finland migrate to the North Sea and Baltic coasts. 

Semi-tame feral birds are common in parks, and have become a pest in some areas. In Great Britain, they were spread by hunters, but remained uncommon until the mid-20th century. Their population grew from 2,200 to 4,000 birds in 1953 to an estimated 82,000 in 1999, as changing agricultural practices and urban growth provided new habitat, with an estimated 165,000 wintering individuals in 2017. An attempt to translocate breeding pairs away from agricultural zones in the 50s and 60s backfired, causing establishment of new subpopulations and an overall population explosion. European birds are mostly descended from the nominate subspecies &quot;B. c. canadensis&quot;, likely with some contributions from the subspecies &quot;B. c. maxima&quot;.

====New Zealand====
Canada geese were introduced as a game bird into New Zealand in 1905. They have become a problem in some areas by fouling pastures and damaging crops. They were protected under the Wildlife Act 1953 and the population was managed by Fish and Game New Zealand, which culled excessive bird numbers. In 2011, the government removed the protection status, allowing anyone to kill the birds.

==Behavior==

Like most geese, the Canada goose is naturally migratory with the wintering range being most of the United States. The calls overhead from large groups of Canada geese flying in a V-shaped formation signal the transitions into spring and autumn. In some areas, migration routes have changed due to changes in habitat and food sources. In mild climates from southwestern British Columbia to California to the Great Lakes, some of the population has become nonmigratory due to adequate winter food supply and a lack of former predators.

Males exhibit agonistic behavior both on and off breeding and nesting grounds. This behavior rarely involves interspecific killing. One documented case involved a male defending his nest from a brant that wandered into the area; the following attack lasted for one hour until the death of the brant. The cause of death was suffocation or drowning in mud as a direct result of the Canada goose&#x27;s pecking the head of the brant into the mud. Researchers attributed it to high hormone levels and the brant&#x27;s inability to leave the nesting area.

===Diet===
Canada geese are primarily herbivores, although they sometimes eat small insects and fish. Their diet includes green vegetation and grains. The Canada goose eats a variety of grasses when on land. It feeds by grasping a blade of grass with the bill, then tearing it with a jerk of the head. The Canada goose also eats beans and grains such as wheat, rice, and corn when they are available. In the water, it feeds from aquatic plants by sliding its bill at the bottom of the body of water. It also feeds on aquatic plant-like algae, such as seaweed.

In urban areas, it is also known to pick food out of garbage bins. They are also sometimes hand-fed a variety of grains and other foods by humans in parks. Canada geese prefer lawn grass in urban areas. They usually graze in open areas with wide clearance to avoid potential predators.

===Reproduction===
During the second year of their lives, Canada geese find a mate. They are monogamous, and most couples stay together all of their lives. If one dies, the other may find a new mate. The female lays from two to nine eggs with an average of five, and both parents protect the nest while the eggs incubate, but the female spends more time at the nest than the male.

Its nest is usually located in an elevated area near water such as streams, lakes, ponds, and sometimes on a beaver lodge. Its eggs are laid in a shallow depression lined with plant material and down.

The incubation period, in which the female incubates while the male remains nearby, lasts for 24–32 days after laying. Canada geese can respond to external climatic factors by adjusting their laying date to spring maximum temperatures, which may benefit their nesting success.
As the annual summer molt also takes place during the breeding season, the adults lose their flight feathers for 20–40 days, regaining flight about the same time as their goslings start to fly.

As soon as the goslings hatch, they are immediately capable of walking, swimming, and finding their own food (a diet similar to that of adult geese). Parents are often seen leading their goslings in a line, usually with one adult at the front and the other at the back. While protecting their goslings, parents often violently chase away nearby creatures, from small blackbirds to lone humans who approach: first giving a warning hiss, and then attacking with bites and slaps of the wings. Although parents are hostile to unfamiliar geese, they may form groups of a number of goslings and a few adults, called crèches.

The offspring enter the fledgling stage any time from six to nine weeks of age. They do not leave their parents until after the spring migration, when they return to their birthplace.

===Migration===

Canada geese are known for their seasonal migrations. Most Canada geese have staging or resting areas where they join up with others. Their autumn migration can be seen from September to the beginning of November. The early migrants have a tendency to spend less time at rest stops and go through the migration much faster. The later birds usually spend more time at rest stops. Some geese return to the same nesting ground year after year and lay eggs with their mate, raising them in the same way each year. This is recorded from the many tagged geese which frequent the East Coast.

Canada geese fly in a distinctive V-shaped flight formation, with an altitude of 1 km (3,000 feet) for migration flight. The maximum flight ceiling of Canada geese is unknown, but they have been reported at 9 km (29,000 feet).

Flying in the V formation has been the subject of study by researchers. The front position is rotated since flying in front consumes the most energy. Canada geese leave the winter grounds more quickly than the summer grounds. Elevated thyroid hormones, such as T3 and T4, have been measured in geese just after a big migration. This is believed because of the long days of flying in migration the thyroid gland sends out more T4 which help the body cope with the longer journey. The increased T4 levels are also associated with increased muscle mass (hypertrophy) of the breast muscle, also because of the longer time spent flying. It is believed that the body sends out more T4 to help the goose&#x27;s body with this long task by speeding up the metabolism and lowering the temperature at which the muscles work. Also, other studies show levels of stress hormones such as corticosterone rise dramatically in these birds during and after a migration.

==Survival==
The lifespan in the wild of geese who survive to adulthood ranges from 10 to 24 years. The British longevity record is held by a specimen tagged as a nestling, which was observed alive at the University of York at the age of 31. In order to survive the extreme winter temperatures, the geese prefer to stay in urban areas rather than in green spaces since industrial areas retain heat.

===Predators===
Known predators of eggs and goslings include coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), Arctic foxes (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;), northern raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), large gulls (&quot;Larus&quot; species), common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), American crows (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;), carrion crows (in Europe, &quot;Corvus corone&quot;) and both brown (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) and American black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;). Geese and their goslings are occasionally preyed upon by domestic dogs—these occurrences can be prevented by leashing a pet dog.

Once they reach adulthood, due to their large size and often aggressive behavior, Canada geese are rarely preyed on, although prior injury may make them more vulnerable to natural predators. Beyond humans, adults can be taken by coyotes and grey wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;). Avian predators that are known to kill adults, as well as young geese, include snowy owls (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;), golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) and bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) and, though rarely on large adult geese, great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), northern goshawks (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), and gyrfalcons (&quot;Falco rusticolus&quot;). 

Adult geese are quite vigorous at displacing potential predators from the nest site, with predator prevention usually falling to the larger male of the pair. Males usually attempt to draw attention of approaching predators and toll (mob terrestrial predators without physical contact) often in accompaniment with males of other goose species. Eagles frequently cause geese to fly off &quot;en masse&quot; from some distance, though in other instances, geese may seem unconcerned at perched bald eagles nearby, seemingly only reacting if the eagle is displaying active hunting behavior. Canada geese are quite wary of humans where they are regularly hunted and killed, but can otherwise become habituated to fearlessness toward humans, especially where they are fed by them. This often leads to the geese becoming overly aggressive toward humans, and large groups of the birds may be considered a nuisance if they are causing persistent problems to humans and other animals in the surrounding area.

===Salinity===
Salinity plays a role in the growth and development of goslings. Moderate to high salinity concentrations without fresh water results in slower development, growth, and saline-induced mortality. Goslings are susceptible to saline-induced mortality before their nasal salt glands become functional; the majority of such deaths occur before the sixth day of life.

===Disease===
Canada geese are susceptible to avian bird flus, such as H5N1. A study carried out using the HPAI virus, a H5N1 virus, found that the geese were susceptible to the virus. This proved useful for monitoring the spread of the virus through the high mortality of infected birds. Prior exposure to other viruses may result in some resistance to H5N1.

==Relationship with humans==

The Canada goose is considered part of the Canadian national identity.

In North America, nonmigratory Canada goose populations have been on the rise. The species is frequently found on golf courses, parking lots, and urban parks, which would have previously hosted only migratory geese on rare occasions. Owing to its adaptability to human-altered areas, it has become one of the most common waterfowl species in North America. In many areas, nonmigratory Canada geese are now regarded as pests by humans. They are suspected of being a cause of an increase in high fecal coliforms at beaches. An extended hunting season, deploying noise makers, and hazing by dogs have been used in an attempt to disrupt suspect flocks. A goal of conservationists has been to focus hunting on the nonmigratory populations (which tend to be larger and more of a nuisance) as opposed to migratory flocks showing natural behavior, which may be rarer.

Since 1999, the United States Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services agency has been engaged in lethal culls of Canada geese primarily in urban or densely populated areas. The agency responds to municipalities or private land owners, such as golf courses, which find the geese obtrusive or object to their waste. Addling goose eggs and destroying nests are promoted as humane population control methods. Flocks of Canada geese can also be captured during molt and this method of culling is used to control invasive populations.

Canada geese are protected from hunting and capture outside of designated hunting seasons in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and in Canada under the Migratory Birds Convention Act. In both countries, commercial transactions such as buying or trading are mostly prohibited and the possession, hunting, and interfering with the activity of the animals are subject to restrictions. In the UK, as with native bird species, the nests and eggs of Canada geese are fully protected by law, except when their removal has been specifically licensed, and shooting is generally permitted only during the defined open season.
Geese have a tendency to attack humans when they feel themselves or their goslings to be threatened. First, the geese stand erect, spread their wings, and produce a hissing sound. Next, the geese charge. They may then peck or attack with their wings.

===Aircraft strikes===

Canada geese have been implicated in a number of bird strikes by aircraft. Their large size and tendency to fly in flocks may exacerbate their impact. In the United States, the Canada goose is the second-most damaging bird strike to airplanes, with the most damaging being turkey vultures. Canada geese can cause fatal crashes when they strike an aircraft&#x27;s engine. The FAA has reported 1,772 known civil aircraft strikes within the United States between 1990 and 2018. The total cost of these bird strikes to general and commercial aviation has been reported to exceed $130 million.

In 1995, a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry aircraft at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, struck a flock of Canada geese on takeoff, losing power in both port side engines. It crashed from the runway, killing all 24 crew members. The accident sparked efforts to avoid such events, including habitat modification, aversion tactics, herding and relocation, and culling of flocks. In 2009, a collision with a flock of migratory Canada geese resulted in US Airways Flight 1549 suffering a total loss of power from both engines after takeoff, forcing the crew of the aircraft to ditch the plane in the Hudson River with no loss of human life.

===Cuisine===
As a large, common wild bird, the Canada goose is a common target of hunters, especially in its native range. Drake Larsen, a researcher in sustainable agriculture at Iowa State University, described them to &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine as &quot;so yummy ...good, lean, rich meat. I find they are similar to a good cut of beef.&quot; The British Trust for Ornithology, however, has described them as &quot;reputedly amongst the most inedible of birds.&quot; The U.S. goose harvest for 2013–14 reported over 1.3 million geese taken.
Canada geese are rarely farmed, and sale of wild Canada goose meat is rare due to regulation and slaughterhouses&#x27; lack of experience with wild birds. Geese in New York City parks culled by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection have been donated to food banks in Pennsylvania.

==Population==
In 2000, the North American population of the geese was estimated to be between 4 million and 5 million birds. A 20-year study from 1983 to 2003 in Wichita, Kansas, found the size of the winter Canada goose population within the city limits increased from 1,600 to over 18,000 birds.

<text>In UNIX computing, the system load is a measure of the amount of computational work that a computer system performs. The load average represents the average system load over a period of time. It conventionally appears in the form of three numbers which represent the system load during the last one-, five-, and fifteen-minute periods.

== Unix-style load calculation ==
All Unix and Unix-like systems generate a dimensionless metric of three &quot;load average&quot; numbers in the kernel. Users can easily query the current result from a Unix shell by running the codice_1 command:

$ uptime
 14:34:03 up 10:43, 4 users, load average: 0.06, 0.11, 0.09

The codice_2 and codice_3 commands show the same three load average numbers, as do a range of graphical user interface utilities. 

In operating systems based on the Linux kernel, this information can be easily accessed by reading the codice_4 file.

To explore this kind of information in depth, according to the Linux&#x27;s Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, architecture-dependent information are exposed on the file codice_5.

An idle computer has a load number of 0 (the idle process is not counted). Each process using or waiting for CPU (the &quot;ready queue&quot; or run queue) increments the load number by 1. Each process that terminates decrements it by 1. Most UNIX systems count only processes in the &quot;running&quot; (on CPU) or &quot;runnable&quot; (waiting for CPU) states. However, Linux also includes processes in uninterruptible sleep states (usually waiting for disk activity), which can lead to markedly different results if many processes remain blocked in I/O due to a busy or stalled I/O system. This, for example, includes processes blocking due to an NFS server failure or too slow media (e.g., USB 1.x storage devices). Such circumstances can result in an elevated load average, which does not reflect an actual increase in CPU use (but still gives an idea of how long users have to wait).

Systems calculate the load &quot;average&quot; as the exponentially damped/weighted moving average of the load &quot;number&quot;. The three values of load average refer to the past one, five, and fifteen minutes of system operation.

Mathematically speaking, all three values always average all the system load since the system started up. They all decay exponentially, but they decay at different &quot;speeds&quot;: they decay exponentially by &quot;e&quot; after 1, 5, and 15 minutes respectively. Hence, the 1-minute load average consists of 63% (more precisely: 1 - 1/&quot;e&quot;) of the load from the last minute and 37% (1/&quot;e&quot;) of the average load since start up, excluding the last minute. For the 5- and 15-minute load averages, the same 63%/37% ratio is computed over 5 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. Therefore, it is not technically accurate that the 1-minute load average only includes the last 60 seconds of activity, as it includes 37% of the activity from the past, but it is correct to state that it includes &quot;mostly&quot; the last minute.

=== Interpretation ===
For single-CPU systems that are CPU bound, one can think of load average as a measure of system utilization during the respective time period. For systems with multiple CPUs, one must divide the load by the number of processors in order to get a comparable measure.

For example, one can interpret a load average of &quot;1.73 0.60 7.98&quot; on a single-CPU system as:

* During the last minute, the system was overloaded by 73% on average (1.73 runnable processes, so that 0.73 processes had to wait for a turn for a single CPU system on average).
* During the last 5 minutes, the CPU was idling 40% of the time, on average.
* During the last 15 minutes, the system was overloaded 698% on average (7.98 runnable processes, so that 6.98 processes had to wait for a turn for a single CPU system on average).

This means that this system (CPU, disk, memory, etc.) could have handled all the work scheduled for the last minute if it were 1.73 times as fast.

In a system with four CPUs, a load average of 3.73 would indicate that there were, on average, 3.73 processes ready to run, and each one could be scheduled into a CPU.

On modern UNIX systems, the treatment of threading with respect to load averages varies. Some systems treat threads as processes for the purposes of load average calculation: each thread waiting to run will add 1 to the load. However, other systems, especially systems implementing so-called M:N threading, use different strategies such as counting the process exactly once for the purpose of load (regardless of the number of threads), or counting only threads currently exposed by the user-thread scheduler to the kernel, which may depend on the level of concurrency set on the process. Linux appears to count each thread separately as adding 1 to the load.

== CPU load vis-à-vis CPU utilization ==
The comparative study of different load indices carried out by Ferrari et al. reported that CPU load information based upon the CPU queue length does much better in load balancing compared to CPU utilization. The reason CPU queue length did better is probably because when a host is heavily loaded, its CPU utilization is likely to be close to 100%, and it is unable to reflect the exact load level of the utilization. In contrast, CPU queue lengths can directly reflect the amount of load on a CPU. As an example, two systems, one with 3 and the other with 6 processes in the queue, are both very likely to have utilizations close to 100%, although they obviously differ.

== Reckoning CPU load ==
On Linux systems, the load-average is not calculated on each clock tick, but driven by a variable value that is based on the HZ frequency setting and tested on each clock tick. This setting defines the kernel clock tick rate in Hertz (times per second), and it defaults to 100 for 10ms ticks. Kernel activities use this number of ticks to time themselves. Specifically, the timer.c::calc_load() function, which calculates the load average, runs every ticks, or about every five seconds:
unsigned long avenrun[3];

static inline void calc_load(unsigned long ticks)
 unsigned long active_tasks; /* fixed-point */
 static int count = LOAD_FREQ;

 count -= ticks;
 if (count &lt; 0) {
 count += LOAD_FREQ;
 active_tasks = count_active_tasks();
 CALC_LOAD(avenrun[0], EXP_1, active_tasks);
 CALC_LOAD(avenrun[1], EXP_5, active_tasks);
 CALC_LOAD(avenrun[2], EXP_15, active_tasks);
}
The avenrun array contains 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute average. The macro and its associated values are defined in sched.h:
#define FSHIFT 11 /* nr of bits of precision */
#define FIXED_1 (1«FSHIFT) /* 1.0 as fixed-point */
#define LOAD_FREQ (5*HZ+1) /* 5 sec intervals */
#define EXP_1 1884 /* 1/exp(5sec/1min) as fixed-point */
#define EXP_5 2014 /* 1/exp(5sec/5min) */
#define EXP_15 2037 /* 1/exp(5sec/15min) */

#define CALC_LOAD(load,exp,n) \
 load *= exp; \
 load += n*(FIXED_1-exp); \
 load »= FSHIFT;
The &quot;sampled&quot; calculation of load averages is a somewhat common behavior; FreeBSD, too, only refreshes the value every five seconds. The interval is usually taken to not be exact so that they do not collect processes that are scheduled to fire at a certain moment.

A post on the Linux mailing list considers its tick insufficient to avoid Moire artifacts from such collection, and suggests an interval of 4.61 seconds instead. This change is common among Android system kernels, although the exact expression used assumes an HZ of 100.

==Other system performance commands==
Other commands for assessing system performance include:
* codice_1 the system reliability and load average
* codice_7 for an overall system view
* codice_8 vmstat reports information about runnable or blocked processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU.
* codice_9 interactive process viewer
* codice_10 (formerly codice_11), codice_12 helps correlate all existing resource data for processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU activity.

<text>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), officially known as the City of Los Angeles Police Department, is the primary law enforcement agency of Los Angeles, California, United States. With 8,832 officers and 3,000 civilian staff, it is the third-largest municipal police department in the United States, after the New York City Police Department and the Chicago Police Department.

The LAPD is headquartered at 100 West 1st Street in the Civic Center district. The department&#x27;s organization and resources are complex, including 21 community stations (divisions) grouped in four bureaus under the Office of Operations; multiple divisions within the Detective Bureau under the Office of Special Operations; and specialized units such as the Metropolitan Division, Air Support Division, and Major Crimes Division under the Counterterrorism &amp; Special Operations Bureau. 

Independent investigative commissions have documented a history of police brutality, corruption, misconduct and discriminatory policing within the LAPD. In 2001, the United States Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with the LAPD regarding systemic civil rights violations and lack of accountability that stretched back decades; following major reforms, the decree was lifted in 2013.

== History ==
The first police force specific to Los Angeles was founded in 1853 as the Los Angeles Rangers, a volunteer force that assisted the existing Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD). The Rangers were soon succeeded by another volunteer force, the Los Angeles City Guards. Neither the Rangers nor the Guards were particularly efficient, and Los Angeles became known for its violence, gambling, and vice.

The first paid force was created in 1869 when six officers were hired to serve under City Marshal William C. Warren. By 1900, under John M. Glass, there were 70 officers, one for every 1,500 people. In 1903, with the start of the Civil Service, this force was increased to 200. In 1910, LAPD Officer Alice Stebbins Wells became the first sworn female police officer in the United States. Officer Georgia Ann Robinson, hired in 1916, was the first African-American female police officer.

Severe corruption issues within the LAPD and the rest of the city government lasted until the 1940s. In 1933, the Reserve Unit was formed, tasked with crime suppression; it would later evolve into the Metropolitan Division. In 1946, the top-secret Gangster Squad was formed to combat the American Mafia and Los Angeles crime family. During World War II, under Clemence B. Horrall, the overall number of personnel was depleted by the demands of the military. Despite efforts to maintain numbers, the police could do little to control the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots. Horrall was replaced by retired United States Marine Corps general William A. Worton, who acted as interim chief until 1950, when William H. Parker succeeded him, serving until he died in 1966. Parker advocated police professionalism and autonomy from civilian administration. However, the Bloody Christmas scandal in 1951 led to calls for civilian accountability and an end to alleged police brutality. In 1965, under Parker, Officer John Nelson and then-Inspector Daryl Gates established the Metropolitan Division&#x27;s Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) unit, the first such unit in American law enforcement, as well as the Special Investigation Section, a highly-secretive tactical stakeout unit. That same year, the Watts riots were sparked by police abuse.

In the 1970s and 1980s, street gangs became a growing issue in Los Angeles; in response, the LAPD established the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) gang intelligence unit in 1979, conducting Operation Hammer in 1987. In the 1990s, corruption, and misconduct within the LAPD were revealed to the public: the 1991 Rodney King beating led to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, while the 1997 Rampart scandal led to the disbandment of CRASH. Also in 1997, outgunned LAPD officers in North Hollywood were locked into a lengthy shootout with heavily armed and armored bank robbers, prompting police armament upgrades across the United States. Throughout its existence, the LAPD absorbed numerous smaller police forces in Greater Los Angeles, including the LACMTA Police in 1997 and the Los Angeles General Services Police in 2012. The LAPD has made several attempts to absorb the Los Angeles Airport Police and Los Angeles Park Ranger Division, though all attempts failed or did not proceed, and no mergers have been made since 2012.

== Organization ==

The Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, also known as the Police Commission, is a five-member civilian body that oversees the LAPD. The Chief of Police reports to the board and the rest of the department reports to the chief.

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is an independent part of the LAPD that has oversight over the department&#x27;s internal disciplinary process and reviews complaints of officer misconduct. It was created by the recommendation of the Christopher Commission and it is exempt from civil service and reports directly to the Board of Police Commissioners. The current Inspector General is Mark P. Smith, who was formerly the Constitutional Policing Advisor for the LASD. The OIG receives copies of every complaint filed against members of the LAPD as well as tracking specific cases along with any resultant litigation. The OIG also conducts audits on select investigations and conducts regular reviews of the disciplinary system to ensure fairness and equality. As well as overseeing the LAPD&#x27;s disciplinary process, the Inspector General may undertake special investigations as directed by the Board of Police Commissioners.

The LAPD&#x27;s Art Theft Detail &quot;is the only full-time municipal law enforcement unit in the United States devoted to the investigation of art crimes.&quot; The longtime head and often sole member of the unit is Detective Don Hrycyk, who in 2014 was described as being a 40-year veteran of the department with twenty years as the only known full-time art detective in the United States. According to the LAPD, the unit has recovered over $121 million in stolen works since 1993. The Art Theft Detail is part of the Burglary Special Section of the Detective Bureau of the LAPD. The LAPD Cadet Program is the department&#x27;s police explorer program. The program was formerly called the Explorer Program but was changed in 2009 after the police commission broke off its partnership with the Boy scouts over policies barring homosexuals, atheists, and agnostics from being troop leaders. The cadet program shifted focus from an old explorer program that tried to guide members to a career in law enforcement, to a program that tries to give cadets a solid foundation in life and to help them prepare for careers by offering services such as tutoring and college scholarships. The cadets complete courses not only on law enforcement but also on citizenship, leadership, financial literacy and other different skill sets. Cadet&#x27;s work positions include ride-alongs, crowd control, charity assistance, and working in stations. The cadet program has posts at all of the LAPD&#x27;s regional divisions as well as specialized divisions including the Metropolitan Division and the Communications Division. As of 2014, there were 5,000 cadets.

=== Office of the Chief ===
The Office of the Chief of Police has the responsibility of assisting the Chief of Police in the administration of the department. This includes the Chief of Staff, Public Communications, and Employee Relations, as well as the Community Safety Partnership Bureau. The Director of the Office of Constitutional Policing and Policy, currently Police Administrator III Lizabeth Rhodes, reports directly to the Office of the Chief. This office was created as a result of the Department of Justice&#x27;s federal consent decree. It develops the LAPD&#x27;s policies and procedures, conducts internal auditing and programs to ensure compliance, handles litigation, forms and ensures compliance with the LAPD&#x27;s long-term strategic plan and risk management strategies, and coordinates local, state, and federal government and legislative matters.

=== Office of Operations ===
The majority of the LAPD&#x27;s approximately 10,000 officers are assigned within the Office of Operations, whose primary office is located in the new Police Administration Building. Headed by an Assistant Chief and the Assistant to the Director, who is a Commander, the office comprises four bureaus and 21 police stations, known officially as &quot;areas&quot; but also commonly referred to as &quot;divisions&quot;. The Office of Operations also has a dedicated Homeless Coordinator reporting directly to the Assistant Chief. The 21 police stations are grouped geographically into four command areas, each known as a &quot;bureau&quot;. The latest areas, &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Topanga&quot;, were added on January 4, 2009.

=== Office of Special Operations ===

The Office of Special Operations is an office that was created in 2010 by then-Chief Charlie Beck. Headed by an Assistant Chief, the office comprises the Detective Bureau, the Counterterrorism and Special Operations Bureau, the Transit Services Bureau, and the Strategic Planning Group. The Detective Bureau also houses the COMPSTAT (Computer Statistics) Division which maintains crime data. COMPSTAT is based on the NYPD CompStat unit that was created in 1994 by former LAPD Chief William Bratton, while he was still a NYPD Police Commissioner. He implemented the LAPD version on becoming Chief of Police in 2002. The Counterterrorism and Special Operations Bureau provides the Los Angeles Police Department specialized tactical resources in support of operations during daily field activities, unusual occurrences, and, especially, during serious disturbances and elevated terrorism threat conditions. It was created from the merger of the Counterterrorism and Criminal Intelligence Bureau with the Special Operations Bureau in 2010. The Transit Services Bureau supervises the Transit Services Group and the Traffic Group, responsible for overseeing the four Geographical Traffic Divisions.

== Headquarters==

Before 2009, LAPD headquarters was located at Parker Center, named after former chief William H. Parker, which stood at 150 N. Los Angeles St. in the Downtown Los Angeles Civic Center district. It was demolished in 2019.

The Police Administration Building, also known as the New Parker Center, replaced the original Parker Center in October 2009. It is located at 100 West 1st Street, also in the Civic Center, occupying the entire block between Main, Spring, 1st, and 2nd streets, immediately south of Los Angeles City Hall. Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; Mendenhall were the architects. The total cost of the new building complex including the data center, the Main Street Parking Structure, and the Aiso Public Parking Garage was $437 million. The main building is a across 10 floors, a café (&quot;LA Reflections&quot;), underground parking as well as a parking structure, racks for 50 bicycles, and a 400-seat civic auditorium. It is LEED-certified, uses energy-efficient mechanical systems, daylighting, high-performance glass, and recycled or renewable building materials. The perimeter is lined with green space. The complex provides space for about 2,300 workers, which let the department consolidate functions here which had been spread out across multiple locations.

==Ranks==
==Demographics==
Up to the Gates administration, the LAPD was predominantly white (80% in 1980), and many officers had resided outside the city limits. Simi Valley, the Ventura County suburb that later became infamous as the site of the state trial that immediately preceded the 1992 Los Angeles riots, has long been home to a large concentration of LAPD officers, most of them white. Hiring quotas began to change this during the 1980s, but it was not until the Christopher Commission reforms that substantial numbers of black, Hispanic, and Asian officers began to be hired onto the force. Minority officers can be found in both rank-and-file and leadership positions in virtually all divisions. In 1910 the LAPD hired the first female police officer with the power to arrest in the United States, Alice Stebbins Wells. LAPD&#x27;s first Latina officer, Josephine Serrano Collier, was hired in 1946. On the LAPD through the early 1970s, women were classified as &quot;policewomen&quot;. Through the 1950s, their duties generally consisted as working as matrons in the jail system or dealing with troubled youths working in detective assignments. Rarely did they work any field assignment, and they were not allowed to rise above the rank of sergeant. A lawsuit by a policewoman, Fanchon Blake, in the 1980s, instituted court-ordered mandates that the department begin actively hiring and promoting women police officers in its ranks. The department eliminated the rank of &quot;policeman&quot; from new hires at that time along with the rank of &quot;policewoman&quot;. Anyone already in those positions was grandfathered in, but new hires were classified instead as &quot;police officers&quot;, which continues to this day. In 2002, women made up 18.9% of the force. In 1886, the department hired its first two black officers, Robert William Stewart and Roy Green. The LAPD was one of the first two police departments in the country to hire an African-American woman officer, Georgia Ann Robinson in 1919. Despite this, the department was slow at integration. During the 1965 Watts riots, only 5 of the 205 police assigned to South Central Los Angeles were black, even though it was the largest black community in Los Angeles. Los Angeles&#x27; first black mayor, Tom Bradley was a former LAPD officer and quit the department after being unable to advance past the rank of lieutenant like other black police officers in the department. When Bradley was elected mayor in 1972, only 5% of LAPD officers were black and there was only one black captain in the department, Homer Broome. Broome would break down racial barriers on the force going on to become the first black officer to obtain the rank of commander and the first black station commander, leading the Southwest Division.

As of 2019, the LAPD had 10,008 sworn officers. Of these, 81% (8,158) were male and 19% (1,850) female. The racial/ethnic breakdown:
* 48.78% or 4,882 was Hispanic/Latino (of any race)
* 30.88% or 3,090 was non-Hispanic White
* 9.61% or 962 was African American
* 7.65% or 766 was Asian
* 2.46% or 246 was Filipino American
* 0.62% or 62 were Indian and Other Ethnicities

The LAPD has grown over the years in the number of officers who speak languages in addition to English. There were 483 bilingual or multilingual officers in 1974, 1,560 in 1998, and 2,500 in 2001 who spoke at least one of 32 languages. In 2001, a study was released that found that non-English-speaking callers to the 911 and non-emergency response lines often receive no language translation, often receive incomplete information, and sometimes receive rude responses from police employees. The issue of a lack of multilingual officers led to reforms including bonuses and salary increases for officers who are certified in second languages. Currently, over a third of LAPD officers are certified in speaking one or more languages other than English. The department also uses a device called the phraselator to translate and broadcast thousands of prerecorded phrases in a multitude of languages, commonly used to broadcast messages in different languages from police vehicles.

==Work environment and revenue==

LAPD patrol officers have a three-day 12-hour and four-day 10-hour workweek schedule. The department has over 250 types of job assignments, and each officer is eligible for such assignments after two years on patrol. LAPD patrol officers almost always work with a partner, unlike most suburban departments surrounding the City of Los Angeles, which deploy officers in one-officer units to maximize police presence and allow a smaller number of officers to patrol a larger area. The department&#x27;s training division has three facilities throughout the city, including the Los Angeles Police Academy (Elysian Park), Ahmanson Recruit Training Center (Westchester), and the Edward Davis Training Center (Granada Hills). From spring 2007 through the spring of 2009, recruits could earn money through sign-on bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $10,000. Those bonuses ended in 2009. Sign on bonuses were paid 1/2 after graduation from the academy, and 1/2 after completion of probation. $2,000 could be added for sign-ons from outside the Los Angeles area for housing arrangements. As of July 2009, recruits earned starting salaries of $56,522–61,095 depending on education level and began earning their full salary on their first day of academy training.

In January 2010, the starting base salary for incoming police officers was lowered by 20%. At the time If applicants had graduated from high school their starting salary would be $45,226, if they had at least 60 college units, with an overall GPA of 2.0 or better, their salary would start at $47,043, and if the applicant had fully completed a college degree, the salary would start at $48,880. In 2014, after negotiations between the city and the police officers union, an agreement on police officer pay that would give pay increases to nearly 1,000 officers who joined the department since the salaries for incoming officers were cut, was reached. The agreement also raised starting salaries for officers to $57,420 with an additional increase to $60,552 after six months which would become effective in the beginning of 2015. The agreement would also change the current overtime payment system from a deferred payment system, which was implemented to cut costs, to a pay-as-you-go overtime system as well as increase the overtime budget from $30 million to $70 million.

== Resources ==
=== Vehicles ===

The LAPD operates a wide variety of police cars, primarily the Ford Police Interceptor Utility, Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, and Dodge Charger, with limited numbers of the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, Chevrolet Impala, Dodge Challenger and Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban, among an assortment of other models. Police motorcycles are primarily the BMW R1200RT-P and Harley-Davidson FLHP. The LAPD SWAT&#x27;s primary vehicle is the Lenco BearCat.

In the early 1980s, the LAPD obtained two Cadillac Gage Commandos from the U.S. Department of Energy, in preparation for security for the city&#x27;s hosting of the 1984 Summer Olympics. They were used as battering rams to breach structures and buildings inhabited by hostile occupants. They saw action in the 1997 North Hollywood shootout, but have since been retired.

===Aviation===

The LAPD&#x27;s aircraft consists of 19 helicopters (&quot;airships&quot;)—5 Bell 206 Jet Rangers and 14 Eurocopter AS350-B2s—and 1 Beechcraft King Air 200. LAPD aircraft are operated by the LAPD Air Support Division. Main airship missions are flown out of Hooper Heliport, located near Union Station. The LAPD also houses air units at Van Nuys Airport.

=== Body-worn cameras===
Beginning in September 2013, the LAPD started a trial program for the use of body-worn cameras with 30 officers in the Skid Row area. Reports from the trial program indicated that the cameras functioned well and that they assisted in deescalating situations although there were some technical issues with the cameras along with slight issues with the cameras falling off of officers during movement. In November 2014, the LAPD chose Taser International as the vendor for body cameras to be used by officers after their trial program earlier in the year. On December 16, 2014, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the city would purchase 7,000 body worn cameras from Taser for use by the department. Patrol officers are now equipped with the cameras, and are required to use these devices while on assignment. 700 of the cameras were deployed to patrol officers in the Central, Mission and Newton patrol areas of the city beginning in January 2015. $1.55 million was raised from private donors to start the body camera program for the initial rollout phase in order to ease budget constraints for the city with another $1 million coming from the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Department of Justice. Before all of the cameras were deployed to patrol officers, the Police Commission created a policy that governs the use of the cameras and video footage while consulting with department and city officials along with outside organizations including other departments who already use body cameras. The commission has created a policy that officers would have to turn on the cameras whenever they arrest or detain someone for interrogation and that many public interactions such as domestic violence interviews would not be recorded. Prior to the rollout of any body worn cameras, officers were able to carry personally owned audio recording devices since 1994 if they filed an application and obtained the requisite permission.

===Firearms===
As of 2023, the LAPD issues the FN 509 MRD-LE and Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P to all new officers, alongside a variety of Glock, Kimber, Staccato, or Beretta pistols. Officers are also issued long guns, including the Remington 870 and Benelli M4 Super 90 shotguns, as well as Smith &amp; Wesson, Colt, or Bushmaster AR-15 rifles. LAPD possesses two M60 machine guns reserved for LAPD SWAT as a last resort or in case of &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; The LAPD also has riot guns capable of firing 37mm munitions and bean bag rounds.

The SWAT used the Kimber Custom TLE II as their sidearms in 2002, renaming it the Kimber LAPD SWAT Custom II. As of 2014, SWAT&#x27;s primary weapons were the Heckler &amp; Koch HK416, M4 carbine, and FN SCAR rifles; the Colt 9mm and HK MP5 submachine guns; the Armalite AR-10, Remington 700, Barrett M82, and M14 sniper rifles; and the Benelli M4 and Remington 870 shotguns. After World War II, the LAPD began to issue the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10. During the 1960s and 1970s the department issued the S&amp;W Model 15 Combat Masterpiece. These guns were modified to fire double-action only. Some specialized units (specifically Motor Officers) were issued the stainless-steel version, the Model 67. In the 1980s, LAPD patrol officers began to be issued the Beretta 92F and Smith &amp; Wesson Model 5906 semi-automatic 9mm pistols. Following the 1997 North Hollywood shootout, LAPD obtained M16 rifles and officers were given the option of carrying the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 4506 and 4566 service pistols. When William Bratton was Chief, he allowed officers to carry the Glock, the firearm carried in the two previous departments Bratton led (the New York City Police Department and the Boston Police Department).

== Awards and commendations ==
The department presents several medals to its members for meritorious service. The LAPD awards medals for bravery, service, unit citations, ribbons for assignment and time-specific service, and marksmanship.

* Medal of Valor

The LAPD Medal of Valor is the highest law enforcement medal awarded to officers by the Los Angeles Police Department. The Medal of Valor is an award for bravery, usually awarded to officers for individual acts of extraordinary heroism performed in the line of duty at extreme and life-threatening personal risk.

==Public opinion==
In a 2020 survey of Los Angeles residents, two-thirds said they believe the department is doing a good job maintaining public safety, while 88% supported community policing, 82% supported an unarmed response model, and 62% supported redirecting some money from the department to community initiatives. There were differences of opinion along racial lines, with three in five white and Asian residents and one in three black residents trusting the LAPD to &quot;do what is right&quot;.

== Controversies, corruption, misconducts and scandals==
Over the years, the Los Angeles Police Department has been the subject of several scandals, misconduct, and other controversies. According to one study, during the lengthy tenure of William H. Parker as police chief (1950–1966), the LAPD was &quot;outwardly racist&quot;, and the tenure of police chief Daryl Gates (1978–1992) was marked by &quot;scandalous racist violence&quot; among the LAPD. Following the Rampart Division CRASH scandal of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the United States Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with the LAPD regarding systemic civil rights violations and lack of accountability that stretched back decades, requiring major reforms. The consent decree was lifted in 2013. The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California stated that the decree &quot;accomplished its purpose by and large&quot; and that the department &quot;has made serious culture changes&quot;, but cautioned against backsliding and said there was more work to be done regarding racial disparities and treatment of the homeless.

===1920s–1940s===
Louis Oaks, chief of the LAPD in the early 1920s, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. James E. Davis served two terms as LAPD police chief, heading the department from 1926 to 1929 and from 1933 to 1938. During his first term as chief, Davis called for violence against criminals while leading a Prohibition vice squad, and the department was known for controversies including accusations of conspiracy, blackmail, and murder. Davis also formed a Red Squad to combat labor unions; headed by Capt. William F. Hynes, the squad arrested hundreds participating in strikes. In March 1928, Christine Collins reported her nine-year-old son, Walter, missing. Five months later a boy named Arthur Hutchins came forth claiming to be Walter; when Mrs. Collins told the police that the boy was not her son, she was committed to a mental institution under a Section 12 internment. It was later determined that Walter had fallen victim to a child rapist/murderer in the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, and Arthur Hutchins admitted that he had lied about his identity to meet his favorite actor, Tom Mix. The widely publicized case was depicted in the 2008 film &quot;Changeling&quot;.

When Frank L. Shaw was elected mayor in 1933, he reappointed Davis as police chief, and the LAPD––already considered &quot;nationally notorious&quot; for police corruption––entered a new phase of widespread criminal activity. In 1936, Davis sent members of the LAPD to California&#x27;s state borders, along Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon, to institute checkpoints blocking the entry of migrants, or &quot;okies&quot;. The police began raids and mass arrests of populations including the homeless and disabled; those taken in by police were given the option of leaving California or serving a 180-day jail term. The so-called &quot;bum blockade&quot; ended after significant negative publicity, including a suit filed by the ACLU in federal court.

By 1937, the LAPD was leading a vast intelligence operation wiretapping politicians, judges, and federal agents. Some records of police surveillance were taken under subpoena after Harry Raymond, a former officer investigating corruption in the force, was the victim of a car bomb. During the trial that followed, LAPD captain Earl Kynette was found guilty of Raymond&#x27;s attempted murder; Davis acknowledged that he had known Raymond was under police surveillance. In the late 1930s, the LAPD engaged in widespread racial profiling of Mexican Americans. The LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department used the 1942 &quot;Sleepy Lagoon murder&quot; of José Gallardo Díaz to justify a coordinated crackdown: the police identified primarily-Mexican American communities, cordoned them off with blockades, and carried out mass searches and arrests. The police detained hundreds of Mexican Americans before indicting 22 for murder. Twelve of the defendants were charged with murder and incarcerated; all convictions were later overturned. Members of the LAPD were accused of participating in anti-Mexican American violence during the Zoot Suit Riots that followed in 1943; despite the LAPD&#x27;s insistence that the riots were caused by Mexican American crime, there was broad consensus that the riots were the result of racial discrimination.

===1950s–1960s===
Parker, who served as chief of the LAPD from August 9, 1950, until his death on July 16, 1966, was frequently criticized for racist remarks, his refusal to acknowledge police brutality, and his demands that the police not be subject to the same laws as citizens; the last of these contributed to ongoing conflicts with the FBI, with the agency refusing to train LAPD officers until after Parker&#x27;s death. Parker adopted the rhetoric of Los Angeles as the &quot;white spot&quot; of America, first popularized by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Harry Chandler, and explicitly set it against the &quot;black picture&quot; of the nation. The Los Angeles City Council once confronted him with a recording in which he referred to Mexican Americans as not being far from &quot;the wild tribes of Mexico&quot;; in the 1960s, he claimed that &quot;by 1970, 45% of the metropolitan area of Los Angeles will be Negro&quot; and that the city should support a strong police force because &quot;if you don&#x27;t, come 1970, God help you&quot;; he described Black participants in the 1965 Watts riots as acting like &quot;monkeys in a zoo&quot;. The Los Angeles Police Department was not integrated until the 1960s.

Early in his tenure as police chief, Parker launched an extensive public relations campaign for the LAPD. In the 1950s, he was a credited consultant for police procedural drama &quot;Dragnet&quot;, even offering the show departmental support in providing case examples and fact-checking; he popularized the term &quot;thin blue line&quot; in both his speeches and in a TV show he conceived and produced for Los Angeles NBC network KNBC; he hired &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry as a speech writer; and he introduced the department&#x27;s first press office. These efforts were seen as tied to his efforts to curry public favor and extend the reach of officers of the LAPD.

Bloody Christmas was the name given to the severe beating of seven civilians under LAPD custody on December 25, 1951. The attacks, which left five Hispanic and two white young men with broken bones and ruptured organs, were only properly investigated after lobbying from the Mexican American community. The internal inquiry by Chief Parker resulted in eight police officers being indicted for the assaults, 54 being transferred, and 39 suspended. In 1962, the controversial LAPD shooting of seven unarmed members of the Nation of Islam resulted in the death of Ronald Stokes, and led to protests of the LAPD led by Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam.

===1970s–1980s===
In the 1970s and into the 1980s &quot;biased policing&quot;, also known as racial profiling, was commonplace in the department. This policing alienated the department from minority residents and gained the department a reputation of abuse of power and bias against minority residents. A major controversy erupted in 1979 over the shooting of Eula Love by two LAPD officers; no legal consequences befell the officers responsible.

Early in his tenure as Chief of Police, Daryl Gates re-instituted the use of the chokehold (placing an arm or flashlight over someone&#x27;s throat) to subdue suspects. In 1982, this technique was used and led to the death of James Mincey Jr. Following Mincey&#x27;s death, the Police Commission barred the use of chokeholds by officers unless in a life-threatening situation. An investigation found that sixteen people had died after being restrained by police chokeholds. In 1986, Officer Stephanie Lazarus killed her ex-boyfriend&#x27;s new wife. Despite the victim&#x27;s father&#x27;s insistence that Lazarus should be a suspect in the homicide, she was not considered by the police and the case went cold. In the 2000s, detectives revisiting cold cases deduced that Stephanie was a suspect. DNA evidence led to her arrest and conviction.

Also in 1986, the department purchased a 14-ton armored breaching vehicle, used to smash quickly through the walls of houses of suspects. The ACLU questioned the constitutionality of the vehicle, and the California Appellate Court later ruled the vehicle was unconstitutional, violating lawful search and seizure. In 1988, African American baseball sportscaster and retired Baseball Hall of Fame player Joe Morgan was detained at Los Angeles International Airport by LAPD and L.A. Airport Police officers after being falsely identified as a drug dealer. He was released when the LAPD realized their mistake. The city cleared the detective of wrongdoing, but Morgan subsequently filed a civil suit against both the LAPD and the city for the unlawful detention; the lawsuit was settled in 1993, and Morgan was awarded $800,000 by the Los Angeles City Council.

On August 1, 1988, as part of Chief Gates&#x27; &quot;Operation Hammer&quot; directed against gangs, SWAT teams raided four apartments at 39th Street and Dalton Avenue. According to an investigation by the department&#x27;s Internal Affairs, the team leader, Captain Thomas Elfmont, directed his men to &quot;hit&quot; the apartments &quot;hard&quot;, to &quot;level&quot; them, and to leave them &quot;uninhabitable&quot;. The police detained 37 people, making seven arrests. They found six ounces of marijuana and a small amount of cocaine. The seven were beaten by the police and at the police station forced to whistle the theme to &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Those who refused to comply were beaten again. Nobody was charged with a crime. The city paid four million dollars to settle the matter.

On September 4, 1988, LAPD officers raided the home of Roger Guydon looking for drugs. They found nothing. In 1991, Guydon won a $760,000 lawsuit against the city.

===1990s–2000s: Rodney King, LA riots, consent decree ===

In April 1991, the Christopher Commission was formed in the wake of the Rodney King beating, by the then-mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley. It was chaired by attorney Warren Christopher and was created to examine the structure and operation of the LAPD. The commission found that there were a significant number of LAPD officers who used excessive force and that the disciplinary structure was weak and ineffective. Fewer than a third of the suggested reforms were put into place.

To reduce drive-by shootings, LAPD initiated Operation Cul-de-Sac in 1991. This consisted of installing barriers on residential streets to block vehicle traffic. As a result, homicides and assaults were greatly reduced. The program ended after two years, with violent crime rates returning to their previous levels.

On July 1, 1992, John Daniels Jr., 36, a tow truck driver, was fatally shot by LAPD Officer Douglas Iversen as he was driving away from a service station in South Central. Iversen was charged with second-degree murder, the first officer to ever be charged with murder for an on-duty shooting. Two separate juries were deadlocked on the charge with 20 out of 24 voting for acquittal of all charges. The case was dismissed by a judge. Daniels&#x27; family received a $1.2 million settlement after filing a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles.


The Los Angeles riots of 1992, also known as the Rodney King uprising or the Rodney King riots, began on April 29, 1992, when a jury acquitted four LAPD police officers accused in the videotaped beating of Rodney King following a high-speed car pursuit on March 3, 1991. After seven days of jury deliberations, the jury acquitted all four officers of assault and acquitted three of the four of using excessive force. The evening after the verdict, thousands of people in the Los Angeles area rioted for over six days following the verdict. Widespread looting, assault, arson, and murder occurred, and property damages totaled one billion dollars. In all, 53 people died during the riots.

On October 12, 1996, LAPD Officers Rafael Pérez and Nino Durden entered the apartment of Javier Ovando. They shot Ovando in the back, paralyzing him from the waist down. They then planted a gun on the unarmed Ovando to make it appear he had attacked them. The two officers then perjured themselves. Ovando was sentenced to 23 years in custody based on their testimony. Later, one of the officers admitted his crime. Ovando was released, and in 2000, was paid $15 million for his injuries and imprisonment. The officers&#x27; actions led to the exposure of the Rampart scandal. By 2001, the resulting investigations would lead to more than 75 officers being investigated or charged, and over 100 criminal cases being overturned, due to perjury or other forms of misconduct, much based on the plea-bargain testimony of Perez.

Following the Rampart scandal, the United States Department of Justice entered into a consent decree with the LAPD regarding systemic civil rights violations and lack of accountability that stretched back decades. Many in the LAPD resisted federal oversight and proposed reforms but entered into a consent decree when the DOJ threatened to sue the city and take complete control over the LAPD. Mayor Richard J. Riordan and the Los Angeles city council agreed to the terms of the decree on November 2, 2000. The federal judge formally entered the decree into law on June 15, 2001. To promote civil rights integrity, the legally binding decree emphasized several areas, including management and supervisory measures, revising critical incident procedures, documentation, investigation and review, revising the management of gang units, revising the management of confidential informants, program development for response to persons with mental illness, improving training, increased integrity audits, increasing the operations of the Police Commission and the Inspector General, and increasing community outreach and public information.

Other provisions in the decree called for divisions to investigate all use of force (now known as Force Investigative Division) and conduct audits department-wide; the development of a risk management system; the creation of a field data capture system to track the race, ethnicity or national origin of the motorists and pedestrians stopped by the department; the creation of an Ethics Enforcement Section within the Internal Affairs Group; the transfer of investigative authority to Internal Affairs of all serious personnel complaint investigations; a nationwide study by an independent consultant on law enforcement dealing with the mentally ill, to help the department refine its system; a study by an independent consultant of the department&#x27;s training programs; and the creation of an informant manual and database.

The Consent Decree Bureau was the LAPD bureau charged with overseeing this process. Until 2009, the commanding officer of the Consent Decree Bureau, a civilian appointed by the chief of police, was Police Administrator Gerald L. Chaleff. In 2006, the consent decree was extended by six years, as U.S. District Court Judge Gary Feess found that the LAPD had not implemented the reforms that it had committed to. The federal oversight of the LAPD was lifted in 2013. On July 10, 2005, while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine, Jose Pena took his 19-month-old daughter, Suzie, hostage in his home. After police arrived, Pena threatened to kill her and himself after firing at others earlier. SWAT officers were called in. After negotiations to try and release Pena&#x27;s daughter were unsuccessful, four SWAT officers entered the home and, during a gunfight, both Mr. Pena and his infant daughter were shot and killed by SWAT team members. One officer was shot and wounded by Pena. Suzie Pena&#x27;s death was the first death of a hostage ever in LAPD SWAT history and the LAPD was criticized for their actions. An independent board of inquiry later cleared the SWAT officers of any wrongdoing. A judge later dismissed a lawsuit by the mother of Suzie Pena because the officers acted reasonably in the case and no negligence was involved.

In 2003, the LAPD arrested Juan Catalan after a 16-year-old girl was shot dead. Catalan was sentenced to death after a witness stated that he looked like the killer. Catalan turned out to be innocent; it was footage shot for the sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm which showed him at Dodger Stadium, showing him watching a baseball game with his family, that exonerated him.

On May Day, 2007, immigrant rights groups held rallies in MacArthur Park in support of undocumented immigrants. The rallies were permitted and initially, the protesters followed the terms of the permits but some of the protesters began blocking the street. After warnings by the LAPD, the protesters failed to disperse and the rally was declared an unlawful assembly. The LAPD only announced the declaration of the unlawful assembly in English leading to confusion by some in the crowd who only spoke Spanish. Police officers held a line to prevent protesters from entering the street and did not disperse the crowd until rocks, bottles, and other objects began to be thrown at the police. The officers began slowly advancing and fired rubber bullets and used batons to disperse crowd members who refused to comply with police orders to leave the area. Police were heavily criticized for firing rubber bullets at some journalists and hitting some with batons who did not disperse along with the crowds. Seventeen officers and two sergeants of the metropolitan division were recommended for punishment by a department internal review for their actions in the incident.

In 2008, Officer Russell Mecano offered to not arrest a woman in exchange for sex and offered cash to another woman in exchange for sex. He was convicted and sentenced to more than eight years.

===2010s–2020s===
On July 22, 2012, Alesia Thomas, an African American woman, died in the back of a police car after being kicked in the upper thigh, groin, and abdomen. Her cause of death was ruled &quot;undetermined&quot;, and the autopsy report mentioned cocaine intoxication as a &quot;major&quot; contributing factor, but also indicated that the struggle with officers &quot;could not be excluded&quot; as a contributing factor to her death. It was later revealed that Thomas was also determined to have bipolar disorder. Later, LAPD officer Mary O&#x27;Callaghan was charged with assault over her actions in the case. As a result of these events, on September 1, 2012, civil rights activists requested an emergency meeting with LAPD Chief Charlie Beck to review arrest and use-of-force policies.

On August 18, 2012, Ronald Weekley Jr., a college student, was punched in the face while being arrested after being stopped for riding his skateboard on the wrong side of the street. On August 21, 2012, Michelle Jordan, a registered nurse, was pulled over for holding her cell phone while driving. She was thrown to the ground twice in the course of being arrested after getting out of the car and refusing to comply with an officer&#x27;s command to get back in the vehicle.

On February 7, 2013, the LAPD was involved in what Chief Beck called &quot;a case of mistaken identity&quot; when, during the manhunt for the murderer and fired LAPD officer, Christopher Dorner, the LAPD and the Torrance Police Department fired upon pickup trucks at two separate locations, believing them to be Dorner. The first incident took place on the 19500 Block of Redbeam Avenue. LAPD officers fired numerous shots into the back of a blue pickup truck, allegedly without warning, and injured the two women inside. Twenty-five minutes later, the Torrance Police shot into the windshield of another pickup truck, narrowly missing the driver. In both cases the victims were not involved with the Dorner case. The Dorner case involved allegations of impropriety by other LAPD officers, as Dorner alleged that he had been fired for reporting brutality by his training officer. The manhunt was triggered by Dorner&#x27;s alleged attacks against LAPD and ex-LAPD personnel. In 2013, the city of Los Angeles agreed to pay the two female victims of the first incident $2.1 million each to settle the matter. The city of Torrance agreed to pay the victim of the second incident $1.8 million.

In May 2014, after much controversy in their city, the Seattle Police Department transferred two Draganflyer X6 UAVs to the LAPD. The LAPD stated that the only uses for the drones would be for narrow and prescribed circumstances such as hostage situations, but that they would not be put into use until the Board of Police Commissioners and the City Attorney crafted a policy for their use after the LA City Council ordered the policy creation. The decision to use the drones gained significant opposition from community activists including the ACLU and new groups founded after the announcement about drone use including Stop LAPD Spying Coalition and the Drone-Free LAPD, No Drones, LA! Activist groups protested outside of city hall against the use of drones by the LAPD.

On August 11, 2014, an African-American man named Ezell Ford was shot by two LAPD gang detectives after they made an investigative stop of Ford on the street. Ford was unarmed and the officers claimed that he got into a physical struggle with one of them and then reached for their gun, forcing them to fire on Ford, while some witnesses who claimed to have seen the incident alleged that there was no struggle. The autopsy report was ordered to be released by Mayor Eric Garcetti before the end of 2014.

On September 11, 2014, African-American actress Danièle Watts was temporarily detained by the LAPD when she and her boyfriend were in Studio City. Watts accused the officers who stopped her of racially profiling her because she was African-American and her boyfriend was Caucasian, claiming that they treated her as if she was a &quot;prostitute&quot; and that the officers had been disrespectful to her because she was African-American. LAPD Sergeant Jim Parker who was one of the two officers accused by Watts of misconduct, released a personal audio recording of the entire incident to TMZ. The recording showed that police had received a 911 call about lewd acts in a car and the couple who were described to have committed the lewd acts fit Watts&#x27; and her boyfriend&#x27;s description. It also showed that when officers arrived on the scene, Watts&#x27; boyfriend cooperated with police but Watts refused to cooperate and identify herself, accused the officers of racism, and ignored officers requests and walked away from them leading to her being handcuffed and temporarily detained. Following the release of the recording, local civil rights activists called for Watts to apologize to the LAPD for falsely accusing them of racial profiling but Watts refused. The two officers were cleared of any wrongdoing by the department shortly after the release of the audio recordings.

In October 2014, the LAPD Office of the Inspector General released a report that members of the department had been using department computers to falsely inflate the number of officers and patrol cars that were on duty at any given time in a method known as &quot;ghost cars&quot;. The report found that supervisors of various ranks would check officers into vacant assignments right before the department&#x27;s computerized patrol software did its headcount and then log the officers off when the count was done. The report found that the practice occurred in at least five out of 21 patrol divisions, and the report also highlighted the causes including understaffing in the LAPD.

In 2018, LAPD officers Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell were fired for misconduct, making false statements, and violating the public&#x27;s trust in their actions during an armed robbery in 2017. On April 15, 2017, Lozano and Mitchell were on duty when they received a call for an armed robbery at a nearby Macy&#x27;s. Despite being close to the scene, the officers remained parked in an alleyway; Sergeant Jose Gomez, patrol sergeant for that shift, asked that the officers respond to the robbery, but they did not reply. While being questioned over the incident, Lozano and Mitchell claimed they could not hear the call due to loud music from a nearby park. When Sergeant Gomez reviewed their vehicle recordings, he found the officers were distracted by the mobile game &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, and that they ignored the robbery call and left their patrol jurisdiction to continue playing the game. Lozano and Mitchell attempted to appeal their firing, arguing their vehicle recordings were used improperly as evidence, but the California Second District Court of Appeal rejected their appeal. In June 2020, following a campaign by a coalition of community groups including Black Lives Matter, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced LAPD budget cuts of $150 million. Garcetti announced the funds would be redirected to community initiatives. Then-Senator Kamala Harris supported Garcetti&#x27;s decision to cut the LAPD&#x27;s budget.

In 2020, the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s Office announced that six LAPD officers had been charged with conspiracy and falsifying information in a false gang labeling scandal, with an additional 18 officers under investigation. The discovery of false accusations led to the review of hundreds of cases and the dismissal of several felony charges dating back to 2016.

On February 13, 2021, the LAPD announced in a series of tweets it was launching an internal investigation into the Harbor Division after their employees allegedly passed around a Valentine&#x27;s Day-themed e-card depicting George Floyd with the caption &quot;You take my breath away&quot;, which referred to Floyd&#x27;s murder. The LAPD said it &quot;will have zero tolerance for this type of behavior&quot;.

On June 30, 2021, an LAPD bomb disposal squad detonated confiscated illegal fireworks in a residential neighborhood, injuring 17 people, causing extensive damage to nearby houses, and destroying the LAPD&#x27;s bomb disposal truck. The explosion reportedly occurred when the bomb squad significantly underestimated the weight of the fireworks that were loaded into the truck&#x27;s blast chamber. 42 pounds of fireworks were loaded into the blast chamber; however, it was only designed to sustain 15 pounds of explosives, with a maximum of 25 pounds (though this would disable the truck). The LAPD was criticized for carelessly handling explosives and detonating them in a neighborhood; Chief Moore publicly apologized during a news conference, informing reporters the bomb squad had begun implementing new procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

In September 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that LAPD officers had been instructed by Chief Michel Moore to collect social media account information from all citizens they interview, whether or not they have been accused of committing a crime. Further, officers were asked to collect Social Security numbers and instructed to tell individuals that they &quot;must be provided&quot; under federal law, although it is unclear if this is true. In a response to the comment, the LAPD stated that the field interview policy was &quot;being updated&quot;. An updated policy instructs officers not to collect Social Security numbers.

== Fallen officers ==

Since the establishment of the Los Angeles Police Department, 220 officers have died in the line of duty. In 2008, Randal Simmons became the first LAPD SWAT officer to be killed in the line of duty. There have been two memorials to fallen LAPD officers. One was outside Parker Center, the former headquarters, which was unveiled on October 1, 1971. The monument was a fountain made from black granite, its base inscribed with the names of deceased LAPD officers.

The old monument located at Parker Center was destroyed in the process of being transported but was replaced by a new memorial at the Police Administration Building, the Los Angeles Police Department Memorial for Fallen Officers, dedicated on October 14, 2009. The memorial is made up of more than 2,000 brass alloy plaques, 207 of which are inscribed with the names of fallen police officers. Two deaths are unsolved, both of off-duty officers: Fred Early, shot in 1972, and Michael Lee Edwards, shot in May 1974. In addition to the numbers listed above, eight police officers and two other LAPD employees died due to COVID-19 complications.

== In popular culture ==
Los Angeles&#x27; relationship with the American film industry and entertainment industries led to the LAPD being prominently featured in popular media. Combined with news stories relating to it, the LAPD&#x27;s image was effectively broadcast worldwide, making it a well-known archetype of urban North American law enforcement. The LAPD occasionally sanctioned works that depicted it positively.

===LAPD-sanctioned media entities===
One of the earliest notable representations of the LAPD in media was the 1930s CBS radio drama &quot;Calling All Cars&quot;, which hired LAPD radio dispatcher Jesse Rosenquist to voice the series&#x27; dispatcher. Rosenquist was already famous because home radios could tune in too early police radio frequencies; as the first police radio dispatcher presented to the public ear, he was the voice that actors went to when called upon for a radio dispatcher role. Chief James E. Davis also presented the show, and many of its plotlines were based on actual incidents the LAPD had handled, a concept that would be a staple of most future LAPD-sanctioned works.

From April to September 1952, KNBH aired &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, a panel show hosted by LAPD Chief William H. Parker, who discussed police affairs with a panel of experts and the audience. Jack Webb produced the &quot;Dragnet&quot; franchise, following LAPD Detective Sergeant Joe Friday, in cooperation with the LAPD. &quot;Dragnet&quot;, which started as a late-1940s radio drama and moved into television in the 1950s and 1960s, was the first major mass media representation of the LAPD. Real LAPD operations inspired Webb to create the series, and close cooperation with LAPD officers let him make it as realistic as possible, including authentic police equipment, sound recording on-site at police facilities, and access to LAPD case files for story plotlines. The popularity of &quot;Dragnet&quot;&#x27;s 1950s television adaptation made then-Chief William H. Parker &quot;the most well-known and respected law enforcement official in the nation&quot; aside from J. Edgar Hoover. The 1960s television series aired under Chiefs Thomas Reddin and Edward M. Davis, and oriented from straightforward crime-solving to internal matters and community policing, per Reddin&#x27;s attempts to improve the LAPD&#x27;s community relations. &quot;Adam-12&quot;, also produced by Webb, followed a pair of LAPD patrol officers, running from 1968 to 1975, longer than &quot;Dragnet&quot;″s 1960s run. The show familiarized the American public with LAPD operations and procedures. It made several of the LAPD&#x27;s organizational quirks, such as its black-and-white paint scheme and &quot;to protect and serve&quot; motto, widely recognizable and symbolic of American policing.

<text>Saarlouis (Sarrelouis in French) is a Kreis (district) in the middle of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are Merzig-Wadern, Sankt Wendel, Neunkirchen, Saarbrücken, and the French &quot;département&quot; Moselle.

==History==
The district was part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. The biggest part of the district was part of duchy of Lorraine which gradually came under French sovereignty (still as a part of the holy empire) between 1737 and 1766. Other villages were part of the county of Nassau-Saarbrücken. The territory of the city Saarlouis which was built to protect the border, came to France as part of the three Bishoprics. Other villages, which today are considered to be too small to form villages of their own were independent imperial territories. The district showed the fundamental problem of the whole empire: A strong influence of foreign rulers and micro-sized territories. After the Napoleonic wars the area went to Prussia, which in 1816 created the district as part of its Rhineland province. Between 1936 and 1945 it was called &quot;Saarlautern&quot;, when the Nazi government attempted to conceal the name&#x27;s French origin.

==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Saar.

==Coat of arms==
The checked black-and-white top part of the coat of arms is taken from the coat of the Hohenzollern, to remember that the area belonged to the German Empire (which was ruled by the Hohenzollern dynasty) directly. The bottom part is the coat of arms of the Lorraine, as Saarlouis belonged to Duchy of Lorraine 1100-1766. The star stands for the French fortress of Saarlouis, the origin of the city, which was built in a star form. The fleur-de-lis comes from the coat of arms of the city Saarlouis.

<text>The Royal Academy of Music (RAM) in London, England, is one of the oldest music schools in the UK, founded in 1822 by John Fane and Nicolas-Charles Bochsa. It received its royal charter in 1830 from King George IV with the support of the first Duke of Wellington.

The academy provides undergraduate and postgraduate training across instrumental performance, composition, jazz, musical theatre and opera, and recruits musicians from around the world, with a student community representing more than 50 nationalities. It is committed to lifelong learning, from Junior Academy, which trains musicians up to the age of 18, through Open Academy community music projects, to performances and educational events for all ages.

The academy&#x27;s museum houses one of the world&#x27;s most significant collections of musical instruments and artefacts, including stringed instruments by Stradivari, Guarneri, and members of the Amati family; manuscripts by Purcell, Handel and Vaughan Williams; and a collection of performing materials that belonged to leading performers. It is a constituent college of the University of London and a registered charity under English law.

Famous academy alumni include Henry Wood, Simon Rattle, Brian Ferneyhough, Elton John and Annie Lennox.

==History==

The academy was founded by John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, in 1822 with the help and ideas of the French harpist and composer Nicolas Bochsa. The academy was granted a royal charter by King George IV in 1830. The founding of the academy was greatly supported by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. He was a keen violinist himself and was determined to make the academy a success.

The academy faced closure in 1866; this was part of the reason for the founding of the Royal College of Music in South Kensington. The academy&#x27;s history took a turn for the better when its recently appointed Principal (and former pupil) William Sterndale Bennett took on the chairmanship of the academy&#x27;s board of directors and established its finances and reputation on a new footing.

The academy&#x27;s first building was in Tenterden Street, Hanover Square. Arnold Bax recalled it as an architectural rabbit warren. &quot;The three eighteenth-century houses which the institution comprised were departitioned, one conjectured, with fearsome violence. Wherefore else the need for those torturous tunnellings, that labyrinthine intricacy of passages, the cul-de-sacs, and follies? It took the average new student about a month to get his or her bearings.&quot; In 1911 the institution moved to the current premises, designed by Sir Ernest George (which include the 450-seat Duke&#x27;s Hall), built at a cost of £51,000 on the site of an orphanage. In 1976 the academy acquired the houses situated on the north side and built between them a new opera theatre donated by the philanthropist Sir Jack Lyons and named after him and two new recital spaces, a recording studio, an electronic music studio, several practice rooms and office space.

The academy again expanded its facilities in the late 1990s, with the addition of 1–5 York Gate, designed by John Nash in 1822, to house the new museum, a musical theatre studio and several teaching and practice rooms. To link the main building and 1–5 York Gate a new underground passage and the underground barrel-vaulted 150-seat David Josefowitz recital hall were built on the courtyard between the mentioned structures.

==Campus and location==

The academy&#x27;s current facilities are situated on Marylebone Road in central London adjacent to Regent&#x27;s Park.

==Teaching==
The Royal Academy of Music offers training from infant level (Junior Academy), with the senior Academy awarding the LRAM diploma, BMus and higher degrees to PhD/ DMus. The former degree GRSM, equivalent to a university honours degree and taken by some students, was phased out in the 1990s. All undergraduates now take the University of London degree of BMus.
Most academy students are classical performers: strings, piano, vocal studies including opera, brass, woodwind, conducting and choral conducting, composition, percussion, harp, organ, accordion, guitar. There are also departments for historical performance, musical theatre performance and jazz.

The academy collaborates with other conservatoires worldwide, including participating in the SOCRATES student and staff exchange programme. In 1991, the academy introduced a fully accredited degree in performance studies, and in September 1999, it became a full constituent college of the University of London, in both cases becoming the first UK conservatoire to do so.

The academy has students from over 50 countries, following diverse programmes including instrumental performance, conducting, composition, jazz, musical theatre, historical performance, and opera. The academy has an established relationship with King&#x27;s College London, particularly the Department of Music, whose students receive instrumental tuition at the academy. In return, many students at the academy take a range of humanities choices at King&#x27;s, and its extended academic musicological curriculum.

The Junior Academy, for pupils under the age of 18, meets every Saturday.

==Library and archives==
The academy&#x27;s library contains over 160,000 items, including significant collections of early printed and manuscript materials and audio facilities. The library also houses archives dedicated to Sir Arthur Sullivan and Sir Henry Wood. Among the Library&#x27;s most valuable possessions are the autograph manuscripts of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot;, Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot; and &quot;The Martyr of Antioch&quot;, Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; and &quot;Serenade to Music&quot;, and the newly discovered Handel &quot;Gloria&quot;. A grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund has assisted in the purchase of the Robert Spencer Collection—a set of Early English Song and Lute music, as well as a fine collection of lutes and guitars. The academy&#x27;s museum displays many of these items. The Orchestral Library has approximately 4,500 sets of orchestral parts. Other collections include the libraries of Sir Henry Wood and Otto Klemperer.

Soon after violinist Yehudi Menuhin&#x27;s death, the Royal Academy of Music acquired his personal archive, which includes sheet music marked up for performance, correspondence, news articles and photographs relating to Menuhin, autograph musical manuscripts, and several portraits of Paganini.

Harriet Cohen bequeathed a large collection of paintings, some photographs and her gold bracelet to the academy, with a request that the room in which the paintings were to be housed was named the &quot;Arnold Bax Room&quot;. Noted for her performances of Bach and modern English music, she was a friend and advocate of Arnold Bax and also premièred Vaughan Williams&#x27; Piano Concerto—a work dedicated to her—in 1933. In 1886, Franz Liszt performed at the academy to celebrate the creation of the &quot;Franz Liszt Scholarship&quot; and in 1843 Mendelssohn was made an honorary member of the academy.

==Student performances and festivals==
Academy students perform regularly in the academy&#x27;s concert venues, and also nationally and internationally under conductors such as the late Sir Colin Davis, Yan Pascal Tortelier, Christoph von Dohnányi, the late Sir Charles Mackerras and Trevor Pinnock. In summer 2012, John Adams conducted an orchestra which combined students from the academy and New York&#x27;s Juilliard School at the Proms and at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center. Conductors who have recently worked with the orchestras include Semyon Bychkov, Daniel Barenboim, Sir Simon Rattle, Pierre-Laurent Aimard and Christian Thielemann. Famous people who have conducted the academy&#x27;s orchestra also include Carl Maria von Weber in 1826 and Richard Strauss in 1926.

For many years, the academy celebrated the work of a living composer with a festival in the presence of the composer. Previous composer festivals at the academy have been devoted to the work of Witold Lutosławski, Michael Tippett, Krzysztof Penderecki, Olivier Messiaen, Hans Werner Henze, Luciano Berio, Elliott Carter, Stavros Papanikolaou, as well as academy graduates, Alfred Schnittke, György Ligeti, Franco Donatoni, Galina Ustvolskaya, Arvo Pärt, György Kurtág and Mauricio Kagel.

In February–March 2006, an academy festival celebrated the violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini, who first visited London 175 years earlier in 1831. The festival included a recital by academy professor Maxim Vengerov, who performed on &quot;Il Cannone Guarnerius&quot;, Paganini&#x27;s favourite violin. Academy instrumentalists and musical theatre students have also performed in a series of concerts with the academy alumnus Sir Elton John.

The students and ensembles of the Royal Academy of Music perform in other venues around London including Kings Place, St Marylebone Parish Church and the South Bank Centre.

==Museum and collections==

The academy&#x27;s public museum is situated in the York Gate building, which is connected to the academy&#x27;s building via a basement link. The museum houses the academy&#x27;s collections, including a major collection of Cremonese stringed instruments dated between 1650 and 1740, a selection of historical English pianos from 1790 to 1850, from the famous Mobbs Collection, original manuscripts by Purcell, Mendelssohn, Liszt, Brahms, Sullivan and Vaughan Williams, musical memorabilia and other exhibits.

<text>A compensated pulsed alternator, also known by the portmanteau &quot;compulsator&quot;, is a form of power supply.

As the name suggests, it is an alternator that is &quot;compensated&quot; (see below) to make it better at delivering pulses of electrical energy than a normal alternator.

==Description and operation==

The principle is very similar to an alternator, except the rotor is usually kept spinning by its inertia (having been &quot;spun up&quot; by an external motor, or the compulsator itself having been used in reverse as an AC motor) and the small matter of the &quot;compensation&quot;. The compulsator is used like a capacitor, to gather energy from a low-power source and store it, then generate a high-power output for a short period.

The windings of a compulsator are different from those of a normal alternator in being designed for minimal inductance. This allows the current in the windings to change very rapidly, which is why this &quot;compensation&quot; makes it better at delivering pulses.

The kinetic energy of a rotating object depends on the mass of the object, the shape of the object, and the square of the speed of rotation. Therefore, compulsators tend to have very light rotors spinning very fast in order to store the most energy in the available mass, and because too much mass in the rotor causes problems with the magnitude of centripetal force required to prevent the rotor from flying apart.

== Usage ==

Compulsators are popular choices for high-end railgun power supplies.

One possibility being considered is to build an electric tank using a conventional diesel engine for propulsion and to charge a compulsator. The compulsator would be used to power a railgun, and potentially other pulsed energy weapons (particularly electronic warfare systems); also, the compulsator could be used in non-pulsed mode to drive a tank with electric motors for limited periods as a kind of &quot;quiet mode&quot;, which could be useful in urban combat.

<text>William Salesbury, also Salusbury, (c. 1520 – c. 1584) was the leading Welsh scholar of the Renaissance and the principal translator of the 1567 Welsh New Testament.

== Early life ==
Salesbury was born some time before 1520 (possibly as early as 1507) in the parish of Llansannan, Conwy. He was the second son of Ffwg Salesbury (&quot;d&quot;. 1520) and Annes, daughter of Wiliam ap Gruffydd ap Robin o Gochwillan. By 1540 he had moved to Plas Isa, Llanrwst; this had been the residence of both his father and his brother. He was probably educated locally, and was certainly influenced by the literary traditions of the Vale of Clwyd. He then studied at Oxford University, probably living in Broadgates Hall. Here he studied the Hebrew, Greek and Latin languages, and became familiar with the (banned) writings of Martin Luther and William Tyndale as well as the technology of printing. Here too he was caught up in the renaissance of learning. Mathias suggests that it was at Oxford that Salesbury left the Roman Catholic church and became a Protestant. Although there is no record of his either having taken a degree at Oxford or having gone on to one of the inns of court, it is known that in 1550 he was at Thavies Inn. Although he spent considerable time in London, there is no evidence of his having travelled abroad. His wife was Catrin Llwyd, sister of Ellis Price. She died around 1572.

==Career==
Brinley Jones describes the remarkable range of Salesbury&#x27;s writings, &quot;the product of a Renaissance humanist scholar, lexicographer, and translator&quot;. Mathias describes his motivations as making the Bible available to the Welsh people, and imparting knowledge to them in their own language. In 1547, Salesbury produced an English-Welsh dictionary called &quot;A dictionary in Englyshe and Welshe&quot;, printed by John Waley &#x27;at London in Foster Lane&#x27; in 1547. Mathias conjectures that this may have been the first book to be printed in Welsh. Brinley Jones suggests that the dictionary has the appearance of a work-book, devised in the first place for Salesbury&#x27;s own use. In 1550 his &quot;A and a introduction, how to pronounce the letters in the British tong (now commonly called Walsh)...&quot; was printed by Robert Crowley. A revised edition was printed &quot;by Henry Denham for Humphrey Toy, at the of the Helmet in Paules church , The. xvij. of May. 1567.&quot; A short comparative study of Welsh sounds with Hebrew and Greek is included, plus an examination of the Latin element in Welsh (which he had first examined in the dictionary of 1547). Both of these books have become important sources for information about the spoken English of the sixteenth century. One of Salesbury&#x27;s books of 1550, &quot;The Descripcion of the Sphere or Frame of the Worlde,&quot; has been described as the first science book in the English language.

Salesbury also published books in Welsh at the same time. In 1547 he published a collection of 930 Welsh proverbs made by Gruffudd Hiraethog (d. 1564), .

In 1550, he published &quot;. A case out of the law of Hoel da, of Wales in the of Lorde, hundred and passed: whereby it gathered that had lawfully married at that .&quot; This book, printed by Robert Crowley, was in Welsh and English; as the title indicates, it was an attempt to justify Protestant doctrine in favour of a clerical marriage to the Welsh and English by establishing precedent for it in the &quot; law&quot; of a Welsh king. (It was no doubt significant that the present royal family, the Tudors, had Welsh origins.) Also in 1550, a polemical text appeared under Crowley&#x27;s imprint stating that it was &quot;compiled&quot; by Salesbury: &quot;The of the Popes Botereulx, commonly called the high .&quot; In this work, he took part in one the great controversies of the time, considering the doctrine of the sacrifice of the mass as show in the existence of stone altars in churches. A third Salesbury book with Crowley&#x27;s imprint in 1551 is a translation of the epistle and gospel readings from the 1549 Book of Common Prayer: . Brinley Jones describes this as his first major contribution towards presenting the scriptures in Welsh.

As a convinced Protestant, Salesbury was obliged to spend most of the reign of Mary I, 1553–1558, in hiding and probably back in Llanrwst. As a consequence his writing and publishing came to a stop.

The belief of Erasmus and Luther that the Bible should be available to all in their native language was firmly advocated by Salesbury. He wrote &#x27;Insist on having Holy Scripture in your language&#x27; (). With the succession of Elizabeth I, Salesbury went to work on this project. In 1563, an act of parliament ordered the bishops of Wales and Hereford to see that a Welsh translation of the Bible, Book of Common Prayer and administration of the sacraments be ready by 1 March 1567. Quite possibly a confederate in this project, Robert Crowley, Salesbury&#x27;s former printer, was at this time a Canon of Hereford, having been instituted to the stall or prebend of &quot;Pratum majus&quot; in the cathedral of Hereford c. 1560–63.

Salesbury worked with Richard Davies, Bishop of St. David&#x27;s, (1 Timothy, Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter) and Thomas Huet, Precentor of St David&#x27;s, (Revelation) to prepare a translation of the New Testament from the original Greek into Welsh. Salesbury was responsible for a large part of the translation therefore, as well as being editor. This was published on 7 October 1567. As Mathias points out, Salesbury&#x27;s translations were heavily criticised for being full of Latinisms and other orthographical peculiarities and consequently unintelligible to many of his contemporaries. However, Mathias is still able to describe them as fine translations, both as regards language and style. Moreover, Bishop William Morgan was to virtually adopt Salesbury&#x27;s version of the New Testament into his Bible of 1588. Sir John Wynn of Gwydir believed that Richard Davies and Salesbury were also collaborating on a translation of the Old Testament but disagreed over the use of one word. Whatever the truth of this, work on the Old Testament did not proceed.

Salesbury also translated the English Book of Common Prayer into Welsh, which was published in 1567 as . Like the Welsh New Testament, this was published by Humphrey Toy.

Salesbury&#x27;s last recorded work, (&#x27;Herbal&#x27;), was basically a paraphrase of some of the best-known herbals of the time, particularly Leonhard Fuchs&#x27;s &quot;De historia stirpium.&quot; William Turner&#x27;s &quot;A New Herball&quot; was another source. Most of the entries follow the same pattern—the name(s) in Latin, English, Welsh, a description, where the herbs are found, when they appear, and what properties they possess.

==Death and legacy==
It is likely that Salesbury died around 1580; the place of his burial is unknown. Brinley Jones considers him the outstanding example of the Welsh Renaissance scholar, broad in his range and interests, inquisitive and enquiring. Mathias concludes that it would be hard to find anybody who has rendered greater service to the Welsh nation than William Salesbury. His translation of the scriptures into Welsh laid the foundations of modern Welsh prose.

<text>BeppoSAX was an Italian–Dutch satellite for X-ray astronomy which played a crucial role in resolving the origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most energetic events known in the universe. It was the first X-ray mission capable of simultaneously observing targets over more than 3 orders-of-magnitude of energy, from 0.1 to 300 kiloelectronvolts (keV) with relatively large area, good (for the time) energy resolution and imaging capabilities (with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute between 0.1 and 10 keV). BeppoSAX was a major programme of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) with the participation of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR). The prime contractor for the space segment was Alenia while Nuova Telespazio led the development of the ground segment. Most of the scientific instruments were developed by the Italian National Research Council (CNR) while the Wide Field Cameras were developed by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) and the LECS was developed by the astrophysics division of the European Space Agency&#x27;s ESTEC facility.

BeppoSAX was named in honour of the Italian physicist Giuseppe &quot;Beppo&quot; Occhialini. SAX stands for &quot;Satellite per Astronomia a raggi X&quot; or &quot;Satellite for X-ray Astronomy&quot;.

X-ray observations cannot be performed from ground-based telescopes, since Earth&#x27;s atmosphere blocks most of the incoming radiation. One of BeppoSAX&#x27;s main achievements was the identification of numerous gamma-ray bursts with extra-galactic objects.

Launched by an Atlas-Centaur on 30 April 1996 into a low inclination (&lt;4 degree) low-Earth orbit, the expected operating life of two years was extended to April 30, 2002, due to high scientific interest in the mission and the continued good technical status. After this date, the orbit started to decay rapidly and various subsystems were starting to fail making it no longer worthwhile to conduct scientific observations.

On April 29, 2003, the satellite ended its life falling into the Pacific Ocean.

== Spacecraft characteristics ==
BeppoSAX was a three axes stabilized satellite, with a pointing accuracy of 1&#x27;. The main attitude constraint derived from the need to maintain the normal to the solar arrays within 30° from the Sun, with occasional excursions to 45° for some WFC observations. Due to the low orbit the satellite was in view of the ground station of Malindi for only a limited fraction of the time. Data was stored on-board on a tape unit with a capacity of 450 Mbits and transmitted to ground every orbit during station passage. The average data rate available to instruments was about 60 kbit/s, but peak rates of up to 100 kbit/s can be retained for part of each orbit. With the solar panels closed, the spacecraft was 3.6 m in height and 2.7 m in diameter. The total mass amounts to 1400 kg, with a payload of 480 kg.

The structure of the satellite consisted of three basic functional subassemblies:
* the Service Module, in the lower part of the spacecraft, which housed all the subsystems and the electronic boxes of the scientific instruments.
* the Payload Module, which housed the scientific instruments and the star trackers.
* the Thermal Shade Structure, that enclosed the Payload Module.

The primary sub-systems of the satellite are:
* The Attitude Orbital Control System (AOCS), that performed attitude determination and manoeuvred and operated the Reaction Control Subsystem in charge of orbit recovering. It included redundant magnetometers, Sun acquisition sensors, three star trackers, six gyroscopes (three of which are for redundancy), three magnetic torquers and four reaction wheels, all controlled by a dedicated computer. The AOCS ensured a pointing accuracy of 1&#x27; during source observations and manoeuvres with a slew rate of 10° per min.
* The On Board Data Handler (OBDH) was the core for data management and system control on the satellite and it also managed the communication interfaces between the satellite and the ground station. Its computer supervised all subsystem processor activities, such as those of each instrument, and the communication busses.

== Instrumentation ==
BeppoSAX contained five science instruments:
* Low Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (LECS)
* Medium Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (MECS)
* High Pressure Gas Scintillation Proportional Counter (HPGSPC)
* Phoswich Detector System (PDS)
* Wide Field Camera (WFC)

The first four instruments (often called Narrow Field Instruments or NFI) point to the same direction, and allow observations of an object in a broad energy band of 0.1 to 300 keV (16 to 48,000 attojoules (aJ)).

The WFC contained two coded aperture cameras operating in the 2 to 30 keV (320 to 4,800 aJ) range and each covering a region of 40 x 40 degrees (20 by 20 degrees full width at half maximum) on the sky. The WFC was complemented by the shielding of PDS which had a (nearly) all-sky view in the 100 to 600 keV (16,000 to 96,000 aJ) band, ideal for detecting gamma-ray bursts (GRB).

The PDS shielding has poor angular resolution. In theory, after a GRB was seen in the PDS, the position was refined first with the WFC. However, due to the many spikes in the PDS, in practice a GRB was found using the WFC, often corroborated by a BATSE-signal. The position up to arcminute precision - depending on the signal to noise ratio of the burst - was found using the deconvoluted WFC-image. The coordinates were speedily sent out as an International Astronomical Union (IAU) and Gamma-ray burst Coordinate Network Circular. After this, immediate follow-up observations with the NFI and optical observatories around the world allowed accurate positioning of the GRB and detailed observations of the X-ray, optical and radio afterglow.

The MECS contained three identical gas scintillation proportional counters operating in the 1.3 to 10 keV (208 to 1602 aJ) range. On 6 May 1997 one of the three identical MECS units was lost when a fault developed in the High Voltage power supply.

The LECS was similar to the MECS units, expect that it had a thinner window that allows photons with lower energies down to 0.1 keV (16 aJ) to pass through and operated in a &quot;driftless&quot; mode which is necessary to detect the lowest energy X-rays as these would be lost in the low field regime near the entrance window of a conventional GSPC. The LECS data above 4 keV (641 aJ) is not usable due to calibration issues probably caused by the driftless design. The LECS and MECS had imaging capability, whereas the high-energy narrow field instruments were non-imaging.

The HPGSPC was also a gas scintillation proportional counter, operating at a high (5 atmospheres) pressure. High pressure equals high density, and dense photon-stopping material allowed detection of photons up to 120 keV (19,000 aJ).

The PDS was a crystal (sodium iodide / caesium iodide) scintillator detector capable of absorbing photons up to 300 keV (48,000 aJ). The spectral resolution of the PDS was rather modest when compared to the gas detectors, but the low background counting rate resulting from the low inclination BeppoSAX orbit and good background rejection capabilities meant that the PDS remains one of the most sensitive high-energy instruments flown.

<text>M. R. Ramakrishna Panikkar (22 March 1935 – 31 March 2008), popularly known as Kadammanitta Ramakrishnan or Kadammanitta, was an Indian poet. He was born in Kadammanitta province of Pathanamthitta district, Kerala. His childhood experiences, especially the Patayani songs, had a strong influence on his literary work.

==Early life==
Ramakrishnan was born on 22 March 1935 to Meletharayil Raman Nair and Kuttiyamma. He completed schooling at his home village of Kadammanitta and at the nearby town of Pathanamthitta. He was influenced by the traditional religious art form of Patayani even from his childhood. After his degree studies, he went to Kolkata and then reached Chennai. He was employed with the Postal Audits and Accounts department in 1959. He worked in Thiruvananthapuram from 1967 until his retirement in 1992.

==Literary life==
Ramakrishnan&#x27;s poem &quot;Njan&quot; was published in 1965 in M. Govindan&#x27;s &quot;Sameeksha&quot; magazine.

Kadammanitta played a role in reviving interest in poetry by holding thousands of recital sessions in every nook and corner of Kerala in the 1970s and 80s. His work has been widely appreciated for its force, energy, and folk touch, and his work gave a mass appeal and popularity making poetry enjoyable even to commonman. Ramakrishnan&#x27;s close association with literary and cultural luminaries, which included M. Govindan, Ayyappa Paniker, M. V. Devan, P. K. Balakrishnan, O. N. V. Kurup, Kavalam Narayana Panicker, D.Vinayachandran, and K. V. Thampi, helped him in the endeavour to give a popular image to Malayalam poetry recital. He had recited his fiery works at thousands of venues all over the state, besides editing a poetry journal &quot;Kerala Kavitha&quot; that attempted to take the essence of poetry from the academic cloisters to the realms of everyday life.

==Other activities==
A communist, he was involved with the student federation as well as communist party during his college days. In 1992, he became the vice president of CPI-M&#x27;s cultural wing, Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham (Progressive Association for Art and Letters), and in 2002 its president. In 1996, he was elected to Kerala state legislative assembly from Aranmula constituency in Pathanamthitta district. He was still continuing as the President of Purogamana Kala Sahithya Sangham when he died.

==Death==
Ramakrishnan died at 9 o&#x27;clock in the morning of 31 March 2008 at M.G.M. Memorial Medical Centre in Pathanamthitta, nine days after celebrating his 73rd birthday. He had been undergoing treatment for myeloid leukaemia for the past three months. He was survived by his wife, Santha, daughter, Geetha Devi, and son, Geetha Krishnan. He was cremated with full state honours at the premises of his home in his birth village, after which he was called more.

<text>The Eifelkreis Bitburg-Prüm () is a district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) Luxembourg, Belgium and the districts of Euskirchen, Vulkaneifel, Bernkastel-Wittlich and Trier-Saarburg.

== History ==
There are three different historical regions: the abbey and the city of Prüm have been directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor in medieval times; later the free city became the principality of Prüm, occupying large portions in the north.

The southwest including the town of Bitburg was a part of the Duchy of Luxemburg from the 10th to the 15th century. Later it was a part of the Seventeen Provinces and hence under Spanish and then Austrian rule. After the Napoleonic Wars the region was handed over to Prussia.

The eastern parts of the district, including the town of Kyllburg, were part of the Prince-bishopric of Trier.

When Prussia gained all these regions about 1815, it established the three districts of Bitburg, Prüm and Trier. In 1970 the districts of Bitburg and Prüm were merged with parts of the former district of Trier in order to form the present district.

On 1 January 2007 the full name of the district was changed to be &#x27; instead of &#x27;.

== Geography ==
The district covers the sparsely populated southwestern part of the Eifel Mountains. The portions along the western borders are occupied by a common German-Belgian nature park and a German-Luxembourgish nature park. A great number of rivers rise from the Schneifel in the northwest and from the Kyllwald in the east, and runs southward to the river Sauer (French: &quot;Sûre&quot;), which is an affluent of the Moselle.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* The red cross symbolising the close city of Trier
* The golden tower from the arms of Bitburg
* The silver lamb from the arms of Prüm
* The blue and white pattern from the arms of Luxembourg

== Towns and municipalities ==
It consists of 234 municipalities, making it is the district in Germany with the most municipalities.

<text>William Morgan (1545 – 10 September 1604) was a Welsh Bishop of Llandaff and of St Asaph, and the translator of the first version of the whole Bible into Welsh from Greek and Hebrew.


==Life==
Morgan was born in 1545 at Tŷ Mawr Wybrnant, in the parish of Penmachno, near Betws-y-Coed, North Wales (there is some doubt about the exact year of his birth; his memorial in Cambridge, for example, gives 1541). As his father was a tenant of the Gwydir estate, he was probably educated at Gwydir Castle, near Llanrwst, along with the children of the Wynn family. Morgan then attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied a range of subjects including philosophy, mathematics and Greek. He graduated BA in 1568 and MA in 1571, before seven years of Biblical studies, including a study of the Bible in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic and the works of the Church Fathers and contemporary Protestant theologians. He graduated BD in 1578 and DD in 1583. At Cambridge he was a contemporary of the Welsh clergyman and poet Edmwnd Prys who had been born only 12 miles from Morgan&#x27;s birthplace; Prys later assisted Morgan with his translation of the Bible.

In addition to his scholarly pursuits, Morgan was a clergyman of the Church of England, having been ordained in 1568 by the Bishop of Ely. His first clerical benefice was the parish of Llanbadarn Fawr, which he gained in 1572; in 1575 he moved to Welshpool, and then became vicar of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant in 1578, where he made his Bible translation. In 1579 he became rector of Llanfyllin, which he held concurrently with being vicar of nearby Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant.

Morgan was still at Cambridge when William Salesbury published his Welsh New Testament in 1567. While he was pleased that this work was available, Morgan firmly believed in the importance of having the Old Testament translated into Welsh as well. He began work on his own translation of the Old Testament in the early 1580s and published this, together with a revision of Salesbury&#x27;s New Testament, in 1588.

Following the publication of his Bible, Morgan worked on a revision of the Book of Common Prayer (which had also been translated by Salesbury), published in 1599. He also began work on a revision of the 1588 Bible, which contained a number of printing errors. This work was continued after Morgan&#x27;s death by bishop Richard Parry and scholar John Davies, and a revised version of the Bible was published in 1620. This edition is still known as William Morgan&#x27;s translation, and it is this rather than the previous edition which became the standard Welsh Bible until the 20th century and continues to be used to this day. His achievement is now looked on as a major monument in the history of the Welsh language; it meant that the Welsh people could read the Bible in their first language at roughly the same time as their English neighbours had the privilege.

William Morgan was appointed Bishop of Llandaff in 1595 and was translated to the bishopric of St Asaph in 1601. He died on 10 September 1604.

==Family==
He married twice, first to Ellen Salesbury, before going to Cambridge, and later to Catherine, daughter of George ap Richard ap John. He had one son, Evan, who became vicar of his father&#x27;s old parish of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant.

==Memorials and commemorations==
Morgan&#x27;s birthplace Tŷ Mawr Wybrnant is preserved by the National Trust as a historic house museum.

A slate plaque close to the gates of the parish church of St Dogfan in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant commemorates Morgan. It was while at this church that he made his historic translations.

There is a memorial in St John&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge, where Morgan was a student.

In 2019 it was announced that the new office building for the UK Government in Central Square, Cardiff, was to be named Tŷ William Morgan (&quot;William Morgan House&quot;), in Morgan&#x27;s honour.

<doc id="219019" wikidata="Q3491165" url="?curid=219019" title="Sweep (book series)">
<text>Sweep (Released as Wicca in the UK and Ireland) is a series of young adult fantasy novels written by Cate Tiernan, the first of which, Book of Shadows, was published in 2001. The series follows a teenage girl, Morgan Rowlands, who discovers she is the descendant of a long line of witches, and possesses powerful magic of her own.

==Plot==
The series is primarily told from the perspective of Morgan Rowlands, who is 16-years-old at the start of the series. During the first story arc Morgan joins a coven led by the popular Cal Blaire and discovers that she is a natural born witch and that she was adopted, as neither of her parents possess magic. Morgan begins to develop a romance with Cal and is introduced to Hunter, a witch from another coven. Her relationship with Cal ends when Morgan discovers that he has betrayed her several times over; he lied to her about being soul mates, he slept with one of her friends, and has been cooperating with his mother Selene&#x27;s plans to use Morgan for her own ends. Upset, Morgan begins to spend more time with Hunter, eventually developing feelings for him that she is initially reluctant to act upon. The first major story arc ends with Cal dying while attempting to save Morgan from Selene&#x27;s machinations. Grief stricken, as it was her magic that killed Cal, Selene is unable to control her dark magic and dies. 

During the second story arc Morgan experiences a prophetic dream about a ritual sacrifice that The Council of Witches believes is tied to the evil Woodbane clan. Morgan and Hunter travel to New York to investigate the dream. During this time they learn that Morgan&#x27;s parents were members of Woodbane and that her father Ciaran murdered her mother after she tried to become good. Morgan finally allows herself to accept her love for Hunter, particularly after learning that he is her true soul mate, but breaks off their relationship as she is afraid that she will only cause him ruin due to her bloodline. Morgan is ultimately able to stop her father&#x27;s evil plans, the source of the dream, by way of his true name, which gives her complete control over him. She and the council use this name to strip him of his powers. 

During the third arc Morgan and the others must find a way to defeat the Dark Wave, a dark force that puts all of witches at risk. Hunter is sent out to investigate a witch collecting other witches&#x27; true names. During this he manages to reunite with his father, who has been using dark magic to communicate with his recently deceased wife, Hunter&#x27;s mother. Hunter and Daniel return home with a journal that reveals the origin of the Dark Wave, which had been created by one of Morgan&#x27;s ancestors. They are ultimately able to defeat the Dark Wave with the help of half-witch Alisa Soto. The main series ends with Hunter and Morgan reaffirming their love for one another, which is strong despite experiencing several challenges. 

In the final book of the series, &quot;Night&#x27;s Child&quot;, Morgan is thirty-seven years old and living in Scotland, where she works as a healer for the New Charter coven. She has spent the past several years under the belief that Hunter was dead due to a storm at sea, unaware that he was captured by evil witches. In his absence she married another man and had a child, Moira. Morgan once again battles the Dark Wave and is reunited with Hunter. Moira is revealed to be Hunter&#x27;s child. Morgan had been pregnant when Hunter went missing and had gotten together with her dead husband soon after out of loneliness, so she had assumed it to be her dead husband&#x27;s. 

==Main characters==

* Morgan Rowlands: Main character and main narrator of books 1 through 9, then partial narrator of books 11, 12, and 14. At the beginning of the series she is 16; in &quot;Night&#x27;s Child&quot; she is in her late thirties. 
* Cal Blaire: He, along with Hunter Niall, both vie for Morgan&#x27;s affections. 
* Hunter Niall: He is a love interest for Morgan and the father of Morgan&#x27;s daughter Moira. 
* Sky Eventide: Sky is Hunter&#x27;s cousin and best friend who came with him to Widow&#x27;s Vale to look out for him. 
* Alisa Soto: Alisa is a half-blood witch with the powers of a full-blood witch.
* Ciaran MacEwan: Ciaran is the &quot;mùirn beatha dàn&quot;(soulmate) of Maeve Riordan (Morgan&#x27;s birth mother)and also the birth father of Morgan.

==Publication history==
== Themes ==
In their 2014 PhD dissertation &quot;I Am the Monster: Self and the Monstrous Feminine in Contemporary Young Adult Literature&quot;, E Talafuse noted that for the main character, &quot;being a teen witch involves studying the craft, reconciling with one’s family and past, and using one’s powers for protection and spiritual growth.&quot; Other themes include the search for identity and what Julia Šarić describes as the &quot;personal fable&quot;, where &quot;within a fictional context the story of a previously unknown remarkable history conveys to both the character as well as the intended reader the sense of &quot;specialness&quot; that this construct is meant to give to the adolescent.&quot;

== Reception ==
Booklist reviewed the first book in the series. The series has also received reviews from the School Library Journal, &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;, and &quot;Pittsburg Post-Gazette&quot;.

=== Awards ===

* Quick Picks for Reluctant Young Adult Readers - Top 10, American Library Association (2002)

== Adaptations ==
In 2010 Variety announced that Universal had picked up the television rights for &quot;Sweep.&quot; Robert Nelson Jacobs was attached to pen the script and Vince Vaughn was to have produced the show through Wild West Picture Show Productions. No further announcements have been made about the show.

<doc id="219021" wikidata="Q188603" url="?curid=219021" title="Capillary action">
<text>Capillary action (sometimes called capillarity, capillary motion, capillary rise, capillary effect, or wicking) is the process of a liquid flowing in a narrow space without the assistance of external forces like gravity.

The effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint-brush, in a thin tube such as a straw, in porous materials such as paper and plaster, in some non-porous materials such as clay and liquefied carbon fiber, or in a biological cell.

It occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces. If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of surface tension (which is caused by cohesion within the liquid) and adhesive forces between the liquid and container wall act to propel the liquid.

==Etymology==
Capillary comes from the Latin word capillaris, meaning &quot;of or resembling hair&quot;. The meaning stems from the tiny, hairlike diameter of a capillary.

== History ==
The first recorded observation of capillary action was by Leonardo da Vinci. A former student of Galileo, Niccolò Aggiunti, was said to have investigated capillary action. In 1660, capillary action was still a novelty to the Irish chemist Robert Boyle, when he reported that &quot;some inquisitive French Men&quot; had observed that when a capillary tube was dipped into water, the water would ascend to &quot;some height in the Pipe&quot;. Boyle then reported an experiment in which he dipped a capillary tube into red wine and then subjected the tube to a partial vacuum. He found that the vacuum had no observable influence on the height of the liquid in the capillary, so the behavior of liquids in capillary tubes was due to some phenomenon different from that which governed mercury barometers.

Others soon followed Boyle&#x27;s lead. Some (e.g., Honoré Fabri, Jacob Bernoulli) thought that liquids rose in capillaries because air could not enter capillaries as easily as liquids, so the air pressure was lower inside capillaries. Others (e.g., Isaac Vossius, Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, Louis Carré, Francis Hauksbee, Josia Weitbrecht) thought that the particles of liquid were attracted to each other and to the walls of the capillary.

Although experimental studies continued during the 18th century, a successful quantitative treatment of capillary action was not attained until 1805 by two investigators: Thomas Young of the United Kingdom and Pierre-Simon Laplace of France. They derived the Young–Laplace equation of capillary action. By 1830, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss had determined the boundary conditions governing capillary action (i.e., the conditions at the liquid-solid interface). In 1871, the British physicist Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) determined the effect of the meniscus on a liquid&#x27;s vapor pressure—a relation known as the Kelvin equation. German physicist Franz Ernst Neumann (1798–1895) subsequently determined the interaction between two immiscible liquids.

Albert Einstein&#x27;s first paper, which was submitted to &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot; in 1900, was on capillarity.

== Phenomena and physics ==

Capillary penetration in porous media shares its dynamic mechanism with flow in hollow tubes, as both processes are resisted by viscous forces. Consequently, a common apparatus used to demonstrate the phenomenon is the &quot;capillary tube&quot;. When the lower end of a glass tube is placed in a liquid, such as water, a concave meniscus forms. Adhesion occurs between the fluid and the solid inner wall pulling the liquid column along until there is a sufficient mass of liquid for gravitational forces to overcome these intermolecular forces. The contact length (around the edge) between the top of the liquid column and the tube is proportional to the radius of the tube, while the weight of the liquid column is proportional to the square of the tube&#x27;s radius. So, a narrow tube will draw a liquid column along further than a wider tube will, given that the inner water molecules cohere sufficiently to the outer ones.

== Examples ==
In the built environment, evaporation limited capillary penetration is responsible for the phenomenon of rising damp in concrete and masonry, while in industry and diagnostic medicine this phenomenon is increasingly being harnessed in the field of paper-based microfluidics.

In physiology, capillary action is essential for the drainage of continuously produced tear fluid from the eye. Two canaliculi of tiny diameter are present in the inner corner of the eyelid, also called the lacrimal ducts; their openings can be seen with the naked eye within the lacrymal sacs when the eyelids are everted.

Wicking is the absorption of a liquid by a material in the manner of a candle wick.

Paper towels absorb liquid through capillary action, allowing a fluid to be transferred from a surface to the towel. The small pores of a sponge act as small capillaries, causing it to absorb a large amount of fluid. Some textile fabrics are said to use capillary action to &quot;wick&quot; sweat away from the skin. These are often referred to as wicking fabrics, after the capillary properties of candle and lamp wicks.

Capillary action is observed in thin layer chromatography, in which a solvent moves vertically up a plate via capillary action. In this case the pores are gaps between very small particles.

Capillary action draws ink to the tips of fountain pen nibs from a reservoir or cartridge inside the pen.

With some pairs of materials, such as mercury and glass, the intermolecular forces within the liquid exceed those between the solid and the liquid, so a meniscus forms and capillary action works in reverse.

In hydrology, capillary action describes the attraction of water molecules to soil particles. Capillary action is responsible for moving groundwater from wet areas of the soil to dry areas. Differences in soil potential (formula_1) drive capillary action in soil.

A practical application of capillary action is the capillary action siphon. Instead of utilizing a hollow tube (as in most siphons), this device consists of a length of cord made of a fibrous material (cotton cord or string works well). After saturating the cord with water, one (weighted) end is placed in a reservoir full of water, and the other end placed in a receiving vessel. The reservoir must be higher than the receiving vessel. A related but simplified capillary siphon only consists of two hook-shaped stainless-steel rods, whose surface is hydrophilic, allowing water to wet the narrow grooves between them. Due to capillary action and gravity, water will slowly transfer from the reservoir to the receiving vessel. This simple device can be used to water houseplants when nobody is home. This property is also made use of in the lubrication of steam locomotives: wicks of worsted wool are used to draw oil from reservoirs into delivery pipes leading to the bearings.

=== In plants and animals ===

Capillary action is seen in many plants, and plays a part in transpiration. Water is brought high up in trees by branching; evaporation at the leaves creating depressurization; probably by osmotic pressure added at the roots; and possibly at other locations inside the plant, especially when gathering humidity with air roots.

Capillary action for uptake of water has been described in some small animals, such as &quot;Ligia exotica&quot; and &quot;Moloch horridus&quot;.

== Height of a meniscus ==
=== Capillary rise of liquid in a capillary ===
The height &quot;h&quot; of a liquid column is given by Jurin&#x27;s law
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the liquid-air surface tension (force/unit length), &quot;θ&quot; is the contact angle, &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of liquid (mass/volume), &quot;g&quot; is the local acceleration due to gravity (length/square of time), and &quot;r&quot; is the radius of tube.

As &quot;r&quot; is in the denominator, the thinner the space in which the liquid can travel, the further up it goes. Likewise, lighter liquid and lower gravity increase the height of the column.

For a water-filled glass tube in air at standard laboratory conditions, at 20°C, , and . Because water spreads on clean glass, the effective equilibrium contact angle is approximately zero. For these values, the height of the water column is
:formula_4

Thus for a {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} radius glass tube in lab conditions given above, the water would rise an unnoticeable {{convert|0.007|mm|in|abbr=on}}. However, for a {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} radius tube, the water would rise {{convert|0.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and for a {{convert|0.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} radius tube, the water would rise {{convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

=== Capillary rise of liquid between two glass plates ===
The product of layer thickness (&quot;d&quot;) and elevation height (&quot;h&quot;) is constant (&quot;d&quot;·&quot;h&quot; = constant), the two quantities are inversely proportional. The surface of the liquid between the planes is hyperbola.
== Liquid transport in porous media ==
When a dry porous medium is brought into contact with a liquid, it will absorb the liquid at a rate which decreases over time. When considering evaporation, liquid penetration will reach a limit dependent on parameters of temperature, humidity and permeability. This process is known as evaporation limited capillary penetration and is widely observed in common situations including fluid absorption into paper and rising damp in concrete or masonry walls. For a bar shaped section of material with cross-sectional area &quot;A&quot; that is wetted on one end, the cumulative volume &quot;V&quot; of absorbed liquid after a time &quot;t&quot; is
:formula_5
where &quot;S&quot; is the sorptivity of the medium, in units of m·s−1/2 or mm·min−1/2. This time dependence relation is similar to Washburn&#x27;s equation for the wicking in capillaries and porous media. The quantity
:formula_6
is called the cumulative liquid intake, with the dimension of length. The wetted length of the bar, that is the distance between the wetted end of the bar and the so-called &quot;wet front&quot;, is dependent on the fraction &quot;f&quot; of the volume occupied by voids. This number &quot;f&quot; is the porosity of the medium; the wetted length is then
:formula_7
Some authors use the quantity &quot;S/f&quot; as the sorptivity.

The above description is for the case where gravity and evaporation do not play a role.

Sorptivity is a relevant property of building materials, because it affects the amount of rising dampness. Some values for the sorptivity of building materials are in the table below.

<text>The Apodidae, or swifts, form a family of highly aerial birds. They are superficially similar to swallows, but are not closely related to any passerine species. Swifts are placed in the order Apodiformes along with hummingbirds. The treeswifts are closely related to the true swifts, but form a separate family, the Hemiprocnidae.

Resemblances between swifts and swallows are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles based on catching insects in flight.

The family name, Apodidae, is derived from the Greek ἄπους (&quot;ápous&quot;), meaning &quot;footless&quot;, a reference to the small, weak legs of these most aerial of birds. The tradition of depicting swifts without feet continued into the Middle Ages, as seen in the heraldic martlet.

==Taxonomy==

Taxonomists have long classified swifts and treeswifts as relatives of the hummingbirds, a judgment corroborated by the discovery of the Jungornithidae (apparently swift-like hummingbird-relatives) and of primitive hummingbirds such as &quot;Eurotrochilus&quot;. Traditional taxonomies place the hummingbird family (Trochilidae) in the same order as the swifts and treeswifts (and no other birds); the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy treated this group as a superorder in which the swift order was called Trochiliformes.

The taxonomy of the swifts is complicated, with genus and species boundaries widely disputed, especially amongst the swiftlets. Analysis of behavior and vocalizations is complicated by common parallel evolution, while analyses of different morphological traits and of various DNA sequences have yielded equivocal and partly contradictory results.

The Apodiformes diversified during the Eocene, at the end of which the extant families were present; fossil genera are known from all over temperate Europe, between today&#x27;s Denmark and France, such as the primitive swift-like &quot;Scaniacypselus&quot; (Early–Middle Eocene) and the more modern &quot;Procypseloides&quot; (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene – Early Miocene). A prehistoric genus sometimes assigned to the swifts, &quot;Primapus&quot; (Early Eocene of England), might also be a more distant ancestor.

===Species===

There are around 100 species of swifts, normally grouped into two subfamilies and four tribes.

Cypseloidinae
:*Tribe Cypseloidini
Apodinae
:*Tribe Collocaliini – swiftlets 
:*Tribe Chaeturini – needletails
:*Tribe Apodini – typical swifts

==Description==
Swifts are among the fastest of birds in level flight, and larger species like the white-throated needletail have been reported travelling at up to . Even the common swift can cruise at a maximum speed of 31 metres per second (). In a single year the common swift can cover at least 200,000 km, and in a lifetime, about two million kilometers.

The wingtip bones of swiftlets are of proportionately greater length than those of most other birds. Changing the angle between the bones of the wingtips and forelimbs allows swifts to alter the shape and area of their wings to increase their efficiency and maneuverability at various speeds. They share with their relatives the hummingbirds a special ability to rotate their wings from the base, allowing the wing to remain rigid and fully extended and derive power on both the upstroke and downstroke. The downstroke produces both lift and thrust, while the upstroke produces a negative thrust (drag) that is 60% of the thrust generated during the downstrokes, but simultaneously it contributes lift that is also 60% of what is produced during the downstroke. This flight arrangement might benefit the bird&#x27;s control and maneuverability in the air.

The swiftlets or cave swiftlets have developed a form of echolocation for navigating through dark cave systems where they roost. One species, the Three-toed swiftlet, has recently been found to use this navigation at night outside its cave roost too.

==Distribution and habitat==
Swifts occur on all the continents except Antarctica, but not in the far north, in large deserts, or on many oceanic islands. The swifts of temperate regions are strongly migratory and winter in the tropics. Some species can survive short periods of cold weather by entering torpor, a state similar to hibernation.

Many have a characteristic shape, with a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. The flight of some species is characterised by a distinctive &quot;flicking&quot; action quite different from swallows. Swifts range in size from the pygmy swiftlet (&quot;Collocalia troglodytes&quot;), which weighs 5.4 g and measures long, to the purple needletail (&quot;Hirundapus celebensis&quot;), which weighs and measures long.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

The nest of many species is glued to a vertical surface with saliva, and the genus &quot;Aerodramus&quot; use only that substance, which is the basis for bird&#x27;s nest soup. Other swifts select holes and small cavities in walls. The eggs hatch after 19 to 23 days, and the young leave the nest after a further six to eight weeks. Both parents assist in raising the young.

Swifts as a family have smaller egg clutches and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed for long periods of time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful.

===Feeding===

All swifts eat insects, such as dragonflies, flies, ants, aphids, wasps and bees as well as aerial spiders. Prey is typically caught in flight using the beak. Some species, like the chimney swift, hunt in mixed species flocks with other aerial insectivores such as members of Hirundinidae (swallows).

==Status==

No swift species has become extinct since 1600, but BirdLife International has assessed the Guam swiftlet as endangered and lists the Atiu, dark-rumped, Seychelles, and Tahiti swiftlets as vulnerable; twelve other species are near threatened or lack sufficient data for classification.

==Exploitation by humans==
The hardened saliva nests of the edible-nest swiftlet and the black-nest swiftlet have been used in Chinese cooking for over 400 years, most often as bird&#x27;s nest soup. Over-harvesting of this expensive delicacy has led to a decline in the numbers of these swiftlets, especially as the nests are also thought to have health benefits and aphrodisiac properties. Most nests are built during the breeding season by the male swiftlet over a period of 35 days. They take the shape of a shallow cup stuck to the cave wall. The nests are composed of interwoven strands of salivary cement and contain high levels of calcium, iron, potassium, and magnesium.

Kondo was hired by Nintendo in 1984 as their first dedicated composer and is currently a Senior Officer at their Entertainment Planning &amp; Development division.

==Early life==
Kondo was born in Nagoya, Japan, on August 13, 1961. Kondo began taking Yamaha Music classes from kindergarten, where he learned to play the electronic organ from the age of five. Kondo also played the marimbas in his elementary school band. He later improved his skills with the electronic organ in a cover band that played jazz and rock music. Kondo studied at the Art Planning Department of Osaka University of Arts, but was never classically trained or academically dedicated to music.

With a love of arcade video games such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and the early &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series, he said video games were the only place where he could find the kind of sound creation that he was looking for. He gained experience in composing, arranging pieces and computer programming through using the piano, and a computer to program music into the Famicom using Famicom BASIC.

==Career==
Kondo applied for a music composition and sound programming job at Nintendo as a senior in 1984. He recalls, &quot;I found my way to Nintendo by looking at the school&#x27;s job placement board. You&#x27;re supposed to apply to many different companies, but I saw the Nintendo ad, and had a love of making synthesizers, and loved games, and thought – that&#x27;s the place for me. I interviewed with one company, Nintendo, and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve been ever since.&quot; Kondo was the third person hired by Nintendo to create music and sound effects for its games, joining Hirokazu Tanaka and Yukio Kaneoka. However, he was the first at Nintendo to actually specialize in musical composition.

His first work at Nintendo was the audio design for the 1984 arcade game &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;. As the Famicom had become popular in Japan by then, Kondo was assigned to compose music for the console&#x27;s subsequent games at Nintendo&#x27;s new development division, Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD). His second work at Nintendo was an instruction manual on how to program Japanese popular music into the Famicom using the peripheral &quot;Family BASIC&quot;. To conclude his first year at Nintendo, he created some of the music of &quot;Devil World&quot;, alongside Akito Nakatsuka. In 1985, Nintendo started marketing the Famicom abroad as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to capitalize on the 1983 video game crash that had devastated Atari, Inc. and other companies. &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; was Kondo&#x27;s first major score. The game&#x27;s melodies were created with the intention that short segments of music could be endlessly repeated during the same gameplay without causing boredom. The main theme is iconic in popular culture and has been featured in more than 50 concerts, been a best-selling ringtone, and been remixed or sampled by various musicians.

Kondo&#x27;s work on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; scores has also become highly recognized. He produced four main pieces of background music for the first installment of the series; the overworld theme has become comparable in popularity with the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; main theme. After the success of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, he provided the score for two Japanese-exclusive games, &quot;The Mysterious Murasame Castle&quot; (1986) and &quot;Shin Onigashima&quot; (1987). He created the soundtrack to &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; (1987), which was later rebranded outside Japan as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; in 1988.

Kondo returned to the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series to produce the scores to &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; (1988) and the SNES launch title &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1990). Koichi Sugiyama directed a jazz arrangement album of &quot;Super Mario World&quot; music and oversaw its performance at the first Orchestral Game Musical Concert in 1991. After finishing the soundtrack to &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, Kondo was in charge of the sound programming for &quot;Pilotwings&quot; (1990), while also composing the &quot;Helicopter Theme&quot; for it, and created the sound effects for &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993). In 1995, he composed for the sequel to &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. Until the early 2000s, Kondo would usually write all compositions by himself on a project, with &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; being the last one Kondo worked on alone. Since then, he has been collaborating with other staff members at Nintendo, advising and supervising music created by others, as well as providing additional compositions for games, including &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot;. He also served as the sound director and lead composer of &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot;. He has also worked alongside Brian Tyler to compose for &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;.

===Concerts===
Kondo attended the world premiere of Play! A Video Game Symphony at the Rosemont Theater in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2006, where his music from the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series was performed by a full symphony orchestra. He also attended and performed in a series of three concerts celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series in late 2011. He performed piano with the American rock band Imagine Dragons live at The Game Awards 2014 ceremony in December 2014.

==Musical style and influences==
Kondo&#x27;s music for &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; was designed around the feeling of motion that mirrors the player&#x27;s physical experience. This followed the philosophy of series creator and designer Shigeru Miyamoto, who demanded that audio for the game be made &quot;with substance&quot; and synchronized with elements of the game. As a result, Kondo based most of the score around genres that are primarily used for dancing, such as Latin music and the waltz.

In the first &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, Kondo juxtaposes the game&#x27;s overworld theme with the theme that plays in dungeons. Kondo remarked on the importance of projecting distinct characters through music, so that players know almost immediately where they are within the game. Kondo used this contrast in other games, such as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

Kondo has cited Deep Purple, Yes, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Casiopea as influences.

<doc id="219033" wikidata="Q2069629" url="?curid=219033" title="Hellcats of the Navy">
<text>Hellcats of the Navy is a 1957 American black-and-white World War II submarine film drama from Columbia Pictures, produced by Charles H. Schneer and directed by Nathan Juran. The film stars Ronald Reagan and his wife, billed under her screen name Nancy Davis, and Arthur Franz. This was the only feature film in which the Reagans acted together, either before or after their 1952 marriage.

The film&#x27;s setting is the Pacific War. The film&#x27;s storyline concerns Commander Casey Abbott, skipper of the submarine USS &quot;Starfish&quot;, being ordered to retrieve a new type of Japanese mine in the waters off the Asiatic mainland. When diver Wes Barton, Abbott&#x27;s rival for the affections of Nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair, gets into a life-threatening situation, Abbott must keep his personal and professional lives separate when dealing with the crisis. 
The story is based on the 1955 non-fiction book &quot;Hellcats of the Sea&quot; by Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood and Hans Christian Adamson.

==Plot==
Commander Casey Abbott (Ronald Reagan), commander of the submarine USS &quot;Starfish&quot;, is ordered to undertake a dangerous mission which sees him attempting to cut off the flow of supplies between China and Japan in the heavily mined waters off the Asiatic mainland. When a diver, who is Abbott&#x27;s competitor for the affections of nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair (Nancy Davis) back home, gets into a dangerous situation, Abbott must struggle to keep his personal and professional lives separate in dealing with the crisis.

The results arouse ill feelings in the crew and especially Abbott&#x27;s executive officer, Lt. Commander Landon (Arthur Franz), who asks his captain to let him air his views in confidence. The results lead Abbott to write in Landon&#x27;s efficiency report that he should never be given command of a naval vessel, resulting in further ill will between the two.

==Cast==

* Ronald Reagan as Commander Casey Abbott
* Nancy Davis as Nurse Lt. Helen Blair
* Arthur Franz as Lt. Cmdr. Don Landon
* Robert Arthur as Freddy Warren
* William Leslie as Lt. Paul Prentice
* William Phillips as Carroll
* Harry Lauter as Lt. Wes Barton
* Michael Garth as Lt. Charlie
* Joseph Turkel as Chick
* Don Keefer as Jug

==Production==
Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz appears as himself to introduce the film, and he is later played in the story by actor Selmer Jackson. Retired Navy officer Charles A. Lockwood, chief author of the book on which this feature was based, is also portrayed briefly by an actor.

It was the second film Nathan Juran directed for producer Charles Schneer.

Reagan said in his autobiography that he was disappointed, overall, in the film, having expected a result more like &quot;Destination Tokyo,&quot; a major Warner Bros. submarine film made during World War II. The diminishing status of the feature films that Reagan was being offered, plus his increasing involvement with television, led to his leaving the big screen forever.

The United States Navy provided extensive cooperation by allowing portions of the film to be shot at Naval Base San Diego and aboard an actual U.S. submarine, possibly . The executive officer of the submarine was Lloyd Bucher, who would go on to command the during its capture by North Korea in 1968.

During the film&#x27;s production, as USS &quot;Besugo&quot; was about to get underway, an argument ensued between the director and one of the unions. There was only a short window of opportunity to maneuver the boat away from the pier, as it was difficult for a submarine tied up in San Diego to get underway while a tide was running. &quot;Besugo&quot; was one of the first submarines to employ nylon rope lines, and when stretched, the lines could get about &quot;as big around as a pencil&quot; and become lethal if they broke under strain. The order was given to the helmsman to answer all bells. Reagan happened to be on deck practicing his dialog lines and hollering out, &quot;Ahead one third, starboard back full ...&quot; About this time, the nylon ropes were stretched to their breaking point when an officer gave the command, &quot;All stop, ALL STOP, Goddammit, ALL STOP!&quot; and Reagan, totally oblivious to what was going on, continued to practice his lines, rocking back and forth on his feet with his hands behind his back, as if nothing were wrong.

Among the stock music used in the film were excerpts from &quot;The Caine Mutiny March&quot;, composed by Max Steiner, the main title theme for the 1954 Columbia Pictures feature film &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;. That film was also about World War II U.S. Navy operations in the Pacific theater; Arthur Franz appears as well in the minor role of Lt. (jg) Paynter.

According to Maurice Manson, who played Vice-Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, shooting for the film was completed in five days.

==Film premiere==
&quot;Hellcats of the Navy&quot; had its official premiere in San Diego, at the downtown Spreckels Theater. The film&#x27;s stars were in attendance, as were local U. S. Navy brass and submariners. A program preceded the showing of the film. On a flatbed trailer in front of the theater were displayed one Mark 14 torpedo and one Mark 16 torpedo, the two types used by navy submarines during World War II.

==DVD reviews== 
Glenn Erickson of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; reviewed the DVD release of &quot;Hellcats of the Navy&quot; and thought that although the direction was &quot;competent&quot;, the script was &quot;completely derivative and cornball&quot;. He went on to criticize the lack of realistic supporting characters and the film&#x27;s use of obvious stock footage, especially that of a U. S. Navy patrol boat portraying a Japanese ship. Overall, he described the film itself as &quot;fair&quot;. David Krauss of &quot;Digitally Obsessed&quot; described the production values as &quot;bargain basement&quot; and found that the cast&#x27;s stiff performances alienated viewers. He gave the film a &quot;C&quot; for style and a &quot;B-&quot; for substance, although he also described the direction as &quot;dry as a military briefing&quot; on CNN.

Erick Harper at &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; has written that &quot;Hellcats&quot; followed a series of submarine war film clichés, like the &quot;love triangle&quot; and familiar elements of the action sequences. He compared parts of the film to the TV series &quot;Star Trek&quot; (which premiered almost a decade later), in that it follows a standard Hollywood formula for its plot. He described Ronald Reagan as &quot;comfortable&quot; and &quot;believable&quot;, and said that the film was &quot;worth checking out for the historical value, if nothing else&quot;.

<doc id="219038" wikidata="Q915886" url="?curid=219038" title="Frutiger (typeface)">
<text>Frutiger (pronounced ) is a series of typefaces named after its Swiss designer, Adrian Frutiger. Frutiger is a humanist sans-serif typeface, intended to be clear and highly legible at a distance or at small text sizes. A popular design worldwide, type designer Steve Matteson described its structure as &quot;the best choice for legibility in pretty much any situation&quot; at small text sizes, while Erik Spiekermann named it as &quot;the best general typeface ever&quot;.

==Distinctive characteristics==

Characteristics of this typeface are:

;Lowercase: square dot over the letters &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;; double-storey &quot;a&quot;, single-storey &quot;g&quot;. Wide, open apertures on letters such as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;s&quot;. Very high x-height, increasing its clarity.
;Uppercase: Wide &quot;A&quot; with a very low centre bar, though less obvious in bold weight. &quot;Q&quot; with a stroke below the circle only. Univers-like &quot;M&quot;, square and with centre strokes descending to the base of the letter. 
;Figures: diagonal serif on the &quot;1&quot;; closed &quot;4&quot;.
;Oblique: The slanted version is an oblique in which the letterforms are slanted, rather than a true italic. Some versions not drawn by Frutiger do add a true italic (see Frutiger Next below).

The typeface in its original incarnation uses the Frutiger numbering system.

==History==

Frutiger is a sans-serif typeface by the Swiss type designer Adrian Frutiger. It is the text version of Frutiger&#x27;s earlier typeface Roissy, commissioned in 1970/71 by the newly built Charles de Gaulle Airport at Roissy, France, which needed a new directional sign system, which itself was based on Concorde, a font Frutiger had created in the early 1960s.

The beginning of Frutiger starts from Concorde, a sans-serif font Frutiger was commissioned to design in 1961-4 by the minor metal type company Sofratype. Frutiger was asked to create a design that would not be too similar to his previous Univers, a reinvention of classic 19th-century typefaces. In practice the design was drawn by his colleague (and fellow Swiss in Paris) André Gürtler as Frutiger was busy. Frutiger wrote of it: &quot;I felt I was on the right track with this grotesque; it was a truly novel typeface.&quot; Gürtler too wrote of feeling that the design was innovative: &quot;this style didn&#x27;t exist in grotesques at the time, except for Gill Sans.&quot; Despite Frutiger and Gürtler&#x27;s enthusiasm, the design failed to sell well and was discontinued with the end of the metal type period: Frutiger wrote that Linotype, who bought Sofratype, &quot;weren&#x27;t aware of the fact that with Concorde they had a totally up-to-date typeface.&quot;

Some years later, Frutiger was commissioned to develop a typeface for Roissy Airport. Frutiger had earlier created an alphabet inspired by Univers and Peignot for Paris Orly Airport, but found the experience a failure due to lack of control and the insistence that all text be in capitals only. As a result, he proposed a modified version of Concorde, refining it following research into legibility. The Roissy typeface was completed in 1972. Impressed by the quality of the Roissy airport signage, the typographical director of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company approached Frutiger in 1974 to turn it into a typeface for print.

In designing the typeface&#x27;s predecessors Concorde and Roissy, Frutiger&#x27;s goal had been to create a sans-serif typeface with the rationality and cleanliness of Univers but the organic and proportional aspects of Gill Sans. According to Frutiger, &quot;What was important, was total clarity – I would even call it nudity – an absence of any kind of artistic addition.&quot; Designing Frutiger as a print version of Roissy, this principle resulted in a distinctive and legible typeface. The letter properties originally suited to the needs of Charles de Gaulle: a modern appearance and legibility at various angles, sizes, and distances. Ascenders and descenders are very prominent, and apertures are wide to easily distinguish letters from one another. While the open a c e s characters have a humanist design, other characters are more similar in proportion to grotesque and neo-grotesque types like Frutiger&#x27;s own Univers. Improvements on Roissy included better spacing.

The Frutiger family was released publicly in 1976 by the Stempel type foundry in conjunction with Linotype. Frutiger became extremely popular for uses such as corporate and transportation branding. In 2008 it was the fifth best-selling typeface of the Linotype foundry.

===Frutiger Linotype===
This is a version of the original Frutiger font family licensed to Microsoft. This family consists of Frutiger 55, 56, 65, and 66. It does not include OpenType features or kerning, but it adds support to Latin Extended-B and Greek characters, with Frutiger 55 supporting extra IPA characters and spacing modifier letters. Unlike most Frutiger variants, Frutiger Linotype features old-style figures as the default numeral style.

Frutiger Linotype can be found in Microsoft products featuring Microsoft Reader and in the standalone Microsoft Reader package.

===ASTRA-Frutiger===
This is a variant of Frutiger used by ASTRA (acronym of the &quot;&quot;, the Swiss Federal Road Office) as the new font for traffic signs, replacing VSS in 2003. It is based on Frutiger 57 Condensed, but with widening ascenders and descenders, which are intended to give the eye a better hold than the earlier version did.

A family of two fonts were made, called ASTRA-Frutiger-Standard/standard and ASTRA-Frutiger-Autobahn/autoroute.

==Frutiger Next==

The Frutiger family was updated in 1997 for signage at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. The new version, Frutiger Next, changed a number of details and added a true italic style in place of the oblique roman of the original.

Frutiger Next was commercially available in 2000 under Linotype. The family include six font weights, with a bonus Ultra Light weight in the OpenType version. It supports ISO Adobe 2, Adobe CE, and Latin Extended characters. OpenType features include small caps, old style figures, superscript and subscript, ordinals, proportional lining figures, and case forms. Font names are no longer numbered with the Frutiger system. Frutiger Black was renamed to Frutiger Next Heavy, and Frutiger Ultra Black was changed to Frutiger Next Black. Condensed fonts no longer include italic variants. In addition to italic type, characters such as the cent sign (¢), the copyright symbol (©), the ampersand (&amp;), the at sign (@), the sharp S (ß), Omega (Ω), and the integral symbol (∫) were redesigned. Cyrillic letters had not been produced until Frutiger Next W1G.

While Frutiger Next added considerably to Frutiger&#x27;s feature set, it added a modish 1990s true italic (not drawn by Frutiger) instead of the sharper oblique Frutiger preferred for sans-serif typefaces throughout his career, over Frutiger&#x27;s objections. In his autobiography, Frutiger commented that in resigning himself to it &quot;Maybe I was too soft to say what I really felt...I didn&#x27;t have the strength and patience anymore.&quot;

===Frutiger Next Greek (2005)===
This is a variant of Frutiger Next designed with Eva Masoura for Linotype, originally published as a TDC2 2006 entry.

===Frutiger Next W1G (2009)===
This is an expanded version of Frutiger Next W1G. It added Greek (from Frutiger Next Greek) and Cyrillic character sets, but advertised OpenType features were reduced to superscript and subscript. Only an OpenType version has been produced.

==Frutiger Arabic (2007)==
This is a font family designed by Lebanese designer Nadine Chahine as a companion to Frutiger in consultation with Adrian Frutiger. It is based on the Kufic style, but incorporates aspects of Ruqʿah script and Naskh in the letter form designs, resulting in what Linotype called &quot;humanist Kufi&quot;. The fonts consist of Basic Latin and ISO-Latin characters derived from the original Frutiger family, with Arabic characters supporting presentation forms A and B. Four font weights were produced.

==Frutiger Serif (2008)==
This is a serif font family designed by Adrian Frutiger and Akira Kobayashi. It is a re-envisioning of the metal type version of Meridien, a typeface first released by Deberny &amp; Peignot during the 1950s.

The family consists of roman and italic fonts in five weights and two widths each.

==Neue Frutiger (2009)==
This is an expanded version of the original Frutiger family designed by Adrian Frutiger and Akira Kobayashi. Unlike the original family, the Frutiger numbering scheme is not used.

Initial release of the family has twenty fonts in ten weights and one width, returning to complementary obliques. It supports ISO Adobe, Adobe CE, and Latin Extended characters. OpenType features include subscript and superscript.

===Neue Frutiger Condensed (2010)===
On April 7, 2010, Monotype Imaging Holdings announced condensed versions of the Neue Frutiger fonts. Designed by Akira Kobayashi, the expansion of the family includes twenty fonts in the same weight and style combination as the original release, in OpenType Pro font format.

===Neue Frutiger W1G (2011)===
This version supports Greek and Cyrillic characters.

The family includes forty fonts in ten weights and two widths, with a complementary oblique.

==Neue Frutiger 1450 (2013)==
It is a version of Neue Frutiger compliant with the German standard DIN 1450, designed by Akira Kobayashi.

The family includes eight fonts, in four weights (book, regular, medium, bold) and one width, with a complementary oblique.

OpenType features include denominator/numerator, fractions, ligatures, localized forms, ordinals, proportional figures, subscript/superscript, scientific inferiors, stylistic alternates (two sets), ornaments, kerning.

== Neue Frutiger World (2018) ==
In 2018, Monotype introduces Neue Frutiger World with several characters more than 150 languages, in Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Georgian, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai and Vietnamese. Additionally, in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

==Similar types==
Adobe&#x27;s Myriad and Microsoft&#x27;s Segoe UI are two prominent humanist typefaces whose similarities to Frutiger have aroused controversy. Frutiger described Myriad as &#x27;not badly done&#x27; but said that the similarities had gone &#x27;a little too far&#x27;. However, in an interview, Adrian Frutiger commended the work of Myriad&#x27;s co-designer, Robert Slimbach: &quot;except the unnecessary doubt concerning Myriad, his work is also very good.&quot; Additionally, the italic style of Myriad is cursive, while the original version of Frutiger uses a slanted Roman style rather than a true italic.

In the 1970s, Frutiger designed Icone, a wedge-serif design with mild stroke modulation, which has many similarities in basic letter structure to Frutiger, and in overall effect to Albertus.

Sony&#x27;s SST, designed by Akira Kobayashi in 2013, was modeled after Frutiger and Helvetica, the latter of which Sony had used previously.

Other typefaces inspired by Frutiger, but not without creative liberties to it, include Aganè, by Italian designer Danilo de Marco in 2017, and LT Asus (after Taiwanese computer manufacturer Asus), by American designer Daniel Lyons in 2021.

<text>Bedtime for Bonzo is a 1951 American comedy film directed by Fred de Cordova and starring Ronald Reagan, Diana Lynn, and a chimpanzee named Peggy as Bonzo. Its central character, a psychology professor (Reagan), tries to teach human morals to a chimpanzee, hoping to solve the &quot;nature versus nurture&quot; question.

A sequel, &quot;Bonzo Goes to College&quot;, was released in 1952, but featured none of the three lead performers from the original film.

==Plot==
Valerie Tillinghast, daughter of a prominent college dean, is engaged to psychology professor Peter Boyd. When Tillinghast’s father discovers that Peter is the son of a former criminal, he forbids the marriage, declaring Peter&#x27;s blood to be tainted, in line with his strong belief in heredity as an influence on character. As Peter believes equally strongly in the opposite, he aims to prove that he can raise a chimpanzee as one would a human child in a law-abiding household.

After acquiring a chimpanzee named Bonzo from colleague Hans Neumann, Peter seeks a nanny, ultimately settling on a young woman named Jane. Together, they act as Bonzo&#x27;s parents, teaching him good habits and providing the simulation of a loving family environment. One afternoon, Bonzo inadvertently turns on the vacuum cleaner and leaps out of the window in alarm, climbing a tree. Jane takes chase, and Bonzo jumps back into the house and dials the emergency services as he has been instructed to do. He then returns to the tree and removes the ladder, leaving Jane stranded until Peter can help her. Valerie arrives just as the firemen are helping them down and misreads the situation, angrily returning Peter&#x27;s ring.

Tillinghast warns that Bonzo is to be sold to Yale University for medical research, and Jane overhears Peter and Neumann discussing the imminent end of the experiment. As she&#x27;s developed romantic feelings for Peter, Jane is so shocked that she allows Bonzo to escape on his tricycle. Peter follows him to a jewelry store, where Bonzo grabs a necklace. When Bonzo refuses to return it, Peter tries to do so himself, only to be arrested. Jane instructs Bonzo to surrender the necklace as he has been taught; he obediently returns to the store and replaces it where he had found it in the window. With the experiment judged a success, Tillinghast decides not to sell Bonzo and bestows his blessing on Peter and Jane&#x27;s impending marriage.

==Production==
During production Reagan was nearly suffocated by the chimpanzee when it pulled on Reagan&#x27;s necktie. After he broke free the tie had to be cut off Reagan&#x27;s neck by a crewmember.

==Reception==
A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a minor bit of fun yielding a respectable amount of laughs but nothing, actually, over which to wax ecstatic.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;a lot of beguiling nonsense with enough broad situations to gloss over plot holes ... Cameras wisely linger on the chimp&#x27;s sequences and his natural antics are good for plenty of laughter.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;If you can stomach all this, you&#x27;ll find some giggles in this farce, which is okay when paying attention to the recently deceased chimp, but is perfectly terrible when trying to tell its story. Ronald Reagan, as the naive professor of things mental, must have felt like the world&#x27;s sappiest straight man playing this silly role, and the others aren&#x27;t much better off.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67%, based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 5.83/10.

As president, Reagan screened the film for staff and guests at Camp David.

==Sequel==
In 1952, a sequel, &quot;Bonzo Goes to College&quot;, was released. However, none of the original three leads appeared. Peggy, who had also appeared in &quot;My Friend Irma Goes West&quot; (1950), died in a fire on March 4, 1951, so another chimpanzee was hired. Reagan declined as he believed the premise implausible.

<text>A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, while others are built into the load appliances that they power. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices. Other functions that power supplies may perform include limiting the current drawn by the load to safe levels, shutting off the current in the event of an electrical fault, power conditioning to prevent electronic noise or voltage surges on the input from reaching the load, power-factor correction, and storing energy so it can continue to power the load in the event of a temporary interruption in the source power (uninterruptible power supply).

All power supplies have a &quot;power input&quot; connection, which receives energy in the form of electric current from a source, and one or more &quot;power output&quot; or power rail connections that deliver current to the load. The source power may come from the electric power grid, such as an electrical outlet, energy storage devices such as batteries or fuel cells, generators or alternators, solar power converters, or another power supply. The input and output are usually hardwired circuit connections, though some power supplies employ wireless energy transfer to power their loads without wired connections. Some power supplies have other types of inputs and outputs as well, for functions such as external monitoring and control.

==General classification==

===Functional===

Power supplies are categorized in various ways, including by functional features. For example, a &quot;regulated&quot; power supply is one that maintains constant output voltage or current despite variations in load current or input voltage. Conversely, the output of an &quot;unregulated&quot; power supply can change significantly when its input voltage or load current changes. &quot;Adjustable&quot; power supplies allow the output voltage or current to be programmed by mechanical controls (e.g., knobs on the power supply front panel), or by means of a control input, or both. An &quot;adjustable regulated&quot; power supply is one that is both adjustable and regulated. An &quot;isolated&quot; power supply has a power output that is electrically independent of its power input; this is in contrast to other power supplies that share a common connection between power input and output.

===Packaging===
Power supplies are packaged in different ways and classified accordingly. A &quot;bench&quot; power supply is a stand-alone desktop unit used in applications such as circuit test and development. &quot;Open frame&quot; power supplies have only a partial mechanical enclosure, sometimes consisting of only a mounting base; these are typically built into machinery or other equipment. &quot;Rack mount&quot; power supplies are designed to be secured into standard electronic equipment racks. An &quot;integrated&quot; power supply is one that shares a common printed circuit board with its load. An &quot;external&quot; power supply, &quot;AC adapter&quot; or &quot;power brick&quot;, is a power supply located in the load&#x27;s AC power cord that plugs into a wall outlet; a &quot;wall wart&quot; is an external supply integrated with the outlet plug itself. These are popular in consumer electronics because of their safety; the hazardous 120 or 240 volt main current is transformed down to a safer voltage before it enters the appliance body.

===Power conversion method===

Power supplies can be broadly divided into &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;switching&quot; types. Linear power converters process the input power directly, with all active power conversion components operating in their linear operating regions. In switching power converters, the input power is converted to AC or to DC pulses before processing, by components that operate predominantly in non-linear modes (e.g., transistors that spend most of their time in cutoff or saturation). Power is &quot;lost&quot; (converted to heat) when components operate in their linear regions and, consequently, switching converters are usually more efficient than linear converters because their components spend less time in linear operating regions.

==Types==

=== DC power supplies ===

An AC-to-DC power supply operates on an AC input voltage and generates a DC output voltage. Depending on application requirements the output voltage may contain large or negligible amounts of AC frequency components known as ripple voltage, related to AC input voltage frequency and the power supply&#x27;s operation. A DC power supply operating on DC input voltage is called a DC-to-DC converter. This section focuses mostly on the AC-to-DC variant.

==== Linear power supply ====
In a linear power supply the AC input voltage passes through a power transformer and is then rectified and filtered to obtain a DC voltage. The filtering reduces the amplitude of AC mains frequency present in the rectifier output and can be as simple as a single capacitor or more complex such as a pi filter. The electric load&#x27;s tolerance of ripple dictates the minimum amount of filtering that must be provided by the power supply. In some applications, ripple can be entirely ignored. For example, in some battery charging applications, the power supply consists of just a transformer and a diode, with a simple resistor placed at the power supply output to limit the charging current.

==== Switched-mode power supply ====

In a switched-mode power supply (SMPS), the AC mains input is directly rectified and then filtered to obtain a DC voltage. The resulting DC voltage is then switched on and off at a high frequency by electronic switching circuitry, thus producing an AC current that will pass through a high-frequency transformer or inductor. Switching occurs at a very high frequency (typically 10 kHz — 1 MHz), thereby enabling the use of transformers and filter capacitors that are much smaller, lighter, and less expensive than those found in linear power supplies operating at mains frequency. After the inductor or transformer secondary, the high frequency AC is rectified and filtered to produce the DC output voltage. If the SMPS uses an adequately insulated high-frequency transformer, the output will be electrically isolated from the mains; this feature is often essential for safety.

Switched-mode power supplies are usually regulated, and to keep the output voltage constant, the power supply employs a feedback controller that monitors current drawn by the load. The switching duty cycle increases as power output requirements increase.

SMPSs often include safety features such as current limiting or a crowbar circuit to help protect the device and the user from harm. In the event that an abnormal high-current power draw is detected, the switched-mode supply can assume this is a direct short and will shut itself down before damage is done. PC power supplies often provide a &quot;power good&quot; signal to the motherboard; the absence of this signal prevents operation when abnormal supply voltages are present.

Some SMPSs have an absolute limit on their minimum current output. They are only able to output above a certain power level and cannot function below that point. In a no-load condition the frequency of the power slicing circuit increases to great speed, causing the isolated transformer to act as a Tesla coil, causing damage due to the resulting very high voltage power spikes. Switched-mode supplies with protection circuits may briefly turn on but then shut down when no load has been detected. A very small low-power dummy load such as a ceramic power resistor or 10-watt light bulb can be attached to the supply to allow it to run with no primary load attached.

The switch-mode power supplies used in computers have historically had low power factors and have also been significant sources of line interference (due to induced power line harmonics and transients). In simple switch-mode power supplies, the input stage may distort the line voltage waveform, which can adversely affect other loads (and result in poor power quality for other utility customers), and cause unnecessary heating in wires and distribution equipment. Furthermore, customers incur higher electric bills when operating lower power factor loads. To circumvent these problems, some computer switch-mode power supplies perform power factor correction, and may employ input filters or additional switching stages to reduce line interference.

====Capacitive (transformerless) power supply====

A capacitive power supply (transformerless power supply) uses the reactance of a capacitor to reduce the mains voltage to a smaller AC voltage. Typically, the resulting reduced AC voltage is then rectified, filtered and regulated to produce a constant DC output voltage.

The output voltage is not isolated from the mains. Consequently, to avoid exposing people and equipment from hazardous high voltage, anything connected to the power supply must be reliably insulated.

The voltage reduction capacitor must withstand the full mains voltage, and it must also have enough capacitance to support maximum load current at the rated output voltage. Taken together, these constraints limit practical uses of this type of supply to low-power applications.

====Linear regulator====
The function of a &quot;linear voltage regulator&quot; is to convert a varying DC voltage to a constant, often specific, lower DC voltage. In addition, they often provide a current limiting function to protect the power supply and load from &quot;overcurrent&quot; (excessive, potentially destructive current).

A constant output voltage is required in many power supply applications, but the voltage provided by many energy sources will vary with changes in load impedance. Furthermore, when an unregulated DC power supply is the energy source, its output voltage will also vary with changing input voltage. To circumvent this, some power supplies use a linear voltage regulator to maintain the output voltage at a steady value, independent of fluctuations in input voltage and load impedance. Linear regulators can also reduce the magnitude of ripple and noise on the output voltage.

===AC power supplies ===

An AC power supply typically takes the voltage from a wall outlet (mains supply) and uses a transformer to step up or step down the voltage to the desired voltage. Some filtering may take place as well. In some cases, the source voltage is the same as the output voltage; this is called an isolation transformer. Other AC power supply transformers do not provide mains isolation; these are called autotransformers; a variable output autotransformer is known as a variac. Other kinds of AC power supplies are designed to provide a nearly constant current, and output voltage may vary depending on impedance of the load. In cases when the power source is direct current, (like an automobile storage battery), an inverter and step-up transformer may be used to convert it to AC power. Portable AC power may be provided by an alternator powered by a diesel or gasoline engine (for example, at a construction site, in an automobile or boat, or backup power generation for emergency services) whose current is passed to a regulator circuit to provide a constant voltage at the output. Some kinds of AC power conversion do not use a transformer. If the output voltage and input voltage are the same, and primary purpose of the device is to filter AC power, it may be called a line conditioner. If the device is designed to provide backup power, it may be called an uninterruptible power supply. A circuit may be designed with a voltage multiplier topology to directly step-up AC power; formerly, such an application was a vacuum tube AC/DC receiver.

In modern use, AC power supplies can be divided into single phase and three phase systems. AC power Supplies can also be used to change the frequency as well as the voltage, they are often used by manufacturers to check the suitability of their products for use in other countries. 230 V 50 Hz or 115 60 Hz or even 400 Hz for avionics testing.

====AC adapter====

An AC adapter is a power supply built into an AC mains power plug. AC adapters are also known by various other names such as &quot;plug pack&quot; or &quot;plug-in adapter&quot;, or by slang terms such as &quot;wall wart&quot;. AC adapters typically have a single AC or DC output that is conveyed over a hardwired cable to a connector, but some adapters have multiple outputs that may be conveyed over one or more cables. &quot;Universal&quot; AC adapters have interchangeable input connectors to accommodate different AC mains voltages.

Adapters with AC outputs may consist only of a passive transformer; in case of DC-output, adapters consist of either transformer with few diodes and capacitors or they may employ switch-mode power supply circuitry. AC adapters consume power (and produce electric and magnetic fields) even when not connected to a load; for this reason they are sometimes known as &quot;electricity vampires&quot;, and may be plugged into power strips to allow them to be conveniently turned on and off.

=== Programmable power supply ===
* For the extended USB Standard PPS see: USB Power Delivery

A programmable power supply (PPS) is one that allows remote control of its operation through an analog input or digital interface such as RS-232 or GPIB. Controlled properties may include voltage, current, and in the case of AC output power supplies, frequency. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including automated equipment testing, crystal growth monitoring, semiconductor fabrication, and x-ray generators.

Programmable power supplies typically employ an integral microcomputer to control and monitor power supply operation. Power supplies equipped with a computer interface may use proprietary communication protocols or standard protocols and device control languages such as SCPI.

=== Uninterruptible power supply ===
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) takes its power from two or more sources simultaneously. It is usually powered directly from the AC mains, while simultaneously charging a storage battery. Should there be a dropout or failure of the mains, the battery instantly takes over so that the load never experiences an interruption. Instantly here should be defined as the speed of electricity within conductors which is somewhat near the speed of light. That definition is important because transmission of high speed data and communications service must have continuity/NO break of that service. Some manufacturers use a quasi standard of 4 milliseconds. However, with high speed data even 4 ms of time in transitioning from one source to another is not fast enough. The transition must be made in a break before make method. The UPS meeting that requirement is referred to as a True UPS or a Hybrid UPS. How much time the UPS will provide is most often based on batteries and in conjunction with generators. That time can range from a quasi minimum 5 to 15 minutes to hours or even days. In many computer installations, it is only enough time on batteries to give the operators time to shut down the system in an orderly way. Other UPS schemes may use an internal combustion engine or turbine to supply power during a utility power outage and the amount of battery time is then dependent upon how long it takes the generator to be on line and the criticality of the equipment served. Such a scheme is found in hospitals, data centers, call centers, cell sites and telephone central offices.

=== High-voltage power supply ===

A high-voltage power supply is one that outputs hundreds or thousands of volts. A special output connector is used that prevents arcing, insulation breakdown and accidental human contact. Federal Standard connectors are typically used for applications above 20 kV, though other types of connectors (e.g., SHV connector) may be used at lower voltages. Some high-voltage power supplies provide an analog input or digital communication interface that can be used to control the output voltage. High-voltage power supplies are commonly used to accelerate and manipulate electron and ion beams in equipment such as x-ray generators, electron microscopes, and focused ion beam columns, and in a variety of other applications, including electrophoresis and electrostatics.

High-voltage power supplies typically apply the bulk of their input energy to a power inverter, which in turn drives a voltage multiplier or a high turns ratio, high-voltage transformer, or both (usually a transformer followed by a multiplier) to produce high voltage. The high voltage is passed out of the power supply through the special connector and is also applied to a voltage divider that converts it to a low-voltage &quot;metering&quot; signal compatible with low-voltage circuitry. The metering signal is used by a closed-loop controller that regulates the high voltage by controlling inverter input power, and it may also be conveyed out of the power supply to allow external circuitry to monitor the high-voltage output.

===Bipolar power supply===

A bipolar power supply operates in all four quadrants of the voltage/current Cartesian plane, meaning that it will generate positive and negative voltages and currents as required to maintain regulation. When its output is controlled by a low-level analog signal, it is effectively a low-bandwidth operational amplifier with high output power and seamless zero-crossings. This type of power supply is commonly used to power magnetic devices in scientific applications.

== Specification ==
The suitability of a particular power supply for an application is determined by various attributes of the power supply, which are typically listed in the power supply&#x27;s &quot;specification&quot;. Commonly specified attributes for a power supply include:

* Input voltage type (AC or DC) and range
* Efficiency of power conversion
* The amount of voltage and current it can supply to its load
* How stable its output voltage or current is under varying line and load conditions
* How long it can supply energy without refueling or recharging (applies to power supplies that employ portable energy sources)
* Operating and storage temperature ranges
* Output is constant voltage type or constant current type

Commonly-used abbreviations used in power supply specifications:
* SCP - Short circuit protection
* OPP - Overpower (overload) protection
* OCP - Overcurrent protection
* OTP - Overtemperature protection
* OVP - Overvoltage protection
* UVP - Undervoltage protection
* CV - Constant voltage
* CC - Constant current
* PFC - Power factor correction
* THD - Total harmonic distortion

== Thermal management ==
The power supply of an electrical system tends to generate heat. The higher the efficiency, the less heat is generated by the power supply. There are many ways to manage the heat of a power supply unit. The types of cooling generally fall into two categories -- convection and conduction. Common convection methods for cooling electronic power supplies include natural air flow, forced air flow, or other liquid flow over the unit. Common conduction cooling methods include heat sinks, cold plates, and thermal compounds.

== Overload protection ==
Power supplies often have protection from short circuit or overload that could damage the supply or cause a fire. Fuses and circuit breakers are two commonly used mechanisms for overload protection.

A fuse contains a short piece of wire which melts if too much current flows. This effectively disconnects the power supply from its load, and the equipment stops working until the problem that caused the overload is identified and the fuse is replaced.
Some power supplies use a very thin wire link soldered in place as a fuse. Fuses in power supply units may be replaceable by the end user, but fuses in consumer equipment may require tools to access and change.

A circuit breaker contains an element that heats, bends and triggers a spring which shuts the circuit down. Once the element cools, and the problem is identified the breaker can be reset and the power restored.

Some power supplies use a thermal cutout buried in the transformer rather than a fuse. The advantage is it briefly allows greater current to be drawn than the maximum allowed continuous current. Some such cutouts are self resetting, some are single use only.

=== Current limiting ===
Some supplies use current limiting instead of cutting off power if overloaded. The two types of current limiting used are electronic limiting and impedance limiting. The former is common on lab bench power supplies, the latter is common on supplies of less than 3 watts output.

A foldback current limiter reduces the output current to much less than the maximum non-fault current.

==Applications==
Power supplies are a fundamental component of many electronic devices and therefore used in a diverse range of applications. This list is a small sample of the many applications of power supplies.

===Computers===
A modern computer power supply is a switch-mode power supply that converts AC power from the mains supply, to several DC voltages. Switch-mode supplies replaced linear supplies due to cost, weight, efficiency and size improvements. The diverse collection of output voltages also have widely varying current draw requirements.

===Electric Vehicles===
Electric vehicles are those which rely on energy created through electricity generation. A power supply unit is part of the necessary design to convert high voltage vehicle battery power.

===Welding===
Arc welding uses electricity to join metals by melting them. The electricity is provided by a &quot;welding power supply&quot;, and can either be AC or DC. Arc welding requires high currents typically between 100 and 350 amperes. Some types of welding can use as few as 10 amperes, while some applications of spot welding employ currents as high as 60,000 amperes for an extremely short time. Welding power supplies consisted of transformers or engines driving generators; modern welding equipment uses semiconductors and may include microprocessor control.

===Aircraft===
Both commercial and military avionic systems require either a DC-DC or AC/DC power supply to convert energy into usable voltage. These may often operate at 400 Hz in the interest of weight savings.

===Automation===
This refers to conveyors, assembly lines, bar code readers, cameras, motors, pumps, semi-fabricated manufacturing and more.

===Medical===

These include ventilators, infusion pumps, surgical and dental instruments, imaging and beds.

<text>America was the first ship of the line built for the Continental Navy, but she never saw service there, being given to France after launching.

== History ==
On 20 November 1776, the Continental Congress authorized the construction of three 74-gun ships of the line. One of these was &quot;America&quot;, laid down in May 1777 in the shipyard of John Langdon on Rising Castle Island (now Badger&#x27;s Island) in Kittery, Maine, across the Piscataqua River from Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

However, progress on her construction was delayed by a chronic scarcity of funds and a consequent shortage of skilled craftsmen and well seasoned timber. The project dragged on for over two years under the immediate supervision of Col. James Hackett as master shipbuilder and the overall direction of John Langdon. Then, on 6 November 1779, the Marine Committee named Captain John Barry as her prospective commanding officer and ordered him to &quot;...hasten, as much as will be in your power, the completing of that ship...&quot;

Nevertheless, the difficulties which previously had slowed the building of the warship continued to prevail during the ensuing months, and little had been accomplished by mid-March 1780 when Barry applied for a leave of absence to begin on the 23rd. However he did perform one notable service for the ship. In November 1777, after inspecting the unfinished vessel which was slated to become his new command, he strongly recommended against a proposal, then under consideration, to reduce her to a 54-gun frigate. His arguments carried the day, and the Marine Committee decided to continue the work of construction according to the ship&#x27;s original plans.

All possibility of Barry&#x27;s commanding &quot;America&quot; ended on 5 September 1780 when he was ordered to Boston to take command of the 36-gun frigate &quot;Alliance&quot; which had recently arrived from Europe. Over nine months later, on 23 June 1781, Congress ordered the Continental Agent of Marine, Robert Morris, to get &quot;America&quot; ready for sea and, on the 26th, picked Captain John Paul Jones as her commanding officer. Jones reached Portsmouth on 31 August and threw himself into the task of completing the man-of-war. However, before the work was finished, Congress decided on 3 September 1782 to present the ship to King Louis XVI of France to replace the ship of the line &quot;Magnifique&quot;, which had run aground and been destroyed on 11 August 1782 while attempting to enter Boston Harbor. The ship was also to symbolize the new nation&#x27;s appreciation for France&#x27;s service to and sacrifices in behalf of the cause of the American patriots.

Despite his disappointment over losing his chance to command the largest warship yet built in America, Jones remained in Portsmouth striving to finish the new ship. The home in which he boarded is now known as the John Paul Jones House and is a National Historic Landmark. His labors bore fruit on 5 November 1782 when &quot;America&quot; – held partially back by a series of ropes calculated to break in sequence to check the vessel&#x27;s acceleration, lest she come to grief on the opposite bank of the river – slipped gracefully into the waters of the Piscataqua. After she had been rigged and fitted out, the ship – commanded by M. le Chevalier de Macarty Martinge (who had commanded &quot;Magnifique&quot; when she was wrecked) departed Portsmouth on 24 June 1783 and reached Brest, France, on 16 July. Armed with a main battery of 18-pounder at a time when French 74&#x27;s carried 24-pdr and 36-pdr guns, &quot;America&quot; would have a relatively weak broadside compared to other French ships-of-the-line.

Little is known of her subsequent service under the French flag other than the fact it was brief. A bit over three years later, she was carefully examined by a survey committee which found her damaged by dry rot beyond economical repair, probably caused by her wartime construction from green timber. She was accordingly scrapped and a much larger &quot;America&quot; with nearly twice her weight of shot was built to take her place.

<doc id="219048" wikidata="Q371406" url="?curid=219048" title="John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan">
<text>Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan (born 18 December 1934 – disappeared 8 November 1974, declared dead 3 February 2016), commonly known as Lord Lucan, was a British peer and gambler who vanished in 1974 after being suspected of killing his children&#x27;s nanny and attempting to murder his wife.

An evacuee during World War II, Lucan attended Eton College and served with the Coldstream Guards in West Germany from 1953 to 1955. Having developed a taste for gambling, he played backgammon and bridge, and was an early member of the exclusive group of wealthy British gamblers at the Clermont Club. Lucan&#x27;s losses often exceeded his winnings, yet he left his job at a London-based merchant bank and became a professional gambler. He was known as Lord Bingham from April 1949 until January 1964, during his father&#x27;s lifetime.

Lucan was known for his expensive tastes: he raced power boats and drove an Aston Martin. In 1963, Lucan married Veronica Duncan, with whom he had three children. The couple moved home to 46 Lower Belgrave Street in Belgravia in 1967, paying £17,500 for the house. After the marriage collapsed in late 1972, he moved out to a nearby property. A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan eventually lost. Apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children, Lucan began to spy on his wife and record their telephone conversations. This fixation, combined with mounting legal expenses and gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on Lucan&#x27;s life and personal finances.

On the night of 7 November 1974, Sandra Rivett, the nanny of Lucan&#x27;s children, was murdered in the Lucan family home. A wounded Lady Lucan burst into the Plumbers Arms; she claimed to have been attacked by her husband and that he had admitted to killing Rivett. Lord Lucan had, by then, telephoned his mother, asking her to collect his children, and driven to visit a friend in Uckfield, East Sussex; he penned letters, protesting his innocence, claiming that he had intervened with an intruder attacking his wife and that his wife accused him of hiring a hitman to kill her. In the early hours of 8 November, Lucan drove off. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven. Despite police issuing a warrant for his arrest, Lucan was never found. At the inquest into Rivett&#x27;s death, held in June 1975, the jury returned a verdict naming Lucan as her killer. Lucan was declared legally dead in 1999, and a death certificate issued in 2016 allowed his titles to be inherited by his son George. Lucan&#x27;s involvement in Rivett&#x27;s murder and his fate remain a subject of debate, various theories, and continuing research.

==Early life and education==
Richard John Bingham was born on 18 December 1934 at 19 Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, the second child and elder son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, an Anglo-Irish peer, and his wife, Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson. John was the great-great-grandson of George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan, who led the Charge of the Light Brigade. A blood clot found in his mother&#x27;s lung forced her to remain in a nursing home, so John, as he became known, was initially cared for by the family&#x27;s nurserymaid, Lucy Sellers. Aged three years, John attended a pre-prep school in Tite Street with his elder sister Jane. In 1939, with the Second World War approaching, the two were taken to the relative safety of Wales.

In 1940, joined by their younger siblings Sally and Hugh, the Lucan children travelled to Toronto in Canada, moving shortly thereafter to Mount Kisco, New York, United States. They stayed for five years with multi-millionairess Marcia Brady Tucker. John was enrolled at The Harvey School and spent summer holidays away from his siblings at a summer camp in the Adirondack Mountains.

While in the US, John and his siblings lived in grandeur and wanted for nothing, but on their return to England in February 1945 they were faced with the stark realities of wartime Britain. Rationing was still in force, their former home at Cheyne Walk had been bombed, and the family&#x27;s house at 22 Eaton Square had had its windows blown out. Despite the family&#x27;s noble ancestry, the 6th Earl and his wife were agnostics and socialists who preferred a more austere existence than that offered by Tucker, an extremely wealthy Christian. For a time, John suffered nightmares and was taken to a psychotherapist. As an adult he remained an agnostic, but ensured that his children attended Sunday school, preferring to give them a traditional childhood.

At Eton College, John developed a taste for gambling. He supplemented his pocket money with income from bookmaking, placing his earnings into a &quot;secret&quot; bank account, and regularly left the school&#x27;s grounds to attend horse races. According to his mother, John&#x27;s academic record was &quot;far from creditable&quot;, but he became captain of Roe&#x27;s House before leaving in 1953 to undertake his National Service. He became a second lieutenant in his father&#x27;s regiment, the Coldstream Guards, and was stationed mainly in Krefeld, West Germany. While there, he also became a keen poker player.

==Career==
On leaving the British Army in 1954, Lucan joined William Brandt&#x27;s Sons and Co., a London-based merchant bank, on an annual salary of £500. In 1960 he met Stephen Raphael, a rich stockbroker who was a skilled backgammon player. They holidayed together in the Bahamas, went water-skiing, and played golf, backgammon and poker. Lucan became a regular gambler and an early member of John Aspinall&#x27;s Clermont gaming club, located in Berkeley Square.

Lucan often won at games of skill like backgammon and bridge, but he also accumulated huge losses. On one occasion Lucan lost £8,000, or about two-thirds of the money he received annually from various family trusts. On another disastrous night at a casino he lost £10,000. His uncle by marriage, stockbroker John Bevan, helped him to pay that particular debt, and Lucan repaid his uncle two years later.

Lucan left Brandt&#x27;s around 1960, shortly after he had won £26,000 playing chemin de fer. A colleague had been promoted before him, leading Lucan to leave his job in protest, saying, &quot;Why should I work in a bank, when I can earn a year&#x27;s money in one single night at the tables?&quot; Lucan travelled to the US, where he played golf, raced power boats, and drove his Aston Martin around the West Coast. He also visited his elder sister Jane and his former guardian, Marcia Tucker. On his return to England he moved out of his parents&#x27; home in St John&#x27;s Wood and into a flat in Park Crescent.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and lifestyle===
Lucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963. She was born in 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife, Thelma. Veronica&#x27;s father had died in a car accident when she was young, after which the family moved to South Africa. Her mother remarried, and her family returned to England, where her new stepfather became manager of a hotel in Guildford. With her sister, Christina, she was educated at St Swithun&#x27;s School, Winchester.

After displaying a talent for art, Veronica went on to study at an art college in Bournemouth. The two sisters later shared a flat in London, where Veronica worked as a model and later as a secretary. Christina&#x27;s marriage to the wealthy William Shand Kydd (half-brother to Peter Shand Kydd, stepfather of Diana Spencer, later Princess of Wales) introduced her to London high society, and it was at a golf-club function in the country that Veronica and Lucan first met.
News of their engagement appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspapers on 14 October 1963, and the two were married at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, on 20 November. After a ceremony attended by Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (one of whose ladies-in-waiting had been a relative of Lady Lucan), but few other prominent members of high society, the couple honeymooned in Europe, travelling first class on the Orient Express. Lucan&#x27;s already embattled finances were given a welcome boost by his father, who provided him with a marriage settlement designed to finance a larger family home and any future additions to the Lucan family. Lucan repaid some of his creditors and purchased 46 Lower Belgrave Street in Belgravia, redecorating it to suit Veronica&#x27;s tastes.

Two months after the wedding, on 21 January 1964, Lucan&#x27;s father died of a stroke. In addition to a reputed £250,000 inheritance, Lucan acquired his father&#x27;s titles: Earl of Lucan; Baron Lucan of Castlebar; Baron Bingham of Melcombe Bingham and Baronet Bingham of Castlebar. His wife became the Countess of Lucan.

The couple had three children:
*Lady Frances Bingham, born on 24 October 1964
*George Bingham, 8th Earl of Lucan, born on 21 September 1967
*Lady Camilla Bingham, born on 30 June 1970.

Following the 1964 birth of their first daughter, Frances, from early in 1965, they employed a nanny, Lillian Jenkins, to look after her. Lucan tried to teach Veronica about gambling and traditional pursuits like hunting, shooting, and fishing. He bought her golf lessons; she later gave up the sport.

Lucan&#x27;s daily routine consisted of breakfast at 9:00 am, coffee, dealing with the morning&#x27;s letters, reading the newspapers, and playing the piano. He sometimes jogged in the park and took his Dobermann for walks. Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon games of backgammon. Returning home to change into black tie, the earl typically spent the remainder of the day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica. In 1965, while still working at Brandt&#x27;s, he had written of his desire to have &quot;£2m in the bank&quot;, claiming that &quot;motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays, and security for the future would give myself and a lot of other people a lot of pleasure&quot;.

Lucan was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, &quot;luxuriant guardsman&#x27;s moustache,&quot; and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular. His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin drophead coupé, drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing power boats. In September 1966 he unsuccessfully screen tested for a part in &quot;Woman Times Seven&quot;, prompting him to decline a later offer from film producer Albert R. Broccoli to screen test him for the role of James Bond.

As a professional gambler, Lucan was a skilled player, once rated amongst the world&#x27;s top 10 backgammon competitors. He won the St James&#x27;s Club tournament and was champion of the west coast of America. He gained the moniker &quot;Lucky&quot; Lucan, but his losses easily outweighed his winnings, and in reality he was anything but lucky. Lucan had interests in thoroughbred horses; in 1968, he paid more in race entry fees than he received in winnings. Despite some arguments over money, Veronica remained largely ignorant of his losses, retaining the use of accounts at Savile Row tailors and various Knightsbridge shops.

Following the births of George and Camilla, Veronica suffered post-natal depression. Lucan became increasingly involved in her mental well-being, and in 1971 took her for treatment at a psychiatric clinic in Hampstead, where she refused to be admitted. Instead, she agreed to home visits from a psychiatrist and a course of antidepressants. In July 1972, the family holidayed in Monte Carlo, but Veronica quickly returned to England, leaving Lucan with their two elder children. The combined pressures of maintaining their finances, the costs of Lucan&#x27;s gambling addiction, and Veronica&#x27;s weakened mental condition took their toll on the marriage; two weeks after a strained family Christmas in 1972, Lucan moved into a small property in Eaton Row.

===Separation===
Some months later Lucan moved again, to a larger rented flat in nearby Elizabeth Street. Despite an early attempt by his wife at reconciliation, by that point all Lucan wanted from the marriage was custody of his children. In an effort to demonstrate that Veronica was unfit to look after them, Lucan began to spy on his family (his car was regularly seen parked in Lower Belgrave Street), later employing private detectives to perform the same task. He also canvassed doctors, who explained that his wife had not &quot;gone mad&quot;, but was suffering from depression and anxiety.

Lucan told his friends that nobody would work for Veronica – she had sacked Jenkins, the children&#x27;s long-term nanny, in December 1972. Of the series of nannies employed in the house, one, 26-year-old Stefanja Sawicka, was told by Veronica that Lucan had hit her with a cane and had, on one occasion, pushed her down the stairs. The countess apparently feared for her safety and told Sawicka not to be surprised &quot;if he kills me one day.&quot;

Sawicka&#x27;s time at the Lucan household ended late in March 1973. While with two of the children near Grosvenor Place, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Veronica applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case&#x27;s complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973.

To defend herself against Lucan&#x27;s claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan&#x27;s case depended on Veronica&#x27;s being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments &quot;in camera&quot;, on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan&#x27;s character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.

Thus began a bitter dispute between the couple, involving many of their friends and Veronica&#x27;s own sister. Lucan again began to watch his wife&#x27;s movements. He recorded some of their telephone conversations with a small Sony tape recorder and played excerpts to any friends prepared to listen; he also told themand his bank managerthat Veronica had been &quot;spending money like water&quot;. Lucan continued to pay her £40 a week and may have cancelled their regular food order with Harrods. He delayed payment to the milkman andknowing that Veronica was required by the court to employ a live-in nannythe childcare agency. With no income of her own, Veronica took a part-time job in a local hospital.

A temporary nanny, Elizabeth Murphy, was befriended by Lucan, who bought her drinks and asked her for information on his wife. He instructed his detective agency to investigate Murphy, looking for evidence that she was failing in her duty of care to his children. This they found; he dispensed with the detective agency&#x27;s services when they presented him with bills amounting to several hundred pounds. Murphy was later hospitalised with cancer. Another temporary nanny, Christabel Martin, reported strange telephone calls to the house, some with heavy breathing and some from a man asking for non-existent people. Following a series of temporary nannies, Sandra Rivett started work in late 1974.

===Gambling===
Losing the court case proved devastating for Lucan. It had cost him an estimated £20,000; by late 1974, his financial position was dire. As he drank more heavily and started chain-smoking, his friends began to worry. In drunken conversations with some of them, including Aspinall and his mother Lady Osborne, Lucan discussed murdering his wife. Greville Howard later gave a statement to the police describing how Lucan had talked of how killing his wife might save him from bankruptcy, how her body might be disposed of in the Solent and how he &quot;would never be caught&quot;.

Lucan borrowed £4,000 from his mother and asked Tucker for a loan of £100,000. Having no luck there, he wrote to Tucker&#x27;s son, explaining how he wished to &quot;buy&quot; his children from Veronica; the money was not forthcoming. He turned to his friends and acquaintances, asking anyone plausible to loan him money to fund his gambling addiction. The financier James Goldsmith guaranteed a £5,000 overdraft for him, which for years remained unpaid.

Lucan also applied to the discreet Edgware Trust. On request, he supplied details of his income, which was apparently around £12,000 a year from various family trusts. Lucan was required to provide a surety and received only £3,000 of the £5,000 he asked for. Much to their managers&#x27; consternation, his four bank accounts were overdrawn; Coutts, £2,841; Lloyds, £4,379; National Westminster, £1,290; Midland, £5,667. Even though by then he was playing for much lower stakes than had previously been the case, Lucan&#x27;s gambling remained completely out of control. Ranson (1994) estimates that between September and October 1974 alone, the earl ran up debts of around £50,000. Taki Theodoracopulos, who recalled Lucan as a close friend for more than a decade, lent him £3,000 in cash three nights before the murder.

Despite these problems, from late October 1974, Lucan&#x27;s demeanour appeared to change for the better. His best man, John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan&#x27;s apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While having dinner with his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On 6 November, he met his uncle John Bevan, apparently in good spirits. Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun, who said that &quot;he seemed very happy, just his usual self, and there was nothing to suggest that he was worried or depressed&quot;. He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver Graham Hill.

At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00 pm and 4:00 am, so Lucan often gambled into the early hours of the morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7 November, though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early in the morning, and at 10:30 am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to eat at the Clermont at about 3:00 pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun drove past the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find Lucan&#x27;s car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00 pm lunch appointment with artist Dominic Elwes and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.

At 4:00 pm, Lucan called at a chemist&#x27;s on Lower Belgrave Street, close to Veronica&#x27;s home, and asked the pharmacist there to identify a small capsule. It turned out to be Limbitrol 5, a drug for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Lucan had apparently made several similar visits since he separated from his wife; he never told the pharmacist where he got the drugs. At 4:45 pm, he called a friend, literary agent Michael Hicks-Beach; between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm, Lucan met with him at Hicks-Beach&#x27;s flat flat on Elizabeth Street. Lucan wanted his help with an article on gambling he had been asked to write for an Oxford University magazine.

Lucan drove Hicks-Beach home at about 8:00 pm, not in his Mercedes-Benz, but in &quot;an old, dark, and scruffy Ford&quot;, possibly a Ford Corsair he borrowed from Michael Stoop several weeks earlier. At 8:30 pm, he called the Clermont to check on a reservation for dinner with Greville Howard and friends. Howard had called him at 5:15 pm and asked if he wished to come to the theatre, but Lucan had declined and made the alternative suggestion to meet at the Clermont at 11:00 pm. He failed to arrive and did not answer his telephone when called.

==Murder of Sandra Rivett==
===Sandra Rivett===

Sandra Eleanor Rivett was born on 16 September 1945, the third child of Albert and Eunice Hensby. The family moved to Australia when she was two years old, but returned in 1955. Sandra was a popular child, described at school as &quot;intelligent, although she does not excel academically&quot;. She worked for six months as an apprentice hairdresser before taking a job as a secretary in Croydon.

After a failed romance, Sandra became a voluntary patient at a mental hospital near Redhill, Surrey, where she was treated for depression. She became engaged to a builder named John and took a job as a children&#x27;s nanny for a doctor in Croydon. On 13 March 1964, she gave birth to a boy named Stephen, but, as her relationship with John was failing, she returned home to live with her parents and considered giving the baby up for adoption. Her parents took on the responsibility and adopted him in May 1965.

Sandra later worked at a home for the elderly before moving to Portsmouth to stay with her older sister. While there she met Roger Rivett; the two married on 10 June 1967 in Croydon. Roger was serving as a Royal Navy able seaman and later worked as a loader for British Road Services, while Sandra worked part-time at Reedham Orphanage in Purley. In mid-1973 he took a job on an Esso tanker, returning to their flat in Kenley a few months later, by which time Sandra was employed by a cigarette company in Croydon.

The marriage collapsed in May 1974 when, suspicious of Sandra&#x27;s movements while he was away, Roger went to live with his parents. She was by then listed on the books of a Belgravia domestic agency and had been caring for an elderly couple in that district. A few weeks later she began to work for the Lucans.

Sandra normally went out with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had changed her night off and had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00 pm on 7 November. 

Lady Lucan later claimed that after putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55 pm, Sandra asked her if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. Wondering what had delayed her nanny when she did not come back, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor and called to Rivett from the top of the basement stairs when she was attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to &quot;shut up.&quot; Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband&#x27;s voice. The two continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal.

Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica&#x27;s face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.

Lucan may have arrived at the Chester Square home of Madelaine Florman (mother of one of Frances&#x27;s school friends) sometime between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm. Alone in the house, Florman ignored the door, but shortly afterwards she received an incoherent telephone call and put the receiver down. Bloodstains, which after forensic examination were found to be a mixture of blood groups A and B, were later discovered on her doorstep. Lucan certainly called his mother between 10:30 pm and 11:00 pm and asked her to collect the children from Lower Belgrave Street. According to the dowager countess, he spoke of a &quot;terrible catastrophe&quot; at his wife&#x27;s home. He told her that he had been driving past the house when he saw Veronica fighting with a man in the basement. He had entered the property and found his wife screaming.

The location from which Lucan made this call, and possibly the call to Florman, remains unknown. The police forced their way into Lady Lucan&#x27;s home and discovered Rivett&#x27;s body before his wife was taken by ambulance to St George&#x27;s Hospital. Lucan drove the Ford Corsair to Uckfield, East Sussex, to visit his friends, the Maxwell-Scotts. Susan Maxwell-Scott&#x27;s meeting with Lucan was his last confirmed sighting.

===Investigation===

By the time Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on 8 November, the divisional surgeon had pronounced Rivett dead, and forensic officers and photographers had been called to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, there was no sign of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica&#x27;s first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained.

A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett&#x27;s arm protruded from a canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.

Officers also searched 5 Eaton Row, into which Lucan had moved early in 1973, interviewed his mother, whom he had called to take the children to her home in St John&#x27;s Wood, and searched his last address at 72a Elizabeth Street. Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan&#x27;s wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and spectacles were on a bedside table. His passport was in a drawer and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat.

Ranson then visited Lady Lucan at St George&#x27;s Hospital. Although heavily sedated, she was able to describe what had happened to her. A police officer was left to guard her should her assailant return. Rivett&#x27;s body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.

After removing her corpse from the canvas sack and beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson he was certain that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Rivett&#x27;s parents confirmed that she had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.

Hours earlier, Lucan had again called his mother, at about 12:30 am. He told her that he would be in touch later that day, but declined to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand Kydd at his country house near Leighton Buzzard and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them. After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, he took them to Ranson.

When asked why she did not immediately inform the police of Lucan&#x27;s presence, Susan said she had not seen any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts, that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan&#x27;s children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Lady Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend&#x27;s home in Plymouth.

The Ford Corsair that Lucan had been seen driving, and whose details had the previous day been circulated across the country, was found on 10 November in Norman Road, Newhaven, about from Uckfield. In its boot was a piece of lead pipe covered in surgical tape and a full bottle of vodka. The car was removed for forensic examination. Later statements from two witnesses suggest that it was parked there sometime between 5:00 am and 8:00 am on the morning of 8 November. Its owner, Michael Stoop, also received a letter from Lucan, delivered to his club, the St James&#x27;s. However, Stoop threw the envelope away and it was therefore not possible to check its postmark to see from where it had been sent.

Ranson suspected a suicide, but a thorough search of Newhaven Downs was judged impossible. A partial search was made using tracker dogs, but all that was found were the skeletal remains of a judge who had disappeared years earlier. Police divers searched the harbour, and a partial search using infrared photography was undertaken the following year, to no avail. A warrant for Lucan&#x27;s arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett and attempting to murder his wife, was issued on 12 November. Descriptions of his appearance, already issued to police forces across the UK, were then issued to Interpol.

===Forensic science===

The scientific examination of the lead pipes found at the murder scene and in the Corsair&#x27;s boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46 Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan&#x27;s (blood group A) and Rivett&#x27;s (B) blood. Hair belonging to Lady Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Rivett. The pipe found inside the Corsair had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely.

The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair&#x27;s boot.

An examination of the blood stains found inside 46 Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked at the top of the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan&#x27;s was also found inside the car.

===Media reaction===
By the afternoon of 8 November, the newspapers&#x27; early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like &quot;Body in sack ... countess runs out screaming&quot;, and &quot;Belgravia murder – earl sought&quot;. A meeting that day at the Clermont between Aspinall, Meinertzhagen, Kydd, Elwes, Charles Benson, and Stephen Raphael became the cause of much press speculation. Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but the relationship between the Metropolitan Police and Lucan&#x27;s social circle was strained; some officers complained that an &quot;Eton mafia&quot; worked against them.

Susan Maxwell-Scott refused to add to her statement, and when Aspinall&#x27;s mother, Lady Osborne, was asked if she could help locate Lucan&#x27;s body, she replied, &quot;The last I heard of him, he was being fed to the tigers at my son&#x27;s zoo&quot;, prompting the police to search the house and the animal cages there. Police searched 14 country houses and estates, including Holkham Hall and Warwick Castle, to no avail.

Amidst concerns expressed by the Labour MP Marcus Lipton that some people were &quot;being a bit snooty&quot; with the police, Benson wrote a letter to the editor of &quot;The Times&quot; asking him to either identify those people or &quot;kindly withdraw his remarks&quot;. To its cost, the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; accused Goldsmith of being at the Clermont meeting, when he was actually in Ireland. Elwes went to see Lady Lucan in hospital and was reportedly deeply shocked both by her appearance and her statement, &quot;Who&#x27;s the mad one now?&quot; Elwes was apparently unhappy at some of the negative press coverage of the countess, and was later ostracised by his friends for his part in an article critical of Lucan, which appeared in &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot;. He died by suicide in September 1975.

Rivett&#x27;s case made headlines around the world. Within days of the murder, newspapers reported on Lady Lucan&#x27;s statement to the police, with claims that she had pretended to collude with her husband to ensure her safety. In January 1975, Lady Lucan gave an exclusive interview to the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. She also appeared in a murder reconstruction in the same newspaper, complete with posed photographs taken inside the house.

===Inquest===
The inquest into Sandra Rivett&#x27;s death opened on 13 November 1974 and was led by the coroner for inner west London, Gavin Thurston. Two witnesses were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife&#x27;s body, and the pathologist Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit on the head with a blunt instrument. At Ranson&#x27;s request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11 December 1974 and 10 March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16 June 1975.

The hearing began with introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33 witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Lady Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened on the night of the attack.

The dowager countess&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship or if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Lady Frances Bingham on 20 November 1974, read the young girl&#x27;s words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.

The landlord of the Plumbers Arms pub described how Lady Lucan had entered his bar covered &quot;head to toe in blood&quot; before she fell into &quot;a state of shock&quot;. He claimed that she shouted &quot;Help me, help me, I&#x27;ve just escaped from being murdered!&quot;, and &quot;My children, my children, he&#x27;s murdered my nanny!&quot; Simpson outlined his post-mortem examination, concluding that death was caused by &quot;blunt head injuries&quot; and &quot;inhalation of blood&quot;. He confirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was most likely responsible for Rivett&#x27;s injuries; some, to the left eye and mouth, he thought more likely to have been caused by punches from a clenched fist.

The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked &quot;dishevelled&quot;, and his hair &quot;a little ruffled&quot;. His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan had told her that he was walking or passing by the Lower Belgrave Street residence when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. He told Maxwell-Scott that the attacker ran off, and that Veronica was &quot;very hysterical&quot; and accused him of having hired a hitman to kill her.
Once the hearing had ended, Thurston made a summary of the evidence presented and told the jury their options. At 11:45 am, their foreman announced &quot;Murder by Lord Lucan&quot;. Lucan became the first member of the House of Lords to be named a murderer since 1760, when Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, was hanged for killing his bailiff. He was also the last person to be committed by a coroner to the Crown Court for unlawful killing; the coroner&#x27;s power to do so was removed by the Criminal Law Act 1977.

Rivett&#x27;s body, which had been held for several weeks following the murder, was released to her family and cremated at Croydon crematorium on 18 December 1974. A police spokesman cited Lady Lucan&#x27;s desire not to upset the family as a reason for her non-attendance at the cremation.

===Lucan&#x27;s defence===
Lucan&#x27;s friends and family were critical of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events. His mother told reporters that it did not serve &quot;any useful purpose at all&quot;. Veronica&#x27;s sister, Christina, said that she felt &quot;great sadness and sorrow&quot; at the verdict. Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl&#x27;s claims of innocence and claimed to feel &quot;awfully sorry&quot; for the countess.

However, as Lucan remained absent, his description of &quot;a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence&quot; came only from the letters he authored and the people he spoke with soon after Rivett&#x27;s murder. While his fingerprints were not found at the scene, his assertions make no provision for the lead pipe discovered in the boot of the Corsair, the claims by some that he discussed murdering his wife, or the lack of a viable suspect for the man he claimed to have seen fighting her. No sign of a forced entry was found, and officers attempting to demonstrate that Lucan could have seen into the basement kitchen, from the street, could only do so by stooping low to the pavement.

The light in the basement of 46 Lower Belgrave Street was not working, making it even more difficult to see into the room; its lightbulb (which was tested and found to be in working order) was found removed from its holder and left lying on a chair. Furthermore, Lady Lucan claimed not to have entered the basement that night, contradicting the earl&#x27;s version of events; his wife&#x27;s account is supported by the forensic examination made of the blood splashes and stains around the property.

Some traces of Lady Lucan&#x27;s blood were found in the basement, the rear garden and on the canvas sack used to store Rivett&#x27;s body; this may have been due to contamination at the scene. The man Lucan claimed to have seen could not have left through the basement&#x27;s front door as it was locked, and the rear door led to a walled garden through which no trace of an escape was found. No signs that the man left by the ground level front door were discovered, and no witnesses reported seeing any such person near 46 Lower Belgrave Street.

In contrast to his defenders, the national press were almost unanimous in their condemnation of Lucan. Their leader-writers ignored the risk of libel and identified him as Rivett&#x27;s killer.

==Bankruptcy and estate==

As Lucan&#x27;s bankruptcy proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors were informed that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust in the years immediately following his disappearance.

Lucan was presumed dead &quot;in chambers&quot; on 11 December 1992, and was declared legally dead on 27 October 1999. Lucan&#x27;s family was granted probate over his estate, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, was refused permission to take his father&#x27;s title and seat in the House of Lords. Following the passage of the Presumption of Death Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful with a High Court decision on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father&#x27;s title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.

==Aftermath and developments==

The last confirmed sighting of Lucan was by Susan Maxwell-Scott as he left the Maxwell-Scott property in Stoop&#x27;s Ford Corsair, and his fate is unknown. Ranson initially claimed that Lucan had &quot;done the honourable thing&quot; and &quot;fallen on his own sword&quot;, a view repeated by many of Lucan&#x27;s friends, including Aspinall, who said that he believed that the earl was guilty of Rivett&#x27;s murder and that he had committed suicide by scuttling his motorboat and jumping into the English Channel with a stone tied to his body. Lady Lucan believed that her husband had killed himself &quot;like the nobleman he was&quot;.

Ranson later changed his view, explaining that he considered it more likely that suicide was far from Lucan&#x27;s thoughts, that a drowning at sea was implausible, and that the earl had moved to southern Africa. A detective who led a new investigation into Lucan&#x27;s disappearance 32 years after the murder told the &quot;Telegraph&quot; that &quot;the evidence points towards the fact that Lord Lucan left the country and lived abroad for a number of years&quot;. Susan Maxwell-Scott told author John Pearson that Lucan might have been helped out of the country by shadowy underground financiers before being judged too great a risk, killed, and buried in Switzerland. Advertising executive Jeremy Scott proposed a similar theory, as he was familiar with some of the Clermont Set.

Lucan&#x27;s disappearance has captivated the public&#x27;s imagination for decades, with alleged sightings reported around the world. One of the earliest such sightings occurred shortly after the murder, but it turned out to be British politician John Stonehouse, who had attempted to fake his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia turned out to be an American businessman.

John Miller, a bounty hunter who had previously kidnapped fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs, claimed to have captured the earl in 1982, but was later exposed by the &quot;News of the World&quot; as a hoaxer. In 2003, a former Scotland Yard detective thought that he had tracked the earl to Goa, India, but the man whom he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from Merseyside. In 2007, reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl.

George Bingham responded to claims that the two eldest Lucan children were sent to Gabon in the early 1980s so that their father might secretly watch them &quot;from a distance&quot; and denied ever visiting the country. Lady Lucan dismissed the newspaper claims of sightings as &quot;nonsense&quot;, reiterating that her husband &quot;was not the sort of Englishman to cope abroad&quot;. George and his sister Lady Camilla are not convinced that their father was responsible for Rivett&#x27;s death.

Following the murder, Lady Lucan fell into an addiction to antidepressant drugs, resulting in her children being fostered by her in-laws, the Shand Kydds, in 1982. She remained estranged from her children for the remainder of her life. Lady Lucan died by suicide on 26 September 2017, believing she had undiagnosed Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She stated in her will that she was leaving all her money to Shelter because of her children&#x27;s &quot;lack of good manners&quot;, having not spoken to them since the 1980s. Her son George commented: &quot;I applaud the decision&quot;.

In 2020, a sighting of Lucan was reported in Australia; a pensioner living in suburban Brisbane was alleged to be Lord Lucan by Professor Hassan Ugail, a leading computer scientist. Ugail claimed state-of-the-art facial recognition technology had positively identified the man as Lucan. The man, who lives in what was described as a Buddhist commune in Brisbane&#x27;s outer suburbs, was found by Rivett&#x27;s son, Neil Berriman, and is reportedly the same age as Lucan. However, &quot;an earlier report by another facial recognition firm, Acumé Forensic, based in Leeds, concluded that Lucan and the man in Australia were not&quot; the same person, and &quot;in April 2021, following extensive inquiries and investigations made by the Australian federal police on behalf of the Metropolitan police, the person was conclusively eliminated from the investigation.&quot; 

The inquiry into Rivett&#x27;s death remains open. 

The 17-year investigation by Neil Berriman, assisted by investigative journalist Glen Campbell, is the subject of the three-part documentary series &quot;Lucan&quot;, broadcast by the BBC in November 2024. Campbell interviews an unnamed woman, claiming to have been Aspinall&#x27;s secretary, who recounts arranging a visit for the children to &quot;Treetops&quot; in Kenya, to enable Lucan to see them &quot;from a distance&quot;. She claims to have personally spoken with Lucan, by telephone, to confirm the arrangements. The documentary concludes with the old man named as Derek Crowther, but now going by the name Christopher Newman, who had performed in the production of the show &quot;Facade&quot;, in Canada, under the names Peter Jason/Jenny Romain in July 1969, five years before the murder, casting doubt on the belief that he is Lord Lucan.

Writer Laura Thompson developed some speculative theories involving long-disputed rumours about the Lucan marriage, which persisted for years. In a 2024 article, Thompson proposed a theory that Lady Lucan herself killed Rivett and framed her husband, drawing conclusions from tenuous circumstantial &quot;evidence&quot; such as Lady Lucan&#x27;s mental state, and the fact that a small amount of her blood, as well as Rivett&#x27;s, was present at the murder scene, and a medical doctor who testified at the inquest that it was possible, if unlikely, that Lady Lucan&#x27;s head injuries could have been self-inflicted. Thompson also wrote that Lady Lucan was described by her sister as &quot;a consummate actress&quot;. 

==Dramatisations==
The 1994 alternative history TV film &quot;The Trial of Lord Lucan&quot;, starring Julian Wadham as Lord Lucan, Lynsey Baxter as Lady Lucan and Jan Ruppe as Sandra Rivett, depicts what might have happened if Lucan had been arrested in Newhaven and stood trial for Rivett&#x27;s murder.

The 1998 film &quot;Bloodlines: Legacy of a Lord&quot; starring Richard Lintern as Lord Lucan, Elizabeth Garvie as Lady Lucan, Liz Cuti as Sandra Rivett, Brian Doherty as Rivett&#x27;s boyfriend, John Hankins, and Jack Toner as Sandra Rivett&#x27;s Child, depicts theories regarding Lucan&#x27;s involvement in the murder and fate.

A two-part miniseries &quot;Lucan&quot; was broadcast on ITV in December 2013. It was adapted from the John Pearson book &quot;The Gamblers&quot;, and was written and produced by Jeff Pope. Rory Kinnear played Lord Lucan, Catherine McCormack Lady Lucan and Leanne Best Sandra Rivett.
