<text>Currawongs are three species of medium-sized passerine birds belonging to the genus Strepera in the family Artamidae native to Australia. These are the grey currawong (&quot;Strepera versicolor&quot;), pied currawong (&quot;S. graculina&quot;), and black currawong (&quot;S. fuliginosa&quot;). The common name comes from the call of the familiar pied currawong of eastern Australia and is onomatopoeic. They were formerly known as crow-shrikes or bell-magpies. Despite their resemblance to crows and ravens, they are only distantly related to the corvidae, instead belonging to an Afro-Asian radiation of birds of superfamily Malaconotoidea.

Currawongs are not as terrestrial as the Australian magpie and have shorter legs. They are omnivorous, foraging in foliage, on tree trunks and limbs, and on the ground, taking insects and larvae (often dug out from under the bark of trees), fruit, and the nestlings of other birds.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Ornithologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe held that currawongs were more closely related to crows and ravens than the Australian magpie and butcherbirds, and duly placed them in the Corvidae. A review of the family Cracticidae by ornithologist John Albert Leach in 1914, during which he had studied their musculature, found that all three genera were closely related. Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between the woodswallows and the butcherbirds and relatives in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which later became the family Artamidae in the official Australian checklist in 2008. The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union has maintained the two clades as separate families, hence currawongs are listed along with butcherbirds, magpie and &quot;Peltops&quot;.

The family Cracticidae has its greatest diversity in Australia, which suggests that the radiation of its insectivorous and scavenger members to occupy various niches took place there. The butcherbirds became predators of small animals, much like the northern hemisphere shrikes, while the Australian magpie became a predominantly ground-hunting omnivore, with the currawongs generally hunting in both living and fallen trees, scavenging and hunting insects and small vertebrates, and occupying in Australia the niche of many Eurasian corvids. 

A 2013 genetic analysis by Anna Kearns and colleagues confirmed the currawongs are a monophyletic group, with some indication that the black currawong lineage diverged from a common ancestor of the grey and pied currawongs (though sampling was limited and not the focus of the study). The common ancestor of butcherbirds and currawongs diverged from peltops between 28.3 and 16.9 million years ago, which followed the expansion of open habitat in Australia 30 to 25 million years ago. The ancestors of currawongs then diverged from the ancestor of butcherbirds and magpie between 17.3 and 9.8 million years ago.

Currawongs and indeed all members of the broader Artamidae are part of a larger group of African shrike-like birds including bushshrikes (Malaconotidae), helmetshrikes (Prionopidae), ioras (Aegithinidae), and vangas (Vangidae), which were defined as the superfamily Malaconotoidea by Cacraft and colleagues in 2004. They are thus only distantly related to crows and ravens, which are in a separate superfamily Corvoidea.

===Species and races===
Although there are several distinct forms, the number of species has varied between two and seven, with three currently recognised. (In 1870 the Gardens of the Zoological Society of London had a living specimen of each of the three species.) Several subspecies of the grey currawong are fairly distinctive and described on that species page.
===Etymology===
The term &quot;currawong&quot; itself is derived from the call of the pied currawong. However, the exact origin of term is unclear; the most likely antecedent is the word &quot;garrawaŋ&quot; from the local Jagera language from the Brisbane region, although the Dharug word &quot;gurawaruŋ&quot; from the Sydney basin is a possibility. &quot;Yungang&quot; as well as &quot;kurrawang&quot; and &quot;kurrawah&quot; are names from the Tharawal people of the Illawarra region.

==Description==
The three currawong species are sombre-plumaged dark grey or black birds with large bills. They resemble crows and ravens, although are slimmer in build with longer tails, booted tarsi and white pages on their wings and tails. Their flight is undulating. Male birds have longer bills than females. The reason for this is unknown but suggests differentiation in feeding technique.

The true currawongs are a little larger than the Australian magpie, smaller than the ravens (except possibly the little raven, which is only slightly larger on average), but broadly similar in appearance. They are easily distinguished by their yellow eyes, in contrast to the red eyes of a magpie and white eyes of Australian crows and ravens. Currawongs are also characterised by the hooked tips of their long, sharply pointed beaks.

==Distribution and habitat==
Currawongs are protected in NSW under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974&quot;.

==Behaviour==
Currawongs are dominant birds that can drive off other species, especially when settling around an area used or inhabited by people. They have been known to migrate to towns and cities during the winter. Birds congregate in loose flocks.

The female builds the nest and incubates the young alone, although both parents feed them. The nests are somewhat flimsy for birds their size.

Currawongs can be friendly to humans and may form long lasting relationships. As of September 2021, a currawong had been visiting the same property in the Barrington Tops area of New South Wales for over eighteen years.

<text>Iván Calderón Marrero (born January 27, 1975) is a Puerto Rican former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2012. He is a two-weight world champion, having held the WBO mini flyweight title from 2003 to 2007 (making eleven successful defenses and being recognized as super champion by the organization), and the WBO, &quot; Ring&quot; magazine, and lineal light flyweight titles from 2007 to 2010 (making six successful defenses). Additionally, his August 2010 bout against Giovani Segura was named fight of the year by &quot; Ring&quot; magazine. As an amateur Calderón represented Puerto Rico in international competitions, including the 2000 Olympics.

Calderon was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2024 along such other notables as Michael Moorer, Diego Corrales, Ana Maria Torres, Ricky Hatton and Nick Charles.

== Personal life ==
Iván Calderón was born in the municipality of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico and currently resides in a sector called &quot;Las Americas&quot; in Bayamón. Iván had a troubling childhood surrounded by violence and problems, which according to him has helped him develop more patience which has helped him in his personal life. Calderón attended middle school in José Nevárez Landrón School, located in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. His first wife was Wilma Laguna, with whom he has two children, Wilvani and Iván junior. In an interview with &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; he noted that he engaged Laguna on August 29, 1997, following a &quot;quinceañero&quot; and the couple married on February 5, 1999. According to him the couple had some disagreements when they met, based on some attitudes he presented, he also notes that he felt she was arrogant at first. However, on one day he decided to propose to her and after four months of establishing a relationship the couple moved in together. Calderón expressed that he is &quot;too much of a house man&quot; and claims that as a result of a rule established by his former wife any kind of non-familiar activity is prohibited on Sundays. In January 2009, it was made public that Calderón and Laguna had established a divorce process.

He is married to A. Maldonado Garcia Dennisse; a prepared and educated woman. Maldonado has his Bachelors of Business Administration from the University Ana G. Mendez. Currently has a daughter named Diannelys E. Calderon.

Calderón spends the money that he earns boxing on properties and he is associated with a company dedicated to satellite vehicle tracking. He is employed by the City of Guaynabo&#x27;s Department of Sports and Recreation and has been involved in several youth-oriented charities in his native Puerto Rico, including lecturing in island schools and co-sponsoring a massive gift-giving effort in the town of Loíza&#x27;s Three Kings festival in early 2006. As a result of his charitable efforts with children that live in poor communities he was awarded a special award at the World Boxing Organization&#x27;s 2007 annual convention.

On November 16, 2011, Federal agents in Puerto Rico seized more than $4 million worth cocaine from a house owned by Calderon. Drug Enforcement Administration spokeswoman Laila Rico said 225 kilograms (nearly 500 pounds) of cocaine were found when agents raided the house in the coastal town of Humacao. Calderon denied knowledge of the narcotics and was never formally charged with an offence.

== Amateur career ==
In 1993, Calderón defeated Miguel Cotto in the light flyweight division, when both boxers were in the early stages of amateur experience. Following this, both athletes developed a close friendship. Calderón lost to Brian Viloria once during his amateur boxing career, but defeated him three times before turning professional. In addition, Calderon competed as an international amateur in several tournaments, including the following:

* 1999 3rd place as a Light Flyweight at Pan-American Games in Winnipeg, Canada. Results were:
** Defeated Wilfrido Valez (Colombia) points
** Defeated Mendeo Winston (Dominican Republic) points
** Lost to Maikro Romero (Cuba) points
* 2000 represented Puerto Rico as a light flyweight at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Result was:
** Lost to Masara La Paene (Indonesia) points

== Professional career ==
After turning professional, Calderón was frequently showcased on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot; show. On July 1, 2001, Calderón defeated José Manuel Ramírez by unanimous decision. During this fight, he suffered an open wound over his right eyebrow, which required surgery. On May 3, 2003, Calderón became a world champion for the first time, defeating Eduardo Marquez by a technical decision in nine rounds at Las Vegas, as part of the de la Hoya-Campas undercard, to win the World Boxing Organization&#x27;s world strawweight title. He had dropped Marquez twice before the end of the fight. Calderón retained his title by a 12-round decision in his first defense, on September 5, over Lorenzo Trejo of Mexico, at Caguas, Puerto Rico. In his second defense, held at Bayamón, he defeated former world champion Alex Sanchez by a unanimous twelve-round decision. On March 20, 2004, he retained the championship with an eleventh-round knockout win over former International Boxing Federation world champion Edgar Cardenas, in Guaynabo. Before that fight, Calderón obtained his high school credit diploma.

On July 31, 2004, as part of the Morales-Hernandez undercard in Las Vegas, he retained his title once again, with a twelve-round decision win over former world champion Roberto Leyva. On November 23 of that year, he made his fifth defense, defeating Nicaraguan Carlos Fajardo by a twelve-round unanimous decision. As part of the Barrera-Morales III undercard. His fight with Fajardo was shown live on HBO&#x27;s Pay per view. On April 30, of 2005, he retained the title with an eighth-round knockout victory over Noel Tunacao, a member of the Tunacao boxing family of the Philippines. On September 25, he retained his title for the seventh time, with a twelve-round unanimous decision over Mexico&#x27;s Gerardo Verde, at Atlantic City, New Jersey.

On December 10, 2004, Calderón retained the title again, this time with a twelve-round unanimous decision over former world champion Daniel Reyes. Calderón began 2006 by defending his title successfully on February 18, with a twelve-round unanimous decision over Isaac Bustos in Las Vegas. He would defend his title successfully twice in 2006 after his fight with Isaac Bustos. On April 29 against Miguel Tellez winning the fight by technical knock out thus gaining his sixth knock out victory. He finished his boxing year on October 21 by defeating José Luis Varela of Venezuela by unanimous decision. Following this fight the World Boxing Organization recognized him as a WBO Super Champion for reaching ten successful title defenses. On his first fight of 2007 that took place on March 28 in Barranquilla, Colombia Calderón defeated Ronald Barrera by split decision. Following his fight against Barrera Calderón announced that he was interested in changing weight and challenge one of the champions in the light flyweight division thus finishing his minimum weight run after twelve successful defenses of the division&#x27;s title.

During this timeframe, Freddie Roach selected Calderón as a sparring partner for Oscar De La Hoya. The reason for this was that the trainer was seeking a fast adversary. On November 16, 2008, Roach rememorated the event in his blog for &quot;The Ring&quot;, stating that &quot;Calderon slapped Oscar around like it was unbelievable.&quot; The trainer also noted that he asked De La Hoya to pursue the offense, but the boxer&#x27;s attempts were unsuccessful. In response, Calderón expressed that he participated in &quot;three or four rounds&quot; of sparring, during which he &quot;gave him problems&quot; and &quot;made him uncomfortable&quot;, while De La Hoya &quot;tried to hit&quot; but seemed &quot;out of timing&quot;. Similarly, Calderón competed against Shane Mosley in a four-round sparring match. The session was in preparation, serving as training for the first of a series of fights against Hugo Cázares. During the actual contest, Mosley had problems landing punches due to his adversary&#x27;s speed. While Calderón recognized that his opponent&#x27;s weight made the practice feel like a complete workout. Subsequently, Mosley expressed that &quot;Iván uses the angles very well and sparring against someone that moves so much is fun&quot;. Calderón noted that competing against a heavier boxer helped him adjust to the pressure that could be presented by Cázares.

=== Light flyweight division ===
On August 25, 2007, Calderón defeated Hugo Cázares by split decision to become the WBO and Lineal Light Flyweight Champion. Calderón entered the ring accompanied by a display of fireworks, before a crowd that featured several media personalities, including Oscar De La Hoya. The size difference between both pugilists was evident since the moment that they stood next to each other prior to the beginning of the fight. Early in the fight Calderón&#x27;s tactic consisted of connecting fast consecutive combinations while avoiding Cázares&#x27; punches. With this strategy he managed to stun Cazares with uppercuts and straight punches. During the fight the crowd displayed support for Calderón, at one point chanting &quot;Olé&quot; when his adversary&#x27;s punches missed. In the third round Cázares displayed a more fluid offensive, but in the fifth he presented a strategy that consisted of only throwing power punches which seemed to benefit Calderón. In the seventh round Ivan&#x27;s offensive pace slowed which benefited Hugo who improved on the offensive aspect. In the eighth round Cázares connected several hard punches which led to Calderón to rely on holds to slow his offense, in this round Cázares scored a knockdown. In the ninth he was in a defensive stance, and during the last rounds he continued this pattern and only connected solidly in the tenth round while Cázares missed several of the punches he threw. At the conclusion of the fight the judges awarded scores of 116-111 for Cázares and 115-112 twice for Calderón. With this victory he became the eleventh Puerto Rican boxer to win multiple world championships and unified this championship with the minimum division&#x27;s one until he vacated it following the announcement that he was going to continue in the light flyweight division. &quot;The Ring&quot; also recognized Calderón as their champion, dethroning Cázares.

Calderón was successful on his first light flyweight title defense when he defeated Juan Esquer in a card that took place on December 1, 2007, in New Mexico. During the course of the fight Esquer was more active offensively. During the first four rounds of the match Calderón used his boxing skills to avoid being hit by the punches thrown by Esquer. From the fifth round onwards Calderón proceeded to exchange combinations of punches with Esquer, eventually gaining control of the fight&#x27;s tempo. The fight lasted twelve rounds and Iván won the fight by unanimous decision with the judges awarding scores of 116–112, 118-110 and 115–113. Calderón&#x27;s second defense in the light flyweight division took place on April 4, 2008, where he defeated Nelson Dieppa by unanimous decision. The three judges awarded him identical scores of 120–108.

Following a protest, the World Boxing Organization named Cázares the mandatory challenger for the championship. The event was scheduled for August 30, 2008. Calderón entered the ring dressed as a matador in reference to his boxing style, which provoked &quot;Olé&quot; chants from the public. In the early stages, the fight&#x27;s pattern was similar to the first meeting. Calderón relied on counter punching while boxing to avoid Cázares&#x27; offensive. Late in the first round, the challenger fell following a combination, but the referee declared that it was an accidental slip. In the following rounds, Cázares tried pressuring in the offensive, but Calderón continued boxing and held his opponent if approached. The challenger was momentarily stunned by an uppercut in the final seconds of the third episode. Cázares&#x27; technique in the next two rounds consisted of throwing punches to the body, while his offensive to the head was being stopped by his opponent&#x27;s forearms. In the sixth round, Calderón focused on his defense, slowing the pace of his offensive. In the seventh episode, an accidental head clash opened a laceration in Calderón&#x27;s forehead. Who was examined by the ringside doctor, after expressing that he was feeling disoriented. The physician recommended stopping the fight. Due to the circumstances, the outcome was decided by the judges&#x27; score cards, which favored Calderón 67-66 and 68-65 twice. Following the event, he announced his intention to participate in a unification match against one of the other light flyweight champions. Due to the nature of this injury, the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission prohibited Calderón participation in any card within 120 days. Two weeks after the contest, the wound was reopened and he underwent plastic surgery to prevent reinjury. On September 23, 2008, Peter Rivera announced that Calderón was expected to return between January and February 2009. Rivera noted that the fight would be against one of the other light flyweight champions, most likely César Canchila, citing that although both Ulises Solís and Edgar Sosa were approached, with both claiming to be available, neither one actually pursued serious negotiations. He subsequently stated that negotiations had been extended to Solís&#x27; representatives, but that those of Sosa still declined, citing that &quot;[He] is a fighter that has always refused to fight with Iván. His managers don&#x27;t want to sacrifice him and prefer to keep him in Mexico competing in soft fights.&quot; In the meanwhile, he received a homage as part of the Dominican Parade in San Juan, serving as &quot;Padrino Internacional&quot; (lit. &quot;International Godfather&quot;) along Juan Manuel López.

On June 13, 2009, Calderón defended the championship against Rodel Mayol. During the first stage, both pugilists fought in the middle of the ring, while he focused on attacking the body while the challenger employed jabs. During the second and third rounds, Mayol pressured the offensive, managing to land a moderate number of punches. In the fourth round, Calderón began pursuing the offensive, while avoiding Mayol&#x27;s punches. This continued in the following chapter, but a head clash opened another laceration on his forehead, he continued the contest, but was more aggressive from this point onwards. Calderón&#x27;s corner tried to stop the bleeding, but the referee suspended the contest during the sixth round after these attempts proven unsuccessful. The fight was declared a technical draw, with both fighters receiving a 58-56 card while the third judge scored in 57-57. An immediate rematch was scheduled three months later. Calderón began this contest by effectively avoiding Mayol&#x27;s constant attack, while throwing limited punches. This pattern continued during the following three rounds. In the fifth, Mayol connected his best punch of the fight, winning the round. To retaliate, Calderón became more aggressive, throwing more combinations. The seventh round began with exchanges from both boxers, but a head clash opens another laceration that stops the fight. The contest was declared a technical decision, with the judges offering scores of 68-65 twice for Calderón and 68-65 for Mayol.

==Retirement==
On October 29, 2012, almost a month after his last fight, Calderón officially announced his retirement from professional boxing. The announcement was made during the inauguration of the Félix Pagán Pintor Gymnasium in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Calderón will now work as administrator of the gymnasium.

<text>Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici (12 June 1519 – 21 April 1574) was the second and last duke of Florence from 1537 until 1569, when he became the first grand duke of Tuscany, a title he held until his death. Cosimo I succeeded his cousin to the duchy. He built the Uffizi (office) to organize his administration, and conquered Siena to consolidate Florence&#x27;s rule in Tuscany. He expanded the Pitti Palace and most of the Boboli Gardens were also laid out during his reign.

==Life==

===Rise to power===
Cosimo was born in Florence on 12 June 1519, the son of the famous condottiere Ludovico de&#x27; Medici (known as Giovanni delle Bande Nere) and his wife Maria Salviati, herself a granddaughter of Lorenzo the Magnificent. He was the grandson of Caterina Sforza, the Countess of Forlì and Lady of Imola. Cosimo became Duke of Florence in 1537 at age 17, after the former Duke of Florence, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, was assassinated. Cosimo was from a different branch of the Medici family, descended from Giovanni il Popolano, the great-grandson of Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici, founder of the Medici Bank. It was necessary to search for a successor outside of the &quot;senior&quot; branch of the Medici family descended from Cosimo di Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, since the only male child of Alessandro, the last lineal descendant of the senior branch, was born out-of-wedlock and was only four years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death.
Up to the time of his accession, Cosimo had lived only in Mugello (the ancestral homeland of the Medici family) and was almost unknown in Florence. However, many of the influential men in the city favoured him as the new duke. Several hoped to rule through him, thereby enriching themselves at the state&#x27;s expense. However, as the Florentine literatus Benedetto Varchi famously put it, &quot;The innkeeper&#x27;s reckoning was different from the glutton&#x27;s.&quot; Cosimo proved strong-willed, astute and ambitious and soon rejected the clause he had signed that entrusted much of the power of the Florentine duchy to a Council of Forty-Eight.

When the Florentine exiles heard of the death of Alessandro, they marshalled their forces with support from France and from disgruntled neighbors of Florence. During this time, Cosimo had an illegitimate daughter, Bia (1537 – 1542), who was portrayed shortly before her premature death in a painting by Bronzino.

Toward the end of July 1537, the exiles marched into Tuscany under the leadership of Bernardo Salviati and Piero Strozzi. When Cosimo heard of their approach, he sent his best troops under Alessandro Vitelli to engage the enemy, which they did at Montemurlo. After defeating the exiles&#x27; army, Vitelli stormed the fortress, where Strozzi and a few of his companions had retreated to safety. It fell after only a few hours, and Cosimo celebrated his first victory. The prominent prisoners were subsequently beheaded on the Piazza della Signoria or in the Bargello. Filippo Strozzi&#x27;s body was found with a bloody sword next to it and a note quoting Virgil, but many believe that his suicide was faked.

===Rule of Tuscany===

In 1537, Cosimo sent Bernardo Antonio de&#x27; Medici to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to gain recognition for his position as head of the Florentine state. That recognition came in June 1537 in exchange for help against France in the course of the Italian Wars. With this move, Cosimo firmly restored the power of the Medici, who thereafter ruled Florence until the death of the last of the Medici rulers, Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici, in 1737. The help granted to Charles V allowed him to free Tuscany from the Imperial garrisons and to increase as much as possible its independence from the overwhelming Spanish influence in Italy.

Cosimo next turned his attention to Siena. With the support of Charles V, he defeated the Sienese at the Battle of Marciano in 1554 and laid siege to their city. Despite the inhabitants&#x27; desperate resistance, the city fell on 17 April 1555 after a 15-month siege, its population diminished from 40,000 to 8,000 people. In 1559, Montalcino, the last redoubt of Sienese independence, was annexed to Cosimo&#x27;s territories. In 1569, Pope Pius V elevated him to the rank of Grand Duke of Tuscany.

In the last 10 years of his reign, struck by the death of two of his sons by malaria, Cosimo gave up active rule of the Florentine state to his son and successor Francesco I. He retreated to live in his villa, the Villa di Castello, outside Florence.

==Statesmanship==

Cosimo was an authoritarian ruler and secured his position by employing a guard of Swiss mercenaries. In 1548, he managed to have his relative Lorenzino, the last Medici claimant to Florence who had earlier arranged the assassination of Cosimo&#x27;s predecessor Alessandro, assassinated himself in Venice. Cosimo also was an active builder of military structures, as a part of his attempt to save the Florentine state from the frequent passage of foreign armies. Examples include the new fortresses of Siena, Arezzo, Sansepolcro, the new walls of Pisa and Fivizzano and the strongholds of Portoferraio on the island of Elba and Terra del Sole.

He laid heavy tax burdens on his subjects. Despite his economic difficulties, Cosimo I was a lavish patron of the arts and also developed the Florentine navy, which eventually took part in the Battle of Lepanto, and which he entrusted to his new creation, the Knights of St. Stephen.

==Patronage of the arts==

Cosimo is perhaps best known today for the creation of the Uffizi (&quot;offices&quot;). Originally intended as a means of consolidating his administrative control of the various committees, agencies, and guilds established in Florence&#x27;s Republican past, it now houses one of the world&#x27;s most important collections of art, much of it commissioned and/or owned by various members of the Medici family.

His gardens at Villa di Castello, designed by Niccolò Tribolo when Cosimo was only seventeen years old, were designed to announce a new golden age for Florence and to demonstrate the magnificence and virtues of the Medici. They were decorated with fountains, a labyrinth, a grotto and ingenious ornamental water features, and were a prototype for the Italian Renaissance garden. They had a profound influence on later Italian and French gardens through the eighteenth century.

Cosimo also finished the Pitti Palace as a home for the Medici and created the magnificent Boboli Gardens behind the Pitti. As his more prominent ancestors had been, he was also an important patron of the arts, supporting, among others, Giorgio Vasari, Benvenuto Cellini, Pontormo, Bronzino, the architect Baldassarre Lanci, and the historians Scipione Ammirato and Benedetto Varchi.

A large bronze equestrian statue of Cosimo I by Giambologna, erected in 1598, still stands today in the Piazza della Signoria, the main square of Florence.

Cosimo was also an enthusiast of alchemy, a passion he inherited from his grandmother Caterina Sforza.

==Marriage and family==
In 1539, Cosimo married the Spanish noblewoman Eleanor of Toledo (1522 – 1562), the daughter of Don Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, the Spanish viceroy of Naples. The couple had a long and peaceful married life. Surprisingly for the era, Cosimo was faithful to his wife throughout their married life. The example of a traditional couple served to strengthen his various reforms and separate their association with the former Duke. Eleanor was a political adviser to her husband and often ruled Florence in his absence. She provided the Medici with the Pitti Palace and was a patron of the new Jesuit order. The Duchess died with her sons Giovanni and Garzia in 1562, when she was only forty; all three of them were struck down by malaria while traveling to Pisa.

Cosimo and Eleanor had:
*Maria (3 April 1540 – 19 November 1557), engaged to Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, but died before the marriage

*Giovanni (28 September 1543 – 20 November 1562), who became Bishop of Pisa and a cardinal
*Lucrezia (7 June 1545 – 21 April 1561), who married Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara and Modena, in 1560
*Pietro (Pedricco) (10 August 1546 – 10 June 1547), who died in infancy
*Garzia (5 July 1547 – 12 December 1562), who died of malaria at age 15
*Antonio (1 July 1548 – July 1548), who died in infancy
*Ferdinando (30 July 1549 – 17 February 1609), Francesco&#x27;s successor as Grand Duke of Tuscany
*Anna (19 March 1553 – 6 August 1553), who died in infancy
*Pietro (3 June 1554 – 25 April 1604), who murdered his wife Eleonora di Garzia di Toledo 

Before his first marriage, Cosimo fathered an illegitimate daughter with an unknown woman:
*Bia de&#x27; Medici (ca. 1536 – March 1, 1542)

After Eleanor&#x27;s death in 1562, Cosimo fathered two children with his mistress Eleonora degli Albizzi:
*an unnamed daughter (born and died 1566) who died before baptism&quot;
*Giovanni (1567 – 1621), later legitimized by his father

In 1570, Cosimo married Camilla Martelli (died 1590) and fathered one child with her:

<text>The Bengal tiger is a population of the &quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot; subspecies and the nominate tiger subspecies. It ranks among the largest wild cats alive today. It is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene for about 12,000 to 16,500 years. Its historical range covered the Indus River valley until the early 19th century, almost all of India, western Pakistan, southern Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and southwestern China. Today, it inhabits India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and southwestern China. It is threatened by poaching, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.

As of 2022, the Bengal tiger population was estimated at 3,167–3,682 individuals in India, 316–355 individuals in Nepal, 131 individuals in Bhutan and around 114 individuals in Bangladesh.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis tigris&quot; was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the tiger. It was subordinated to the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1929. Bengal is the traditional type locality of the species and the nominate subspecies &quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot;.

The validity of several tiger subspecies in continental Asia was questioned in 1999. Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was proposed to recognise only two subspecies as valid, namely &quot;P. t. tigris&quot; in mainland Asia, and &quot;P. t. sondaica&quot; in the Greater Sunda Islands and possibly in Sundaland. The nominate subspecies &quot;P. t. tigris&quot; constitutes two clades: the northern clade comprises the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and the southern clade all remaining continental tiger populations. The extinct and living tiger populations in continental Asia have been subsumed to &quot;P. t. tigris&quot; since the revision of felid taxonomy in 2017.

=== Phylogeny ===
Results of a genetic analysis of 32 tiger samples indicate that the Bengal tiger samples grouped into a different clade than the Siberian tiger samples.

===Genetic ancestry===
The Bengal tiger is defined by three distinct mitochondrial nucleotide sites and 12 unique microsatellite alleles. The pattern of genetic variation in the Bengal tiger corresponds to the premise that it arrived in India approximately 12,000 years ago. This is consistent with the lack of tiger fossils from the Indian subcontinent prior to the late Pleistocene, and the absence of tigers from Sri Lanka, which was separated from the subcontinent by rising sea levels in the early Holocene.

==Characteristics==

The Bengal tiger&#x27;s coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings. The white tiger is a recessive mutant, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam, Bengal, Bihar and especially in the former State of Rewa. However, it is not an occurrence of albinism. In fact, there is only one fully authenticated case of a true albino tiger, and none of black tigers, with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846. Fourteen Bengal tiger skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London have 21–29 stripes.
Another recessive mutant is the golden tiger that has a pale golden fur with red-brown stripes. The mutants are very rare in nature.

The greatest skull length of a tiger is in males and in females. It has exceptionally stout teeth. Its canines are long and thus the longest among all cats.

===Body weight and size===
The Bengal tiger ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today.
Males and female Bengal tigers in Panna Tiger Reserve reach a head-to-body length of and respectively, including a tail about long. Total length ranges from for male tigers and for female tigers. They typically range from in shoulder height.

Subadult males weigh between and reach when adult; subadult females weigh and reach between when adult. In central India, 42 adult male Bengal tigers weighed on average with a range of ; their total length was with a range of , and their average shoulder height was ; 39 adult female Bengal tigers weighed an average of with a maximum of and an average total length of ranging from .
Several scientists indicated that adult male Bengal tigers in the Terai consistently attain more than of body weight. Seven adult males captured in Chitwan National Park in the early 1970s had an average weight of ranging from , and that of the females was ranging from . Two male tigers captured in Chitwan National Park in the 1980s exceeded weights of and are the largest free ranging tigers reported to date.

The smallest recorded weights for Bengal tigers are from the Bangladesh Sundarbans, where adult females weigh .
Three tigresses from the Bangladesh Sundarbans had a mean weight of . The oldest female weighed and was in a relatively poor condition at the time of capture. Their skulls and body weights were distinct from those of tigers in other habitats, indicating that they may have adapted to the unique conditions of the mangrove habitat. Their small sizes are probably due to a combination of intense intraspecific competition and small size of prey available to tigers in the Sundarbans, compared to the larger deer and other prey available to tigers in other parts.

The very large &quot;Leeds Tiger&quot; on display at Leeds City Museum, shot in 1860 near Mussoorie, had a body length of at death. Two tigers shot in Kumaon District and near Oude at the end of the 19th century allegedly measured more than . But at the time, sportsmen had not yet adopted a standard system of measurement; some measured while others measured &#x27;over the curves&#x27;. The greatest length of a tiger skull measured &quot;over the bone&quot;; this one was shot in the vicinity of Nagina in northern India.

In the beginning of the 20th century, a male tiger was shot in central India with a head and body length of between pegs, a chest girth of , a shoulder height of and a tail length of , which was perhaps bitten off by a rival male. This specimen could not be weighed, but it was estimated to weigh about . A male weighing was shot in northern India in the 1930s. A male tiger shot in Nepal weighed and measured &#x27;over the curves&#x27;.
The heaviest wild tiger was possibly a male killed in 1967 in the foothills of the Himalayas that measured between pegs and over curves; it weighed after eating a buffalo calf. Without eating the calf, it would have likely weighed about . In the Central Provinces of India, a male tiger shot weighed and measured .

The Bengal tiger rivals the Siberian tiger in average weight.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Bengal tiger&#x27;s historical range covered the Indus River valley until the early 19th century, almost all of India, western Pakistan, southern Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and southwestern China. Today, it inhabits India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and southwestern China.
It is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years.
In 1982, a sub-fossil right middle phalanx was found in a prehistoric midden near Kuruwita in Sri Lanka, which is dated to about 16,500 years ago and tentatively considered to be of a tiger. Tigers appear to have arrived in Sri Lanka during a pluvial period, during which sea levels were depressed, evidently prior to the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. The tiger probably arrived too late in southern India to colonise Sri Lanka, which earlier had been connected to India by a land bridge.
Results of a phylogeographic study using 134 samples from tigers across the global range suggest that the historical northeastern distribution limit of the Bengal tiger is the region in the Chittagong Hills and Brahmaputra River basin, bordering the historical range of the Indochinese tiger.
In the Indian subcontinent, Bengal tigers inhabit tropical moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests, tropical and subtropical moist deciduous forests, mangroves, subtropical and temperate upland forests, and alluvial grasslands. The latter habitat once covered a huge swath of grassland, riverine and moist semi-deciduous forests along the major river system of the Gangetic and Brahmaputra plains, but has now been largely converted to agricultural land or severely degraded. Today, the best examples of this habitat type are limited to a few blocks at the base of the outer foothills of the Himalayas including the &quot;Tiger Conservation Units&quot; (TCUs) Rajaji-Corbett, Bardia-Banke, and the transboundary TCUs Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, Dudhwa-Kailali and Shuklaphanta-Kishanpur. Tiger densities in these TCUs are high, in part because of the extraordinary biomass of ungulate prey.

In Pakistan, Khairpur was the last stronghold of the tiger by the late 19th century; the last individuals were shot in 1906 in Bahawalpur in the Indus Riverine jungles.
===India===
In the 20th century, Indian censuses of wild tigers relied on the individual identification of footprints known as pug marks – a method that has been criticised as deficient and inaccurate. Camera traps are now being used in many sites.

Good tiger habitats in subtropical and temperate forests include the &quot;Tiger Conservation Units&quot; (TCUs) Manas-Namdapha. TCUs in tropical dry forest include Hazaribag Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Kanha-Indravati corridor, Orissa dry forests, Panna National Park, Melghat Tiger Reserve and Ratapani Tiger Reserve. The TCUs in tropical moist deciduous forest are probably some of the most productive habitats for tigers and their prey, and include Kaziranga-Meghalaya, Kanha-Pench, Simlipal and Indravati Tiger Reserves. The TCUs in tropical moist evergreen forests represent the less common tiger habitats, being largely limited to the upland areas and wetter parts of the Western Ghats, and include the tiger reserves of Periyar, Kalakad-Mundathurai, Bandipur and Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary.


During a tiger census in 2008, camera trap and sign surveys using GIS were employed to estimate site-specific densities of tiger, co-predators and prey. Based on the result of these surveys, the total tiger population was estimated at 1,411 individuals ranging from 1,165 to 1,657 adult and sub-adult tigers of more than 1.5 years of age. Across India, six landscape complexes were surveyed that host tigers and have the potential to be connected. These landscapes comprise the following:
* in the Sivaliks–Gangetic flood plain landscape there are six populations with an estimated population size of 259 to 335 individuals in an area of of forested habitats, which are located in Rajaji and Corbett National Parks, in the connected habitats of Dudhwa-Kheri-Pilibhit, in Suhelwa Tiger Reserve, in Sohagi Barwa Sanctuary and in Valmiki National Park;
* in the Central Indian highlands there are 17 populations with an estimated population size of 437 to 661 individuals in an area of of forested habitats, which are located in the landscapes of Kanha-Pench, Satpura-Melghat, Sanjay-Palamau, Navegaon-Indravati; isolated populations are supported in the tiger reserves of Bandhavgarh, Tadoba, Simlipal and the national parks of Panna, Ranthambore–Kuno–Palpur–Madhav and Saranda;
* in the Eastern Ghats landscape there is a single population with an estimated population size of 49 to 57 individuals in a habitat in three separate forest blocks located in the Srivenkateshwara National Park, Nagarjunasagar Tiger Reserve and the adjacent proposed Gundla Brahmeshwara National Park, and forest patches in the tehsils of Kanigiri, Badvel, Udayagiri and Giddalur;
* in the Western Ghats landscape there are seven populations with an estimated population size of 336 to 487 individuals in a forested area of in three major landscape units Periyar-Kalakad-Mundathurai, Bandipur-Parambikulam-Sathyamangalam-Mudumalai-Anamalai-Mukurthi and Anshi-Kudremukh-Dandeli;
* in the Brahmaputra flood plains and northeastern hills tigers live in an area of in several patchy and fragmented forests;
* in the Sundarbans National Park tigers live in about of mangrove forest.
Manas-Namdapha, Orang-Laokhowa and Kaziranga-Meghalaya are &quot;Tiger Conservation Units&quot; in northeastern India, stretching over at least across several protected areas. Tigers are also present in Pakke Tiger Reserve. In the Mishmi Hills, tigers were recorded in 2017 up to an elevation of in snow.
Ranthambore National Park hosts India&#x27;s westernmost tiger population. The Dangs&#x27; Forest in southeastern Gujarat is potential tiger habitat.

In May 2018, a tiger was recorded in Sahyadri Tiger Reserve for the first time in eight years.
In February 2019, a tiger was sighted in Gujarat&#x27;s Lunavada area in Mahisagar district, and found dead shortly afterwards. Officials assumed that it originated in Ratapani Tiger Reserve and travelled about over two years. It probably died of starvation. In May 2019, camera traps recorded tigers in Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary and Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, the first records in Goa since 2013.

The tigers in the Sundarbans in India and Bangladesh are the only ones in the world inhabiting mangrove forests. The population in the Indian Sundarbans was estimated as 86–90 individuals in 2018.

As of 2014, the Indian tiger population was estimated to range over an area of and number 2,226 adult and subadult tigers older than one year. About 585 tigers were present in the Western Ghats, where Radhanagari and Sahyadri Tiger Reserves were newly established. The largest population resided in Corbett Tiger Reserve with about 215 tigers. The Central Indian tiger population is fragmented and depends on wildlife corridors that facilitate connectivity between protected areas. By 2018, the population had increased to an estimated 2,603–3,346 individuals. As of 2022, the Indian population was estimated to comprise 3,167–3,682 individuals.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, tigers are now relegated to the forests of the Sundarbans and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Chittagong forest is contiguous with tiger habitat in India and Myanmar, but the tiger population is of unknown status.

As of 2004, population estimates in Bangladesh ranged from 200 to 419 individuals, most of them in the Sundarbans. This region is the only mangrove habitat in this bioregion, where tigers survive, swimming between islands in the delta to hunt prey. Bangladesh&#x27;s Forest Department is raising mangrove plantations supplying forage for spotted deer. Since 2001, afforestation has continued on a small scale in the Sundarbans.
From October 2005 to January 2007, the first camera trap survey was conducted across six sites in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to estimate tiger population density. The average of these six sites provided an estimate of 3.7 tigers per . Since the Bangladesh Sundarbans is an area of , it was inferred that the total tiger population comprised approximately 200 individuals.
Home ranges of adult female tigers were recorded comprising between , which would indicate an approximate carrying capacity of 150 adult females. The small home range of adult female tigers and consequent high density of tigers in this habitat type relative to other areas may be related to both the high density of prey and the small size of the Sundarban tigers.

Since 2007, tiger monitoring surveys have been carried out every year by WildTeam in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to monitor changes in the Bangladesh tiger population and assess the effectiveness of conservation actions. This survey measures changes in the frequency of tiger track sets along the sides of tidal waterways as an index of relative tiger abundance across the Sundarbans landscape.
By 2009, the tiger population in the Bangladesh Sundarbans was estimated as 100–150 adult females or 335–500 tigers overall. Female home ranges, recorded using Global Positioning System collars, were some of the smallest recorded for tigers, indicating that the Bangladesh Sundarbans could have one of the highest densities and largest populations of tigers anywhere in the world. They are isolated from the next tiger population by a distance of up to . Information is lacking on many aspects of Sundarbans tiger ecology, including relative abundance, population status, spatial dynamics, habitat selection, life history characteristics, taxonomy, genetics, and disease. There is also no monitoring program in place to track changes in the tiger population over time, and therefore no way of measuring the response of the population to conservation activities or threats. Most studies have focused on the tiger-human conflict in the area, but two studies in the Sundarbans East Wildlife sanctuary documented habitat-use patterns of tigers, and abundances of tiger prey, and another study investigated tiger parasite load. Some major threats to tigers have been identified. The tigers living in the Sundarbans are threatened by habitat destruction, prey depletion, highly aggressive and rampant intraspecific competition, tiger-human conflict, and direct tiger loss.
By 2017, this population was estimated at 84–158 individuals.
As of 2018, 114 individuals were estimated to live in the country.

A rising sea-level due to climate change is projected to cause a severe loss of suitable habitat for this population in the following decades, around 50% by 2050 and 100% by 2070.

===Nepal===
The tiger population in the Terai of Nepal is split into three isolated subpopulations that are separated by cultivation and densely settled habitat. The largest population lives in Chitwan National Park and in the adjacent Parsa National Park encompassing an area of of prime lowland forest. To the west, the Chitwan population is isolated from the one in Bardiya National Park and adjacent unprotected habitat farther west, extending to within of the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, which harbours the smallest population.

From February to June 2013, a camera trapping survey was carried out in the Terai Arc Landscape, across an area of in 14 districts. The country&#x27;s tiger population was estimated at 163–235 breeding adults comprising 102–152 tigers in the Chitwan-Parsa protected areas, 48–62 in Bardiya-Banke National Parks and 13–21 in Shuklaphanta National Park.
Between November 2017 and April 2018, the third nationwide survey for tiger and prey was conducted in the Terai Arc Landscape; the country&#x27;s population was estimated at 220–274 tigers.
As of 2022, 316–355 individuals were estimated to live in the country.

===Bhutan===
In Bhutan, tigers have been documented in 17 of 18 districts. They inhabit the subtropical Himalayan foothills at an elevation of in the south to over in the temperate forests in the north. Their stronghold appears to be the country&#x27;s central belt between the Mo River in the west and the Kulong River in the east ranging in elevation from . By 2015, Bhutan&#x27;s tiger population was estimated at 103 individuals.

Royal Manas and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks form the largest contiguous tiger conservation area in Bhutan representing subtropical to alpine habitat types.
In 2010, camera traps recorded a tiger pair at elevations of . As of 2015, the tiger population in Bhutan was estimated at 89 to 124 individuals in a survey area of .

In 2008, a tiger was recorded at an elevation of in Jigme Dorji National Park, which is the highest elevation record of a tiger known to date. In 2017, a tiger was recorded for the time in Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary. It probably used a wildlife corridor to reach northeastern Bhutan.

Bhutan&#x27;s tiger population was estimated at 90 individuals comprising 60 females and 30 males with a population density estimate of 0.19–0.31 tigers per by March 2015. As of 2022, the population was estimated at 131 individuals.

===China===
The presence of the Bengal tiger in southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region, China was investigated in 1995 when the loss of livestock was high in Mêdog County due to a large predator. Tiger paw prints were found on pastures around several villages.
One tiger was shot in 1996, and about 4–5 tigers were reported by officials in the area by 1999.
About 8–12 tigers were thought to remain in this area a decade later.
A camera trapping and interview survey during 2013–2018 in nine potential sites in Mêdog County revealed that only 1–3 non-resident individuals might be entering the area south of the Yarlung Tsangpo river, but only during the dry season from October to March.
In early 2019, a Bengal tiger was photographed twice at an elevation of in a broadleaved forest in Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The basic social unit of the tiger is composed of a female and her offspring. Adult animals congregate only temporarily when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supplies of food. Otherwise, they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the forest and grassland animals upon which they prey. Resident adults of either sex maintain home ranges, confining their movements to definite habitats within which they satisfy their needs and those of their cubs, which include prey, water and shelter. In this site, they also maintain contact with other tigers, especially those of the opposite sex. Those sharing the same ground are well aware of each other&#x27;s movements and activities. In Chitwan National Park, radio-collared subadult tigers started dispersing from their natal areas earliest at the age of 19 months. Of the 14 subadults studied, the four females stayed closer to their mother&#x27;s home range than the 10 males. The latter dispersed between . None of them crossed open cultivated areas that were more than wide, but moved through prime alluvial and forested habitat.

In the Panna Tiger Reserve, an adult radio-collared male tiger moved between locations on successive days in winter, and in summer. His home range was about in summer and in winter. Included in his home range were the much smaller home ranges of two females, a tigress with cubs and a subadult tigress. They occupied home ranges of .

The home ranges occupied by adult male residents tend to be mutually exclusive, even though one of these residents may tolerate a transient or sub-adult male at least for a time. A male tiger keeps a large territory in order to include the home ranges of several females within its bounds, so that he may maintain mating rights with them. Spacing among females is less complete. Typically there is partial overlap with neighbouring female residents. They tend to have core areas, which are more exclusive, at least for most of the time. Home ranges of both males and females are not stable. The shift or alteration of a home range by one animal is correlated with a shift of another. Shifts from less suitable habitat to better ones are made by animals that are already resident. New animals become residents only as vacancies occur when a former resident moves out or dies. There are more places for resident females than for resident males.

During seven years of camera trapping, tracking, and observational data in Chitwan National Park, six to nine breeding tigers, two to sixteen non-breeding tigers, and six to twenty young tigers of less than one year of age were detected in the study area of . One of the resident females left her territory to one of her female offspring and took over an adjoining area by displacing another female; and a displaced female managed to re-establish herself in a neighbouring territory made vacant by the death of the resident. Of 11 resident females, 7 were still alive at the end of the study period, two disappeared after losing their territories to rivals, and two died. The initial loss of two resident males and subsequent take over of their home ranges by new males caused social instability for two years. Of four resident males, one was still alive and three were displaced by rivals. Five litters of cubs were killed by infanticide, two litters died because they were too young to fend for themselves when their mothers died. One juvenile tiger was presumed dead after being photographed with severe injuries from a deer snare. The remaining young lived long enough to reach dispersal age, two of them becoming residents in the study area.

===Hunting and diet===
The Bengal tiger is a carnivore and prefers hunting large ungulates such as gaur, sambar, chital, barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Medium-sized prey includes wild boar, Indian hog deer, Indian muntjac and northern plains gray langur. Small prey such as porcupine, hare and peafowl form a small part of its diet. Because of the encroachment of humans into tiger habitat, it also preys on domestic livestock.

Bengal tigers occasionally hunt and kill predators such as Indian leopard, mugger crocodile, Asian black bear, sloth bear, and dhole. They generally do not attack adult Indian elephant and Indian rhinoceros, but such extraordinarily rare events have been recorded. In Kaziranga National Park, tigers killed 20 rhinoceros in 2007. In 2011 and 2014, two instances of Bengal tigers killing adult elephants were recorded; in Jim Corbett National Park on a 20-year-old elephant cow, and another on a 28-year-old sick elephant in Kaziranga National Park; the latter was eaten by several tigers at once. A king cobra (&quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot;), an Indian cobra (&quot;Naja naja&quot;), Asian water monitor, rhesus macaque, fish, crabs, and very rarely fishing cats and turtles were found in the stomachs and scat of tigers in the Sundarbans. One in Chitwan National Park has been reported to have hunted three gharials.

Results of scat analyses indicate that the Bengal tigers in Nagarahole National Park preferred prey weighing more than and that on average tiger prey weighed . The prey species included chital, sambar, wild pig and gaur. Gaur remains were found in 44.8% of all tiger scat samples, sambar remains in 28.6%, wild pig remains in 14.3% and chital remains in 10.4% of all scat samples. In Bandipur National Park, gaur and sambar together also constituted 73% of tiger diet.

In most cases, Bengal tigers approach their victim from the side or behind from as close a distance as possible and grasp the prey&#x27;s throat to kill it. Then they drag the carcass into cover, occasionally over several hundred metres, to consume it. The nature of the tiger&#x27;s hunting method and prey availability results in a &quot;feast or famine&quot; feeding style: they often consume of meat at one time. In one study, tigresses from Nepal made about 40–50 kills a year and ate a minimum of of meat a day. Two males made about 40–50 kills in a year and ate of meat a day at the least.

If injured, old or weak, or when its regular prey species become scarce, Bengal tigers often attack humans and become man-eaters.

===Reproduction and lifecycle===

The tiger in India has no definite mating and birth seasons. Most young are born in December and April. Young have also been found in March, May, October and November. In the 1960s, certain aspects of tiger behaviour at Kanha National Park indicated that the peak of sexual activity was from November to about February, with some mating probably occurring throughout the year.

Males reach maturity at 4–5 years of age, and females at 3–4 years. A Bengal comes into estrus (commonly known as &quot;heat&quot;) at intervals of about 3–9 weeks, and is receptive for 3–6 days. After a gestation period of 104–106 days, 1–4 cubs are born in a shelter situated in tall grass, thick bush or in caves. Newborn cubs weigh and they have a thick woolly fur that is shed after 3.5–5 months. Their eyes and ears are closed. Their milk teeth start to erupt at about 2–3 weeks after birth, and are slowly replaced by permanent dentition from 8.5 to 9.5 weeks of age onwards. They suckle for 3–6 months, and begin to eat small amounts of solid food at about 2 months of age. At this time, they follow their mother on her hunting expeditions and begin to take part in hunting at 5–6 months of age. At the age of 2–3 years, they slowly start to separate from the family group and become transient, looking out for an area where they can establish their own home range. Young males move farther away from their native home range than young females. Once the family group has split, the mother comes into heat again.

==Threats==
None of the &quot;Tiger Conservation Landscapes&quot; within the Bengal tiger range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 individuals. Habitat losses and the extremely large-scale incidences of poaching are serious threats to the species&#x27; survival.

The Forest Rights Act passed by the Indian government in 2006 grants some of India&#x27;s most impoverished communities the right to own and live in the forests, which likely brings them into conflict with wildlife and under-resourced, under-trained, ill-equipped forest department staff. In the past, evidence showed that humans and tigers cannot co-exist.

===Poaching===
The most significant immediate threat to the existence of wild tiger populations is the illegal wildlife trade in poached skins and body parts between India, Nepal and China. The governments of these countries have failed to implement adequate enforcement response, and wildlife crime remained a low priority in terms of political commitment and investment for years. There are well-organised gangs of professional poachers, who move from place to place and set up camp in vulnerable areas. Skins are rough-cured in the field and handed over to dealers, who send them for further treatment to Indian tanning centres. Buyers choose the skins from dealers or tanneries and smuggle them through a complex interlinking network to markets outside India, mainly in China. Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanisation and revenge killing. Farmers blame tigers for killing cattle and shoot them. Their skins and body parts may however become a part of the illegal trade. In Bangladesh, tigers are killed by professional poachers, local hunters, trappers and villagers. Each group of people has different motives for killing tigers, ranging from profit and excitement to safety concerns; and has access to the illegal wildlife trade in body parts.

The illicit demand for bones and body parts from wild tigers for use in Traditional Chinese medicine is the reason for the unrelenting poaching pressure on tigers on the Indian subcontinent. For at least a thousand years, tiger bones have been an ingredient in traditional medicines that are prescribed as a muscle strengthener and treatment for rheumatism and body pain.

Between 1994 and 2009, the Wildlife Protection Society of India has documented 893 cases of tigers killed in India, which is just a fraction of the actual poaching and trade in tiger parts during those years.
In 2004, all the tigers in India&#x27;s Sariska Tiger Reserve were killed by poachers. In 2007, police in Allahabad raided a meeting of suspected poachers, traders and couriers. One of the arrested persons was the biggest buyer of Indian tiger parts who sold them to Chinese buyers, using women from a nomadic tribe as couriers. In 2009, none of the 24 tigers residing in the Panna Tiger Reserve were left because of excessive poaching.
In November 2011, two tigers were found dead in Maharashtra: a male tiger was trapped and killed in a wire snare; a tigress died of electrocution after chewing at an electric cable supplying power to a water pump; another dead tigress found in Kanha Tiger Reserve landscape was suspected to have been poisoned. In 2021, Bangladeshi police arrested a poacher suspected of killing 70 Bengal tigers during a period of 20 years.

===Human–tiger conflict===

The Indian subcontinent has served as a stage for intense confrontations between tigers and people. At the beginning of the 19th century tigers were so numerous, that the killing of tigers was officially rewarded in many localities. The Terai region supported large numbers of tigers that were pushed into marginal habitat after the 1950s, when the conversion of natural habitat for paddy fields increased. Marauding tigers began to take a toll of human life in areas bordering cultivation. They are thought to have followed domestic livestock that wintered in the plains when they returned to the hills in the spring, and then being left without prey when the herds dispersed back to their respective villages. These tigers were the old, the young and the disabled. All suffered from some disability, mainly caused either by gunshot wounds or porcupine quills.

In the Sundarbans, 10 out of 13-man-eaters recorded in the 1970s were males, and they accounted for 86% of the victims. These man-eaters have been grouped into the &quot;confirmed&quot; or dedicated ones who go hunting especially for human prey; and the &quot;opportunistic&quot; ones, who do not search for humans but will, if they encounter a man, attack, kill and devour him. In areas where opportunistic man-eaters were found, the killing of humans was correlated with their availability, most victims being claimed during the honey-gathering season. Tigers in the Sunderbans presumably attacked humans who entered their territories in search of wood, honey or fish, thus causing them to defend their territories. The number of tiger attacks on humans may be higher outside suitable areas for tigers, where numerous people are present, but with little wild prey for tigers.

In Nepal, the incidence of man-eating tigers has been only sporadic. In Chitwan National Park no cases were recorded before 1980. In the following few years, 13 people have been killed and eaten in the park and its environs. In the majority of cases, man-eating appeared to have been related to an intra-specific competition among male tigers.
An interview survey with 499 local people in Chitwan revealed that lower caste Hindus and people with less than eight years of formal education had negative attitudes to the tiger; most of them owned livestock and had heard about tigers attacking people and livestock.

In December 2012, a tiger was shot by the Kerala Forest Department on a coffee plantation on the fringes of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. Chief Wildlife Warden of Kerala ordered the hunt for the animal after mass protests erupted as the tiger had been carrying away livestock. The Forest Department had constituted a special task force to capture the animal with the assistance of a 10-member Special Tiger Protection Force and two trained Indian elephants from the Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka.

==Conservation efforts==

An area of special interest lies in the &quot;Terai Arc Landscape&quot; in the Himalayan foothills of northern India and southern Nepal, where 11 protected areas composed of dry forest foothills and tall-grass savannas harbour tigers in a landscape. The goals are to manage tigers as a single metapopulation, the dispersal of which between core refuges can help maintain genetic, demographic, and ecological integrity, and to ensure that species and habitat conservation becomes mainstreamed into the rural development agenda. In Nepal a community-based tourism model has been developed with a strong emphasis on sharing benefits with local people and on the regeneration of degraded forests. The approach has been successful in reducing poaching, restoring habitats, and creating a local constituency for conservation.

The WWF partnered with Leonardo DiCaprio to form a global campaign, &quot;Save Tigers Now&quot;, with the ambitious goal of building political, financial and public support to double the wild tiger population by 2022. &quot;Save Tigers Now&quot; started its campaign in 12 different WWF Tiger priority landscapes, since May 2010.

This population of tigers has been assessed at the local level in several countries. It is listed as Endangered in Nepal, India, and Bhutan, While Bangladesh and China list it as Critically Endangered.

In April 2023, India signed a memorandum of understanding with Cambodia to assist the country with the tiger&#x27;s reintroduction. At least of the Cardamom Mountains of Tatai Wildlife Sanctuary could be used to host tigers that are imported from India. The last tiger in Cambodia was photographed in 2007 by a camera trap. In 2016, the Cambodian government declared that the Indochinese tiger population was &quot;functionally extinct&quot;.

===In India===

In 1973, Project Tiger was launched aiming at ensuring a viable tiger population in the country and preserving areas of biological importance as a natural heritage for the people. The project&#x27;s task force visualised these tiger reserves as breeding nuclei, from which surplus animals would disperse to adjacent forests. The selection of areas for the reserves represented as close as possible the diversity of ecosystems across the tiger&#x27;s distribution in the country. Funds and commitment were mustered to support the intensive program of habitat protection and rehabilitation under the project. By the late 1980s, the initial nine reserves covering an area of had been increased to 15 reserves covering an area of . More than 1100 tigers were estimated to inhabit the reserves by 1984.

Through this initiative the population decline was reversed initially, but has resumed in recent years; India&#x27;s tiger population decreased from 3,642 in the 1990s to just over 1,400 from 2002 to 2008.

The Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 enables government agencies to take strict measures so as to ensure the conservation of the Bengal tigers. The Wildlife Institute of India estimates showed that tiger numbers had fallen in Madhya Pradesh by 61%, Maharashtra by 57%, and Rajasthan by 40%. The government&#x27;s first tiger census, conducted under the Project Tiger initiative begun in 1973, counted 1,827 tigers in the country that year. Using that methodology, the government observed a steady population increase, reaching 3,700 tigers in 2002. However, the use of more reliable and independent censusing technology including camera traps for the 2007–2008 all-India census has shown that the numbers were in fact less than half than originally claimed by the Forest Department.

Following the revelation that only 1,411 Bengal tigers existed in the wild in India, down from 3,600 in 2003, the Indian government set up eight new tiger reserves. Because of dwindling tiger numbers, the Indian government has pledged US$153 million to further fund the Project Tiger initiative, set up a Tiger Protection Force to combat poachers, and fund the relocation of up to 200,000 villagers to minimise human-tiger interaction. Indian tiger scientists have called for use of technology in the conservation efforts.
In 2022, Ranipur Wildlife Sanctuary was declared as the 54th tiger reserve.

In January 2008, the Government of India launched a dedicated anti-poaching force composed of experts from Indian police, forest officials and various other environmental agencies. Ranthambore National Park is often cited as a major success by Indian officials against poaching.

Kuno-Palpur in Madhya Pradesh was supposed to receive Asiatic lions from Gujarat. Since no lions have been transferred from Gujarat to Madhya Pradesh so far, it may be used as a sanctuary for the tiger instead where it could help keep down the leopard population that targets the main prey of reintroduced cheetahs.

=== In captivity ===

Bengal tigers have been captive bred since 1880 and widely crossed with tigers from other range countries.

In July 1976, Billy Arjan Singh acquired a hand-reared tigress from Twycross Zoo in the United Kingdom, and reintroduced her to the wild in Dudhwa National Park with the permission of India&#x27;s then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In the 1990s, some tigers from this area were observed to have the typical appearance of Siberian tigers, namely a large head, pale fur, white complexion, and wide stripes, and were suspected to be Siberian–Bengal tiger hybrids. Tiger hair samples from the national park were analysed using mitochondrial sequence analysis. Results revealed that the tigers in question had a Bengal tiger mitochondrial haplotype indicating that their mother was a Bengal tiger. Skin, hair and blood samples from 71 tigers collected in Indian zoos, in the Indian Museum, Kolkata and including two samples from Dudhwa National Park were used for a microsatellite analysis that revealed that two tigers had alleles in two loci contributed by Bengal and Siberian tigers.
However, samples of two hybrid specimens constituted a too small sample base to conclusively assume that &quot;Tara&quot; was the source of the Siberian tiger genes.

Indian zoos bred tigers for the first time at the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata. The 1997 International Tiger Studbook lists the global captive population of Bengal tigers at 210 individuals that are all kept in Indian zoos, except for one female in North America. Completion of the Indian Bengal Tiger Studbook is a necessary prerequisite to establishing a captive management program for tigers in India.

===In Bangladesh===
WildTeam is working with local communities and the Bangladesh Forest Department to reduce human-tiger conflict in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. For over 100 years people, tigers, and livestock have been injured and killed in the conflict; in recent decades up to 50 people, 80 livestock, and 3 tigers have been killed in a year. Now, through WildTeam&#x27;s work, there is a boat-based Tiger Response team that provides first aid, transport, and body retrieval support for people being killed in the forest by tigers. WildTeam has also set up 49 volunteer Village Response Teams that are trained to save tigers that have strayed into the village areas and would be otherwise killed. These village teams are made up of over 350 volunteers, who are also now supporting anti-poaching work and conservation education/awareness activities. WildTeam also works to empower local communities to access the government funds for compensating the loss/injury of livestock and people from the conflict. To monitor the conflict and assess the effectiveness of actions, WildTeam have also set up a human-tiger conflict data collection and reporting system.

===In Nepal===
In May 2010, Banke National Park was established with an area of .
The government aimed at doubling the country&#x27;s tiger population by 2022 at the Global Tiger Summit in 2010. The tiger population reached 355 in 2022, almost tripling the population of 121 in 2009.

===&quot;Re-wilding&quot; project in South Africa===
In 2000, the Bengal tiger re-wilding project &quot;Tiger Canyons&quot; was started by John Varty, who together with the zoologist Dave Salmoni trained captive-bred tiger cubs how to stalk, hunt, associate hunting with food and regain their predatory instincts. They claimed that once the tigers proved that they can sustain themselves in the wild, they would be released into a free-range sanctuary of South Africa to fend for themselves.

The project has received controversy after accusations by their investors and conservationists of manipulating the behaviour of the tigers for the purpose of a film production, &quot;Living with Tigers&quot;, with the tigers believed to be unable to hunt. Stuart Bray, who had originally invested a large sum of money in the project, claimed that he and his wife, Li Quan, watched the film crew &quot;[chase] the prey up against the fence and into the path of the tigers just for the sake of dramatic footage.&quot;

The four tigers involved in this project have been confirmed to be crossbred Siberian–Bengal tigers, which should neither be used for breeding nor being released into the Karoo. Tigers that are not genetically pure will not be able to participate in the tiger Species Survival Plan, as they are not used for breeding, and are not allowed to be released into the wild.

==In culture==

The tiger is one of the animals displayed on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The tiger crest is the emblem on Chola coins. The presence on many coins of a tiger, a fish, and a bow suggests they are Chola issues. The latter two emblems are of the Pandya and Chera dynasties respectively, and Chola copper plate inscriptions showing the three together indicate that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over them.

Today, the tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh and India. Bangladeshi banknotes feature a tiger. The political party Muslim League of Pakistan uses the tiger as its election symbol.
Tipu Sultan, who ruled Mysore in late 18th-century India, was also a great admirer of the animal. The famed 18th-century automaton, Tipu&#x27;s Tiger was also created for him. The tiger was the dynastic symbol of this dynasty.
During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Punch ran a political cartoon showing the Indian rebels as a tiger attacking a victim.

<text>Canadian federalism () involves the current nature and historical development of the federal system in Canada.

Canada is a federation with eleven components: the national Government of Canada and ten provincial governments. All eleven governments derive their authority from the Constitution of Canada. There are also three territorial governments in the far north, which exercise powers delegated by the federal parliament, and municipal governments which exercise powers delegated by the province or territory. Each jurisdiction is generally independent from the others in its realm of legislative authority. The division of powers between the federal government and the provincial governments is based on the principle of exhaustive distribution: all legal issues are assigned to either the federal Parliament or the provincial Legislatures.

The division of powers is set out in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (originally called the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;), a key document in the Constitution of Canada. Some amendments to the division of powers have been made in the past century and a half, but the 1867 act still sets out the basic framework of the federal and provincial legislative jurisdictions. The division of power is reliant upon the &quot;division&quot; of the unitary Canadian Crown and, with it, of Canadian sovereignty, among the country&#x27;s 11 jurisdictions.

The federal nature of the Canadian constitution was a response to the colonial-era diversity of the Maritimes and the Province of Canada, particularly the sharp distinction between the French-speaking inhabitants of Lower Canada and the English-speaking inhabitants of Upper Canada and the Maritimes. John A. Macdonald, Canada&#x27;s first prime minister, originally favoured a unitary system.

== History ==
=== Origins ===


The foundations of Canadian federalism were laid at the Quebec Conference of 1864. The Quebec Resolutions were a compromise between those who wanted sovereignty vested in the federal government and those who wanted it vested in the provinces. The compromise based the federation on the constitution of the British Empire, under which the legal sovereignty of imperial power was modified by the conventions of colonial responsible government, making colonies of settlement (such as those of British North America) self-governing in domestic affairs. A lengthy political process ensued before the Quebec Resolutions became the &quot;British North America Act 1867&quot;. This process was dominated by John A. Macdonald, who joined British officials in attempting to make the federation more centralized than that envisaged by the Resolutions.

The resulting constitution was couched in more centralist terms than intended. As prime minister, Macdonald tried to exploit this discrepancy to impose his centralist ideal against chief opponent Oliver Mowat. In a series of political battles and court cases from 1872 to 1896, Mowat reversed Macdonald&#x27;s early victories and entrenched the co-ordinated sovereignty which he saw in the Quebec Resolutions. In 1888, Edward Blake summarized that view: &quot;[It is] a federal as distinguished from a legislative union, but a union composed of several existing and continuing entities ... [The provinces are] not fractions of a unit but units of a multiple. The Dominion is the multiple and each province is a unit of that multiple ...&quot; The accession of Wilfrid Laurier as prime minister inaugurated a new phase of constitutional consensus, marked by a more-egalitarian relationship between the jurisdictions. The federal government&#x27;s quasi-imperial powers of disallowance and reservation, which Macdonald abused in his efforts to impose a centralised government, fell into disuse.

=== 1914–1960 ===
During World War I, the federal Crown&#x27;s power was extended with the introduction of income taxes and passage of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, the scope of which was determined by several court cases. The constitution&#x27;s restrictions of parliamentary power were affirmed in 1919 when, in the &quot;Initiatives and Referendums Reference&quot;, a Manitoba act providing for direct legislation by way of initiatives and referendums was ruled unconstitutional by the Privy Council on the grounds that a provincial viceroy (even one advised by responsible ministers) could not permit &quot;the abrogation of any power which the Crown possesses through a person directly representing it&quot;. Social and technological changes also worked their way into constitutional authority; the &quot;Radio Reference&quot; found that federal jurisdiction extended to broadcasting, and the &quot;Aeronautics Reference&quot; found the same for aeronautics.

In 1926, the King–Byng Affair resulted in a constitutional crisis which was the impetus for changes in the relationship between the governor general and the prime minister. Although its key aspects were political in nature, its constitutional aspects continue to be debated. One result was the Balfour Declaration issued later that year, whose principles were eventually codified in the Statute of Westminster 1931. It, and the repeal of the &quot;Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865&quot;, gave the federal parliament the ability to make extraterritorial laws and abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Criminal appeals were abolished in 1933, but civil appeals continued until 1949. The last Privy Council ruling of constitutional significance occurred in 1954, in &quot;Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited&quot;. After that, the Supreme Court of Canada became the final court of appeal.

In 1937, Lieutenant Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen refused to give Royal Assent to three Legislative Assembly of Alberta bills. Two would have put the province&#x27;s banks under the control of the provincial government; the third, the &quot;Accurate News and Information Act&quot;, would have forced newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories the provincial cabinet considered &quot;inaccurate&quot;. All three bills were later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Reference re Alberta Statutes&quot;, which was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

World War II&#x27;s broader scope required passage of the &quot;National Resources Mobilization Act&quot; to supplement the powers in the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; to pursue the national war effort. The extent to which wartime federal power could expand was further clarified in the &quot;Chemicals Reference&quot; (which held that Orders in Council under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; were equivalent to acts of parliament) and the &quot;Wartime Leasehold Regulations Reference&quot;, which held that wartime regulations could displace provincial jurisdiction for the duration of an emergency. Additional measures were required in order to secure control of the economy during that time. Jurisdiction over unemployment insurance was transferred permanently to the federal sphere; the provinces surrendered their power to levy succession duties and personal and corporate income taxes for the duration of the war (and for one year afterwards) under the Wartime Tax Rental Agreement; and labour relations were centralized under federal control with the Wartime Labour Relations Regulations (lasting until 1948), in which the provinces ceded their jurisdiction over all labour issues.

Canada emerged from the war with better cooperation between the federal and provincial governments. This led to a welfare state, a government-funded health care system and the adoption of Keynesian economics. In 1951 section 94A was added to the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; to allow the Canadian parliament to provide for pensions. This was extended in 1964 to allow supplementary benefits, including disability and survivors&#x27; benefits. The era saw an increase in First Ministers&#x27; Conferences to resolve federal-provincial issues. The Supreme Court of Canada became the court of final appeal after the 1949 abolition of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the federal parliament received the power to amend the constitution, limited to non-provincial matters and subject to other constraints.

=== 1960–1982 ===
1961 saw the last instance of a lieutenant governor reserving a bill passed by a provincial legislature. Frank Lindsay Bastedo, Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan, withheld Royal Assent and reserved Bill 5, &quot;An Act to Provide for the Alteration of Certain Mineral Contracts&quot;, to the Governor-in-Council for review. According to Bastedo, &quot;[T]his is a very important bill affecting hundreds of mineral contracts. It raises implications which throw grave doubts of the legislation being in the public interest. There is grave doubt as to its validity&quot;. The act was upheld in an Order in Council by the federal government.

Parliament passed the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, the first codification of rights by the federal government. Prime Minister Lester Pearson obtained passage of major social programs, including universal health care (a federal-provincial cost-sharing program), the Canada Pension Plan and Canada Student Loans. Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution encouraged increased administrative decentralization in Canada, with Quebec often opting out of federal initiatives and instituting its own (such as the Quebec Pension Plan). The Quebec sovereignty movement led to the victory of the Parti Québécois in the 1976 Quebec election, prompting consideration of further loosening ties with the rest of Canada; this was rejected in a 1980 referendum.

During the premiership of Pierre Trudeau, the federal government became more centralist. Canada experienced &quot;conflictual federalism&quot; from 1970 to 1984, generating tensions with Quebec and other provinces. The National Energy Program and other petroleum disputes sparked bitterness in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland toward the federal government.

=== Patriation ===
Although Canada achieved full status as a sovereign nation in the Statute of Westminster 1931, there was no consensus on a process to amend the constitution; attempts such as the 1965 Fulton–Favreau formula and the 1971 Victoria Charter failed to receive unanimous approval from both levels of government. When negotiations with the provinces again stalled in 1980, Trudeau threatened to take the case for patriation to the British parliament &quot;[without] bothering to ask one premier&quot;. According to the federal cabinet and Crown counsel, if the British Crown (in council, in parliament, and on the bench) exercised sovereignty over Canada, it would do so only at the request of the federal ministers.

Manitoba, Newfoundland and Quebec posed reference questions to their respective courts of appeal, in which five other provinces intervened in support. In his ruling, Justice Joseph O&#x27;Sullivan of the Manitoba Court of Appeal held that the federal government&#x27;s position was incorrect; the constitutionally-entrenched principle of responsible government meant that &quot;Canada had not one responsible government but eleven.&quot; Officials in the United Kingdom indicated that the British parliament was under no obligation to fulfill a request for legal changes desired by Trudeau, particularly if Canadian convention was not followed. All rulings were appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. In a decision later known as the &quot;Patriation Reference&quot;, the court ruled that such a convention existed but did not prevent the federal parliament from attempting to amend the constitution without provincial consent and it was not the role of the courts to enforce constitutional conventions.

The Canadian parliament asked the British parliament to approve the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, which it did in passage of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;. This resulted in the introduction of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, the transfer of constitutional amendment to a Canadian framework and the addition of section 92A to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, giving the provinces more jurisdiction over their natural resources.

=== After 1982 ===
The Progressive Conservative Party under Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney favoured the devolution of power to the provinces, culminating in the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. After merging in 2003 with the heavily devolutionist Canadian Alliance, the Conservative Party under Stephen Harper has maintained the same stance. When Harper was appointed prime minister in 2006, the frequency of First Ministers&#x27; conferences declined significantly; inter-provincial cooperation increased with meetings of the Council of the Federation, established by the provincial premiers, in 2003.

After the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien limited the ability of the federal government to spend money in areas under provincial jurisdiction. In 1999 the federal government and all provincial governments except Quebec&#x27;s agreed to the Social Union Framework Agreement, which promoted common standards for social programmes across Canada. Former Prime Minister Paul Martin used the phrase &quot;asymmetrical federalism&quot; to describe this arrangement. The Supreme Court upholds the concepts of flexible federalism (where jurisdictions overlap) and cooperative federalism (where they can favourably interact), as noted in &quot;Reference re Securities Act&quot;.

== The Crown ==
As a federal monarchy, the Canadian Crown is present in all jurisdictions in the country, with the headship of state a part of all equally. Sovereignty is conveyed not by the governor general or federal parliament, but through the Crown itself as a part of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Canada&#x27;s 11 (one federal and 10 provincial) legal jurisdictions; linking the governments into a federal state, the Crown is &quot;divided&quot; into 11 &quot;crowns&quot;. The fathers of the Canadian Confederation viewed the constitutional monarchy as a bulwark against potential fracturing of the Canadian federation, and the Crown remains central to Canadian federalism.

== Distribution of legislative powers ==


=== Division of powers ===
The federal–provincial distribution of legislative powers (also known as the division of powers) defines the scope of the federal and provincial legislatures. These have been identified as exclusive to the federal or provincial jurisdictions or shared by all. Section 91 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, lists the major federal parliament powers, based on the concepts of peace, order, and good government; while Section 92 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; enumerates those of the provincial governments.

The Act puts remedial legislation on education rights, uniform laws relating to property and civil rights (in all provinces other than Quebec), creation of a general court of appeal and other courts &quot;for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada,&quot; and implementing obligations arising from foreign treaties, all under the purview of the federal legislature in Section 91. Some aspects of the Supreme Court of Canada were elevated to constitutional status in 1982.

The Act lists the powers of the provincial parliaments (subject to the federal parliament&#x27;s authority to regulate inter-provincial movement) in Section 92. These powers include the exploration, development and export to other provinces of non-renewable natural resources, forestry resources and electrical energy. Education is under provincial jurisdiction, subject to the rights of separate schools.

Old-age pensions, agriculture and immigration are shared by federal and provincial jurisdictions. One prevails over the other in cases of conflict, however: for pensions, federal legislation will not displace provincial laws, and for agriculture and immigration it is the reverse.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1871&quot; allowed parliament to govern any territories not forming part of any province, and the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot;, gave parliament the ability to pass extraterritorial laws.

=== Doctrines ===
To rationalize how each jurisdiction may use its authority, certain doctrines have been devised by the courts: pith and substance, including the nature of any ancillary powers and the colourability of legislation; double aspect; paramountcy; inter-jurisdictional immunity; the living tree; the purposive approach; and charter compliance (most notably through the Oakes test). Additionally, there is the implied Bill of Rights.

=== Jurisdiction over public property ===

Jurisdiction over Crown property is divided between the provincial legislatures and the federal parliament, with the key provisions Sections 108, 109, and 117 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Public works are the property of the federal Crown, and natural resources are within the purview of the provinces. Title to such property is not vested in one jurisdiction or another, however, since the Canadian Crown is indivisible. Section 109 has been given a particularly-broad meaning; provincial legislation regulating labour used to harvest and the disposal of natural resources does not interfere with federal trade and commerce power, and royalties have been held to cover the law relating to escheats. Canada cannot unilaterally create Indian reserves, since the transfer of such lands requires federal and provincial approval by Order in Council (although discussion exists about whether this is sound jurisprudence).

The provincial power to manage Crown land did not initially extend to Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created from part of the Northwest Territories, since the land was vested in the federal Crown. It was vacated on some land (the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block) by British Columbia when it entered the confederation. Title to this land was not vested in those provinces until the passage of the Natural Resources Acts in 1930. The power is not absolute, however; provincial Crown land may be regulated or expropriated for federal purposes. The administration of crown land is also subject to the rights of First Nations (since they are a relevant interest), and provincial power &quot;is burdened by the Crown obligations toward the Aboriginal people in question&quot;. Debate exists about whether such burdens apply in the same manner in the Western provinces under the Natural Resources Acts.

Management of offshore resources is complex; although management of the beds of internal waters is vested in the provincial Crowns, management of beds of territorial seas is vested in the federal Crown (with management of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone). The beds and islands of the waters between Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia have been declared the property of the Crown in right of British Columbia. Federal-provincial management agreements have been implemented concerning offshore petroleum resources in the areas around Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia.

=== Taxation and spending ===

Taxation is a power of the federal and provincial legislatures; provincial taxation is more restricted, in accordance with sections 92(2) and 92(9) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. In &quot;Allard Contractors Ltd. v. Coquitlam (District)&quot;, provincial legislatures may levy an indirect fee as part of a valid regulatory scheme. Gérard La Forest observed &quot;obiter dicta&quot; that section 92(9) (with provincial powers over property and civil rights and matters of a local or private nature) allows for the levying of license fees even if they constitute indirect taxation.

Parliament has the power to spend money on public debt and property. Although the Supreme Court of Canada has not ruled directly about constitutional limits on federal spending power, parliament can transfer payments to the provinces. This arises from the 1937 decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the &quot;Unemployment Insurance Reference&quot;, where Lord Atkin observed: &quot;Assuming the Dominion has collected by means of taxation a fund, it by no means follows that any legislation which disposes of it is necessarily within Dominion competence ... If on the true view of the legislation it is found that in reality in pith and substance the legislation invades civil rights within the Province, or in respect of other classes of subjects otherwise encroaches upon the provincial field, the legislation will be invalid&quot;. In &quot;Re Canada Assistance Plan&quot;, Justice Sopinka held that the withholding of federal money previously granted to fund a matter within provincial jurisdiction does not amount to the regulation of that matter.

== Federal legislative power ==

Much distribution of power has been ambiguous, leading to disputes which have been decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and (after 1949) the Supreme Court of Canada. The nature of the Canadian constitution was described by the Privy Council in 1913 as not truly federal (unlike the United States and Australia); although the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, states in its preamble that the colonies had expressed &quot;their desire to be federally united into one Dominion&quot;, &quot;the natural and literal interpretation of the word [federal] confines its application to cases in which these States, while agreeing on a measure of delegation, yet in the main continue to preserve their original Constitutions&quot;. The Privy Council determined that the Fathers of Confederation desired a &quot;general Government charged with matters of common interest, and new and merely local Governments for the Provinces&quot;. Matters other than those listed in the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, as the responsibility of the federal or provincial parliaments fell to the federal legislature (the reverse of the arrangement between the federal and state congresses in the United States).

=== National and provincial concerns ===

The preamble of Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 states: &quot;It shall be lawful for the Queen ... to make laws for the Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada, in relation to all Matters not coming within the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces&quot;. In addition to assigning powers not stated elsewhere (which has been narrowly interpreted), this has led to the creation of the national-emergency and national-concern doctrines.

The national-emergency doctrine was described by Mr Justice Beetz in &quot;Reference re Anti-Inflation Act&quot;. The national-concern doctrine is governed by the principles stated by Mr Justice Le Dain in &quot;R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd.&quot;.

The federal government is partially limited by powers assigned to the provincial legislatures; for example, the Canadian constitution created broad provincial jurisdiction over direct taxation and property and civil rights. Many disputes between the two levels of government revolve around conflicting interpretations of the meaning of these powers.

In the &quot;Local Prohibition Case&quot; of 1896, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council arrived at a method of interpretation, known as the &quot;four-departments doctrine&quot;, in which jurisdiction over a matter is determined in the following order:

# Does it fall under Section 92, classes 115?
# Can it be characterized as falling under Section 91, classes 129?
# Is it of a general nature, bringing it within Section 91&#x27;s residuary clause?
# If not, it falls under Section 92, class 16.

By the 1930s, as noted in the &quot;Fish Canneries Reference&quot; and &quot;Aeronautics Reference&quot;, the division of responsibilities between federal and provincial jurisdictions was summarized by Lord Sankey.

Although the Statute of Westminster 1931 declared that the Parliament of Canada had extraterritorial jurisdiction, the provincial legislatures did not achieve similar status. According to s. 92, &quot;In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws ...&quot;.

If a provincial law affects the rights of individuals outside the province:

:* If it is, in pith and substance, provincial, ancillary effects on the rights of individuals outside the province are irrelevant but
:* Where it is, in pith and substance, legislation in relation to the rights of individuals outside the province, it will be &quot;ultra vires&quot; the province

In &quot;The Queen (Man.) v. Air Canada&quot;, it was held that the s. 92(2) power providing for &quot;direct taxation within the province&quot; does not extend to taxing sales on flights passing over (or through) a province, but the question of how far provincial jurisdiction can extend into a province&#x27;s airspace was left undecided. However, the property and civil rights power does allow for determining rules with respect to conflict of laws in civil matters.

=== National dimension ===

Federal jurisdiction arises in several circumstances:

:* Under the national-emergency doctrine for temporary legislation (the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;)
:* Under the national-concern doctrine for:
:** Matters not existing at confederation (radio and television)
:** Matters of a local or private nature in a province which have become matters of national concern, such as what can accrue to the regulation of trade and commerce
:* Matters where the grant is exclusive under Section 91 (criminal law)
:* Matters where authority may be assumed (as with works for the general advantage of Canada)

The gap approach, employed sparingly, identifies areas of jurisdiction arising from oversights by the drafters of the constitution; for example, federal jurisdiction to incorporate companies is inferred from the power provinces have under Section 92 for &quot;The Incorporation of Companies with Provincial Objects&quot;.

=== Uniformity of federal law ===

Section 129 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; provided for laws in effect at the time of Confederation to continue until repealed or altered by the appropriate legislative authority. Similar provisions were included in the terms of union of other territories that were subsequently incorporated into Canada.

The uniformity of laws in some areas of federal jurisdiction was significantly delayed. Offences were not made uniform until 1892, when common-law criminal offences were abolished under the &quot;Criminal Code, 1892&quot;. Divorce law was not made uniform until 1968, Canadian maritime law not until 1971 and marriage law not until 2005. Provisions of the &quot;Civil Code of Lower Canada&quot;, adopted in 1865 by the former Province of Canada, affecting federal jurisdiction continued to be in force in Quebec (if they had not been displaced by other federal Acts) until their repeal on 15 December 2004.

=== Interplay of jurisdictions ===

According to the Supreme Court of Canada, &quot;our Constitution is based on an allocation of exclusive powers to both levels of government, not concurrent powers, although these powers are bound to interact in the realities of the life of our Constitution.&quot; Chief Justice Dickson observed the complexity of that interaction:

The history of Canadian constitutional law has been to allow for a fair amount of interplay and indeed overlap between federal and provincial powers. It is true that doctrines like interjurisdictional and Crown immunity and concepts like &quot;watertight compartments&quot; qualify the extent of that interplay. But it must be recognized that these doctrines and concepts have not been the dominant tide of constitutional doctrines; rather they have been an undertow against the strong pull of pith and substance, the aspect doctrine and, in recent years, a very restrained approach to concurrency and paramountcy issues.
Notable examples include:
* Although the provinces have the power to create criminal courts, only the federal government has the power to determine criminal procedure. Criminal procedure includes prosecution, and federal law can determine the extent of federal and provincial involvement. The provinces&#x27; power under s. 92(14) over the administration of justice includes the organization of courts and police forces, which determines the level of law enforcement. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as the federal police, contracts for the provision of many provincial and municipal police forces.
* Although the federal power to regulate fisheries does not override provincial authority to require a permit for catching fish in waters under provincial control, the regulation of recreational fisheries has been partially delegated under the &quot;Fisheries Act&quot; to the provinces for specified species in specific provinces.
* Works affecting navigation are subject to federal approval under the &quot;Navigable Waters Protection Act&quot; and provincial approval, since the beds of navigable waters are generally reserved to the Crown in right of the province.
* Although federal jurisdiction over broadcasting and most telecommunications is exclusive, the provinces may regulate advertising and cable installation (above or underground).
* Although the concept of marriage is under federal jurisdiction, the solemnization of marriages is controlled by the provinces.
* The provincial power to regulate security interests under the property and civil-rights power will be displaced by security interests created under a federal head of power – most notably under the banking power – but only to the extent that federal law has covered the field.
* Laws arising from the property and civil-rights power will be used to complement the interpretation of federal legislation where the federal Act has not provided otherwise, but federal power cannot be used to create rules of private law in areas outside its jurisdiction.
* In insolvency law, provincial statutes operate by federal incorporation into the &quot;Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act&quot; and the &quot;Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act&quot;. However, where a stay under federal law has been lifted in order to allow proceedings to take place, a province can impose a moratorium on proceedings falling under provincial law.

=== Delegation and cooperation ===

In 1899, Lord Watson asserted during the argument in &quot;CPR v Bonsecours&quot; that neither the federal parliament nor the provincial legislatures could give legislative authority to the other level. Subsequent attempts to dovetail federal and provincial legislation to achieve certain ends met with difficulty, such as an attempt by Saskatchewan to ensure enforcement of a federal statute by enacting a complementary Act declaring that the federal Act would continue in force under provincial authority if it was ruled &quot;ultra vires&quot;. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled a federal and provincial Act &quot;ultra vires&quot;, voiding both as an attempt by the province to vest powers in parliament unauthorized by the &quot;BNA Act&quot;.

The matter was addressed in 1950 by the Supreme Court, which held &quot;ultra vires&quot; a proposed Nova Scotia Act which would have authorized the inter-delegation of legislative and taxation authority between Parliament and the Nova Scotia legislature. In that decision, Justice Rand explained the distinction between delegation to a subordinate body and that to a legislative body.

Later attempts to achieve federal-provincial coordination have succeeded with other types of legislative schemes involving:
* Conditional legislation (such as a federal Act, providing that it will not apply where a provincial Act has been enacted in a given matter). As Justice Rand declared in 1959, &quot;That Parliament can so limit the operation of its own legislation and that it may do so upon any such event or condition is not open to serious debate&quot;.
* Incorporation by reference or adoption (for example, a federal regulation prohibiting vehicles from operating on a federal highway except &quot;in accordance with the laws of the province and the municipality in which the highway is situated&quot;)
* Joint schemes with administrative cooperation, such as the administrative authority granted by federal law to provincial transport boards to license extraprovincial transport

=== Power to implement treaties ===

To understand how treaties can enter Canadian law, three significant cases must be considered: the &quot;Aeronautics Reference&quot;, the &quot;Radio Reference&quot; and the &quot;Labour Conventions Reference&quot;. Although the reasoning behind the judgments is complex, it is considered to break down as follows:
* Aeronautics were held by the &quot;Aeronautics Reference&quot; to be within the authority of the Parliament of Canada under s. 132 governing treaties entered into by the British Empire. After that treaty was replaced, it was held in &quot;Johannesson v. West St. Paul&quot; that in accordance with &quot;Ontario v. Canada Temperance Federation&quot; the field continued to be within federal jurisdiction under the power relating to peace, order and good government.
* Although an international agreement governing broadcasting was not a treaty of the British Empire, the &quot;Radio Reference&quot; held that it fell within federal jurisdiction; Canada&#x27;s obligations under its agreements in this field required it to pass legislation applying to all Canadian residents, and the matter could be seen as analogous to telegraphs (already in the federal sphere).
* The &quot;Labour Conventions Reference&quot; dealt with labour relations (clearly within provincial jurisdiction); since the conventions were not treaties of the British Empire and no plausible argument could be made for the field attaining a national dimension or becoming of national concern, the Canadian Parliament was unable to exercise new legislative authority.

Although the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; had made Canada fully independent in governing its foreign affairs, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that s. 132 did not evolve to take that into account. As noted by Lord Atkin at the end of the judgment,

It must not be thought that the result of this decision is that Canada is incompetent to legislate in performance of treaty obligations. In totality of legislative powers, Dominion and Provincial together, she is fully equipped. But the legislative powers remain distributed and if in the exercise of her new functions derived from her new international status she incurs obligations they must, so far as legislation be concerned when they deal with provincial classes of subjects, be dealt with by the totality of powers, in other words by co-operation between the Dominion and the Provinces. While the ship of state now sails on larger ventures and into foreign waters she still retains the watertight compartments which are an essential part of her original structure.
This case left undecided the extent of federal power to negotiate, sign and ratify treaties dealing with areas under provincial jurisdiction, and has generated extensive debate about complications introduced in implementing Canada&#x27;s subsequent international obligations; the Supreme Court of Canada has indicated in several &quot;dicta&quot; that it might revisit the issue in an appropriate case.

== Limits on legislative power ==

Outside the questions of &quot;ultra vires&quot; and compliance with the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, there are absolute limits on what the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures can legislate. According to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;:
* S. 96 has been construed to hold that neither the provincial legislatures nor Parliament can enact legislation removing part of the inherent jurisdiction of the superior courts.
* S. 121 states, &quot;All Articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces&quot;. This amounts to a prohibition of inter-provincial tariffs.
* S. 125 states, &quot;No Lands or Property belonging to Canada or any Province shall be liable to Taxation&quot;.
* Under s. 129, limits have been placed on the ability of the legislatures of Ontario and Quebec to amend or repeal Acts of the former Province of Canada. Where such an act created a body corporate operating in the former Province, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that such bodies cannot have &quot;provincial objects&quot; and only the Parliament of Canada had power to deal with such acts. It has been held that this restriction exists for any Act applying equally to Upper and Lower Canada, which became problematic when the &quot;Civil Code of Lower Canada&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Civil Code of Quebec&quot;.

While the Parliament of Canada has the ability to bind the Crown in right of Canada or of any province, the converse is not true for the provincial legislatures, as &quot;[p]rovincial legislation cannot &quot;proprio vigore&quot; [ie, of its own force] take away or abridge any privilege of the Crown in right of the Dominion.&quot;

<doc id="221160" wikidata="Q1466972" url="?curid=221160" title="Eight Elders">
<text>The Eight Great Eminent Officials (), abbreviated as the Eight Elders (), were a group of elderly members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) who held substantial power in the last two decades of the 20th century. In the English-speaking world, these men are often called The Eight Immortals as an allusion to the Taoist deities commonly known as the Eight Immortals.

== History ==
The Central Advisory Commission was the institutional power base of the Eight Elders. Deng Xiaoping, who emerged as China&#x27;s top leader in December 1978, as a result of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, was the most powerful of the group, but his power was never absolute, and he had to consult and make compromises with the other seven Elders, of whom the most prominent were Chen Yun and Li Xiannian (considered the second and third in power, respectively, and both associated with the leftist hard-liners and opposition to reform and market-oriented economy). Deng&#x27;s allies among the Elders included Yang Shangkun and Peng Zhen. 

By the late 1980s, all Elders, including Deng himself, were united in opposition to further political reforms, while holding different views on economic and foreign affairs.

According to reformist General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, of all the Elders, Li Xiannian was the most prominent, most active and most successful in opposing and blocking changes and reforms in both political and economic issues. Important decisions were often made in Deng&#x27;s home. The Eight Elders were able to remove three Party leaders. Hua Guofeng was gradually removed from Premier and Party chairman between 1980 and 1981; Hu Yaobang was removed in 1987; and, Zhao Ziyang was removed in 1989. Deng, the core of the eight Elders, retired after the 5th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee (November 1989), when he resigned from his last official title (Chairman of the Central Military Commission), and the rest of the Elders officially retired after the 14th Party Congress in October 1992 when the Central Advisory Commission was abolished. They still held decisive influence behind the scenes until Deng&#x27;s death in February 1997.

== Membership ==
The membership was never formally stated. With Deng Xiaoping as the main holder of power, the eight elders are accepted to include:

;Timeline of the life span of members
== Descendants ==
Descendants of the eight Elders who have benefited significantly from nepotism and cronyism constitute a group now known as &quot;the Princelings&quot; or the &quot;Crown Prince Party&quot;. Its members, rising through party ranks, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions, even if they are assigned to a local administrative position. They are often seen to outrank other party officials and possess greater prestige due to their lineage. &quot;Bloomberg&quot; has reported on the extensive wealth accumulated by these descendants via their roles in various public and private companies.

<doc id="221162" wikidata="Q745796" url="?curid=221162" title="Grey currawong">
<text>The grey currawong (Strepera versicolor) is a large passerine bird native to southern Australia, including Tasmania. One of three currawong species in the genus &quot;Strepera&quot;, it is closely related to the butcherbirds and Australian magpie of the family Artamidae. It is a large crow-like bird, around long on average; with yellow irises, a heavy bill, dark plumage with white undertail and wing patches. The male and female are similar in appearance. Six subspecies are recognised and are distinguished by overall plumage colour, which ranges from slate-grey for the nominate from New South Wales and eastern Victoria and subspecies &quot;plumbea&quot; from Western Australia, to sooty black for the clinking currawong of Tasmania and subspecies &quot;halmaturina&quot; from Kangaroo Island. All grey currawongs have a loud distinctive ringing or clinking call.

Within its range, the grey currawong is generally sedentary, although it is a winter visitor in the southeastern corner of Australia. Comparatively little studied, much of its behaviour and habits is poorly known. Omnivorous, it has a diet that includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas as well as scrubland in drier parts of the country. It is less arboreal than the pied currawong, spending more time foraging on the ground. It builds nests high in trees, which has limited the study of its breeding habits. Unlike its more common relative, it has adapted poorly to human impact and has declined in much of its range, although not considered endangered. 

== Taxonomy and naming ==
The grey currawong was first described as &quot;Corvus versicolor&quot; by ornithologist John Latham in 1801, who gave it the common name of &quot;variable crow&quot;. The specific name &quot;versicolor&quot; means &#x27;of variable colours&#x27; in Latin. Other old common names include grey crow-shrike, leaden crow-shrike, mountain magpie, black-winged currawong (in western Victoria), clinking currawong (in Tasmania), and squeaker (in Western Australia). The black-winged currawong was known to the Ramindjeri people of Encounter Bay as &quot;wati-eri&quot;, the word meaning &quot;to sneak&quot; or &quot;to track&quot;. &quot;Kiling-kildi&quot; was a name derived from the call used by the people of the lower Murray River.

Together with the pied currawong (&quot;S. graculina&quot;) and black currawong (&quot;S. fuliginosa&quot;), the grey currawong forms the genus &quot;Strepera&quot;. Although crow-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and are instead closely related to the Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between the woodswallows and the butcherbirds and relatives in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which later became the family Artamidae.

=== Subspecies ===

Six subspecies are spread around Australia. They vary extensively in the colour of their plumage, from grey to sooty black, and the amount of white on their wings, and most were at one time considered separate species:

* &quot;S. v. versicolor&quot;, the nominate race, is known as the grey currawong, and is found in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, and eastern and central Victoria, west to Port Phillip on the coast, and to the Grampians inland.
* &quot;S. v. intermedia&quot;, the grey-brown form of South Australia, is also known as the brown currawong. It is found in the Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas, the Gawler and Mount Lofty Ranges and the eastern areas of the Great Australian Bight. The smallest of the six subspecies, it has a shorter wing and tail. Birds in the southern Eyre Peninsula have darker plumage than those in the northern parts. First described by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877 from a specimen collected in Port Lincoln, its specific name is the Latin adjective &quot;intermedia&quot; &quot;intermediate&quot;.

* &quot;S. v. arguta&quot;, the darkest race, is from eastern Tasmania and is known as the clinking currawong from its call or locally as the black magpie. Sharpe called it the Tasmanian hill-crow. It was first described by John Gould in 1846. The specific name is the Latin adjective &quot;argūtus&quot; &quot;shrill/piercing&quot;, &quot;noisy&quot; or &quot;melodious&quot;. Larger and heavier than the nominate subspecies, it has longer wings, tail, bill, and tarsus.
*&quot;S. v. melanoptera&quot;, known as the black-winged currawong, is from western Victoria&#x27;s Mallee region and South Australia west to the Mount Lofty Ranges. It can be difficult to distinguish from the black and pied currawongs at any distance. Of similar size and bill-shape to the nominate subspecies, it has a darker blackish-brown plumage and lacks the white wing markings. Birds from much of western Victoria are intermediates between this and the nominate subspecies, often bearing partial white markings on the wings. Similarly, in the western part of its range in South Australia are intermediate with subspecies to the west and also have some paler patches. Named by John Gould in 1846, its specific name is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;melano-&quot; &quot;black&quot; and &quot;pteron&quot; &quot;wings&quot;. American ornithologist Dean Amadon observed that birds from northwestern Victoria were lighter in plumage than those of South Australia, and tentatively classified them as a separate subspecies &quot;howei&quot;. However, he noted they warranted further investigation, and subsequent authorities have not recognised the populations as separate.
* &quot;S. v. halmaturina&quot; is restricted to Kangaroo Island. A dark-plumaged subspecies, it has a longer narrower bill than the nominate race, and is lighter in weight. The specific name is the adjective &quot;halmaturina&quot; &quot;of Kangaroo Island&quot;. It was first named by Gregory Mathews in 1912.
* &quot;S. v. plumbea&quot; is found from western South Australia and the southwestern corner of the Northern Territory westwards into Western Australia. It is colloquially known as &quot;squeaker&quot; from the sound of its call. Named by Gould in 1846, its specific name is the Latin adjective &quot;plumběus&quot; &quot;leaden&quot;. The common name leaden crow-shrike refers to this group. Very similar in plumage to the nominate subspecies, it differs in its thicker, more downward curved bill. The base plumage is variable, but tends to be slightly darker and possibly more brown-tinged than the nominate subspecies. Amadon noted that a specimen from the Everard Ranges in northwestern South Australia was larger and paler than other specimens of &quot;plumbea&quot;. Although he considered these Central Australian birds as a separate subspecies &quot;centralia&quot;, he conceded very little was known. They have been considered part of &quot;plumbea&quot; subsequently.

== Description ==

A larger and more slender bird than its more common relative the pied currawong, the adult grey currawong ranges from in length, with an average of around ; the wingspan varies from , averaging around , with an average weight of around . Adults of the Tasmanian subspecies average around . The male is on average slightly larger than the female, but the size and weight ranges mostly overlap. It is generally a dark grey bird with white in the wing, undertail coverts, the base of the tail and most visibly, the tip of the tail. It has yellow eyes. The orbital (eye-ring), legs and feet are black, whereas the bill and gape range from greyish black to black. The overall plumage varies according to subspecies. The nominate race &quot;versicolor&quot; and &quot;plumbea&quot; are slate-grey in colour, while &quot;melanoptera&quot; and &quot;intermedia&quot; are blackish-brown, and &quot;arguta&quot; of Tasmania and &quot;halmaturina&quot; a sooty black. The size of the white patch on the wing also varies, being large and easily spotted in &quot;versicolor&quot;, &quot;plumbea&quot;, &quot;intermedia&quot; and &quot;arguta&quot;, but non-existent or indistinct in &quot;melanoptera&quot; and &quot;halmaturina&quot;.

More specifically, the nominate subspecies has a grey forehead, crown, nape, ear-coverts and throat with the face a darker grey-black. The feathers of the throat are longer, giving rise to hackles there. The upperparts and underparts are a brownish-grey and become more brown with age. Towards the belly, the feathers are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have white edges which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.

Birds appear to moult once a year in spring or summer, although observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.

=== Voice ===

Unlike that of the pied currawong, the grey currawong&#x27;s call does not sound like its name. The grey currawong is best known for making a sound variously transcribed as &quot;p&#x27;rink&quot;, &quot;clink&quot;, &quot;cling&quot;, &quot;ker-link&quot; or &quot;tullock&quot;, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the &quot;kling&quot; of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races &quot;versicolor&quot; and &quot;melanoptera&quot; are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.

A softer and more tuneful musical call has been called the &quot;toy-trumpet call&quot;. It has been reported to foretell rainy weather. The loud &quot;bell call&quot; resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.

=== Similar species ===
The grey currawong is unlikely to be confused with other species apart from other currawongs. It is immediately distinguishable from crows and ravens as they have wholly black plumage, a stockier build and white (rather than yellow) eyes. However, it can be encountered in mixed-species flocks with the pied currawong. It can be distinguished by its paler plumage, lack of white base to the tail, straighter bill, and very different vocalisations. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies &quot;melanoptera&quot;) has a darker plumage than other grey subspecies, and is thus more similar in appearance to the pied currawong, but its wings lack the white primaries of the latter species. In Tasmania, the black currawong is similar but has a heavier bill and call similar to the pied and lacks the white rump.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Grey currawongs are found right across the southern part of Australia from the Central Coast region of New South Wales, occurring south of latitude 32°S southwards and westwards, from the vicinity of Mudgee in the north and southwest to Temora and Albury onto the Riverina and across most of Victoria and southern South Australia to the fertile south-west corner of Western Australia and the semi-arid country surrounding it. The clinking subspecies is endemic to Tasmania, where it is more common in the eastern parts, but is absent from King and Flinders Islands in Bass Strait. There is an outlying population in the arid area where the Northern Territory meets South Australia and Western Australia. In general, the grey currawong is sedentary throughout its range, although it appears to be resident in the cooler months only in south Gippsland in eastern Victoria and the far south coast of New South Wales.

The grey currawong is found in wet and dry sclerophyll forests across its range, as well as mallee scrubland, and open areas such as parks or farmland near forested areas. It also inhabits pine plantations. Preferences vary between regions; subspecies &quot;versicolor&quot; is more common in wetter forests in southeastern mainland Australia, while the Tasmanian subspecies &quot;arguta&quot; is found most commonly in lowland dry sclerophyll forest. The subspecies &quot;melanoptera&quot; and &quot;intermedia&quot; are found mainly in mallee scrublands and woodlands, while in Western Australia, subspecies &quot;plumbea&quot; is found in various forests and woodlands, such as jarrah (&quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot;), karri (&quot;E. diversicolor&quot;), tuart (&quot;E. gomphocephala&quot;) and wandoo (&quot;E. wandoo&quot;), as well as paperbark woodlands around swampy areas, and acacia shrublands dominated by summer-scented wattle (&quot;Acacia rostellifera&quot;) and mulga (&quot;Acacia aneura&quot;) with &quot;Eremophila&quot; understory.

Formerly common, the grey currawong appears to have declined across its distribution; it became scarce in northern Victoria in the 1930s, and in northeastern Victoria in the 1960s. Habitat destruction has seen it decline in southeastern South Australia around Naracoorte and from many areas in the Western Australian Wheatbelt. It also became rare in the Margaret River and Cape Naturaliste regions after 1920, and vanished from much of the Swan Coastal Plain by the 1940s. One place which has seen an increase in numbers is the Mount Lofty Ranges in the 1960s. The species has never been common in the Sydney Basin and sightings have been uncommon and scattered since the time of John Gould in the early 19th century. The status of the species is uncertain in the Northern Territory, where it may be extinct. It has been classified as &quot;critically endangered&quot; there pending further information.

== Behaviour ==
Overall, data on the social behaviour of the grey currawong is lacking, and roosting habits are unknown. It is generally shyer and more wary than its pied relative, but has become more accustomed to people in areas of high human activity in southwest Western Australia. Its undulating flight is rapid and silent. It hops or runs when on the ground. Birds are generally encountered singly or in pairs, but may forage in groups of three to eleven birds. Up to forty birds may gather to harvest a fruit tree if one is found. The black-winged subspecies is seldom seen in groups larger than four or five, while the clinking currawong may form groups of up to forty birds over the non-breeding season.

There is some evidence of territoriality, as birds in the Wheatbelt maintain territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the wedge-tailed eagle, square-tailed kite and Australian hobby. The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.

Two species of chewing louse have been isolated and described from grey currawongs: (&quot;Menacanthus dennisi&quot;) from subspecies &quot;halmaturina&quot; on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, and &quot;Australophilopterus strepericus&quot; from subspecies &quot;arguta&quot; near Launceston in Tasmania. A new species of spirurian nematode, &quot;Microtetrameres streperae&quot; isolated from a grey currawong at Waikerie was described in 1977. The parasitic alveolate &quot;Isospora streperae&quot; was described from a grey currawong (subspecies &quot;plumbea&quot;) from Western Australia.

=== Breeding ===
The breeding habits of the grey currawong are not well known, and the inaccessibility of its nests makes study difficult. The breeding season lasts from August to December. The grey currawong builds a large shallow nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees; generally eucalypts are chosen. It produces a clutch of one to five (though usually two or three) rounded or tapered oval eggs, which vary in size and colour according to subspecies. Those of subspecies &quot;versicolor&quot; average in size and are a pale brown or buff with shades of pink or wine tones, and are marked with streaks or splotches of darker brown, purple-brown, slate-grey or even blue-tinged. Those of the black-winged currawong are similarly sized at and are buff or flesh-coloured with a purple tint and marked with darker browns or purple-browns. The clinking currawong lays larger and paler eggs of dull white, pale grey or buff with a faint wine-colour tint, and marked with darker tones of purple-, grey- or blue-tinged brown, which average . The eggs of the brown currawong are also pale wine-tinted brown, buff, or cream with darker markings of cinnamon, brown or purple-brown, and measure . Finally, the western subspecies lays eggs averaging in size which are pale shades of red-brown or wine-colour, with darker red-brown markings. In all subspecies, the markings can coalesce over the larger end of the egg to form a darker &#x27;cap&#x27;. The incubation period is poorly known because of the difficulty of observing nests, but one observation suggested around 23 days from laying to hatching. Like all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous). Both parents feed the young.

Data on nesting success rates is limited; one study of 35 nests found that 28 (80%) resulted in the fledging of at least one young currawong. Causes of failure included nest collapse by gale-force winds and rain, and harassment and nest raiding by pied currawongs. The incidence of brood parasitism is uncertain. A pair of grey currawongs have been observed feeding a channel-billed cuckoo (&quot;Scythrops novaehollandiae&quot;) chick on one occasion.

=== Feeding ===

The grey currawong is an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder. It preys on many invertebrates, such as snails, spiders and woodlice, and a wide variety of insects including beetles, earwigs, cockroaches, wasps, ants and grasshoppers, and smaller vertebrates, including frogs, lizards such as the bearded dragon as well as skinks, rats, mice, and nestlings or young of Tasmanian nativehen, red wattlebird, eastern spinebill, house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;), and splendid fairywren (&quot;M. splendens&quot;), It has been recorded hunting at the nests of the superb fairywren (&quot;Malurus cyaneus&quot;), and the bell miner (&quot;Manorina melanophrys&quot;).

A wide variety of plant material is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of &quot;Ficus&quot; species, &quot;Leucopogon&quot; species, &quot;Exocarpos&quot; species, a cycad &quot;Macrozamia riedlei&quot;, a mistletoe &quot;Lysiana exocarpi&quot;, &quot;Astroloma humifusum&quot;, &quot;A. pinifolium&quot;, &quot;Myoporum insulare&quot;, &quot;Enchylaena tomentosa&quot; and &quot;Coprosma quadrifida&quot;. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as &quot;Pyracantha angustifolia&quot; and &quot;P. fortuneana&quot;, and &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (&quot;Doryanthes excelsa&quot;). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong has been identified as the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (&quot;Asparagus asparagoides&quot;). Boneseed (&quot;Chrysanthemoides monilifera&quot; subspecies &quot;monilifera&quot;), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, &quot;A. pinifolium&quot; is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to wonder whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.

Foraging takes place on the ground, or less commonly in trees or shrubs. Most commonly the grey currawong probes the ground for prey, but sometimes chases more mobile animals. It has been recorded removing insects from parked cars, as well as employing the &quot;zirkeln&quot; method, where it inserts its bill in a crack or under a rock and uses it to lever open a wider space to hunt prey. In one case, a bird was observed holding bark off the branch of a eucalypt and levering open gaps every with its bill. The grey currawong usually swallows prey whole, although one bird was observed impaling a rodent on a stick and eating parts of it, in the manner of a butcherbird. A field study on road ecology in southwestern Australia revealed that the grey currawong is unusual in inhabiting cleared areas adjacent to roads. However, it was not recorded feeding on roadkill, and moves away from the area in breeding season. It was also commonly hit and killed by vehicles.

==Conservation status==
The grey currawong has a very large range and thus does not meet the range size criteria for vulnerable. The population trend appears to be stable, although the population size has not been quantified, it is unlikely to approach the susceptible thresholds under the population size criterion (10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10 percent in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature evaluated it as least concern.

==In Aboriginal mythology==
A grey currawong features in the major Dreaming story of the Kaurna people, when the ancestor hero Tjilbruke kills one in order to use fat and feathers to cover his body before transforming himself into a glossy ibis at Rosetta Head.

<doc id="221166" wikidata="Q1586211" url="?curid=221166" title="Black currawong">
<text>The black currawong (Strepera fuliginosa), also known locally as the black [[jay]], is a large passerine bird endemic to Tasmania and the nearby islands within the Bass Strait. One of three currawong species in the genus &quot;Strepera&quot;, it is closely related to the butcherbirds and Australian magpie within the family Artamidae. It is a large crow-like bird, around long on average, with yellow irises, a heavy bill, and black plumage with white wing patches. The male and female are similar in appearance. Three subspecies are recognised, one of which, &quot;Strepera fuliginosa colei&quot; of King Island, is vulnerable to extinction.

Within its range, the black currawong is generally sedentary, although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during the cooler months. The habitat includes densely forested areas as well as alpine heathland. It is rare below altitudes of . Omnivorous, its diet includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Less than the pied currawong, the black currawong spends more time foraging on the ground. It roosts and breeds in trees.

==Taxonomy==
The black currawong was first described by ornithologist John Gould in 1836 as &quot;Cracticus fuliginosus&quot;, and in 1837 as &quot;Coronica fuliginosa&quot;. The specific epithet is the Late Latin adjective &quot;fuliginosus&quot; &quot;sooty&quot; from Latin &quot;fūlīgo&quot; &quot;soot&quot;, and refers to the black plumage. American ornithologist Dean Amadon regarded the black currawong as a subspecies of the pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), seeing it as part of a continuum with subspecies &quot;ashbyi&quot; of the latter species, the complex having progressively less white plumage as one moves south. Subsequent authors have considered it a separate species, although Richard Schodde and Ian Mason describe it as forming a superspecies with the pied currawong. A 2013 genetic analysis by Anna Kearns and colleagues gave some indication that the black currawong lineage diverged from a common ancestor of the grey and pied currawongs (though sampling was limited and not the focus of the study).

Common names include black currawong, sooty currawong, black bell-magpie, black or mountain magpie, black or sooty crow-shrike, and muttonbird. Black jay is a local name applied to the species within Tasmania. The species is often confused with the local dark-plumaged subspecies of the grey currawong (&quot;S. versicolor&quot;), known as the clinking currawong or hill magpie.

There are three subspecies of the black currawong: the nominate form &quot;Strepera fuliginosa fuliginosa&quot; of Tasmania; &quot;Strepera fuliginosa parvior&quot; of Flinders Island, described by Schodde and Mason in 1999; and &quot;Strepera fuliginosa colei&quot; of King Island, described by Gregory Mathews in 1916. The two island subspecies have identical plumage to the nominate, but are slightly smaller with shorter wings and tails, subspecies &quot;colei&quot; having a shorter tail than &quot;parvior&quot;.

Together with the pied and grey currawong, the black currawong forms the genus &quot;Strepera&quot;. Although crow-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and are instead closely related to the Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon E. Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between the woodswallows and the butcherbirds and relatives in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which later became the family Artamidae.

==Description==
The black currawong is about long with an wingspan. The male is somewhat larger and heavier than the female; males of the nominate subspecies average to females&#x27; . Male wings average around and tails , while female wings average and tails . Data for the two island subspecies is limited, but males of subspecies &quot;colei&quot; have been measured at with wings on average, and a female at with a wing, and subspecies &quot;parvior&quot; at for males with wings on average, and and wing for a female. The sexes are similar in plumage, which is all black except for white patches at the tips of the wings and tail feathers. The bill and legs are black and the eyes bright yellow. The white tips line the trailing edges of the wings in flight, and a paler arc across the bases of the primary flight feathers is also visible on the underwing. Although there is no seasonal variation to the plumage, the black may fade a little to a dark brown with wear. Immature birds have browner-tinged plumage, and a yellow gape until they are two years old. The oldest recorded age of a black currawong has been 15 years; a bird was sighted in July 2004 near Fern Tree, Tasmania, less than from where it had been banded in July 1989.

===Voice===
The black currawong is a loud and vocal species, and makes a variety of calls. Its main call is markedly different from the pied or grey currawongs and has been described as a combination of alternating &quot;kar&quot; and &quot;wheek&quot; sounds, &quot;killok killok&quot;, or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.

===Similar species===
The black currawong is commonly confused with the clinking currawong, but the latter species has a white rump and larger white wing patches. The black currawong has a heavier bill and a characteristic call unlike the clink-clink call of the clinking. The forest and little ravens are similar in size but lack the white wing patches, and instead have entirely black plumage and white, rather than yellow eyes. The black currawong is unlikely to be mistaken for the closely related pied currawong as the latter does not reach Tasmania, but it has a longer and deeper bill and lacks the white rump and undertail coverts.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black currawong is endemic to Tasmania where it is widespread, although it is uncommon or absent from areas below altitude. It breeds mainly in the Central Highlands, with scattered records elsewhere in Tasmania. Reports of breeding are rare from the northeast. It is found on many islands of Bass Strait, including the Hunter and Furneaux Groups. It was recorded historically from the Kent Group, but its status there is unknown. Within its range it is largely sedentary, although some populations at higher altitudes may move to lower altitudes during winter. Flocks have also been recorded making the long journey across water from Maria Island to the mainland in the morning and returning at nightfall, as well as moving between islands in the Maatsuyker group. The black currawong has expanded into the northeast corner of the island, to Musselroe Bay and Cape Portland.

The black currawong is generally found in wetter eucalypt forests, dominated by such species as alpine ash (&quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot;), messmate (&quot;E. obliqua&quot;), and mountain gum (&quot;E. dalrympleana&quot;), sometimes with a beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) understory. It also frequents cool rainforest of beech, king billy pine (&quot;Athrotaxis selaginoides&quot;). In lowlands it is more restricted to denser forests and moist gullies, while it also occurs in alpine scrubland and heathland at altitude. In dryer more open forest, it is replaced by the clinking currawong, although the two may co-occur in places such as the Central Highlands and Eastern Tiers. Both the Flinders and King island subspecies are found across their respective islands, but prefer more forested habitats there. The black currawong has been recorded in gardens in Hobart in Tasmania&#x27;s southeast, and around Mount Wellington, on Hobart&#x27;s outskirts, in winter. Some remained to breed in Hobart in 1994 after a year of severe weather.

==Behavior==
Black currawongs are found singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been observed digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they did not appear to wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs have been observed wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at Maydena, Tasmania, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as pears with their feet.

One species of chewing lice, &quot;Australophilopterus curviconus&quot;, has been recovered and described from a black currawong near Launceston.

===Breeding===
Breeding occurs from August to December. Like all currawongs, it builds a large cup-nest out of sticks, lined with softer material, and placed in the fork of a tree from high. Old nests are sometimes tidied up and reused in following years. A typical clutch has two to four pale grey-brown, purplish-buff, spotted, blotched red-brown or purplish-brown eggs. As in all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous). Both parents feed the young, but the male feeds them alone after leaving the nest and as they become more independent, and also moves from giving food directly to them to placing it on the ground near them so they learn to eat for themselves.

===Feeding===

No systematic studies have been done on the diet of the black currawong, but it is known to be omnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of foodstuffs including insects and small vertebrates, carrion, and berries. Birds often forage on the ground but also in tree canopies. They use their bills to probe the ground or turn over clods of earth or small rocks looking for food. Birds have been seen using walking tracks to forage. A group of ten birds were observed trying to break open ice on a frozen lake. They have been recorded foraging along the beach for fly larvae in beached kelp. Most commonly, black currawongs forage in pairs, but they may congregate in larger groups—flocks of 100 birds have descended on orchards to eat apples or rotten fruit. The species has been observed in a mixed-species flocks with forest ravens (&quot;Corvus tasmanicus&quot;), and silver gulls (&quot;Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae&quot;), white-faced herons (&quot;Egretta novaehollandiae&quot;), white-fronted chats (&quot;Epthianura albifrons&quot;), and European starlings (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;) on the beach at Sundown Point. They have been observed securing dead larger prey to ease subsequent dismemberment; a parent currawong had wedged a dead chicken&#x27;s wings under a log to facilitate pulling off portions such as legs and entrails to feed to its young, and another time hooked a dead rabbit on a spur of a log to rip it into pieces.

The black currawong consumes the berries of the species in the heath genus &quot;Leptecophylla&quot;, as well as &quot;Astroloma humifusum&quot;, and the native sedge &quot;Gahnia grandis&quot;, as well as domestic pea, and apples. Invertebrates consumed include earthworms (Lumbricidae) and many types of insects, such as ants, moths, flies, crickets, grasshoppers and beetles like weevils, scarabs and leaf beetles. It is adaptable, and has learnt to eat the introduced European wasp (&quot;Vespula germanica&quot;). A bird that was being harassed by three scarlet robins (&quot;Petroica boodang&quot;) was seen to turn on them and catch and eat one suddenly. Other vertebrates recorded as prey include the house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), small lizards, tadpoles, chickens, ducklings, the young of domestic turkey, Tasmanian nativehen (&quot;Tribonyx mortierii&quot;), flame robin (&quot;Petroica phoenicea&quot;) and rabbit.

It can become quite bold and tame, much like its close relative, the pied currawong on the Australian mainland, especially in public parks and gardens where people make a habit of feeding it. Black currawongs have been recorded taking young peas from pods, raiding orchards, seizing chickens from poultry yards, and entering barns in search of mice.

Black currawongs are very common around picnic areas in Tasmania&#x27;s two most popular National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by tourists there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995 when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.

== Conservation status ==
Despite its small range, the black currawong is unlikely to meet the range size criteria for vulnerable. The population trend appears to be stable, and even though the population size has not been quantified, it is unlikely to approach the susceptible thresholds under the population size criterion (10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10 percent in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population size), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature evaluated it as least concern. One of its subspecies, &quot;Strepera fuliginosa colei&quot; of King Island, has declined over much of its range on King Island, possibly due to clearing of its forest habitat, and has been listed as vulnerable. There are estimated to be around 500 birds. It is unclear whether competition with the more numerous forest raven is impacting on the subspecies there.

<text>The pied currawong (Strepera graculina) is a black passerine bird native to eastern Australia and Lord Howe Island. One of three currawong species in the genus &quot;Strepera&quot;, it is closely related to the butcherbirds and Australian magpie of the family Artamidae. Six subspecies are recognised. It is a robust crowlike bird averaging around in length, black or sooty grey-black in plumage with white undertail and wing patches, yellow irises, and a heavy bill. The male and female are similar in appearance. Known for its melodious calls, the species&#x27; name &quot;currawong&quot; is believed to be of indigenous origin.

Within its range, the pied currawong is generally sedentary, although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during the cooler months. It is omnivorous, with a diet that includes a wide variety of berries and seeds, invertebrates, bird eggs, juvenile birds and young marsupials. It is a predator which has adapted well to urbanization and can be found in parks and gardens as well as rural woodland. The habitat includes every kind of forested area, although mature forests are preferred for breeding. Roosting, nesting and the bulk of foraging take place in trees, in contrast with the ground-foraging behaviour of its relative, the Australian magpie.

== Taxonomy ==
The pied currawong&#x27;s binomial names were derived from the Latin &quot;strepera&quot;, meaning &quot;noisy&quot;, and &quot;graculina&quot; for resembling a jackdaw. It was first described by English ornithologist George Shaw in John White&#x27;s 1790 book, &quot;Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales&quot;, as the &quot;white-vented crow&quot;, with Latin name &quot;Corvus graculinus&quot;. Also published in 1790, John Latham introduced the name &quot;Coracias strepera&quot;, classifying it with the rollers. The specific epithet &quot;strepera&quot; (or its masculine form, &quot;streperus&quot;) was used by several subsequent authors including Leach, Vieillot, Shaw, Temminck, and Gould, in genera &quot;Corvus&quot; (crows), &quot;Cracticus&quot;, &quot;Gracula&quot; (grackles), &quot;Barita&quot;, and &quot;Coronica&quot;.

René Lesson defined &quot;Strepera&quot; as a sub-genus of crows in 1831. John Gould described a second species, the black currawong of Tasmania, in 1836, and the next year created genus &quot;Coronica&quot; for both species. George Robert Gray adopted Lesson&#x27;s name &quot;Strepera&quot; at the genus level and introduced the combination &quot;Strepera graculina&quot; in 1840.

Pied crow-shrike is an old vernacular name from colonial days, and the term &quot;pied&quot; refers to two or more colors in blotches. Other common names include pied chillawong, currawang, charawack, kurrawack, tallawong, tullawong, mutton-bird, Otway forester, and pied afternoon-tea bird. The onomatopoeic term &quot;currawong&quot; itself is derived from the bird&#x27;s call. However, the exact origin of the term is unclear; the most likely antecedent is the word &quot;garrawaŋ&quot; from the indigenous Jagera language from the Brisbane region, although the Darug word &quot;gurawaruŋ&quot; from the Sydney basin is a possibility. &quot;Yungang&quot; as well as &quot;Kurrawang&quot; and &quot;Kurrawah&quot; are names from the Tharawal people of the Illawarra region. French ornithologists such as Daudin, Lesson, and Vieillot called it the , meaning &#x27;alarm clock&#x27; or &#x27;wake-up caller&#x27;.

Its closest relative is the black currawong (&quot;S. fuliginosa&quot;) of Tasmania, which has sometimes been considered a subspecies. Together with the larger grey currawong (&quot;S. versicolor&quot;), they form the genus &quot;Strepera&quot;. Although crow-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and instead belong to the family Artamidae, together with the closely related Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae.

=== Subspecies ===
Six subspecies are currently recognised, characterised principally by differences in size and plumage. There is a steady change to the birds&#x27; morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish plumage, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show more white plumage in the tail, with less whiteness on the wing.

*&quot;Strepera graculina graculina&quot; is the nominate form, found from the Sydney region north to the Burdekin River in northern Queensland.
*&quot;Strepera graculina ashbyi&quot;, (critically endangered), the western Victorian pied currawong, was described by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1913. It is threatened by hybridization with the neighbouring subspecies &quot;nebulosa&quot; whose range is expanding westwards. A 2000 estimate placed the number of breeding birds at around 250. It resembles subspecies &quot;nebulosa&quot;, with sooty plumage, a long tail and a short bill. There is some doubt over whether &quot;ashbyi&quot;, which is little known, is a distinct subspecies or a colour morph of &quot;nebulosa&quot;. It is thought to have evolved after the two populations became separated by basalt plains in western Victoria, with the return of trees after the abandonment of regular Aboriginal burning in the late 18th century contributing to the remixing of populations. Hybrid forms have been identified in the Grampians and Yarra Valley. Further investigation in 2017 by Peter Menkhorst and Craig Morley established that the type specimen was an immature bird and that its collection point and characteristics placed it within subspecies &quot;nebulosa&quot;. They also observed there is a population that is abundant (rather than endangered) in the Otway Ranges that has a smaller speculum (wingpatch) than &quot;nebulosa&quot; and that Mathews had mistaken this for a subspecies of grey currawong, naming it &quot;Neostrepera versicolor riordani&quot;. They proposed renaming &quot;S. g. nebulosa&quot; to &quot;S. g. ashbyi&quot; and the other population as &quot;S. g. riordani&quot;.
* &quot;Strepera graculina crissalis&quot;, (vulnerable) the Lord Howe currawong was described by English naturalist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877. It appears to have adapted well to human habitation on Lord Howe Island, though the population is small overall, somewhere around 70–80 birds. Although regarded as a subspecies, it has yet to be studied with molecular DNA techniques, which may lead to it being reclassified as a separate species.

* &quot;Strepera graculina magnirostris&quot; is found on the Cape York Peninsula to the Normanby River in northern Queensland. First described by Henry Lake White in 1923, it has a longer and heavier bill and shorter tail than the nominate subspecies. It has been little studied to date.
* &quot;Strepera graculina robinsoni&quot; is found on the Atherton Tableland in northeastern Queensland. First described by Gregory Mathews in 1912, it is combined with &quot;magnirostris&quot; by some authors. Little researched, it appears to be smaller than other subspecies.
* &quot;Strepera graculina nebulosa&quot;, found in southeastern New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and central Victoria, is very similar to the nominate subspecies but has a shorter bill, longer tail and larger wing. Its upperparts are sooty black, a little paler than the nominate subspecies, and underparts sooty black to slate-grey. The white patch on the primary flight feathers is also smaller. It was first defined in 1999 by ornithologists and bird taxonomists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason. There is a hybrid zone with subspecies &quot;graculina&quot; in southern and central New South Wales, from Eden north to the Illawarra region and stretching northwest to the Blue Mountains.

== Description ==

The pied currawong is generally a black bird with white in the wing, undertail coverts, the base of the tail and most visibly, the tip of the tail. It has yellow eyes. Adult birds are in length, with an average of around ; the wingspan varies from , averaging around . Adult males average around , females . The wings are long and broad. The long and heavy bill is about one and a half times as long as the head and is hooked at the end. Juvenile birds have similar markings to adults but have softer and brownish plumage overall, although the white band on the tail is narrower. The upperparts are darker brown with scallops and streaks over the head and neck, and the underparts lighter brown. The eyes are dark brown and the bill dark with a yellow tip. The gape is a prominent yellow. Older birds grow darker until adult plumage is achieved, but juvenile tail markings only change to adult late in development. Birds appear to moult once a year in late summer after breeding. The pied currawong can live for over 20 years in the wild.

=== Voice ===

Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when in flight and at all times of the day. They are noisier early in the morning and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud distinctive call has been translated as &quot;Kadow-Kadang&quot; or &quot;Curra-wong&quot;, akin to a croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as &quot;Wheeo&quot;. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.

=== Similar species ===
The smaller white-winged chough has similar plumage but has red eyes and is found mainly on the ground. Australian crow and raven species have white eyes and lack the white rump, and the similar-sized Australian magpie has red eyes and prominent black and white plumage. The larger grey currawong is readily distinguished by its lighter grey overall plumage and lack of white feathers at the base of the tail. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies &quot;melanoptera&quot; of the grey) does have a darker plumage than other grey subspecies, but its wings lack the white primaries of the pied currawong.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The pied currawong is common in both wet and dry sclerophyll forests, rural and semi-urban environments throughout eastern Australia, from Cape York Peninsula to western Victoria and Lord Howe Island, where it occurs as an endemic subspecies. It has more recently become prevalent in South-East South Australia, in and around Mount Gambier. It has adapted well to European presence, and has become more common in many areas of eastern Australia, with surveys in Nanango, Queensland, Barham, New South Wales, Geelong, Victoria, as well as the Northern Tablelands and South West Slopes regions in New South Wales, all showing an increase in population. This increase has been most marked, however, in Sydney and Canberra since the 1940s and 1960s, respectively. In both cities, the species had previously been a winter resident only, but now remains year-round and breeds there. They are a dominant species and common inhabitant of Sydney gardens.

In general, the pied currawong is sedentary, although some populations from higher altitudes move to areas of lower elevation in winter. However, evidence for the extent of migration is conflicting, and the species&#x27; movements have been little studied to date. More recently still, a survey of the population of pied currawongs in southeastern Queensland between 1980 and 2000 had found the species had become more numerous there, including suburban Brisbane. One 1992 survey reported the total number of pied currawongs in Australia had doubled from three million birds in the 1960s to six million in the early 1990s.

The pied currawong is able to cross bodies of water of some size, as it has been recorded from Rodondo Island, which lies off the coast of Wilsons Promontory in Victoria, as well as some offshore islands in Queensland. It has disappeared from Tryon, North West, Masthead and Heron Islands in the
Capricorn Group on the Great Barrier Reef. The presence of the Lord Howe subspecies is possibly the result of a chance landing there.

The pied currawong&#x27;s impact on smaller birds that are vulnerable to nest predation is controversial: several studies have suggested that the species has become a serious problem, but the truth of this widely held perception was queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed that common introduced birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of Gould&#x27;s petrel at a colony on Cabbage Tree Island, near Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (&quot;Eopsaltria australis&quot;) and scarlet robin (&quot;Petroica boodang&quot;) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is negatively correlated with the presence of silvereyes (&quot;Zosterops lateralis&quot;).

The species has been implicated in the spread of weeds by consuming and dispersing fruit and seed. In the first half of the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the prickly pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.

== Behaviour ==

Pied currawongs are generally tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus able to share territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage in the early morning and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.

During the breeding season, pied currawongs will pair up and become territorial, defending both nesting and feeding areas. A 1994 study in Sydney&#x27;s leafy northern suburbs measured an average distance of between nests, while another in Canberra in 1990 had three pairs in a segment of pine-tree lined street. Territories have been measured around 0.5–0.7 ha in Sydney and Wollongong, although these were restricted to nesting areas and did not include a larger feeding territory, and 7.9 ha in Canberra. Pied currawongs vigorously drive off threats such as ravens, and engage in bill-snapping, dive-bombing and aerial pursuit. They adopt a specific threat display against other currawongs by lowering the head so the head and body are parallel to the ground and pointing the beak out forward, often directly at the intruder. The male predominates in threat displays and territorial defence, and guards the female closely as she builds the nest.

Flocks of birds appear to engage in play; one routine involves a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting to dislodge it. A successful challenger is then challenged in its turn by other birds in the flock.

The pied currawong bathes by wading into water up to deep, squatting down, ducking its head under, and shaking its wings. It preens its plumage afterwards, sometimes applying mud or soil first. The species has also been observed anting.

=== Breeding ===

Although found in many types of woodland, the pied currawong prefers to breed in mature forests. It builds a nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees in spring; generally eucalypts are chosen and never isolated ones. It produces a clutch of three eggs; they are a light pinkish-brown colour (likened by one author to that of silly putty) with splotches of darker pink-brown and lavender. Tapered oval in shape, they measure about . The female broods alone. The incubation period is not well known, due to the difficulty of observing nests, but observations indicate around 30 days from laying to hatching. Like all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous) They quickly grow a layer of ashy-grey down. Both parents feed the young, although the male does not begin to feed them directly until a few days after birth.

The channel-billed cuckoo (&quot;Scythrops novaehollandiae&quot;) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs which are then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs closely resemble those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs have been known to desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The brown goshawk (&quot;Accipiter fasciatus&quot;) and lace monitor (&quot;Varanus varius&quot;) have also been recorded taking nestlings.

=== Feeding ===

The pied currawong is an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, eating fruit and berries as well as preying on many invertebrates, and smaller vertebrates, mostly juvenile birds and bird eggs, although they may take healthy adult birds up to the size of a crested pigeon on occasion. Currawongs will hunt in trees, snatching insects and berries, as well as birds and eggs from nests. They also hunt in the air and on the ground. Insects predominate in the diet during summer months, and fruit during the winter. They will often scavenge, eating scraps and rubbish and can be quite bold when seeking food from people, lingering around picnic areas and bird-feeding trays. Beetles and ants are the most common types of insects consumed. Pied currawongs have been recorded taking mice, as well as chickens and turkeys from farms. The pied currawong consumes fruit, including a wide variety of figs, such as the Moreton Bay (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;), Port Jackson (&quot;F. rubiginosa&quot;), Banyan (&quot;F. virens&quot;) and Strangler fig (&quot;F. watkinsiana&quot;), as well as lillypillies (&quot;Syzygium&quot; species), white cedar (&quot;Melia azedarach&quot;), plum pine (&quot;Podocarpus elatus&quot;), and geebungs (&quot;Persoonia&quot; species). Other fruit is also sought after, and currawongs have been known to raid orchards, eating apples, pears, strawberries, grapes, stone fruit, citrus, and corn. Pied currawongs have been responsible for the spread of the invasive ornamental &quot;Asparagus aethiopicus&quot; (often called &quot;A. densiflorus&quot;) in the Sydney area, the weedy privet species &quot;Ligustrum lucidum&quot; and &quot;L. sinense&quot;, and firethorn species &quot;Pyracantha angustifolia&quot; and &quot;P. rogersiana&quot; around Armidale.

Birds forage singly or in pairs in summer, and more often in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which time they are more likely to loiter around people and urban areas. They occasionally associate with Australian magpies (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;) or common starlings (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (&quot;S. versicolor&quot;) and satin bowerbirds (&quot;Ptilinorhynchus violaceus&quot;). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (&quot;Falco longipennis&quot;), collared sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter cirrocephalus&quot;), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua galerita&quot;). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (&quot;Sericornis frontalis&quot;) nestlings became silent when they heard the recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.

== Conservation status ==

The range size criterion does not apply to this species because it has such a large range. As a result, it does not approach the vulnerable thresholds. The population trend appears to be increasing and its size has not been quantified, but it does not appear to be close to the susceptible thresholds under the population size criterion (10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10 percent in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). As a result, the species is considered to be least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

<text>Sir Benjamin Peter James Bradshaw (born 30 August 1960) is a British politician who served as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport from 2009 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Exeter from 1997 to 2024. Before entering politics he worked as a BBC Radio reporter.

==Early life and career in journalism==
Bradshaw is the son of an Anglican priest and former canon of Norwich Cathedral, Peter Bradshaw, and his wife Daphne Murphy. Bradshaw was educated at Thorpe Grammar School, followed by the University of Sussex where he read for a degree in German. He also attended the University of Freiburg in Germany while an undergraduate. Between 1982 and 1983, Bradshaw taught English at the Technikum, a school of technology in Winterthur in the Zurich canton of Switzerland.

Bradshaw became a reporter with the Exeter &quot;Express &amp; Echo&quot; in 1984 and subsequently joined the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; in Norwich as a reporter in 1985. In 1986 he joined the staff of BBC Radio Devon and became the Berlin correspondent for BBC Radio in 1989 and was working in the city when the Berlin Wall fell. In 1991, he became a reporter with BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The World at One&quot;, contributing to the programme until his election to Westminster. He won the Sony News Reporter Award in 1993.

==Parliamentary career==

===Election and first term as an MP===
Bradshaw was selected to contest the marginal parliamentary seat of Exeter at the 1997 general election after the first choice candidate was deselected by the local Labour party on instructions from Labour party headquarters.

The sitting Conservative MP, John Hannam, had retired and the Conservatives chose Adrian Rogers to be their candidate. While Bradshaw is openly gay, Rogers is a leading member of the religious right. During the campaign there were allegations of homophobia and sin. The result, however, was not close, and Bradshaw was elected as the Labour MP for Exeter with a majority of 11,705. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 4 July 1997. He was the second British MP who was openly gay at the time of first election, 21 minutes after Stephen Twigg.

In the Commons, Bradshaw introduced the Pesticides Act in 1998, which gave more powers to inspectors. He became a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State at the Department of Health John Denham in 2000.

===Initial ministerial posts===
Following the 2001 general election Bradshaw entered Tony Blair&#x27;s government as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Only days after being appointed to the Foreign Office, he had to answer questions following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. On 6 March 2002, while answering Parliamentary Questions, Bradshaw accused George Galloway of &quot;being not just an apologist but a mouthpiece for the Iraqi regime over many years&quot;. Galloway responded by accusing Bradshaw of being a liar, though after a suspension of the Commons sitting, both men withdrew their comments.

Bradshaw became the Deputy to the Leader of the House of Commons Robin Cook in 2002, and was an Under Secretary of State at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2003 until 2006, when he was made a Minister of State at the same department. During this period, he was sent to Brussels to negotiate changes to the Common Fisheries Policy on behalf of the British in-shore fishing fleet.

In 2003, Bradshaw supported the government&#x27;s stance on Iraq and voted for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In 2005, Bradshaw supported the detention of terror suspects without trial and voted for the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.

===Health minister===

On 28 June 2007, he was moved to become a Minister of State in the Department of Health and, in addition, was given the Minister for the South West portfolio.

Bradshaw was the subject of controversy while Minister for Health. His responses to questioning on Radio 4 about the shortfall in NHS dentistry leading to patients being unable to access NHS dentists and even resorting to treating themselves was to claim that those needing urgent treatment should go to see their GP, which prompted the British Medical Association to observe that a general practitioner was no substitute for a qualified dentist.

Bradshaw also claimed that GPs were operating &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreements&quot; to ensure patients didn&#x27;t move between surgeries, claims dismissed as &quot;absolute nonsense&quot; by doctors&#x27; leaders.

On the subject of the National Programme for IT, a scheme dogged by cost overruns, delays, and doubts over its benefit to patients, he commented: &quot;Our use of computer technology in the NHS is becoming the envy of the world. It is saving lives, saving time and saving money. If you talk to health and IT experts anywhere in the world they point to Britain as example of computer technology being used successfully to improve health services to the public.&quot;

He was also criticised for defending car parking fees at NHS hospitals at a time when Wales was removing parking fees. The BMA called such charges &quot;a tax on the sick&quot;, and questioned the legitimacy of trusts making up to £248,000 a month in parking fees. Bradshaw&#x27;s claims that such charges were necessary to pay for patient care were dismissed by a shadow health spokesman, who commented that it did &quot;not add up&quot; for the government to make such claims in the light of an NHS surplus of £1.8bn.

His plan to introduce private management of some NHS trusts was also heavily criticised. The BMA called it a step towards privatising the NHS. Dr. Jonathan Fielden observed that there was no evidence private management was better than public sector management. Professor Allyson Pollock, head of the Centre for International Public Health Policy at the University of Edinburgh, said: &quot;Bringing private management in will simply accelerate the process of privatisation of services which will have catastrophic effects for the patients and the public at large. It will mean less care for everyone, and more money for profits and shareholders&quot;. Nigel Edwards, of the NHS Confederation, said the government had tried drafting in private sector management before, at the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield in 2003, which was not successful. He commented: &quot;What it revealed is that the reason that hospitals tend to fail is often much more complicated and much more difficult than just poor management&quot;.

===Expenses and period as Culture Secretary===
It was claimed in May 2009 that he exploited the MPs&#x27; expenses system by claiming the entire interest bill on a property he shares with his partner in west London. Bradshaw has said claims made about his expenses were factually wrong.

On 5 June 2009 he was appointed Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. He held this position until the 2010 general election and served as Shadow Culture Secretary until the 2010 Labour Party Shadow Cabinet election.

===In opposition===
On 7 October 2010 the Labour Party announced that he had failed to be elected to one of the 19 available places in the first Shadow cabinet of new leader Ed Miliband. In 2011, Bradshaw voted for the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. On 5 February 2013, he voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.

Following Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 2015 general election, and the resignation of both Miliband and deputy leader Harriet Harman, Bradshaw announced his intention on 15 May to stand in the Labour Party deputy leadership election. He later gained the minimum 35 nominations required to stand in the ballot with the other candidates. Bradshaw came last in the election.

Bradshaw is a former critic of Jeremy Corbyn, whom he accused in a September 2016 article of being a &quot;destructive combination of incompetence, deceit and menace&quot;. This comment was after Bradshaw was included on an internal Labour list of MPs, issued by mistake, who were implicated in &quot;abusing&quot; Corbyn and his supporters. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election. However, Bradshaw later changed his position on Jeremy Corbyn, praising his 2017 election performance.

In November 2016, Bradshaw opposed a motion in Parliament for the UK to withdraw support for the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen. George Galloway accused Bradshaw of supporting Saudi Arabia&#x27;s regime where men like Bradshaw &quot;are beheaded.&quot;

Bradshaw claimed during a Commons debate in December 2016 that it is &quot;highly probable&quot; that the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum was manipulated by Vladimir Putin. Bradshaw saw this as fitting a pattern of interfering in the business of other nations after the CIA accused Russian hackers of trying to influence US elections. Bradshaw also maintains that the Russians sent him an e-mail with sophisticated malware and maintains this was a cyberattack. Bradshaw said, &quot;The email came to my gmail account, which is more vulnerable than my parliamentary one. What the sender was claiming was potentially extremely useful and political dynamite. It was drafted in a clever way to make it tempting to open.&quot; Bradshaw added, &quot;I was the first MP to raise Russia&#x27;s role in the Brexit vote in 2016. Ever since I have been asking questions about the Kremlin&#x27;s subversion of our democracy.&quot;

On 3 February 2022, Bradshaw announced he would not be standing in the 2024 general election.

===Other activities===
In 2009, Ben Bradshaw won the Stonewall Politician of the Year Award in 2009 for his work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. He was given a score of 100% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall. Bradshaw was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council in 2009, giving him the right to the honorific prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.

In 2013, Bradshaw is a member of the Henry Jackson Society Advisory Council. In 2024, he was a member of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East.

==Personal life==
On 24 June 2006, Bradshaw and his partner Neal Dalgleish, who is a BBC producer, registered a civil partnership. He was one of the first MPs to do so, and he was the first Cabinet Minister to be in a civil partnership. Bradshaw has asked the Church of England to clarify whether a member of the Church of England clergy who married a same sex partner would be disciplined or defrocked.

Bradshaw&#x27;s brother is Jonathan Bradshaw, professor emeritus of social policy at the University of York.

Bradshaw was knighted in the 2023 Birthday Honours for political and public service.

<text>The Letterist International (LI) was a Paris-based collective of radical artists and cultural theorists between 1952 and 1957. It was created by Guy Debord and Gil J. Wolman rejoined by Jean-Louis Brau and Serge Berna as a from Isidore Isou&#x27;s Lettrist group. The group went on to join others in forming the Situationist International, taking some key techniques and ideas with it.

&#x27;Letterist&#x27; (&quot;lettriste&quot;) was the form the group themselves used, as in their 1955 sticker: &#x27;If you believe you have genius, or if you think you have only a brilliant intelligence, write the letterist internationale.&#x27; Though the spelling &#x27;Lettrist&#x27; is also common in English, authors and translators such as Donald Nicholson-Smith, Simon Ford, Sadie Plant and Andrew Hussey use the &#x27;Letterist International&#x27; spelling.

The group was a motley assortment of novelists, sound poets, painters, film-makers, revolutionaries, bohemians, alcoholics, petty criminals, lunatics, under-age girls and self-proclaimed failures. In the Summer of 1953, their average age was a mere twenty years, rising to twenty nine and a half in 1957. In their blend of intellectualism, protest and hedonism—though differing in other ways, for instance in their total rejection of spirituality—they might be viewed as French counterparts of the American Beat Generation, particularly in the form it took during exactly the same period, i.e., before anyone from either group achieved notoriety, and were still having the adventures that would inform their later works and ideas.

==History and theory==
The LI was the first breakaway faction from Isidore Isou&#x27;s Letterists. (They would be followed in turn by the Ultra-Letterists). The schism developed when the &#x27;left-wing&#x27; of the Letterist group disrupted a Charlie Chaplin press conference for &quot;Limelight&quot; at the Hôtel Ritz Paris in October 1952. They distributed a polemic entitled &quot;No More Flat Feet&quot;, which concluded: &quot;The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin.&quot; Isou was keen to distance himself from his younger acolytes&#x27; tract. His own attitude was that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that he was no longer relevant, and they turned Isou&#x27;s own words back against him: &quot;We appreciated the importance of Chaplin&#x27;s work &quot;in its own time&quot;, but we know that today novelty lies elsewhere, and &#x27;truths which no longer entertain become lies&#x27; (Isou).&quot; As they proceeded to explain, &quot;the most urgent exercise of liberty is the destruction of idols&quot;.

Although the LI had in fact already been covertly formed by Guy Debord and Gil J. Wolman in June 1952, even before the Chaplin intervention and the public split from Isou, it was not formally established until 7 December 1952. The four signatories of the Chaplin tract (Debord and Wolman, together with Jean-Louis Brau and Serge Berna) agreed on a constitution for the group during a visit to Aubervilliers (where Brau&#x27;s father lived). Anyone collaborating with &#x27;Isouian activities&#x27;, they declared, would be automatically excluded, even if this was being done in defence of the LI. &#x27;It is in the transcendence of arts that everything has yet to be done.&#x27; The official base of the group was at 32, Rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviéve, Paris, subsequently to become the official base of the Situationist International (but invariably referred to by both groups as &quot;Rue de la Montagne-Geneviéve&quot;, signalling their disdain for religion). This was in fact the address of a bar, Tonneau d&#x27;Or, and indeed most of their time was spent either drinking in a number of bars in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, principally at Chez Moineau on the Rue du Four, or else simply walking the streets.

There was a serious purpose behind their ambulation. They developed the dérive, or drift, where they would wander like clouds through the urban environment for hours or sometimes even days on end. During their wanderings in the Summer of 1953, an &quot;illiterate Kabyle&quot; suggested to them the term &quot;Psychogeography&quot;, to designate what they saw as a pattern of emotive force-fields that would permeate a city. The dérive would enable them to map out these forces, and these results could then be used as a basis upon which to build a system of unitary urbanism. Among their most important texts on these matters were Debord&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Dérive&quot; (published in the Belgian surrealist magazine &quot;Les Lèvres Nues&quot;, no. 9, November 1956), and Ivan Chtcheglov&#x27;s &quot;Formulary for a New Urbanism&quot; (written October 1953, but not published until June 1958 in the first issue of the journal &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot;). In the latter, Chtcheglov advocated a new city where, as he wrote, &quot;each person will live in his own personal &#x27;cathedral&#x27;. There will be rooms that produce dreams better than drugs, and houses where it will be impossible to do anything but love.&quot; He declared, &quot;The Hacienda must be built&quot;, a remark which would later inspire the name of the famous Manchester night-club. In &quot;Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography&quot; (&quot;Les Lèvres Nues&quot;, no. 6, September 1955), Debord described a colleague&#x27;s drift through the Harz region of Germany, blindly following a map of London. This is still a favourite methodology amongst psychogeographers. They produced a broad range of proposals: the abolition of museums and the placing of art in bars, keeping the Metro open all night, opening the roofs of Paris like pavements with escalators to help gain access.

Another important notion developed by the LI, was that of détournement, a technique of reutilising plagiarised material (literary, artistic, cinematic, etc.) for a new and usually radical purpose. The defining LI text here was the 1956 &quot;A User&#x27;s Guide to Détournement&quot;, by Debord and Wolman, from &quot;Les Lèvres Nues&quot; no. 8. They argued: &quot;In truth, it is necessary to do away with the whole notion of personal property in this area. The emergence of new demands renders earlier &#x27;great works&#x27; obsolete. They become obstacles, bad habits. It is not a question of whether we like them or not. We must pass them by.&quot; These techniques were subsequently used extensively by the Situationists. In addition, such characteristically situationist concepts as the construction of situations and the supersession of art were first developed by the LI.

In addition to the central Parisian group, an Algerian section of the LI was established in April 1953 by Hadj Mohamed Dahou, Cheik Ben Dhine and Ait Diafer. Based at Orléansville (&#x27;the most letterist city in the world&#x27; according to &quot;Potlatch&quot; no. 12), they were hit hard by an earthquake there on 9 September 1954, although initial reports that most of them had been killed turned out to be unfounded (&quot;Potlatch&quot; no. 13). A Swiss section was also established in late 1954, but were almost immediately excluded (&quot;Potlatch&quot; no. 15).

In September 1956, Wolman represented the LI at the World Congress of Artists in Alba, Italy. This conference had been organised by Asger Jorn and Pinot-Gallizio of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus (IMIB), and important links between the two groups were consolidated. Wolman himself was excluded from the LI shortly afterwards, but the remaining members, Debord and Michèle Bernstein, subsequently visited Cosio d&#x27;Arroscia where, on 28 July 1957, the LI officially fused with the IMIB and the London Psychogeographical Association to form the Situationist International.

==Adventures==
Besides the Charlie Chaplin protest, some of the more noteworthy/startling activities of the LI include:

* Ivan Chtcheglov&#x27;s plan to blow up the Eiffel Tower, on no other grounds than that its lights were shining through his bedroom window and keeping him awake at night.
* Debord&#x27;s legendary 1953 graffito, &quot;Ne travaillez jamais!&quot; (&quot;Never work!&quot;), inscribed on a wall at the corner of the Rue de Mazarine and Rue de Seine. The slogan would later reappear in May 1968, and summed up the ethos of both the LI and the Situationist International after them.

Although pre-dating the formation of the LI (but directly involving Serge Berna, and inspiring the others), one might also mention:

* A 1950 letterist attempt at the &quot;liberation&quot; of a Catholic orphanage at Auteuil, causing a small-scale riot in protest at how &quot;youth suffers in slavery, or is super-exploited by the seniority system.&quot;
* The Notre-Dame Affair of Easter Sunday, 1950, where Michel Mourre, dressed in a Dominican&#x27;s habit, took to the pulpit and began to address the congregation, informing them, before anyone realised that anything was amiss, that God was dead, and that the Catholic Church was &quot;appropriating our life force in the name of an empty heaven&quot;, and &quot;infecting the world with its morality of death&quot;.

An extract from a letter of Gil Wolman to Jean-Louis Brau, of 20 July 1953, gives a clear impression of what the group and their associates tended to get up to from day to day:

I am back! ... Where were things when you left? Joël [Berlé] has been out for a long time, on probation. Jean-Michel [Mension] and Fred [Auguste Hommel] are now free, too (for stealing from parked cars—and under the influence, naturally). Little Eliane [Papaï] got out of police custody last week after a dramatic arrest in a maid&#x27;s room somewhere in Vincennes with Joël and Jean-Michel; they were drunk, needless to say, and refused to open up to the police, who left and came back with reinforcements. In the confusion they lost the seal of the Letterist International. Linda [Fried] not sentenced yet. Sarah [Abouaf] still in the reformatory—but her sister, sixteen and a half, has taken her place. There have been other arrests, for narcotics, for who knows what else. It&#x27;s getting very tiresome. There is G[uy]-E[rnest Debord], who has just spent ten days in a nursing home where his parents sent him following a failed attempt to gas himself. He&#x27;s back in the neighbourhood now. Serge [Berna?] is due out on 12 May. The day before yesterday I threw up royally outside Moineau&#x27;s. The latest diversion in the neighbourhood is spending the night in the Catacombs—another of Joël&#x27;s bright ideas. I have a good many projects which are liable to remain just that—projects. ...

Decades later, Debord would nostalgically (though also somewhat ambiguously) sum up the spirit of the times in his &quot;Panegyric&quot; (1989): &quot;Between the rue du Four and the rue de Buci, where our youth so completely went astray as a few glasses were drunk, one could feel certain that we would never do any better.&quot;

==Membership==
* Guy Debord (1931–1994) (generally using the name &#x27;Guy-Ernest&#x27; during this period).
* Gil J. Wolman (1929–1995). Excluded 1957.
* Michèle Bernstein (1932–). Joined 1954.
* Alexander Trocchi (1925–1984). Joined 1955.
* Hadj Mohamed Dahou (1926-2010) (aka Midhou or just Mohamed Dahou) Joined 1953.
* Ivan Chtcheglov (1933–1998) (known as &quot;Gilles Ivain&quot;). quit 1954.
* Serge Berna (1925?–?). Excluded 1953.
* Patrick Straram (1934–88). Joined 1953, quit 1954.
* Jean-Michel Mension. (1934–2006). Excluded 1954.
* Jean-Louis Brau (1930–1985) (known as &quot;Bull Dog Brau&quot;). Excluded 1953.

Several others also passed through the LI during its five years of existence, including André-Frank Conord, Jacques Fillon, Abdelhafid Khatib, Henry de Béarn and Gaëtan M. Langlais. In addition, the central members (almost all of them men), would sometimes include their girlfriends&#x27; names (usually first names only) among the signatories to their texts. Worthy of special mention among these girlfriends is Eliane Papaï (1935–?). An alumna of the same Auteuil orphanage the letterists had attempted to liberate, she was first the girlfriend of Debord, then the wife of Mension, and finally the wife of Brau. Debord recalled her fondly in many of his later films and writings, and she herself (as Eliane Brau) produced a book on the Situationists in 1968, &quot;Le situationnisme ou la nouvelle internationale&quot;.

Jean-Louis Brau, Gil Wolman and François Dufrêne founded a Second Letterist International (&quot;D.I.L.&quot;, &quot;Deuxième Internationale Lettriste&quot;) in 1964. The New Lettrist International was founded more recently and is independent of (though inspired by) the earlier group.

==Publications==
The LI published four issues of the &quot;Internationale Lettriste&quot; bulletin between 1952 and 1954, followed by twenty eight issues of &quot;Potlatch&quot; from 1954 to 1957. A further two issues of &quot;Potlatch&quot; appeared in November 1957 and July 1959, now with the revised subtitle &quot;Information bulletin of the Situationist International&quot;. Each issue comprised between one and four mimeographed sheets. &quot;Les Lèvres Nues&quot;, though not an LI publication, published some of their most important articles. All of these texts, together with a few other miscellaneous tracts, are reprinted in &quot;Documents Relatifs A La Fondation De L&#x27;Internationale Situationniste&quot; (Editions Allia, 1985).

Debord&#x27;s 1959 collaboration with Asger Jorn, &quot;Mémoires&quot;, was directly concerned with the early days of the LI. The new Gallimard edition of his &quot;Oeuvres&quot; gathers many LI texts, including some never before published. Michèle Bernstein&#x27;s novels, &quot;Tous les chevaux du roi&quot; (1960) and &quot;La Nuit&quot; (1961), present fictionalised accounts of her life with Debord during this period. Patrick Straram&#x27;s &quot;Les bouteilles se couchent&quot; was a semi-fictionalised contemporary account of the scene, written in 1953 but lost until recently: it was published by Editions Allia in 2006. Also recently published by the same house are a biography of Ivan Chtcheglov and a separate collection of his writings. In October 2010, an unpublished text from the LI has just been released that recalls the adventures of the letterists between 1945 and February 1953 : &quot;Visages de l&#x27;avant-garde&quot; (Paris: Jean-Paul Rocher, éditeur, 2010).

<text>ITV Westcountry, formerly known as Westcountry Television and Carlton Westcountry, was the ITV franchise holder for the South West of England, covering Cornwall, Devon, Isles of Scilly, southern and western Somerset and western Dorset. The company replaced its predecessor, TSW (Television South West), from 1 January 1993. The station was owned and operated by ITV plc under the licensee of &quot;ITV Broadcasting Limited&quot; (formerly &quot;Westcountry Television Limited&quot;).

ITV West Country incorporating the former ITV Westcountry (&quot;West&quot;) and ITV West (&quot;East&quot;) regions was (until 31 December 2013) a non-franchise ITV regional station covering South West England. With the formal split of the Wales and West Channel 3 licence in January 2014, a separate licence was created for Wales with the West licence merged with that of West Country. ITV West Country thus became a franchise region. Both companies which make up the new regional licence still legally exist. ITV Wales &amp; West Ltd, ITV Wales &amp; West Group Ltd and Westcountry Television Ltd are each, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed on www.companieshouse.gov.uk as a &quot;Dormant company&quot;. This article however, covers the Westcountry Television part of the franchise.

== History ==
===Franchise award===
Westcountry Television was one of two rival consortia bidding against the incumbent TSW when the ITV franchises were put to tender early in 1991. Two of Westcountry&#x27;s original shareholders were Brittany Ferries and South West Water; the latter investor attracted criticism as only three years earlier it had been responsible for one of the worst water pollution incidents in the United Kingdom and which had occurred within the franchise area at Camelford. On 16 October 1991, Westcountry was announced as the winner, bidding £7 million a year against TSW&#x27;s bid of £16 million a year. Several local MPs were concerned that South West Water&#x27;s involvement would lead to partiality in news items concerning the local water firm.

TSW launched a legal challenge to the franchise award, and after initially being refused permission to do so in the High Court, a legal action began which would last almost three months and went all the way to the House of Lords. In February 1992 the legal process found in favour of Westcountry and while it could now finally sign the franchise agreement, its original programme plans were hit by the delay. Following discussions with the Independent Television Commission, Westcountry announced on 1 April 1992 it had abandoned the plans to build new studios on the Plymouth waterfront, opting instead to convert an industrial unit at Langage Science Park, Plymouth. It also reduced its planned staffing levels – already far fewer than those of TSW – leading to an expression of disappointment by TSW&#x27;s managing director Harry Turner. Of the 297 TSW employees, only 16 found work at Westcountry at the start of the franchise. Around 112 staff were employed by Westcountry at the time of the station&#x27;s launch.

===Launch===
Westcountry Television took over from TSW at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) 1993 after ITN&#x27;s &quot;Into The New Year&quot; bulletin featuring the Westminster clock tower chimes.

Technicians switched from the TSW microwave link to Westcountry Television, launching into a two-minute trail voiced by Bruce Hammal and Trish Bertram welcoming viewers to Westcountry, proudly announcing its forthcoming regional programmes. The promo was followed by the Eddie Murphy and Dudley Moore film &quot;Best Defense&quot;. The new station promised an increase to 11 hours a week of regional programming of mixed genres.

Six months after the launch, the company joined up with Meridian Broadcasting, HTV, Channel Television and S4C to create a joint advertising sales operation.

During the summer of 1996, Westcountry prepared to float the company on the stock market, which resulted in HTV, United News &amp; Media, Carlton Communications and Canwest bidding to buy out Westcountry. In October 1996 GWR, the radio group, made a bid of £70m for Westcountry TV, outbidding both HTV and Carlton, but within a few weeks United News &amp; Media increased its offer and was expected to acquire the company, But Westcountry owners had become increasingly frustrated at the slow progress of talks and criticised United boss Lord Hollick&#x27;s &quot;nickel and dime&quot; tactics over negotiations, opting instead to sell to Carlton Communications for £10m higher than United&#x27;s offer of around £75m, around 25 November 1996. Hollick was described as &quot;disappointed but far from livid&quot; at the outcome. Subsequently, Westcountry was re-branded as Carlton Westcountry on 6 September 1999, although only referred on screen as &quot;Carlton&quot;. On 27 October 2002, Carlton Westcountry lost its regional identity, and became known as &quot;ITV1 Carlton&quot; prior to regional programmes only, while being known as ITV1 at all other times. The franchise briefly became &quot;ITV1 for the Westcountry&quot; in 2003, before being renamed onscreen as &quot;ITV1 Westcountry&quot; upon the ITV plc merger of 2004, and officially taking this name two years later. &quot;ITV1 Westcountry&quot; was used for a time after this, although from 13 November 2006, the regional name was only verbally mentioned before any locally produced programming.

===ITV West Country===
Following a speech by Michael Grade about regional broadcasting post-switchover at the 2007 Nations and Regions conference in Cardiff, there was speculation that ITV West and ITV Westcountry could merge news operations, as part of further streamlining of regional operations. Rumours suggested that, while a newsroom (and separate regional identity) would be retained in the south west, the main &quot;Westcountry Live&quot; programme would move to a studio alongside &quot;The West Tonight&quot; at ITV West in Bristol (akin to the Meridian and Thames Valley news services at Whiteley). On 12 September 2007, ITV issued a statement to the City of London, saying that it wished to reduce the number of news studios from 17 to just nine. This included merging ITV West with ITV Westcountry to form a non-franchise region, ITV West and Westcountry, from February 2009.

Shortly after the broadcasting regulator OFCOM gave final approval to the changes, the regional news service was phased out with the final broadcast from Plymouth aired on Sunday 15 February 2009. A new programme entitled &quot;The West Country Tonight&quot; replaced the &quot;Westcountry Live&quot; on Monday 16 February 2009 but included separate opt-out news bulletins (some of which were pre-recorded depending on the day&#x27;s news) and weather forecasts for the Westcountry region during the main 6pm programme and in the weekday late bulletin after &quot;News at Ten&quot;. Separate daytime bulletins for the region were reintroduced in September 2011.

On 14 January 2013, the region became known as ITV West Country. In September 2013, the south west opt-out within the main 6pm news programme &quot;ITV News West Country&quot; was extended to at least 20 minutes. Separate weekend bulletins were also reintroduced, effectively restoring a full regional news service for the former Westcountry region.

==Studios==
Westcountry was originally based at Brittany Ferries&#x27; offices in Millbay Docks, Plymouth with a view to constructing a purpose-built studio centre on the Plymouth waterfront. However, following the delay caused by TSW&#x27;s legal proceedings, these plans were scrapped. The company opted instead to convert an industrial unit at Langage Science Park in Plympton, which was backed up by a network of seven local newsrooms and studios in Torbay, Penzance, Truro, Exeter, Barnstaple, Weymouth and Taunton.

Although Westcountry&#x27;s headquarters were in Plymouth, transmission for the channel was outsourced and run by HTV Wales staff at HTV&#x27;s presentation centre in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff with continuity announcers based at the Plymouth studios. This arrangement lasted from the first day of broadcasting until shortly after regional continuity was abandoned in October 2002.

Following the merger to form ITV West Country, most of Westcountry&#x27;s operations were transferred to HTV&#x27;s West headquarters in Bristol, where production of the regional news service is now based. The only operation left in Plymouth is a newsroom and sales office, alongside two newsrooms in Truro and Exeter.

==Sub-regions==
Up until early 2009, Westcountry ran four sub-regional services, each providing short opt-out bulletins for their area during the flagship news programme &quot;Westcountry Live&quot; and the late bulletin after &quot;News at Ten&quot;. The opt-outs were broadcast from Westcountry&#x27;s studios in Barnstaple (covering north Devon), Exeter (serving east Devon and parts of Somerset), Plymouth (south Devon &amp; parts of east Cornwall) and Truro (Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly). Westcountry was the first and only ITV company to produce four opt-outs for its region.

==Identity==
Between 1 January 1993 and 5 September 1999, Westcountry&#x27;s presentation featured that of a large &#x27;W&#x27; shape on a frosted screen over a background video of a nature scene. The idents were made so that the scene could only be seen clearly through the &#x27;W&#x27; shape. Accompanying the video was a five-note jingle featuring string and flute instruments. This presentational package lasted throughout the whole period, with the only change on 8 September 1997 that of a form-up added made out of diagonal lines.

From 6 September 1999 however, the look changed drastically, as the Carlton &#x27;Star&#x27; ident package was launched on the network. The look, featuring a start up film involving hearts would flash out to reveal the Carlton name over a spinning star background. The Westcountry name was only used on the news programme &quot;Westcountry Live&quot;. This package lasted until 28 October 2002, when regional continuity was lost.

In its place, a national ITV1 branding package, with local idents featuring the ITV1 logo on the left hand side of the screen with Carlton logo below. This remained until late 2003, when the Carlton name was removed from regional idents, which instead featured four colour cubes randomly located in a scene from the region. The ITV1 logo was located in the bottom right corner with the caption &quot;ITV1 for the Westcountry&quot; located beneath. Following the 2004 ITV rebranding, the new local ident featured the national ident of three cubes containing the letters &#x27;ITV&#x27; above a large cube &#x27;1&#x27;, with the addition of the region name below. A few blunders occurred however. To begin with, Westcountry&#x27;s local ident had the word &quot;West&quot; beneath which was later replaced as &quot;West Country&quot;. The ident was finally amended to show the right name at approximately the same time that regional idents were abandoned. In 2006 and 2009, the Westcountry brand completely disappeared from continuity and the news service respectively. The station would now be known on-air as just ITV1 at all times.

On 14 January 2013, the station&#x27;s on-air identity was changed to ITV, along with all other ITV plc-owned franchises.

==Programmes==
Westcountry&#x27;s programme offerings were primarily aimed at a regional market as opposed to gaining network slots. Westcountry&#x27;s flagship programme was the regional news magazine &quot;Westcountry Live&quot;, which ran between Westcountry&#x27;s launch in 1993 until the merger in 2009. Other regional programmes included:

*&quot;Bendell at Bedtime&quot; – Topical debate (2004)
*&quot;Birthday People&quot; – Birthday slot for children (1993–2005)
*&quot;Blooming Marvelous&quot; – (1994–96)
*&quot;Brief Encounters&quot; – Feature series about unusual pastimes (1993–94)
*&quot;Energize!&quot; – A Saturday Children&#x27;s magazine programme (1996–2000)
*&quot;Little River Journeys&quot; – A look at the Westcountry region&#x27;s waterways, later aired by Channel 4 (1995)
*&quot;On the Road to the Islands&quot; – Jack Pizzey&#x27;s tour of islands in the south west, later aired by Channel 4 (1993)
*&quot;Richard Digance: For One Night Only&quot; – Local entertainment series (1997–98)
*&quot;Special Report&quot; – current affairs programme
*&quot;The L.A.D.S.&quot; – A rare partly network commission, A magazine programme for men. (1996)
*&quot;Ruth Meets The Entertainers&quot; – (1995) 
*&quot;The West At Work&quot; – (1993–96)
*&quot;Westcountry Focus&quot; – Westcountry&#x27;s first regular current affairs series
*&quot;Westcountry Life&quot; – Short 30-second films reflecting aspects of life in the region (1993–96)
*&quot;Westcountry Soccer Night&quot; – Local football magazine show (2004–08)
*&quot;Westcountry Update&quot; – Weekly news review for the deaf and hard of hearing (1993–2004)
*&quot;West Wise&quot; – Short-lived inter-town quiz, one of Westcountry&#x27;s first local programmes (1993)

In its annual reports, the Independent Television Commission (ITC) commented on Westcountry&#x27;s programming and performance; in 1995 it said that Westcountry had a &quot;good news service and regional programming&quot;, despite a difficult first year. Two years later in 1997 the ITC again noted its &quot;strong, high quality regional programming&quot; and that it had &quot;scored a major network success with &quot;Christmas with the Royal Navy&quot;, a series of five live programmes&quot;. In 1999 the ITC again commented that Westcountry provided a &quot;regional service of generally high quality&quot; and that overall its range of regional programmes was &quot;wide and included some strong factual material&quot;, also noting that one of its children&#x27;s programmes had been supplied to the network.

<text>Carlos Guastavino (5 April 1912 – 29 October 2000) was an Argentine composer, considered one of the foremost composers of his country. His production amounted to over 500 works, most of them songs for piano and voice, many still unpublished. His style was quite conservative, always tonal and lushly romantic. His compositions were clearly influenced by Argentine folk music. His reputation was based almost entirely on his songs, and Guastavino has sometimes been called &quot;the Schubert of the Pampas&quot;. Some of his songs, for example &quot;Pueblito, mi pueblo&quot;, &quot;La rosa y el sauce&quot; (&quot;The Rose and the Willow&quot;) and &quot;Se equivocó la paloma&quot; (&quot;The Dove Was Mistaken&quot;), became national favorites. Unlike most other composers, at any time or place, Guastavino earned enough from his royalties and performing rights that he had little need for other income.&lt;ref name=&quot;BkltNI5818/20&quot;&gt;MacDonald, Callum. Essay in booklet with the recording &quot;Carlos Guastavino: The Complete Piano Music&quot;, Martin Jones, piano. Nimbus, NI 5818/20 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous performers, such as Teresa Berganza, Martha Argerich, Gidon Kremer, José Carreras, Kiri Te Kanawa, Patricia Caicedo, Bernarda Fink, Cecilia Pillado, María Isabel Siewers, Jorge Chaminé, Agathe Martel, Karina Gauvin,Julie Nesrallah and José Cura have included works of Guastavino on their programs or recordings.

==Life==
Carlos Guastavino was born in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. He studied music in Santa Fe with Esperanza Lothringer and Dominga Iaffei, and in Buenos Aires with Athos Palma. A talented pianist, he performed his piano works in London in 1947, 1948, and 1949, invited by the BBC, and as a recipient of a scholarship from the British Council. During these years, the BBC Symphony Orchestra premiered the orchestral version of his &quot;Tres Romances Argentinos&quot;, under the baton of Walter Goehr. Later, in 1956, Guastavino toured the USSR and China, performing his pieces for voice and piano.

==Compositional style==
Guastavino&#x27;s musical style marked a stark contrast with the works of his 20th-century Argentine contemporaries such as Alberto Ginastera and reveals the influence of European composers such as Albéniz, Granados, Rachmaninoff, Chabrier, Falla, Debussy, and Ravel, but also is clearly inherited from the luminaries of 19th-century Argentine nationalist composers, such as Alberto Williams, Ernesto Drangosch, Francisco Hargreaves, Eduardo García Mansilla and Julián Aguirre. Aguirre&#x27;s delicate and intimate piano writing is an especially evident influence on Guastavino. Guastavino&#x27;s stylistic isolation from the modernist and avant-garde movements going on around him, and the self-consciously nationalist content of his songs made him a model for Argentine popular and folk musicians in the 1960s.

Guastavino published more than 150 songs for voice and piano, numerous piano solo pieces, choral works, school songs, and chamber music. The poets whose works he set to music included Rafael Alberti, Leon Benarós, Hamlet Lima Quintana, Atahualpa Yupanqui, Pablo Neruda, Gabriela Mistral, and Jorge Luis Borges. A small number of his songs are settings of his own texts. His works for orchestra included &quot;Divertissement; fue una vez&quot;, commissioned by Colonel W. de Basil for his original Ballet Russe and premiered at the Teatro Colón, in Buenos Aires, in 1942; and &quot;Suite Argentina&quot; which was performed in London, Paris, Barcelona, and Havana by the Ballet Español of Isabel Lopez. He also wrote three Sonatas for guitar.

==Awards==
Guastavino received important awards and recognition, such as the Municipal Prize from the city of Buenos Aires for his chamber songs, a prize from the Justice Ministry of Argentina, Prize of the Cultural Commission of Santa Fe Province for his songs, &quot;Vosotras&quot; magazine Prize for his &quot;Canción de Navidad&quot;, and a Prize from the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Music Council as recognition of his outstanding creative activity.

<text>Helmut Friedrich Lachenmann (; born 27 November 1935) is a German composer of contemporary classical music. Associated with the &quot;instrumental musique concrète&quot; style, Lachenmann is alongside Wolfgang Rihm as among the leading German composers of his time.

== Life and works ==
Lachenmann was born in Stuttgart and after the end of the Second World War (when he was 11) started singing in his local church choir. Showing an early aptitude for music, he was already composing in his teens. He studied piano with Jürgen Uhde and composition and theory with Johann Nepomuk David at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart from 1955 to 1958 and was the first private student of the Italian composer Luigi Nono in Venice from 1958 to 1960. He also worked briefly at the electronic music studio at the University of Ghent in 1965, composing his only published tape piece &quot;Szenario&quot; during that period but thereafter focused almost exclusively on purely instrumental music. The brutality of his music led Francisco Estévez to compare his work to the paintings of Francis Bacon.

Lachenmann has referred to his compositions as &quot;musique concrète instrumentale&quot;, implying a musical language that embraces the entire sound-world made accessible through unconventional playing techniques. According to the composer, this is music

His music is therefore primarily derived from the most basic of sounds, which through processes of amplification serve as the basis for extended works. His scores place enormous demands on performers, due to the plethora of techniques that he has invented for wind, brass and string instruments.

His more important works include his opera &quot;Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern&quot; [&quot;The Little Match Girl&quot;] (1990–96, after Hans Christian Andersen, Leonardo da Vinci and Gudrun Ensslin), the orchestral pieces &quot;Schwankungen am Rand&quot; (1974–75, for eight brass, two electric guitars, two pianos, four thunder sheets, and 34 strings), &quot;Accanto&quot; (1975–76, for clarinet, large orchestra and tape), and &quot;NUN&quot; (1997–99, for flute, trombone, male chorus, and large orchestra), the ensemble works &quot;Mouvement (- vor der Erstarrung)&quot; (1982–84, for three ad hoc players and 14 players), and &quot;&quot;...zwei Gefühle...&quot;, Musik mit Leonardo&quot; (1992 [later incorporated in opera &quot;Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern&quot;], after Leonardo da Vinci, for two speakers and 22 players), and three string quartets (&quot;Gran Torso&quot;, 1971, revised 1976, 1988; &quot;Reigen seliger Geister&quot;, 1989; &quot;Grido&quot;, 2001), as well as other orchestral, ensemble and chamber works and six piano pieces.

He has regularly lectured at the Darmstadt New Music Summer School since 1978. From 1976 to 1981, he taught music theory, ear training and composition at the Musikhochschule Hannover, and from 1981 to 1999, he taught composition at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart. 

He is also noted for his articles, essays and lectures, many of which appear in &quot;Musik als existentielle Erfahrung&quot; (&quot;Music as Existential Experience&quot;) (Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, Wiesbaden, 1996).

Lachenmann has received many distinguished awards such as the Bach Prize of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg in 1972, the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1997, and the 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Contemporary Music Category.

He is married to Japanese pianist Yukiko Sugawara.

<text>Sterling silver is an alloy composed by weight of 92.5% silver and 7.5% other metals, usually copper. The sterling silver standard has a minimum millesimal fineness of 925.

&quot;Fine silver&quot;, which is 99.9% pure silver, is relatively soft, so silver is usually alloyed with copper to increase its hardness and strength. Sterling silver is prone to tarnishing, and elements other than copper can be used in alloys to reduce tarnishing, as well as casting porosity and firescale. Such elements include germanium, zinc, platinum, silicon, and boron. Recent examples of these alloys include &quot;argentium&quot;, &quot;sterlium&quot; and &quot;silvadium&quot;.

==Etymology==
One of the earliest attestations of the term is in Old French form , in a charter of the abbey of Les Préaux, dating to either 1085 or 1104. The English chronicler Orderic Vitalis (1075 – 1142) uses the Latin forms and . The word in origin refers to the newly introduced Norman silver penny.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the most plausible etymology is a derivation from a late Old English (with, or like, a &#x27;little star&#x27;), as some early Norman pennies were imprinted with a small star.

Another argument is that the Hanseatic League was the source for both the origin of its definition and manufacture, and in its name is that the German name for the Baltic is , or &#x27;East Sea&#x27;, and from this the Baltic merchants were called &quot;Osterlings&quot;, or &quot;Easterlings&quot;. In 1260, Henry III granted them a charter of protection. Because the League&#x27;s money was not frequently debased like that of England, English traders stipulated to be paid in pounds of the Easterlings, which was contracted to &quot;sterling&quot;.

Their Kontor, the Steelyard of London, was called Easterlings Hall, or . The Hanseatic League was officially active in the London trade from 1266 to 1597. This etymology may have been first suggested by Walter de Pinchebek () with the explanation that the coin was originally made by moneyers from that region.

The claim has been made in Henry Spelman&#x27;s glossary () as referenced in &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; by William Blackstone. Yet another claim on this same hypothesis is from William Camden, as quoted in &quot;Chamber&#x27;s Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts&quot;, Volume 4. By 1854, the tie between Easterling and Sterling was well-established, as Ronald Zupko quotes in his dictionary of weights.

The British numismatist Philip Grierson disagrees with the &quot;star&quot; etymology, as the stars appeared on Norman pennies only for the single three-year issue from 1077 to 1080 (the Normans changed coin designs every three years). Grierson&#x27;s proposed alternative is that &quot;sterling&quot; derives from &quot;ster&quot; meaning &#x27;strong&#x27; or &#x27;stout&#x27;, by analogy with the Byzantine solidus, originally known as the meaning &#x27;solid gold&#x27; or &#x27;reliable gold&#x27;. In support of this he cites the fact that one of the first acts of the Normans was to restore the coinage to the consistent weight and purity it had in the days of Offa, King of Mercia. This would have been perceived as a contrast to the progressive debasement of the intervening 200 years, and would therefore be a likely source for a nickname.

S.E. Rigold disputes the origin being Norman, stating, &quot;that, while medieval British coins seldom copy or are copied by those of France, they have many typological connexions with the lands to the east—the Netherlands, the Baltic, Germany, and even deeper regions of central Europe.&quot;

== History ==
A piece of sterling silver dating from Henry II&#x27;s reign was used as a standard in the Trial of the Pyx until it was deposited at the Royal Mint in 1843. It bears the royal stamp &quot;ENRI. REX&quot; (&quot;King Henry&quot;) but this was added later, in the reign of Henry III. The first legal definition of sterling silver appeared in 1275, when a statute of Edward I specified that 12 troy ounces of silver for coinage should contain 11 ounces  pennyweights of silver and  pennyweights of alloy, with 20 pennyweights to the troy ounce. This is (not precisely) equivalent to a millesimal fineness of 926.

In Colonial America, sterling silver was used for currency and general goods as well. Between 1634 and 1776, some 500 silversmiths created items in the &quot;New World&quot; ranging from simple buckles to ornate Rococo coffee pots. Although silversmiths of this era were typically familiar with all precious metals, they primarily worked in sterling silver. The colonies lacked an assay office during this time (the first would be established in 1814), so American silversmiths adhered to the standard set by the London Goldsmiths Company: sterling silver consisted of 91.5–92.5% by weight silver and 8.5–7.5 wt% copper. Stamping each of their pieces with their personal maker&#x27;s mark, colonial silversmiths relied upon their own status to guarantee the quality and composition of their products.

Colonial silversmiths used many of the techniques developed by those in Europe. Casting was frequently the first step in manufacturing silver pieces, as silver workers would melt down sterling silver into easily manageable ingots. Occasionally, they would create small components (e.g. teapot legs) by casting silver into iron or graphite molds, but it was rare for an entire piece to be fabricated via casting.

Silversmiths would forge an ingot into the desired shape, by hammering at room temperature; this cold forming process, caused work hardening of the silver, which become increasingly brittle and difficult to shape. To restore the workability, the silversmith would anneal the piece—that is, heat it to a dull red and then quench it in water—to relieve the stresses in the material and return it to a more ductile state.

Hammering required more time than all other silver manufacturing processes, and therefore accounted for the majority of labor costs. Silversmiths would then seam parts together to create complex and artistic items, sealing the gaps with a solder of 80 wt% silver and 20 wt% bronze. Finally, they would file and polish their work to remove all seams, finishing off with engraving and stamping the smith&#x27;s mark.

The American revolutionary Paul Revere was regarded as one of the best silversmiths from this &quot;Golden Age of American Silver&quot;. Following the Revolutionary War, Revere acquired and made use of a silver rolling mill from England. Not only did the rolling mill increase his rate of production—hammering and flattening silver took most of a silversmith&#x27;s time—he was able to roll and sell silver of appropriate, uniform thickness to other silversmiths. He retired a wealthy artisan, his success partly due to this strategic investment. Although he is celebrated for his beautiful hollowware, Revere made his fortune primarily on low-end goods produced by the mill, such as flatware. With the onset of the first Industrial Revolution, silversmithing declined as an artistic occupation.

From about 1840 to 1940 in the United States and Europe, sterling silver cutlery (US: &#x27;flatware&#x27;) became &quot;&quot; when setting a proper table. There was a marked increase in the number of silver companies that emerged during that period. The height of the silver craze was during the 50-year period from 1870 to 1920. Flatware lines during this period sometimes included up to 100 different types of pieces.

== Hallmarks ==

Some countries developed systems of hallmarking silver:
* To indicate the purity of the silver alloy used in the manufacture or hand-crafting of the piece.
* To identify the silversmith or company that made the piece.
* To note the date and/or location of the manufacture or tradesman.
* To reduce the amount of counterfeit silver items.

==Uses==
Individual eating implements often included: 
*forks (dinner fork, salad fork, pastry fork, or shrimp fork)
*spoons (teaspoon, coffee spoon, demitasse spoon, iced tea spoon) and
* knives (dinner knife, butter spreader, cheese knife). 
This was especially true during the Victorian period, when etiquette dictated no food should be touched with one&#x27;s fingers.

Serving pieces were often elaborately decorated and pierced and embellished with ivory, and could include any or all of the following: carving knife and fork, salad knife and fork, cold meat fork, punch ladle, soup ladle, gravy ladle, casserole-serving spoon, berry spoon, lasagna server, macaroni server, asparagus server, cucumber server, tomato server, olive spoon, cheese scoop, fish knife and fork, pastry server, &quot;petit four&quot; server, cake knife, bon bon spoon, salt spoon, sugar sifter or caster and crumb remover with brush.

Cutlery sets were often accompanied by tea sets, hot water pots, chocolate pots, trays and salvers, goblets, demitasse cups and saucers, liqueur cups, bouillon cups, egg cups, plates, napkin rings, water and wine pitchers and coasters, candelabra and even elaborate centerpieces.

The interest in sterling silver extended to business (paper clips, mechanical pencils, letter openers, calling card boxes, cigarette cases), to the boudoir (dresser trays, mirrors, hair and suit brushes, pill bottles, manicure sets, shoehorns, perfume bottles, powder bottles, hair clips) and even to children (cups, cutlery, rattles).

Other uses for sterling silver include:

* Use as surgical and medical instruments as early as Ur, Hellenistic-era Egypt and Rome, and their use continued until largely replaced in Western countries in the mid to late 20th century by cheaper, disposable plastic items and sharper, more durable steel ones. The alloy&#x27;s natural malleability is an obvious physical advantage, but it is also naturally aseptic.
* Some brasswind instrument manufacturers use 92.5% sterling silver as the material for making their instruments, including the flute and saxophone. For example, some leading saxophone manufacturers such as Selmer and Yanagisawa have crafted some of their saxophones from sterling silver.
*Use as jewelry rings, bracelets, earrings and necklaces.

== Tarnish and corrosion ==

Silver is not a very reactive metal and does not react with oxygen or water at ordinary temperatures, so does not easily oxidize. However, it is attacked by common components of atmospheric pollution. Silver sulfide slowly appears as a black tarnish during exposure to airborne compounds of sulfur (byproducts of the burning of fossil fuels and some industrial processes), and low level ozone reacts to form silver oxide. As the purity of the silver decreases, the problem of corrosion or tarnishing increases because other metals in the alloy, usually copper, may react with oxygen in the air.

The black silver sulfide (Ag2S) is among the most insoluble salts in aqueous solution, a property that is exploited for separating silver ions from other positive ions.

Sodium chloride (NaCl) or common table salt is known to corrode silver-copper alloy, typically seen in silver salt shakers where corrosion appears around the holes in the top.

Several products have been developed for the purpose of polishing silver that serve to remove sulfur from the metal without damaging or warping it. Because harsh polishing and buffing can permanently damage and devalue a piece of antique silver, valuable items are typically hand-polished to preserve the unique patinas of older pieces. Techniques such as wheel polishing, which are typically performed by professional jewelers or silver repair companies, are reserved for extreme tarnish or corrosion.

<doc id="221194" wikidata="Q130300" url="?curid=221194" title="Miyazaki Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located on the island of Kyūshū. Miyazaki Prefecture has a population of 1,073,054 as of 1 June 2019 and has a geographic area of 7,735 km2 (2,986 sq mi). Miyazaki Prefecture borders Ōita Prefecture to the north, Kumamoto Prefecture to the northwest, and Kagoshima Prefecture to the southwest.

Miyazaki is the capital and largest city of Miyazaki Prefecture, with other major cities including Miyakonojō, Nobeoka, and Hyūga. Miyazaki Prefecture is located in southeastern Kyūshū on Japan&#x27;s Pacific coast, with its coastline extending from Nobeoka near the entrance to the Bungo Channel to Shibushi Bay in Kushima.

== History ==
Historically, after the Meiji Restoration, Hyūga Province was renamed Miyazaki Prefecture.

In Japan, Miyazaki Prefecture was first created in 1873 when Mimitsu Prefecture was merged with parts of Miyakonojō Prefecture. The first Miyazaki existed only until 1876 when it was merged (back) into Kagoshima Prefecture. Under public pressure and demands in the Kagoshima Prefectural Assembly, Miyazaki became finally independent from Kagoshima in 1883.

== Geography ==
Miyazaki Prefecture is on the eastern coast of the island of Kyushu, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean to the south and east, Ōita Prefecture to the north, and Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectures to the west. It is one of only two locations on Earth where the fungus &quot;Chorioactis geaster&quot; is found. Miyazaki is the home of the hyuganatsu fruit. It is also home to two virgin forests of the palm &quot;Livistona chinensis&quot;, one of which, on the islet of Aoshima, Miyazaki, is the northernmost reproducing population of its native range.

As of 31 March 2019, 12% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Kirishima-Kinkōwan National Park; Kyūshū Chūō Sanchi, Nichinan Kaigan, Nippō Kaigan, and Sobo-Katamuki Quasi-National Parks; and Mochio-Sekinoo, Osuzu, Saitobaru-Sugiyasukyō, Sobo Katamuki, Wanitsuka, and Yatake Kōgen Prefectural Natural Parks.

<text>Johannes Georg Fritsch (27 July 1941 – 29 April 2010) was a German composer.

At the age of seven, Fritsch found a violin in the attic of his uncle&#x27;s house in Bensheim-Auerbach, Germany, and began lessons with a village music teacher named Knapp. When he was ten, his family moved to Cologne, and he began studying with the principal violist in the Gürzenich Orchestra.

He studied music, sociology, and philosophy from 1961 to 1965 at the University and the Staatliche Musikhochschule in Cologne with, amongst others, Bernd Alois Zimmermann and Gottfried Michael Koenig. In the following years he applied himself to the most varied musical activities. Amongst other things he played viola in the Stockhausen-Ensemble from 1964 to 1970, and took part in the German exhibition at Expo &#x27;70, the World&#x27;s Fair in Osaka in 1970.

Although he had begun to compose at the age of 17, Fritsch regards as his first real composition the &quot;Duett für Bratsche&quot; (Duet for Viola), for viola and tape, which had a &quot;succès de scandale&quot; when he performed it at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1962—one newspaper review called him a &quot;kühner Kratzer&quot; (audacious scraper).

In 1966 Fritsch received the Förderpreis (Monetary Award) of the Federal State of North Rhine–Westphalia, and in 1971 the Prize of the Paris Biennale. Since the 1970s there have been further awards, such as the Förderpreis of the City of Cologne, and the Robert-Schumann Prize of the City of Düsseldorf.

In 1970 Fritsch was one of the founders of the Feedback Studio of Cologne (together with Rolf Gehlhaar and David Johnson), and has been since 1975 active as the chief protagonist of the Feedback Studio Verlag, the first German composers&#x27; publishing house. He is a producer of compact discs, editor of the &quot;Feedback Studio Papers&quot; (one of the journals dedicated to electronic music), a publisher of scores of contemporary music, and a concert manager. In 1979, 1982, 1984, and 1986 he was with WDR manager of the World Music Congresses in Vlotho.
From 1984 he was Professor of Composition at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik in Cologne, where his students have included Volker Staub, Caspar Johannes Walter, Juan María Solare, Josef Rebbe, Branimir Krstic and many other composers and improvisors.

He died at the age of 68 on 29 April 2010 after a long illness.

<text>A clamp is a fastening device used to hold or secure objects tightly together to prevent movement or separation through the application of inward pressure. In the United Kingdom the term cramp is often used instead when the tool is for temporary use for positioning components during construction and woodworking; thus a G cramp or a sash clamp but a wheel clamp or a surgical clamp.

There are many types of clamps available for many different purposes. Some are temporary, as used to position components while fixing them together, others are intended to be permanent. In the field of animal husbandry, using a clamp to attach an animal to a stationary object is known as &quot;rounded clamping.&quot; A physical clamp of this type is also used to refer to an obscure investment banking term, &quot;fund clamps.&quot; Anything that performs the action of clamping may be called a clamp, so this gives rise to a wide variety of terms across many fields.

==Types==

* C-clamp (also G-clamp or G-cramp) (lower centre in the top photo)
* Flooring clamp A carpenter&#x27;s clamp used to cramp up floorboards prior to fixing.
* Forked clamp stainless steel for ST ground glass joints with/without setscrew. Sizes for: ST 14, 19, 24, 29 and 45. 
* Gripe (a specialized clamp, tightened with a wedge, for holding strakes in position when building a clinker boat)
* Hand clamp
* Handscrew (upper right in the top photo)
* Holdfast, a bench clamp for holding things to a bench top or side The bench forms the fixed jaw.

<doc id="221199" wikidata="Q334471" url="?curid=221199" title="Clamp (manga artists)">
<text>Clamp (stylized in all caps) is an all-female Japanese manga artist group, consisting of leader and writer Nanase Ohkawa (born in Osaka), and three artists whose roles shift for each series: Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Satsuki Igarashi (all born in Kyoto).

Clamp was first formed in the mid-1980s as an eleven-member group creating &quot;dōjinshi&quot; (self-published fan works), and began creating original manga in 1987. By the time the group made its mainstream publishing debut with &quot;RG Veda&quot; in 1989, it was reduced to seven members; three more members left in 1993, leaving the four current members of the group.

Notable works by Clamp include &quot;X&quot; (1992), &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; (1993), &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; (1996) and its sequel &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card&quot; (2016), &quot;Chobits&quot; (2000), and &quot;xxxHolic&quot; and &quot;&quot; (both 2003). Various series by the group cross-reference each other, and characters reappear in multiple works by the group, with &quot;Tsubasa&quot;, a series set across multiple dimensions, featuring multiple alternative versions of characters from past works. Clamp are noted as among the most critically and commercially acclaimed manga artists in Japan, and as of 2007, have sold nearly 100 million books worldwide.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Clamp&quot; refers to a storage clamp, in the sense of &quot;a bunch of potatoes&quot;. This is referenced in &quot;&quot;, where a teacher is observed saying: &quot;The name &#x27;Clamp&#x27; incorporates the words &#x27;hinge,&#x27; as well as &#x27;potato mountain,&#x27; within its definition.&quot;

==History==

===Before their debut (1980s–1989)===
Clamp originally began in the mid-1980s as an eleven-member dōjinshi circle, to fill a booth vacancy at Dream Comic, a doujin event in Osaka. To fill a vacancy next to Yun Kōga&#x27;s CLUB/Y booth, they called themselves CLAMP, since club and clamp both started with in Katakana spelling, and the booths were sorted according to gojūon order. The original circle included , , , , , , and . Three of Clamp&#x27;s artists—Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Satsuki Igarashi—first began drawing manga when they were teenagers, inspired by friends. The three artists were good friends in the same school. They met and befriended Nanase Ohkawa through one of her friends who had bought comics from Mokona. The original group of twelve members began to meet at every event held in Osaka and Kobe, which usually occurred once a month. Before they began creating original work, the group produced dōjinshi of &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;, and yaoi dōjinshi of &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; and &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;. However, in 1987, the group stopped dōjinshi and began creating original work; it was at this time they began working on &quot;RG Veda&quot;, a loose adaptation of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Their first collaborative work was entitled &quot;Clamp&quot;, which they continued to work on until shortly after their debut.

The group debuted as professional manga artists when they decided to print the manga &quot;RG Veda&quot;, which they had first started as a fan comic. After seeing the comic digest of the manga series that Clamp had published, an editor for Shinshokan&#x27;s &quot;Wings&quot; manga magazine asked the group to work for them. They submitted an approximately sixty-page story as a sample, but the work was rejected. Ohkawa later lambasted the draft, stating that &quot;everything was bad&quot; and attributing the quality to the group&#x27;s lack of experience, since they had never before completed a story as a cohesive group. The group was given another chance at publication should they submit a new story that Shinshokan liked; this time, they submitted &quot;RG Veda&quot;, which was serialized in &quot;Wings&quot; magazine.

During the time before their official debut, the group moved to Tokyo and rented a small, two-bedroom apartment. Ohkawa stated that she thought she was &quot;gonna die there&quot;. Nekoi stated that &quot;the only private space [they] had was under [their] desk.&quot;

By the time &quot;RG Veda&quot; debuted, its members had gone down to seven. During the production of the manga &quot;RG Veda&quot;, O-Kyon had left the group. In June 1990, Nanao officially left the group (last mentioned in &quot;Shōten 6&quot;). Hishika, Nakamori and Ōmi officially left in March 1993 (as mentioned in the Shōten 3). In October 1992, Akiyama and Sei officially left the group.

&quot;RG Veda&quot; was originally planned to be a single story rather than a series, although because of good reader response and higher-than-expected sales for its first volume Shinshokan permitted the group to create more volumes, however after each chapter of the manga was released, Shinshokan threatened that it would cease serialization should its popularity fall.

In July 1989, &quot;Genki Comics&quot; began serializing Clamp&#x27;s second work, &quot;Man of Many Faces&quot;.

===1990–1999===
&quot;Genki Comics&quot; began serializing &quot;&quot; in August 1991, which became the work that the three artists Mokona, Nekoi, and Igarashi enjoyed working on most. In March 1990, &quot;Wings&quot; began serializing &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;. In December 1990, &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot; ran &quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot;, and in May 1992, it began serializing &quot;X&quot;.

Clamp was serialized by many other magazines and publishers including Kobunsha publishing &quot;Shirahime-Syo: Snow Goddess Tales&quot; on June 10, 1992. In 1993, Clamp released two different manga: in March, &quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot;, which began serializing in &quot;Newtype&quot;, and in November, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; which was serialized in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;. &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; also began to serialize &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; in May 1996; Ohkawa, Clamp&#x27;s leader and storyboarder, particularly enjoyed working on &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; because unlike many of her previous works, it wasn&#x27;t tragic. Kadokawa Shoten published &quot;The One I Love&quot; on July 17, 1995. &quot;Wish&quot; first began serializing in &quot;Asuka Comics DX&quot; in October 1996. In December 1998, &quot;&quot; began first serializing in Asuka Comics DX, and in January 1999, &quot;Angelic Layer&quot; first began serializing in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Ace&quot;.

===2000–2009===

In 2001, &quot;Young Magazine&quot; began serializing Clamp&#x27;s &quot;Chobits&quot; which completed its run in 2002. Although their previous works are targeted at a female audience, &quot;Chobits&quot; marked the first time Clamp wrote for an older teen male audience. Clamp began writing the two works that tell separate parts of the same overarching plot, &quot;xxxHolic&quot; serialized in &quot;Young Magazine&quot; beginning in 2003 followed by &quot;&quot; serialized in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; beginning in the same year. &quot;Tsubasa&quot; marked the first time Clamp had ever tried writing for a younger male audience, although their first work published in the Shōnen demographic was &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;.

In 2004, Clamp&#x27;s 15th anniversary as a manga artist group, the members changed their names from Nanase Ohkawa, Mokona Apapa, Mick Nekoi, and Satsuki Igarashi to Ageha Ohkawa, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi (her name is pronounced the same, but written with different characters) respectively. To celebrate Clamp&#x27;s 15th anniversary, Tokyopop released a twelve-part magazine series entitled &quot;Clamp no Kiseki&quot; that contained a plethora of information for fans. The August 2004 issue of &quot;Newtype USA&quot;, a magazine specializing in events of the anime and manga subcultures, reported that the members of Clamp simply wanted to try out new names. In a later interview with Ohkawa, it was revealed that initially Mokona wanted to drop her surname because it sounded too immature for her liking, while Nekoi disliked people mistakenly commenting on her as a Rolling Stones member. Ohkawa and Igarashi, wanting to go with the flow of Nekoi&#x27;s and Mokona&#x27;s name changes, changed their names as well.

In 2006, Clamp provided the character designs for &quot;Code Geass&quot;. This came into fruition after producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi called them. This also marked Clamp&#x27;s first time being requested to provide a character design for an anime series not originally created by them.

Ohkawa made her first appearance overseas at the Taipei International Book Exhibition sponsored by Production I.G that same year. During an interview there, she announced that Clamp would be making its first United States public debut at &quot;Anime Expo&quot; in July in Anaheim, California co-sponsored by Anime Expo, Del Rey Manga, Funimation and Tokyopop. They were well received at the convention as fans completely filled all 6,000 seats present in the auditorium of the focus panel in addition to more on the waiting list. By 2006, Clamp had reportedly sold in excess of 90 million copies of their manga internationally.

===2010–present===
While &quot;&quot; ended in October 2009, &quot;xxxHolic&quot; ended in early 2011. The authors were satisfied with the two manga ending commenting it was difficult to serialize the two interconnected manga at the same time due to &quot;Tsubasa&quot;″s focus on action which required them to write side stories for &quot;xxxHolic&quot;.

Clamp collaborated in the &quot;&quot; spin off anime, &quot;Blood-C&quot;, as they are responsible for designing the characters and providing the story. Ohkawa wrote the scripts with series supervisor, Junichi Fujisaku for both anime series and the sequel movie, &quot;Blood-C: The Last Dark&quot;.

&quot;Legal Drug&quot; restarted serialization in the same year in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Young Ace&quot; under the new title of &quot;Drug and Drop&quot;. A new &quot;xxxHolic&quot; manga titled &quot;XXXHOLiC Rei&quot; also started serialization in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Young Magazine&quot; in March 2013.

Clamp also provided character design for Studio Deen&#x27;s the anime adaptation of &quot;Kabukibu!&quot;, which aired in April 2017.

&quot;Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card&quot; began serialization in 2016 with an anime that aired from January to June 2018 on NHK.

On October 19, 2020, the official Clamp fans website posted a link to a YouTube video due to start on October 25, 2020. These daily links are each accompanied by a graphic displaying the number of days to go until the announcement, and a single word. Each word relates to a chapter of &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; from the respectively numbered tankobon volume. This has caused speculation among Clamp&#x27;s fans that a new &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; related work is due to be announced. On October 25, 2020, at 15:00 UTC (October 26, 2020 at midnight Japan Standard Time), a trailer was released for a new anime adaptation of &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;. The new series, &quot;Tokyo Babylon 2021&quot;, will be released and set the story in the year 2021. It was to be made by the studio GoHands. The series was to debut in April 2021, but was postponed due to the production team&#x27;s plagiarism incident. On March 28, 2021, the production committee announced that the series&#x27;s production was discontinued, and Clamp and the production committee will restart the anime series with a different studio.

In January 2021, it was announced that a new series in the &quot;Cardfight!! Vanguard&quot; franchise will begin on April 3, 2021, and will feature character designs by Clamp. The new series will be called &quot;Vanguard overDress&quot;.

In June 2021, it was announced that Clamp will collaborate with Netflix to produce an original anime series based on the &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;, with Wit Studio handling the animation. In March 2024, the series&#x27; title was revealed as &quot;The Grimm Variations&quot;, which was released as a Netflix exclusive in April 2024.

==Business model==
The members of Clamp all share a single workplace and as such do not need to arrange specific meetings. Nanase Ohkawa acts as the group&#x27;s spokesperson, producer-director, and storyboarder. Mokona is the chief character designer, while Igarashi and Nekoi work for the background; however, the three often shuffle their roles. Sometimes, they may split the work of the characters and backgrounds or have one person draw all the art depending on the story. The three artists try to stay as &quot;close as possible&quot; to Ohkawa&#x27;s original designs. Ohkawa advises the artists on what colors to use. Although Ohkawa chooses which projects they decide to decline or accept, Satsuki Igarashi decides on the actual time and order the group works on each project, creating the schedules for time allotted to each individual work. They do not have any assistants, stating that assistants would slow them down because they would not understand the &quot;years worth of jargon&quot; they created among themselves.

Once Ohkawa has conceived a story, the four members of the group gather &quot;to discuss the purpose of the story and its main characters&quot;. After the group members become familiar with the story, Ohkawa drafts an outline for the story and determines the story&#x27;s setting. The ending for each story is predetermined. Ohkawa designs many of the characters early in the story&#x27;s development; frequently appearing guest characters are designed from the beginning whereas minor characters are designed early on. As Ohkawa drafts the outline, the other three members formulate character designs by creating character profile sheets so as to avoid confusion. After drawing a sample story and sketch for their editor and receiving approval, Ohkawa assigns the roles to each group member and then chooses the visual styles depending on factors such as the complexity of the story, the chosen art style, and its relationship to the group&#x27;s other works. Ohkawa provides a rough draft for each chapter detailing things such as dialogue, panel size, props, movement, and character&#x27;s emotions.

On average for each chapter that they produce (for Clamp, an average of 20 pages of artwork in a magazine), storyboarding takes twelve hours, the script takes eight hours to write, and the artwork depends on the story. For example, a chapter of &quot;xxxHolic&quot; takes two days, whereas a chapter of &quot;X&quot; took four to five days.

==Style==

In general, Ohkawa gets her inspiration for the group from everyday events such as dreams or the news. Unlike most manga artists who specialize in a single genre, Clamp has created a diverse body of work. Clamp&#x27;s genres vary widely, from childish and comedic (&quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;,&quot;Clamp School Detectives&quot;) to more dramatic and teen-rated (&quot;xxxHolic&quot;, &quot;X&quot;) series. Furthermore, drawing from the idea of Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Star System as they did in &quot;&quot;, Clamp often crossover characters from their own series into their other works, which gives rise to a loosely defined &quot;Clamp Universe&quot;.

Although most of their manga are female-oriented, Clamp has also attracted male readers in their early works through their handling of fight scenes in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot;. &quot;Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle&quot; is a male-oriented manga but Clamp still added multiple motifs to attracts readers such as Syaoran&#x27;s romantic journey. &quot;xxxHolic&quot; is an adult-oriented manga but it uses Kimihiro Watanuki as a protagonist that would attract a female demographic.

===Art===
The current members of Clamp took art-focused classes during their high school. However, Tsubaki Nekoi feels that, aside from basic art skills, drawing manga requires a different skill set; however, none of the group members has worked as an assistant for already established manga artists, and most of their ability is self-taught. Clamp&#x27;s manga is distinguished by its diverse visual styles. Their work &quot;Clover&quot;, for example, is remarkable for its heavy use of negative space.

===Themes===
Clamp&#x27;s works span a wide variety of themes. As opposed to keeping consistent themes across their works or having individual themes for each work, Nanase Ohkawa stated &quot;we come up with a new theme for each story. One thing to say each time.&quot; Their works often deal with the theme of human fate that relates to Ohkawa&#x27;s view on life; Ohkawa believes that &quot;fate is something you choose&quot;, not a &quot;mystical force manipulating your destiny&quot;, and that with determination and resolve, &quot;you can change your fate&quot;.

Also common is the idea of soulmates, or couples tied together by fate. Syaoran and Sakura (featured in both &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; and &quot;&quot;) are among Clamp&#x27;s signature couples that best fits this representation. As also seen in &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, three girls are bound together by fate to save Cephiro. Fate is also the reason the three girls consider each other &quot;sisters&quot;; another idea that elaborates people being tied together (family cannot be chosen). Clamp also explores the idea of chaste or pure love (as in the manga &quot;Chobits&quot;). Clamp&#x27;s disregard for sex or gender (or at times biological age) in these couples has led them to write same-sex couples into many of their manga in contrast to many other manga artists (for example, Tōya and Yukito in &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;). A number of such couples have been shown together across parallel dimensions in the Clamp multiverse. Although Clamp often writes romantic works, Ohkawa has mentioned that she feels that it is more putting one&#x27;s life on the line than love that causes women to grow or change. Clamp never features love as a central theme; Ohkawa stated in an interview with Takeshi Oshiguchi in 1997 for &quot;Animerica&quot; that she is not &quot;good at love stories&quot; since her &quot;idea of a relationship is different from that of a lot of other people&quot;.

Perhaps drawing inspiration from Ohkawa&#x27;s own poor right-eye vision, Clamp frequently features one-eyed characters or characters that lose their sight in one eye as means to express the feeling of loneliness (for example, Subaru and Seishirō in &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; and &quot;X&quot; and Fay in &quot;Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle&quot;). However, there is always something later on that comes to supplement the loss in vision.

==Reception and awards==
Mystery has surrounded the members of Clamp as, in order to avoid being harassed by overzealous fans, they avoid making public appearances. In polls conducted by marketing research firm Oricon, Clamp was elected ninth most popular manga artist from Japan in 2007, while they were eighth in 2008, sharing the spot with Fujiko F. Fujio.

Gen Fukunaga, the president and CEO of Funimation, has praised Clamp as being &quot;one of the most acclaimed groups of artists in Japan&quot;. According to Charles Solomon, a journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Clamp &quot;ranks among the most successful creators of manga ... in Japan and the United States&quot;. Dallas Middaugh, associate publisher of Del Rey Manga, stated that Clamp was an integral part of &quot;manga explosion&quot; that has been occurring in the United States over the past few years. He also praised the group&#x27;s artwork and storytelling style as having &quot;struck a strong chord with male and female manga readers&quot;. The group was placed third after the winner for the Shogakukan Manga Award in the Children&#x27;s category in 1999. Their work &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; won the Seiun Award for best manga in 2001. Almost 100 million Clamp &quot;tankōbon&quot; copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007. Various of their selling series include &quot;xxxHolic&quot; and &quot;Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle&quot; that have sold over eleven million and twenty million volumes, respectively.

When asked about the universal popularity of Clamp&#x27;s works, John Oppliger of AnimeNation stated that although it is &quot;not based on originality [or] their artistic skill&quot;, they possess a distinct style that &quot;perfectly mesh[es] the conventional attributes of shōnen and shōjo manga&quot;. He also pointed out that Clamp often &quot;recycles&quot; characters from their own earlier works, which gave rise to &quot;a loosely defined &#x27;Clamp Universe&#x27; that gives much of their work a unifying tone&quot;, and creates &quot;absorbing, complex narratives that appeal to both male and female readers&quot;. All these factors result in &quot;a cult following devoted to anything and everything the group publishes&quot;. &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot; authors stated that &quot;whatever Clamp are on, we&#x27;d like some&quot;.

Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; stated that Clamp&#x27;s works &quot;are among the most successful manga and anime with Western fans&quot;.

<doc id="221204" wikidata="Q639319" url="?curid=221204" title="Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp">
<text>Natzweiler-Struthof was a Nazi concentration camp located in the Vosges Mountains close to the villages of Natzweiler and Struthof in the Gau Baden-Alsace of Germany, on territory annexed from France on a basis in 1940. It operated from 21 May 1941 to September 1944, and was the only concentration camp established by the Germans in the territory of pre-war France. The camp was located in a heavily forested and isolated area at an elevation of .

About 52,000 prisoners were estimated to be held there during its time of operation. The prisoners were mainly from the resistance movements in German-occupied territories. It was a labor camp, a transit camp and, as the war went on, a place of execution. Some died of exhaustion and starvation – there were an estimated 22,000 deaths at the camp and its network of subcamps. Many prisoners were moved to other camps; in particular, in 1944 the former head of Auschwitz concentration camp was brought in to evacuate the prisoners of Natzweiler-Struthof to Dachau as the Allied armies approached. Only a small staff of Nazi SS personnel remained when the camp was liberated by the French First Army under the command of the U.S. Sixth Army Group on 23 November 1944.

The anatomist August Hirt made a Jewish skull collection, whose purpose was to portray Jews as racially inferior, at the camp. A documentary movie was made about the 86 named men and women who were killed there for that project. Some of the people responsible for atrocities in this camp were brought to trial after the war ended.

The camp is preserved as a museum in memory of those held or killed there. The European Centre of Deported Resistance Members is located at this museum, focusing on those held. A monument to the departed stands at the site. The present museum was restored in 1980 after damage by neo-Nazis in 1976. Among notable prisoners, the writer Boris Pahor was interned in Natzweiler-Struthof and wrote his novel &quot;Necropolis&quot; based on his experience.

==Background==
In 1940, Germany invaded and occupied France, including Alsace. That region, adjacent to the German border, was chosen for full Germanization and was annexed to Gau Baden-Alsace. On 2 July 1940, two weeks after the fall of the nearby city of Strasbourg, an internment camp was set up near Schirmeck which existed throughout the war but was never part of the concentration camp system. The Natzweiler-Struthof main camp on 1 May 1941 was established nearby at Natzweiler in the Bruche valley, due to its proximity to a quarry.

==Operations==

The construction of Natzweiler-Struthof was overseen by Hans Hüttig in the spring of 1941, in a heavily forested and isolated area at an elevation of . The camp operated between 21 May 1941 and the beginning of September 1944, when the SS evacuated the surviving prisoners on a &quot;death march&quot; to Dachau, with only a small SS unit keeping the camp&#x27;s operations.

On 23 November 1944, this camp with its small staff was discovered and liberated by the French First Army as part of the U.S. Sixth Army Group, on the same day that the city of Strasbourg was liberated by the Allies. Through 1945, Natzweiler-Struthof had a complex of about 70 subcamps or annex camps. (For the system of subcamps see List of subcamps of Natzweiler-Struthof.)

===Initial focus and later actions===

The total number of prisoners reached 52,000 over the three years, of 32 nationalities. Inmates originated from various countries, including Poland, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, France, Nazi Germany, Slovene-speaking parts of Yugoslavia and Norway. The camp was specially set up for &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; prisoners, in most cases, people of the resistance movements. It was a labor camp and a transit camp, as many prisoners were sent to other Nazi concentration camps before the final evacuation. As the war continued, it became a death camp as well. Some people died of exhaustion from the work they had to do while starving. Deaths have been estimated at 22,000 at the main camp and the subcamps.

Interned prisoners provided forced labor for the Wehrmacht war industry, through contracts with private industry. The work
was done mainly at the numerous annex camps, some of them located in mines or tunnels to protect them from Allied air raids. Work, hunger, darkness and lack of health care caused many epidemics; mortality rates could reach 80%. Some worked in quarries, but many worked in the arms industry at various subcamps. Daimler-Benz moved its aircraft engine factory from Berlin to a gypsum mine near the Neckarelz annex camp. The disused autobahn Engelberg Tunnel in Leonberg, near Stuttgart, was used by the Messerschmitt Aircraft Company which eventually employed 3,000 prisoners in forced labor. Another annex camp at Schörzingen was established in February 1944 to extract crude oil from oil shale. The total number of prisoners at all of the Natzweiler subcamps was an estimated 19,000 of whom between 7,000 and 8,000 were in the main camp at Natzweiler.


The camp held a crematorium and a jury rigged gas chamber outside the main camp, which was not used for mass extermination but for selective extermination, as part of the human experimentation programs, in particular on the problems of fighting a war, like typhus among the troops.

Doctors Otto Bickenbach and Helmut Rühl were accused of crimes committed at this camp. Hans Eisele was also stationed in this camp for a time. August Hirt committed suicide in June 1945; his suicide was unknown for many years, and he was tried in absentia in 1953 at Metz for his war crimes, including the Jewish skull collection, begun at Auschwitz, continued at Natzweiler-Struthof, and at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg.

Some prisoners were executed directly, by hanging, by gunshot or by gas. The female prisoner-population in the camp was small, and only seven SS women served in Natzweiler-Struthof camp (compared to more than 600 SS men) and 15 in the Natzweiler complex of subcamps. The main duty of the female supervisors in Natzweiler was to guard the few women who came to the camp for medical experiments or to be executed. The camp also trained several female guards who went to the Geisenheim and Geislingen subcamps in western Germany.

Leo Alexander, the medical advisor at the Nuremberg trials, stated that some children were murdered at Natzweiler-Struthof for the sole purpose of testing poisons for inconspicuous executions of Nazi officials and prisoners. Such executions of took place at Bullenhuser Damm.

The camp became a war zone in late summer 1944, and was evacuated in early September 1944. Prior to the evacuation of the camp, 141 prisoners were shot dead on 31 August – 1 September 1944. The 70th anniversary of this execution of those who resisted Nazi occupation was commemorated at the museum in 2014.

===Notable prisoners===

Four female British SOE agents were executed together on 6 July 1944: Diana Rowden, Vera Leigh, Andrée Borrel and Sonya Olschanezky. Brian Stonehouse of the British SOE and Albert Guérisse, a Belgian escape line leader, witnessed the arrival of the four women and the events leading up to their execution and cremation; both men testified to the executions of the four women in post-war trials. The two men were sent to Dachau, where they were liberated. Roger Boulanger writes of the four British SOE women executed under the supervision of Dr. Plaza and Dr. Rhode, in his section on Capital Punishment (Les exécutions capitales), as to the intent of the RSHA of Berlin, Reichssicherheitshauptamt, to have them disappear with no trace, as their names were not recorded as being at this camp. Stonehouse later sketched the four women which aided in their identification.

Charles Delestraint, leader of the Armée Secrète, was detained at Natzweiler-Struthof, then was executed by the Gestapo in Dachau days before that camp was liberated and the war ended. Henri Gayot, a member of the French Resistance who was interned at Struthof between April and September 1944, documented his ordeal in drawings which are now in the Struthof Concentration Camp Museum.

Bishop Gabriel Piguet, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Clermont-Ferrand, was interned at Natzweiler before being transferred to the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp. He is honored as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, Israel&#x27;s Holocaust Memorial, for hiding Jewish children in Catholic boarding schools.


Two British Royal Air Force airmen (Flying Officer Dennis H. Cochran, and Flight Lieutenant Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; R. H. Hayter) who were involved in &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and murdered by the Gestapo after re-capture, were cremated at Natzweiler-Struthof.

British bomber Sergeant Frederic (&quot;Freddie&quot;) Habgood was hanged at this camp, after his Lancaster bomber crashed in Alsace on 27 July 1944 and he was betrayed to the Nazis by a local woman. Two died as a result of the crash, three survived as prisoners of war in a camp in Poland, one returned to England with the help of the resistance, and Mr Habgood was hanged on 31 July 1944. His death was acknowledged as a war crime in 1947 and his family was informed, but the most personal evidence of his presence there, a silver bracelet with his name on it, emerged from the soil in July 2018, as an area with flowers was being watered by a volunteer.

In his memoirs titled &quot;Moi, Pierre Seel, déporté homosexuel&quot;, Pierre Seel, who served a sentence at the neighboring camp of Schirmeck, tells that he took part in the construction of the Struthof concentration camp, in the context of his forced labor tasks.

Notable Norwegian prisoners at Natzweiler include newspaper editor and Labour Party politician Trygve Bratteli who later went on to become Prime Minister of Norway, and former footballer Asbjørn Halvorsen who had previously played in Germany for Hamburger SV. Both were imprisoned at Natzweiler for distribution of illegal newspapers in German-occupied Norway. In total, 504 Norwegians were imprisoned at Natzweiler. Only 266 of them returned home alive.

The Slovene novelist Boris Pahor was imprisoned at the camp in 1944. Pahor was later transported to Dachau camp and other camps until finally liberated in Bergen-Belsen. After the war he wrote the novel &quot;Necropolis&quot; about his experiences in the camp. The novel was later translated into numerous other European languages.

==Jewish skull collection==

The Jewish skull collection was an attempt by the Nazis to create an anthropological display to showcase the alleged racial inferiority of the &quot;Jewish race&quot; and to emphasize the status of Jews as Untermenschen (&quot;sub-humans&quot;), in contrast to the Germanic Übermenschen (&quot;super-humans&quot;) Aryan race which the Nazis considered to be the &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; (master race). The people who were to serve as best examples of the &quot;Jewish race&quot; were selected from people at the Auschwitz camp, then brought to Natzweiler-Struthof both to eat well and then to be murdered by gas, and their corpses brought to the Anatomy Institute of at the Reich University of Strasbourg (Reichsuniversität Straßburg) in the annexed region of Alsace, a project of great scope. Some initial study of the corpses was performed, but the progress of the war stalled completion of the collection.

The collection was sanctioned by Reichsführer of the SS Heinrich Himmler, and under the direction of August Hirt with Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers who was responsible for procuring and preparing the corpses as part of his management of the Ahnenerbe (the National Socialist scientific institute that researched the archaeological and cultural history of the hypothesized Aryan race). In a 2013 documentary by Sonia Rolley and others, two historians remark that &quot;Hirt is one of the most absolutely criminal of National Socialist ideology,&quot; adds the historian Yves Ternon. &quot;The project itself, continues Professor Johann Chapoutot, is an example of this investment of politics by science, or science by politics that is Nazism.&quot;

In 1943, the inmates selected at Auschwitz were transported to Natzweiler-Struthof. They spent two weeks eating well in barracks there in Block 13, so they would be good specimens of normal size. The deaths of 86 inmates were, in the words of Hirt, &quot;induced&quot; at a jury rigged gassing facility at Natzweiler-Struthof on several days in August and their corpses, 57 men and 29 women, were sent to Strasbourg for study. Natzweiler-Struthof was considered the better place for gassing the selected victims (better than at Auschwitz), as they would die one by one, with no damage to the corpses, and Natzweiler-Struthof was at Hirt&#x27;s disposal. Josef Kramer, acting commandant of Natzweiler-Struthof (who was a Lagerführer at Auschwitz and the last commandant of Bergen Belsen) personally carried out the gassing of 80 of the 86 victims at Natzweiler-Struthof.
The next part of the process for this &quot;collection&quot; was to bring the corpses to the Reichs University, where Hirt&#x27;s plan was to make anatomical casts of the bodies. Photos of the corpses as found by the Allies who saw them in the Reichs University make the totality of the strange project quite real. The next step after making the casts was to have been reducing them to skeletons. Neither of those steps, making the casts nor reducing the corpses to skeletons, was carried out. In 1944, with the approach of the Allies, there was concern over the possibility that the corpses could be discovered. In September 1944, Sievers telegrammed Brandt: &quot;The collection can be defleshed and rendered unrecognizable. This, however, would mean that the whole work had been done for nothing – at least in part – and that this singular collection would be lost to science, since it would be impossible to make plaster casts afterwards.&quot; And so it was left, as the camp was evacuated in September 1944, and the human remains were left at a room in the Reichs University of Strasbourg.

Two anthropologists, who were both members of the SS, Hans Fleischhacker and Bruno Beger, along with Wolf-Dietrich Wolff, were accused of making selections at Auschwitz of Jewish prisoners for Hirt&#x27;s collection of &#x27;racial types&#x27;, the man who devised the project of the Jewish skull collection. Beger was found guilty, although he was credited for pre-trial imprisonment and served no time. Also named as associated with this project are doctor and the anatomist . August Hirt, who conceived the project, was sentenced to death in absentia at the Military War Crimes Trial at Metz on 23 December 1953. It was unknown at the time that Hirt had shot himself in the head on 2 June 1945 while in hiding in the Black Forest.

For many years only a single victim, Menachem Taffel (prisoner no. 107969), a Polish-born Jew who had been living in Berlin, was positively identified through the efforts of Serge and Beate Klarsfeld. In 2003, Hans-Joachim Lang, a German professor at the University of Tübingen succeeded in identifying all the victims, by comparing a list of inmate numbers of the 86 corpses at the Reichs University in Strasbourg, surreptitiously recorded by Hirt&#x27;s French assistant Henri Henrypierre, with a list of numbers of inmates vaccinated at Auschwitz. The names and biographical information of the victims were published in the book &quot;Die Namen der Nummern&quot; (&quot;The Names of the Numbers&quot;). Rachel Gordon and Joachim Zepelin translated the introduction to the book to English, at the web site where the whole book, including the biographies of the 86 people, is posted in German. Lang recounts in detail the story of how he determined the identities of the 86 victims gassed for Hirt&#x27;s project of the Jewish skull collection. Forty-six of these individuals were originally from Thessaloniki, Greece. The 86 were from eight countries in German-occupied Europe: Austria, Netherlands, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Belgium and Poland. The biographies of all 86 people are described in English on a web site set up by Lang.

In 1951, the remains of the 86 victims were reinterred in one location in the Cronenbourg-Strasbourg Jewish Cemetery. On 11 December 2005, memorial stones engraved with the names of the 86 victims were placed at the cemetery. One is at the site of the mass grave, the other along the wall of the cemetery. Another plaque honoring the victims was placed outside the Anatomy Institute at Strasbourg&#x27;s University Hospital.

In 2022, the gas chamber was reopened to the public, but the European Center for Deported Resistance Fighters (CERD), led by Guillaume d&#x27;Andlau, indicated that it did not want to: &quot;celebrate the inauguration of this morbid place&quot;, having &quot; nothing to do with those intended for mass murder&quot;, specifying that &quot;it is a symbolic place for the camp and its activities in connection with the Reichsuniversität Straßburg&quot; which is perceived as a lack of sensitivity towards mourners.

==Post-war criminal trials==

The first camp commandant, Hans Hüttig, was sentenced to life in prison on 2 July 1954 by a French military court in Metz. In 1956, he was released from detention after being imprisoned for eleven years.

Josef Kramer, the former commandant of the camp during the time of the Jewish skull collection project, was arrested at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 17 April 1945 and tried at Lüneburg in the British-occupied sector for other crimes committed in Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. He was sentenced on 16–17 November 1945 and was hanged at Hamelin prison on 13 December 1945.

The commandant of Natzweiler at the time that four female resistance agents were executed, Fritz Hartjenstein and five others were tried by a British war crimes court at Wuppertal, from 9 April to 5 May 1946. All of the accused were found guilty; of these, three were sentenced to death and two hanged. Hartjenstein&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment on 1 June 1946. However, he was tried a second time by the British for hanging a POW who was a member of the Royal Air Force. He died of a heart attack while awaiting execution on 20 October 1954.

Those tried at Wuppertal were:
#Franz Berg: death sentence (executed by hanging 11 October 1946)
#Kurt Geigling: 10 years imprisonment
#Josef Muth: 15 years imprisonment
#Peter Straub: death sentence (executed by hanging 11 October 1946)
#Magnus Wochner: 10 years imprisonment
# Fritz Hartjenstein (commandant): death sentence, commuted to life (Wuppertal), death sentence by British (Rastatt), death sentence by French Court (Metz), died before sentence was carried out

Magnus Wochner was also implicated in the Stalag Luft III murders and was listed among the accused.
Heinrich Ganninger, adjutant and deputy of commander Fritz Hartjenstein, committed suicide in Wuppertal prison in April 1946 before his trial. He was accused of having murdered four British female spies.

Heinrich Schwarz was tried separately at Rastatt in connection with atrocities committed during his tenure as commandant of Natzweiler-Struthof. He was sentenced to death and subsequently shot by a firing squad near Baden-Baden on 20 March 1947.

==Post-war history, museum and monument==
During the night of 12–13 May 1976, neo-Nazis burned the camp museum, with the loss of important artifacts. Structures were rebuilt, placing the artifacts that survived the fire as they were found originally. The reconstructed camp museum was officially opened on 29 June 1980. The European Centre of Deported Resistance Members, a new structure at the site, opened in November 2005, and at the same time, &quot;the museum was entirely redesigned to focus solely on the history of Natzweiler concentration camp and its subcamps.&quot;

A dramatic monument (including a bronze figure supine and emaciated) stands in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Documentary films==
A documentary film was shown in 2014 about the 86 people who were murdered in the camp and whose remains were later identified by name, as described above in The Jewish skull collection section. The film &quot;The names of the 86&quot; () was directed by Emmanuel Heyd and Raphael Toledano (Dora Films).

Another documentary was made about the skull project in 2013, titled &quot;Au nom de la race et de la science, Strasbourg 1941–1944&quot; (English: &quot;In the name of Race and Science, Strasbourg 1941–1945&quot;). Its goal was to explain what happened at Reich University of Strasbourg, at Natzweiler-Struthof, in the strange use of science in this Nazi project to eliminate the Jews, but keeping some remains for history and science, the project never fully completed.

In the 2019 BBC One documentary &quot;The Man Who Saw Too Much&quot; Alan Yentob traces the story of 106-year-old Boris Pahor, believed to be the oldest known survivor of the Nazi concentration camps at the time.

<text>Clark&#x27;s nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), sometimes referred to as Clark&#x27;s crow or woodpecker crow, is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, native to the mountains of western North America. The nutcracker is an omnivore, but subsists mainly on pine nuts, burying seeds in the ground in the summer and then retrieving them in the winter by memory.
The bird was described by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with William Clark first observing it in 1805 along the banks of the Salmon River, a tributary of the Columbia River.

==Etymology and history==
Clark&#x27;s nutcracker&#x27;s scientific name literally means &quot;nutcracker of the Columbia&quot;. In 1806 Meriwether Lewis recorded a more detailed description. A skin collected by the expedition was obtained by the ornithologist Alexander Wilson, who used it to produce an engraving for his monumental &quot;American Ornithology&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Originally placed in the genus &quot;Corvus&quot; by Lewis, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker was later included in &quot;Nucifraga&quot; by Wilson, which also includes two Old World species with similar lifestyles and habitats.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is present in western North America from British Columbia and western Alberta in the north to Baja California and central New Mexico in the south. There is also a small isolated population on the peak of Cerro Potosí, elevation 3,700 metres (12,200 ft), in Nuevo León, northeast Mexico. It is mainly found in mountains at altitudes of 900–3,900 metres (3,000–12,900 ft) in conifer forest. It is not migratory except in the sense of moving back and forth locally between areas of higher and lower elevation. Outside the breeding season, it may wander extensively to lower altitudes and also further east as far as Illinois (and exceptionally, Pennsylvania), particularly following any cone crop failure in its normal areas.

==Description==
&quot;Nucifraga columbiana&quot; can reach an average length of . It is slightly smaller than its Eurasian relative the spotted nutcracker (&quot;N. caryocatactes&quot;). Most of its body has feathers that are ashy-grey and loose in texture. The wings and tail are black and white. The central tail feathers are black and the outer ones white. The bill, legs and feet are also black. The bill is long, stout, and cone-shaped.

==Food==

The most important food resources for this species are the seeds of pines (&quot;Pinus&quot; sp.), principally the two cold-climate (high altitude) species of white pine (&quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;) with large seeds &quot;P. albicaulis&quot; and &quot;P. flexilis&quot;, but also using other high-altitude species like &quot;P. balfouriana, P. longaeva&quot; and &quot;P. monticola&quot;. During migrations to lower altitudes, it also extensively uses the seeds of pinyon pines. The isolated Cerro Potosí population is strongly associated with the local endemic Potosi pinyon (&quot;Pinus culminicola)&quot;. All Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers have a sublingual pouch capable of holding around 50–150 seeds, depending on the size of the seeds; the pouch greatly enhances the birds&#x27; ability to transport and store seeds.

Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers store seeds, usually in the ground for later consumption, in caches of 1–15 seeds (average of 3–4 seeds). Depending on the cone crop as well as the tree species, a single Clark&#x27;s nutcracker can cache as many as 98,000 seeds per season. The birds regularly store more than they actually need as insurance against seed theft by other animals (squirrels, etc.), as well as low availability of alternative foods; this surplus seed is left in the cache, and may be able to germinate and grow into new trees, if the conditions are right. Through this activity of caching and over-storing, the bird is perpetuating its own habitat. Closely tied in with this storage behavior is the bird&#x27;s remarkable long-term spatial memory; they are able to relocate caches of seeds with great accuracy, even nine months later, and even when the cache sites are buried under up to a meter (3 ft) of snow. Its powers of memory exemplify the high intelligence of the Corvidae.  Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers are known for storing and recovering large numbers of seed caches that are critical for winter survival. Short-term memory tasks reveal that nutcrackers can remember spatial information better than visual information. It was demonstrated that the cache recovery ability of Clarks nutcracker is derived from a memory system that has evolved differently for storing spatial information.
The diet also includes a wide range of insect prey, berries and other fruits, small mammals, including ground squirrels and voles, nestling birds, amphibians, and occasionally flesh from carcasses. Eggs and nestlings are sometimes devoured, and peanuts and suet have become a favorite at bird tables. Food is taken both from the ground and from trees, where the nutcrackers are very agile among the branches. The birds are able to extract food by clasping pine cones in such a way that the cones are held between one or both feet. The birds then hack the cones open with their strong bills. Rotten logs are also hacked into in order to locate large beetle grubs, and animal dung may be flipped over in search of insects. Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers can also be opportunistic feeders in developed areas, and are known to some as &quot;camp robbers&quot;.

==Nesting==

The species usually nests in pines or other types of conifers during early spring. Two to four eggs are laid, incubation usually occurring in 16–18 days. Incubation is performed by both the male and female parents, and both the male and the female develop brood patches. The young are typically fledged by around the 22nd day. The fledglings follow their parents around for several months, possibly in order to learn the complex seed storage behavior.

==Whitebark pine mutualism==
Clark&#x27;s nutcracker is the primary seed disperser for whitebark pine (&quot;Pinus albicaulis&quot;). Whitebark pine is in decline throughout its range, due to infection by white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;), widespread outbreaks of mountain pine beetle, and the long-term effects of fire suppression. Clark&#x27;s nutcracker is an integral part of the whitebark pine restoration process: Clark&#x27;s nutcracker must remain in whitebark pine forests and cache the seeds in excess, so that healthy trees will continue to grow. If whitebark pine declines into extinction, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker will lose an important source of food and may no longer be seen in areas where the tree is the primary source of seed, such as Glacier National Park.

==Vocalization==
The voice of this bird is extremely varied and produces many different sounds. However, the most frequent call is commonly described as &quot;&quot;.

<text>Admiralty courts, also known as maritime courts, are courts exercising jurisdiction over all maritime contracts, torts, injuries, and offenses.

== United Kingdom ==
===England and Wales===
===Scotland===

The Scottish court&#x27;s earliest records, held in West Register House in Edinburgh, indicate that sittings were a regular event by at least 1556. Judges were styled &quot;Judge Admiral&quot; and received appointment at the hands of the Scottish High Admiral to hear matters affecting the Royal Scots Navy as well as mercantile, privateering and prize money disputes. From 1702 the judge of the court was also authorised to appoint deputies to hear lesser matters or to deputise during his absence.

The Scottish court&#x27;s workload was small until the mid-eighteenth century, with judges hearing no more than four matters in each sitting. After the 1750s the volume of cases rose until by 1790 it was necessary to maintain a daily log of decisions. The growth in caseload was related to increasing disputes regarding breaches of charter, including ship&#x27;s masters seeking compensation for unpaid freight and merchants suing for damage to goods or unexpected port fees. Cases reflected Scotland&#x27;s principal marine industries including the transshipment of sugar and tobacco and the export of dried fish, coal and grains. A smaller number of cases related to smuggling, principally brandy, and to salvage rights for ships wrecked on Scottish shores. The court ceased operation in 1832 and its functions were subsumed into the Court of Session, Scotland&#x27;s supreme court for civil disputes.

===Cinque Ports===
The sole survivor of the independent courts of admiralty is the Court of Admiralty for the Cinque Ports, which is presided over by the early-merged role of Judge Official and Commissary. This office is normally held by a High Court Judge who holds the appointment of Admiralty Judge. The jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty of the Cinque Ports extends in an area with boundaries running from the Naze Tower, Essex along the shore to Brightlingsea, then to Shoe Beacon (or Shore Beacon), (to the east of Shoeburyness, Essex), across the mouth of the Thames Estuary to Shellness, Kent, and around the coast to Redcliffe, near Seaford, Sussex. It covers all the sea from Seaford to a point five miles off Cape Grisnez on the coast of France, and the Galloper Sands off the coast of Essex. The last full sitting was in 1914. According to general civilian practice, the registrar can (and here does) act as deputy to the judge. Unless the judge finds a conflict of interest in the registrar&#x27;s work their main task is to co-invest each successive Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Appeal from the court&#x27;s decisions lies to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

===Court regalia===

Since Elizabethan times, the symbol of authority for a British admiralty court has been a silver oar, placed before the judge when the court is in session. In this respect the silver oar is the equivalent of a ceremonial mace, representing the authority of the Crown and the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom. An antique silver oar is still placed before the bench when the High Court sits in London on matters relating to its admiralty court functions; in past times it was borne by the marshal in procession, not only in court but on occasions of arrest of persons or vessels, and also on the way to Execution Dock for the last journey of those convicted of piracy. The date of the London oar is uncertain: it is depicted on the tomb of David Lewis, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty from 1559 until 1584, there is some evidence that it may date from the beginnings of the court in the fourteenth century, though one of several assay marks suggests that it was remade three centuries later (based on the earlier pattern). Local courts and vice-admiralty courts had their own silver oars; early examples survive from colonial courts in Bermuda (1701), Boston (1725), New York City (c. 1725), Colombo (1801), Cape of Good Hope (1806) and Calcutta. The silver oars measure four feet in length, and are borne by a ceremonial &quot;Water Bailiff&quot;, who is charged with the protection of the magistrate while the latter is on duty near the water.

The Admiralty Court of the Cinque Ports had a silver oar of early date, but it was stolen in the 1960s and replaced with a replica. Some local authorities possess examples relating to their former local admiralty jurisdiction. In recent times, new silver oars have been made for admiralty courts in Canada, Australia and New Zealand; in 2014 the Admiralty Court presented a replica silver oar mace to the Corporation of Trinity House on the occasion of its 500th anniversary, acknowledging the work of its brethren in advising the court over much of its history.

In addition to representing the court in session, from the nineteenth century the silver oar has been the insignia of the Admiralty Marshal – an official responsible for serving writs of the court, and carrying out the sale of any vessels seized and disposed of by court decision.

===Vice admiralty courts===

To expedite the administration of maritime law, British colonies were routinely granted subsidiary jurisdiction through independent vice-admiralty courts. These were civil courts with the power to interpret colonial legislation, provided these did not conflict with Admiralty Court decisions or British maritime law.

The first vice-admiralty court in Australia was established in the colony of New South Wales in 1788. The first Vice-Admiral was Arthur Phillip and the first judge was Robert Ross. The court was abolished in 1911 when the Supreme Court of New South Wales was granted the admiralty jurisdiction of the court.

A vice-admiralty court was also formed in Nova Scotia to try smugglers and to enforce the Sugar Act 1764 throughout British North America. From 1763 to 1765, when American smugglers were caught, they were tried by corrupt judges who received a percentage of the confiscated goods if the defendants were found guilty; therefore, defendants were more than likely to be found guilty.

===Colonial courts of admiralty===

Local courts and vice-admiralty courts had their own &quot;silver oars&quot; as symbols of Admiralty jurisdiction; early examples survive from colonial courts in Bermuda (1701), Boston (1725), New York City (c. 1725), Colombo (1801), Cape of Good Hope (1806) and Calcutta.

1890 saw the enactment of the (53 &amp; 54 Vict. c. 27 (UK)). That act provided for the abolition of the imperial courts of admiralty and replace them with local courts to be called colonial courts of admiralty. It was widely considered unsatisfactory that the imperial court should exist separately to the colonial courts, yet use the same facilities and personnel of the colonial courts.

==Ceylon and Sri Lanka==
A colonial court of admiralty was established in the British Ceylon in 1891 under the &quot;Ceylon Courts of Admiralty Ordinance&quot; under the provisions of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 (UK) to deal jurisdiction over all admiralty and maritime actions. With Ceylon gaining self rule in 1948, jurisdiction over admiralty matters were transferred to the Supreme Court of Ceylon as the Ceylon Independence Act 1947 (UK) made provisions of the Admiralty Act inapplicable.

In Sri Lanka today, admiralty jurisdiction is exercised by the High Court of Colombo, having had the jurisdiction transferred to it from the Supreme Court under the provisions of the &quot;Judicature Act No.2 of 1978&quot;.

==Canada==

A silver oar sat in Quebec City, for many years from 1764 the seat of Admiralty practice in the St Lawrence Great Lakes drainage basin. The Halifax vice Admiralty court sat in judgment of the bulk of the piracy cases in the western Atlantic, while Quebec dealt with most of the commercial work.

The Canadian Admiralty court was born the year after the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 laid the groundwork. In that year &quot;the Parliament of Canada declared the Exchequer Court of Canada to be a &quot;Colonial Court of Admiralty&quot;, thereby rendering it Canada&#x27;s national admiralty court. The Exchequer Court continued in this role until 1 June 1971, when it was renamed and continued by statute as the Federal Court of Canada, to remain the admiralty court of Canada.&quot;

==Hanseatic League==

The Hanseatic League was formed in the 13th century to exploit trade between Nordic cities linked by the Baltic Sea. The law &quot;van schiprechte&quot; was developed by this means. In 1241, Lübeck, which had access to the Baltic and North seas&#x27; fishing grounds, formed an alliance—a precursor to the League—with the trade city of Hamburg, which controlled access to the salt-trade routes from Lüneburg. These cities gained control over most of the salt-fish trade, especially the Scania Market; Cologne joined them in the Diet of 1260. The towns raised their armies, with each guild required to provide levies when needed. The Hanseatic cities aided one another, and commercial ships often served to carry soldiers and their arms. The network of alliances grew to include a flexible roster of 70 to 170 cities.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War, from 1618 to 1648, was destructive for the Hanseatic League and members suffered heavily. Then in 1666, the Steelyard burned in the Great Fire of London. The Kontor-manager sent a letter to Lübeck appealing for immediate financial assistance for a reconstruction. Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck called for a Hanseatic Day in 1669. Only a few cities participated and those who came were reluctant to contribute financially to the London reconstruction. It was the last formal meeting, unbeknownst to any of the parties.

==United States==
In the United States, the federal district courts have jurisdiction over all admiralty and maritime actions; see .

In recent years, a pseudolegal conspiracy argument used notably by sovereign citizens is that an American court displaying an American flag with a gold fringe is in fact an &quot;admiralty court&quot; and thus has no jurisdiction. Courts have repeatedly dismissed this as frivolous. In &quot;United States v. Greenstreet&quot;, the court summarized their finding to this argument with, &quot;Unfortunately for Defendant Greenstreet, decor is not a determinant for jurisdiction.&quot;

<text>The Central Advisory Commission (CAC) was a body of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that existed during the era of the paramount leadership of Deng Xiaoping. The body was supposed to provide &quot;political assistance and consultation&quot; to the CCP Central Committee; however, as the CAC was a select group of senior CCP leadership, it was often seen as having more authority unofficially than that body.

== History ==
The commission was established after the 12th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1982, and abolished in 1992. Its chairmen were Deng Xiaoping (1982–1987) and Chen Yun (1987–1992). Its membership was offered only to members of the Central Committee with forty years or more of service which made it an important forum for the Eight Elders to remain formally involved in politics. Directors and deputy directors were required to have first served in the Politburo or Politburo Standing Committee. Despite being supposedly advisory its power surpassed that of the Politburo Standing Committee and was nicknamed the &quot;Sitting Committee&quot; on account of the advanced age of its members.

== Commentary ==
According to Yasheng Huang, the CAC served as a restraint on the leadership at the time by the Eight Elders and was, as an institution, &quot;best positioned to check and balance a future dictator.&quot; Huang stated that its abolition paved the way for the rise of Xi Jinping.

<text>Kunduz (; ; ) is a city in northern Afghanistan and the capital of Kunduz Province. The city has an estimated population of about 268,893 as of 2015, making it about the seventh largest city of Afghanistan, and the largest city in northeastern Afghanistan. Kunduz is in the historical Tokharistan region of Bactria, near the confluence of the Kunduz River with the Khanabad River. Kunduz is linked by highways with Kabul to the south, Mazar-i-Sharif to the west, and Badakhshan to the east. Kunduz is also linked with Dushanbe in Tajikistan to the north, via the Afghan dry port of Sherkhan Bandar. This city is famous in Afghanistan for its watermelon production.

As of 2015, the land use of the city (within the municipal boundary) is largely agricultural (65.8% of total area). Residential land comprises nearly half of the &#x27;built-up&#x27; land area (48.3%) with 29,877 dwellings. Institutional land comprises 17.9% of built-up land use, given that the airport is within the municipal boundary.

== Etymology ==
Kunduz is also sometimes spelled (romanized) as Kundûz, Qonduz, Qondûz, Konduz, Kondûz, Kondoz, or Qhunduz. The name of the city is derived from the Persian compound, &quot;kohan dež&quot;, &quot;old/ancient fort&quot;.

== History ==

Kunduz is the site of the ancient city of Drapsaka. It was a great centre of Buddhist learning and very prosperous during the 3rd century AD.

The city used to be called Aornos () and later Walwalij or Varvaliz, a compound of the old name Warn and . The name &quot;Kuhandiz&quot; began to be used from the Timurid time.

In the 18th and 19th centuries it was the capital of an Uzbek khanate which reached its largest extent, from Balkh to the Pamir Mountains, during the reign of Murad Beg (1815–1842). Murad Beg faced the decline of his state after being defeated by Dost Mohammad Khan. After Murad&#x27;s death, the khanate declined and was eventually subjugated by Afghanistan in 1859.

In the early 20th century, between 100 and 200,000 Tajiks and Uzbeks fled the conquest of their homeland by the Russian Red Army and settled in northern Afghanistan.

In the early 20th century, under the governance of Sher Khan Nashir, Kunduz became one of the wealthiest Afghan provinces. This was mainly due to Nasher&#x27;s founding of the Spinzar Cotton Company, which continues to exist in post-war Afghanistan. At its peak, the Spinzar Cotton Company employed 5,000 people full time. Kunduz is the most important agricultural province which produces wheat, rice, millet, and other products and obtained the nickname of &quot;the hive of the country.&quot;

===21st century===
Kunduz is the centre for the northeast provinces and was captured by the Taliban in 1997. It was the last major city held by the Taliban before its fall to US-backed Afghan Northern Alliance forces on 26 November 2001.During the summer of 2015, the Taliban advanced and attacked the city, which resulted in a battle for control of the city against Afghan forces. Tens of thousands of inhabitants were displaced internally by the fighting. On 28 September 2015 the Taliban flag was again raised in the city center and the Taliban managed to capture the city prison and free many prisoners. On 3 October 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U gunship attacked the Kunduz Trauma Centre operated by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders). The Afghan Armed Forces counter-attacked and managed to re-capture the city in 15 days. The Taliban announced that, after achieving their objectives, they have withdrawn from the city&#x27;s center. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson, said that their main object in leaving the city is to avoid civilian casualties from air raids. In April 2018 the Afghan Air Force conducted an airstrike that killed and injured dozens of civilians at a religious school in Kunduz. On 31 August 2019, the Taliban forces launched another attack on the city, setting off a major battle with local security forces.

On 19 May 2020, the Taliban killed one policeman and one civilian and injured 18 others in a motorbike bomb blast in Kunduz. On the same day, the Taliban attempted again to capture Kunduz, attacking several government posts but were repelled by the Afghan security forces. The Taliban were forced to flee the city, leaving ten dead bodies behind. Eight Afghan soldiers and three civilians were killed and 55 others were wounded during the Taliban attack.

On 8 August 2021, the Taliban as part of their nationwide military offensive captured Kunduz, along with Sar-e-Pul and Taloqan after heavy clashes with ANA forces.

On 8 October 2021, a militant of ISKP detonated a suicide vest targeting shia worshippers at the Gozar-e-Sayed Abad Mosque, killing 50+ people and wounding over 100.

== Geography ==
Kunduz is strategically situated on the main north–south highway linking Kabul to Tajikistan, and east–west Mazar-i-Sharif to Taloqan and Fayzabad.

=== Climate ===
Kunduz has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. Precipitation is generally low except from January to April, with summers almost always rainless.
== Demographics ==
The city of Kunduz has an estimated population of about 268,893 as of 2015. Ethnic Pashtuns comprise the largest segment, followed by Uzbeks, Tajiks, Arabs and a few others. Kunduz is the capital of a highly diverse province that includes significant populations of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Arabs, Balochis and Turkmens.

Historically, during the late 19th century the city was predominantly Tajik with a significant Uzbek minority. However, as part of the Pashtunization initiative in Northern Afghanistan, successive Afghan governments sent Pashtuns north into Kunduz, taking both land reclaimed from the wetlands of Kunduz and from other non-Pashtun groups.

Kunduz Arabs speak Persian and Pashto, Afghanistan&#x27;s two official languages, rather than Arabic. However, they claim a strong Arab identity, based on their tribal origins in Arabia. This may in fact point to the seventh-century and eighth-century migration to this and other Central Asian locales of many Arab tribes from Arabia in the wake of the Islamic conquests of the region.

== Administration ==
Kunduz city is divided into 8 Districts (&#x27;Nahias&#x27;) with a total land area of 11,206 hectares.

The most influential leader of Kunduz was Arif Khan, who was a governor of Kunduz Province and was shot dead in the city of Peshawar, Pakistan in the year 2000. Soon after the incident his brother Haji Omar Khan took his responsibility and was appointed as the Governor of Kunduz (2000–01).

<doc id="221220" wikidata="Q204481" url="?curid=221220" title="Far-right politics">
<text>Far-right politics, often termed right-wing extremism, encompasses a range of ideologies that are marked by radical conservatism, authoritarianism, ultra-nationalism, and nativism. This political spectrum situates itself on the far end of the right, distinguished from more mainstream right-wing ideologies by its opposition to liberal democratic norms and emphasis on exclusivist views. Far-right ideologies have historically included fascism, Nazism, and Falangism, while contemporary manifestations also incorporate neo-fascism, neo-Nazism, white supremacy, and various other movements characterized by chauvinism, xenophobia, and theocratic or reactionary beliefs.

Key to the far-right worldview is the notion of societal purity, often invoking ideas of a homogeneous &quot;national&quot; or &quot;ethnic&quot; community. This view generally promotes organicism, which perceives society as a unified, natural entity under threat from diversity or modern pluralism. Far-right movements frequently target perceived threats to their idealized community, whether ethnic, religious, or cultural, leading to anti-immigrant sentiments, welfare chauvinism, and, in extreme cases, political violence or oppression. According to political theorists, the far-right appeals to those who believe in maintaining strict cultural and ethnic divisions and a return to traditional social hierarchies and values.

In practice, far-right movements differ widely by region and historical context. In Western Europe, they have often focused on anti-immigration and anti-globalism, while in Eastern Europe, strong anti-communist rhetoric is more common. The United States has seen a unique evolution of far-right movements that emphasize nativism and radical opposition to central government. 
Far-right politics have led to oppression, political violence, forced assimilation, ethnic cleansing, and genocide against groups of people based on their supposed inferiority or their perceived threat to the native ethnic group, nation, state, national religion, dominant culture, or conservative social institutions. Across these contexts, far-right politics has continued to influence discourse, occasionally achieving electoral success and prompting significant debate over its place in democratic societies.

== Overview ==
=== Concept and worldview ===

According to scholars Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, the core of the far right&#x27;s worldview is organicism, the idea that society functions as a complete, organized and homogeneous living being. Adapted to the community they wish to constitute or reconstitute (whether based on ethnicity, nationality, religion or race), the concept leads them to reject every form of universalism in favor of &quot;autophilia&quot; and &quot;alterophobia&quot;, or in other words the idealization of a &quot;we&quot; excluding a &quot;they&quot;. The far right tends to absolutize differences between nations, races, individuals or cultures since they disrupt their efforts towards the utopian dream of the &quot;closed&quot; and naturally organized society, perceived as the condition to ensure the rebirth of a community finally reconnected to its quasi-eternal nature and re-established on firm metaphysical foundations.

As they view their community in a state of decay facilitated by the ruling elites, far-right members portray themselves as a natural, sane and alternative elite, with the redemptive mission of saving society from its promised doom. They reject both their national political system and the global geopolitical order (including their institutions and values, e.g. political liberalism and egalitarian humanism) which are presented as needing to be abandoned or purged of their impurities, so that the &quot;redemptive community&quot; can eventually leave the current phase of liminal crisis to usher in the new era. The community itself is idealized through great archetypal figures (the Golden Age, the savior, decadence and global conspiracy theories) as they glorify non-rationalistic and non-materialistic values such as the youth or the cult of the dead.

Political scientist Cas Mudde argues that the far right can be viewed as a combination of four broadly defined concepts, namely exclusivism (e.g. racism, xenophobia, ethnocentrism, ethnopluralism, chauvinism, including welfare chauvinism), anti-democratic and non-individualist traits (e.g. cult of personality, hierarchism, monism, populism, anti-particracy, an organicist view of the state), a traditionalist value system lamenting the disappearance of historic frames of reference (e.g. law and order, the family, the ethnic, linguistic and religious community and nation as well as the natural environment) and a socioeconomic program associating corporatism, state control of certain sectors, agrarianism, and a varying degree of belief in the free play of socially Darwinistic market forces. Mudde then proposes a subdivision of the far-right nebula into moderate and radical leanings, according to their degree of exclusionism and essentialism.

=== Definition and comparative analysis ===
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right&quot; states that far-right politics include &quot;persons or groups who hold extreme nationalist, xenophobic, homophobic, racist, religious fundamentalist, or other reactionary views.&quot; While the term &quot;far right&quot; is typically applied to fascists and neo-Nazis, it has also been used to refer to those to the right of mainstream right-wing politics.

According to political scientist Lubomír Kopeček, &quot;[t]he best working definition of the contemporary far right may be the four-element combination of nationalism, xenophobia, law and order, and welfare chauvinism proposed for the Western European environment by Cas Mudde.&quot; Relying on those concepts, far-right politics includes yet is not limited to aspects of authoritarianism, anti-communism and nativism. Claims that superior people should have greater rights than inferior people are often associated with the far right, as they have historically favored a social Darwinistic or elitist hierarchy based on the belief in the legitimacy of the rule of a supposed superior minority over the inferior masses. Regarding the socio-cultural dimension of nationality, culture and migration, one far-right position is the view that certain ethnic, racial or religious groups should stay separate, based on the belief that the interests of one&#x27;s own group should be prioritized.

In western Europe, far right parties have been associated with anti-immigrant policies, as well as opposition to globalism and European integration. They often make nationalist and xenophobic appeals which make allusions to ethnic nationalism rather than civic nationalism (or liberal nationalism). Some have at their core illiberal policies such as removing checks on executive authority, and protections for minorities from majority (multipluralism). In the 1990s, the &quot;winning formula&quot; was often to attract anti-immigrant blue collar workers and white collar workers who wanted less state intervention in the economy, but in the 2000s, this switched to welfare chauvinism.

In comparing the Western European and post-Communist Central European far-right, Kopeček writes that &quot;[t]he Central European far right was also typified by a strong anti-Communism, much more markedly than in Western Europe&quot;, allowing for &quot;a basic ideological classification within a unified party family, despite the heterogeneity of the far right parties.&quot; Kopeček concludes that a comparison of Central European far-right parties with those of Western Europe shows that &quot;these four elements are present in Central Europe as well, though in a somewhat modified form, despite differing political, economic, and social influences.&quot; In the American and more general Anglo-Saxon environment, the most common term is &quot;radical right&quot;, which has a broader meaning than the European radical right. Mudde defines the American radical right as an &quot;old school of nativism, populism, and hostility to central government [which] was said to have developed into the post-World War II combination of ultranationalism and anti-communism, Christian fundamentalism, militaristic orientation, and anti-alien sentiment.&quot;

Jodi Dean argues that &quot;the rise of far-right anti-communism in many parts of the world&quot; should be interpreted &quot;as a politics of fear, which utilizes the disaffection and anger generated by capitalism. [...] Partisans of far right-wing organizations, in turn, use anti-communism to challenge every political current which is not embedded in a clearly exposed nationalist and racist agenda. For them, both the USSR and the European Union, leftist liberals, ecologists, and supranational corporationsall of these may be called &#x27;communist&#x27; for the sake of their expediency.&quot;

In &quot;Hate in the Homeland: The New Global Far Right&quot;, Cynthia Miller-Idriss examines the far-right as a global movement and representing a cluster of overlapping &quot;antidemocratic, antiegalitarian, white supremacist&quot; beliefs that are &quot;embedded in solutions like authoritarianism, ethnic cleansing or ethnic migration, and the establishment of separate ethno-states or enclaves along racial and ethnic lines&quot;.

== Modern debates ==
=== Terminology ===
According to Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, the modern ambiguities in the definition of far-right politics lie in the fact that the concept is generally used by political adversaries to &quot;disqualify and stigmatize all forms of partisan nationalism by reducing them to the historical experiments of Italian Fascism [and] German National Socialism.&quot; Mudde agrees and notes that &quot;the term is not only used for scientific purposes but also for political purposes. Several authors define right-wing extremism as a sort of anti-thesis against their own beliefs.&quot; While the existence of such a political position is widely accepted among scholars, figures associated with the far-right rarely accept this denomination, preferring terms like &quot;national movement&quot; or &quot;national right&quot;. There is also debate about how appropriate the labels neo-fascist or neo-Nazi are. In the words of Mudde, &quot;the labels Neo-Nazi and to a lesser extent neo-Fascism are now used exclusively for parties and groups that explicitly state a desire to restore the Third Reich or quote historical National Socialism as their ideological influence.&quot;

One issue is whether parties should be labelled radical or extreme, a distinction that is made by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany when determining whether or not a party should be banned. Within the broader family of the far right, the extreme right is revolutionary, opposing popular sovereignty and majority rule, and sometimes supporting violence, whereas the radical right is reformist, accepting free elections, but opposing fundamental elements of liberal democracy such as minority rights, rule of law, or separation of powers.

After a survey of the academic literature, Mudde concluded in 2002 that the terms &quot;right-wing extremism&quot;, &quot;right-wing populism&quot;, &quot;national populism&quot;, or &quot;neo-populism&quot; were often used as synonyms by scholars (or, nonetheless, terms with &quot;striking similarities&quot;), except notably among a few authors studying the extremist-theoretical tradition.

=== Relation to right-wing politics ===
Italian philosopher and political scientist Norberto Bobbio argues that attitudes towards equality are primarily what distinguish left-wing politics from right-wing politics on the political spectrum: &quot;the left considers the key inequalities between people to be artificial and negative, which should be overcome by an active state, whereas the right believes that inequalities between people are natural and positive, and should be either defended or left alone by the state.&quot;

Aspects of far-right ideology can be identified in the agenda of some contemporary right-wing parties: in particular, the idea that superior persons should dominate society while undesirable elements should be purged, which in extreme cases has resulted in genocides. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform in London, distinguishes between fascism and right-wing nationalist parties which are often described as far right such as the National Front in France. Mudde notes that the most successful European far-right parties in 2019 were &quot;former mainstream right-wing parties that have turned into populist radical right ones.&quot; According to historian Mark Sedgwick, &quot;[t]here is no general agreement as to where the mainstream ends and the extreme starts, and if there ever had been agreement on this, the recent shift in the mainstream would challenge it.&quot;

Proponents of the horseshoe theory interpretation of the left–right political spectrum identify the far left and the far right as having more in common with each other as extremists than each of them has with centrists or moderates. This theory has received criticism, including the argument that it has been centrists who have supported far-right and fascist regimes over socialist ones.

=== Nature of support ===
Jens Rydgren describes a number of theories as to why individuals support far-right political parties and the academic literature on this topic distinguishes between demand-side theories that have changed the &quot;interests, emotions, attitudes and preferences of voters&quot; and supply-side theories which focus on the programmes of parties, their organization and the opportunity structures within individual political systems. The most common demand-side theories are the social breakdown thesis, the relative deprivation thesis, the modernization losers thesis and the ethnic competition thesis.

The rise of far-right parties has also been viewed as a rejection of post-materialist values on the part of some voters. This theory which is known as the reverse post-material thesis blames both left-wing and progressive parties for embracing a post-material agenda (including feminism and environmentalism) that alienates traditional working class voters. Another study argues that individuals who join far-right parties determine whether those parties develop into major political players or whether they remain marginalized.

Early academic studies adopted psychoanalytical explanations for the far right&#x27;s support. The 1933 publication &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot; by Wilhelm Reich argued the theory that fascists came to power in Germany as a result of sexual repression. For some far-right parties in Western Europe, the issue of immigration has become the dominant issue among them, so much so that some scholars refer to these parties as &quot;anti-immigrant&quot; parties.

== Intellectual history ==
=== Background ===
The French Revolution in 1789 created a major shift in political thought by challenging the established ideas supporting hierarchy with new ones about universal equality and freedom. The modern left–right political spectrum also emerged during this period. Democrats and proponents of universal suffrage were located on the left side of the elected French Assembly, while monarchists seated farthest to the right.

The strongest opponents of liberalism and democracy during the 19th century, such as Joseph de Maistre and Friedrich Nietzsche, were highly critical of the French Revolution. Those who advocated a return to the absolute monarchy during the 19th century called themselves &quot;ultra-monarchists&quot; and embraced a &quot;mystic&quot; and &quot;providentialist&quot; vision of the world where royal dynasties were seen as the &quot;repositories of divine will&quot;. The opposition to liberal modernity was based on the belief that hierarchy and rootedness are more important than equality and liberty, with the latter two being dehumanizing.

=== Emergence ===
In the French public debate following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, &quot;far right&quot; was used to describe the strongest opponents of the &quot;far left&quot;, those who supported the events occurring in Russia. A number of thinkers on the far right nonetheless claimed an influence from an anti-Marxist and anti-egalitarian interpretation of socialism, based on a military comradeship that rejected Marxist class analysis, or what Oswald Spengler had called a &quot;socialism of the blood&quot;, which is sometimes described by scholars as a form of &quot;socialist revisionism&quot;. They included Charles Maurras, Benito Mussolini, Arthur Moeller van den Bruck and Ernst Niekisch. Those thinkers eventually split along nationalist lines from the original communist movement, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels contradicting nationalist theories with the idea that &quot;the working men [had] no country.&quot; The main reason for that ideological confusion can be found in the consequences of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, which according to Swiss historian Philippe Burrin had completely redesigned the political landscape in Europe by diffusing the idea of an anti-individualistic concept of &quot;national unity&quot; rising above the right and left division.

As the concept of &quot;the masses&quot; was introduced into the political debate through industrialization and the universal suffrage, a new right-wing founded on national and social ideas began to emerge, what Zeev Sternhell has called the &quot;revolutionary right&quot; and a foreshadowing of fascism. The rift between the left and nationalists was furthermore accentuated by the emergence of anti-militarist and anti-patriotic movements like anarchism or syndicalism, which shared even fewer similarities with the far right. The latter began to develop a &quot;nationalist mysticism&quot; entirely different from that on the left, and antisemitism turned into a credo of the far right, marking a break from the traditional economic &quot;anti-Judaism&quot; defended by parts of the far left, in favour of a racial and pseudo-scientific notion of alterity. Various nationalist leagues began to form across Europe like the Pan-German League or the Ligue des Patriotes, with the common goal of a uniting the masses beyond social divisions.

=== &quot;Völkisch&quot; and revolutionary right ===

The &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement emerged in the late 19th century, drawing inspiration from German Romanticism and its fascination for a medieval Reich supposedly organized into a harmonious hierarchical order. Erected on the idea of &quot;blood and soil&quot;, it was a racialist, populist, agrarian, romantic nationalist and an antisemitic movement from the 1900s onward as a consequence of a growing exclusive and racial connotation. They idealized the myth of an &quot;original nation&quot;, that still could be found at their times in the rural regions of Germany, a form of &quot;primitive democracy freely subjected to their natural elites.&quot; Thinkers led by Arthur de Gobineau, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Alexis Carrel and Georges Vacher de Lapouge distorted Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution to advocate a &quot;race struggle&quot; and an hygienist vision of the world. The purity of the bio-mystical and primordial nation theorized by the &quot;Völkischen&quot; then began to be seen as corrupted by foreign elements, Jewish in particular.

Translated in Maurice Barrès&#x27; concept of &quot;the earth and the dead&quot;, these ideas influenced the pre-fascist &quot;revolutionary right&quot; across Europe. The latter had its origin in the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; intellectual crisis and it was, in the words of Fritz Stern, the deep &quot;cultural despair&quot; of thinkers feeling uprooted within the rationalism and scientism of the modern world. It was characterized by a rejection of the established social order, with revolutionary tendencies and anti-capitalist stances, a populist and plebiscitary dimension, the advocacy of violence as a means of action and a call for individual and collective palingenesis (&quot;regeneration, rebirth&quot;).

=== Contemporary thought ===
The key thinkers of contemporary far-right politics are claimed by Mark Sedgwick to share four key elements, namely apocalyptism, fear of global elites, belief in Carl Schmitt&#x27;s friend–enemy distinction and the idea of metapolitics. The apocalyptic strain of thought begins in Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; and is shared by Julius Evola and Alain de Benoist. It continues in &quot;The Death of the West&quot; by Pat Buchanan as well as in fears over Islamization of Europe. Ernst Jünger was concerned about rootless cosmopolitan elites while de Benoist and Buchanan oppose the managerial state and Curtis Yarvin is against &quot;the Cathedral&quot;. Schmitt&#x27;s friend–enemy distinction has inspired the French Nouvelle Droite idea of ethnopluralism. 

In a 1961 book deemed influential in the European far-right at large, French neo-fascist writer Maurice Bardèche introduced the idea that fascism could survive the 20th century under a new metapolitical guise adapted to the changes of the times. Rather than trying to revive doomed regimes with their single party, secret police or public display of Caesarism, Bardèche argued that its theorists should promote the core philosophical idea of fascism regardless of its framework, i.e. the concept that only a minority, &quot;the physically saner, the morally purer, the most conscious of national interest&quot;, can represent best the community and serve the less gifted in what Bardèche calls a new &quot;feudal contract&quot;.

Another influence on contemporary far-right thought has been the Traditionalist School, which included Julius Evola, and has influenced Steve Bannon and Aleksandr Dugin, advisors to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin as well as the Jobbik party in Hungary.

== International organizations ==

During the rise of Nazi Germany, far-right international organizations began to emerge in the 1930s with the International Conference of Fascist Parties in 1932 and the Fascist International Congress in 1934. During the 1934 Fascist International Conference, the &quot;&quot; (CAUR; English: Action Committees for the Universality of Rome), created by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Regime to create a network for a &quot;Fascist International&quot;, representatives from far-right groups gathered in Montreux, Switzerland, including Romania&#x27;s Iron Guard, Norway&#x27;s Nasjonal Samling, the Greek National Socialist Party, Spain&#x27;s Falange movement, Ireland&#x27;s Blueshirts, France&#x27;s &quot;Mouvement Franciste and&quot; Portugal&#x27;s União Nacional, among others. However, no international group was fully established before the outbreak of World War II.

Following World War II, other far-right organizations attempted to establish themselves, such as the European organizations of Nouvel Ordre Européen, European Social Movement and Circulo Español de Amigos de Europa or the further-reaching World Union of National Socialists and the League for Pan-Nordic Friendship. Beginning in the 1980s, far-right groups began to solidify themselves through official political avenues.

With the founding of the European Union in 1993, far-right groups began to espouse Euroscepticism, nationalist and anti-migrant beliefs. By 2010, the Eurosceptic group European Alliance for Freedom emerged and saw some prominence during the 2014 European Parliament election. The majority of far-right groups in the 2010s began to establish international contacts with right-wing coalitions to develop a solidified platform. In 2017, Steve Bannon would create The Movement, an organization to create an international far-right group based on Aleksandr Dugin&#x27;s &quot;The Fourth Political Theory&quot;, for the 2019 European Parliament election. The European Alliance for Freedom would also reorganize into Identity and Democracy for the 2019 European Parliament election.

The far-right Spanish party Vox initially introduced the Madrid Charter project, a planned group to denounce left-wing groups in Ibero-America, to the government of United States president Donald Trump while visiting the United States in February 2019, with Santiago Abascal and Rafael Bardají using their good relations with the administration to build support within the Republican Party and establishing strong ties with American contacts. In March 2019, Abascal tweeted an image of himself wearing a morion similar to a conquistador, with &quot;ABC&quot; writing in an article detailing the document that this event provided a narrative that &quot;symbolizes in part the expansionist mood of Vox and its ideology far from Spain&quot;. The charter subsequently grew to include signers that had little to no relation to Latin America and Spanish-speaking areas. Vox has advised Javier Milei in Argentina, the Bolsonaro family in Brazil, José Antonio Kast in Chile and Keiko Fujimori in Peru.

Nationalists from Europe and the United States met at a Holiday Inn in St. Petersburg on March 22, 2015, for first convention of the International Russian Conservative Forum organized by pro-Putin Rodina-party. The event was attended by fringe right-wing extremists like Nordic Resistance Movement from Scandinavia but also by more mainstream MEPs from Golden Dawn and National Democratic Party of Germany. In addition to Rodina, Russian neo-Nazis from Russian Imperial Movement and Rusich Group were also in attendance. The event was attended by several notable American white supremacists including Jared Taylor and Brandon Russell.

==== Morocco====
Morocco saw a spread of ultranationalism, antifeminism, and opposition to immigration themes in digital spaces.

==== Rwanda ====
A number of far-right extremist and paramilitary groups carried out the Rwandan genocide under the racial supremacist ideology of Hutu Power, developed by journalist and Hutu supremacist Hassan Ngeze. On 5 July 1975, exactly two years after the 1973 Rwandan coup d&#x27;état, the far right National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) was founded under president Juvénal Habyarimana. Between 1975 and 1991, the MRND was the only legal political party in the country. It was dominated by Hutus, particularly from Habyarimana&#x27;s home region of Northern Rwanda. An elite group of MRND party members who were known to have influence on the President and his wife Agathe Habyarimana are known as the akazu, an informal organization of Hutu extremists whose members planned and lead the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Prominent Hutu businessman and member of the akazu, Félicien Kabuga was one of the genocides main financiers, providing thousands of machetes which were used to commit the genocide. Kabuga also founded Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, used to broadcast propaganda and direct the génocidaires. Kabuga was arrested in France on 16 May 2020, and charged with crimes against humanity.

===== Interahamwe =====
The Interahamwe was formed around 1990 as the youth wing of the MRND and enjoyed the backing of the Hutu Power government. The Interahamwe were driven out of Rwanda after Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front victory in the Rwandan Civil War in July 1994 and are considered a terrorist organisation by many African and Western governments. The Interahamwe and splinter groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda continue to wage an insurgency against Rwanda from neighboring countries, where they are also involved in local conflicts and terrorism. The Interahamwe were the main perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, during which an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsi, Twa and moderate Hutus were killed from April to July 1994 and the term &quot;Interahamwe&quot; was widened to mean any civilian bands killing Tutsi.

===== Coalition for the Defence of the Republic =====

Other far-right groups and paramilitaries involved included the anti-democratic segregationist Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which called for complete segregation of Hutus from Tutsis. The CDR had a paramilitary wing known as the Impuzamugambi. Together with the Interahamwe militia, the Impuzamugambi played a central role in the Rwandan genocide.

==== South Africa ====
===== Herstigte Nasionale Party =====

The far right in South Africa emerged as the Herstigte Nasionale Party (HNP) in 1969, formed by Albert Hertzog as breakaway from the predominant right-wing South African National Party, an Afrikaner ethno-nationalist party that implemented the racist, segregationist program of apartheid, the legal system of political, economic and social separation of the races intended to maintain and extend political and economic control of South Africa by the White minority. The HNP was formed after the South African National Party re-established diplomatic relations with Malawi and legislated to allow Māori players and spectators to enter the country during the 1970 New Zealand rugby union team tour in South Africa. The HNP advocated for a Calvinist, racially segregated and Afrikaans-speaking nation.

===== Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging =====

In 1973, Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche, a former police officer founded the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), a South African neo-Nazi paramilitary organisation, often described as a white supremacist group. Since its founding in 1973 by Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche and six other far-right Afrikaners, it has been dedicated to secessionist Afrikaner nationalism and the creation of an independent Boer-Afrikaner republic in part of South Africa. During negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa in the early 1990s, the organization terrorized and killed black South Africans.

==== Togo ====

Togo has been ruled by members of the Gnassingbé family and the far-right military dictatorship formerly known as the Rally of the Togolese People since 1969. Despite the legalisation of political parties in 1991 and the ratification of a democratic constitution in 1992, the regime continues to be regarded as oppressive. In 1993, the European Union cut off aid in reaction to the regime&#x27;s human-rights offenses. After&#x27;s Eyadema&#x27;s death in 2005, his son Faure Gnassingbe took over, then stood down and was re-elected in elections that were widely described as fraudulent and occasioned violence that resulted in as many as 600 deaths and the flight from Togo of 40,000 refugees. In 2012, Faure Gnassingbe dissolved the RTP and created the Union for the Republic.

Throughout the reign of the Gnassingbé family, Togo has been extremely oppressive. According to a United States Department of State report based on conditions in 2010, human rights abuses are common and include &quot;security force use of excessive force, including torture, which resulted in deaths and injuries; official impunity; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; lengthy pretrial detention; executive influence over the judiciary; infringement of citizens&#x27; privacy rights; restrictions on freedoms of press, assembly, and movement; official corruption; discrimination and violence against women; child abuse, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and sexual exploitation of children; regional and ethnic discrimination; trafficking in persons, especially women and children; societal discrimination against persons with disabilities; official and societal discrimination against homosexual persons; societal discrimination against persons with HIV; and forced labor, including by children.&quot;

=== Americas ===
==== Brazil ====

During the 1920s and 1930s, a local brand of religious fascism appeared known as Brazilian Integralism, coalescing around the party known as Brazilian Integralist Action. It adopted many characteristics of European fascist movements, including a green-shirted paramilitary organization with uniformed ranks, highly regimented street demonstrations and rhetoric against Marxism and liberalism.

Prior to World War II, the Nazi Party had been making and distributing propaganda among ethnic Germans in Brazil. The Nazi regime built close ties with Brazil through the estimated 100 thousand native Germans and 1 million German descendants living in Brazil at the time. In 1928, the Brazilian section of the Nazi Party was founded in Timbó, Santa Catarina. This section reached 2,822 members and was the largest section of the Nazi Party outside Germany. About 100 thousand born Germans and about one million descendants lived in Brazil at that time.

After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, many Nazi war criminals fled to Brazil and hid among the German-Brazilian communities. The most notable example of this was Josef Mengele, a Nazi SS officer and physician known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; for his deadly experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz II (Birkenau) concentration camp, who fled first to Argentina, then Paraguay, before finally settling in Brazil in 1960. Mengele eventually drowned in 1979 in Bertioga, on the coast of São Paulo state, without ever having been recognized in his 19 years in Brazil.

The far right has continued to operate throughout Brazil and a number of far-right parties existed in the modern era including Patriota, the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party, the Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order, the National Renewal Alliance and the Social Liberal Party as well as death squads such as the Command for Hunting Communists. Former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro was a member of the Alliance for Brazil, a far-right nationalist political group that aimed to become a political party, until 2022, when the party was disbanded. Since 2022, he is a member of the Liberal Party. Bolsonaro has been widely described by numerous media organizations as far right.

==== Guatemala ====

In Guatemala, the far-right government of Carlos Castillo Armas utilized death squads after coming to power in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état. Along with other far-right extremists, Castillo Armas started the National Liberation Movement (&quot;Movimiento de Liberación Nacional&quot;, or MLN). The founders of the party described it as the &quot;party of organized violence&quot;. The new government promptly reversed the democratic reforms initiated during the Guatemalan Revolution and the agrarian reform program (Decree 900) that was the main project of president Jacobo Arbenz Guzman and which directly impacted the interests of both the United Fruit Company and the Guatemalan landowners.

Mano Blanca, otherwise known as the Movement of Organized Nationalist Action, was set up in 1966 as a front for the MLN to carry out its more violent activities, along with many other similar groups, including the New Anticommunist Organization and the Anticommunist Council of Guatemala. Mano Blanca was active during the governments of colonel Carlos Arana Osorio and general Kjell Laugerud García and was dissolved by general Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia in 1978.

Armed with the support and coordination of the Guatemalan Armed Forces, Mano Blanca began a campaign described by the United States Department of State as one of &quot;kidnappings, torture, and summary execution.&quot; One of the main targets of Mano Blanca was the Revolutionary Party, an anti-communist group that was the only major reform oriented party allowed to operate under the military-dominated regime. Other targets included the banned leftist parties. Human rights activist Blase Bonpane described the activities of Mano Blanca as being an integral part of the policy of the Guatemalan government and by extension the policy of the United States government and the Central Intelligence Agency. Overall, Mano Blanca was responsible for thousands of murders and kidnappings, leading travel writer Paul Theroux to refer to them as &quot;Guatemala&#x27;s version of a volunteer Gestapo unit&quot;.

==== Chile ====

The National Socialist Movement of Chile (MNSCH) was created in the 1930s with the funding from the German population in Chile. In 1938, the MNSCH was dissolved after it attempted a coup and recreated itself as the Popular Freedom Alliance party, later merging with the Agrarian Party to create the Agrarian Labor Party (PAL). PAL would go through various mergers to become the , then National Action and finally the National Party.

Following the fall of Nazi Germany, many Nazis fled to Chile. The National Party supported the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état that established the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with many members assuming positions in Pinochet&#x27;s government. Pinochet headed a far-right dictatorship in Chile from 1973 to 1990. According to author Peter Levenda, Pinochet was &quot;openly pro-Nazi&quot; and used former Gestapo members to train his own Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA) personnel. Pinochet&#x27;s DINA sent political prisoners to the Chilean-German town of Colonia Dignidad, with the town&#x27;s actions being defended by the Pinochet government. The Central Intelligence Agency and Simon Wiesenthal also provided evidence of Josef Mengelethe infamous Nazi concentration camp doctor known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; for his lethal experiments on human subjectsbeing present in Colonia Dignidad. Former DINA member Michael Townley also stated that biological warfare weapons experiments occurred at the colony.

Following the end of Pinochet&#x27;s government, the National Party would split to become the more centrist National Renewal (RN), while individuals who supported Pinochet organized Independent Democratic Union (UDI). UDI is a far-right political party that was formed by former Pinochet officials. In 2019, the far-right Republican Party was founded by José Antonio Kast, a UDI politician who believed his former party criticized Pinochet too often. According to Cox and Blanco, the Republican Party appeared in Chilean politics in a similar manner to Spain&#x27;s Vox party, with both parties splitting off from an existing right wing party to collect disillusioned voters.

==== El Salvador ====
During the Salvadoran Civil War, far-right death squads known in Spanish by the name of &quot;Escuadrón de la Muerte&quot;, literally &quot;Squadron of Death, achieved notoriety when a sniper assassinated Archbishop Óscar Romero while he was saying mass in March 1980. In December 1980, three American nuns and a lay worker were gangraped and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing thousands of peasants and activists. Funding for the squads came primarily from right-wing Salvadoran businessmen and landowners.

El Salvadorian death squads indirectly received arms, funding, training and advice during the Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. Some death squads such as Sombra Negra are still operating in El Salvador.

==== Honduras ====

Honduras also had far-right death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was Battalion 3–16. Hundreds of people, teachers, politicians and union bosses were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States through the Central Intelligence Agency. At least nineteen members were School of the Americas graduates. As of mid-2006, seven members, including Billy Joya, later played important roles in the administration of President Manuel Zelaya.

Following the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis, former Battalion 3–16 member Nelson Willy Mejía Mejía became Director-General of Immigration and Billy Joya was &quot;de facto&quot; President Roberto Micheletti&#x27;s security advisor. Napoleón Nassar Herrera, another former Battalion 3–16 member, was high Commissioner of Police for the north-west region under Zelaya and under Micheletti, even becoming a Secretary of Security spokesperson &quot;for dialogue&quot; under Micheletti. Zelaya claimed that Joya had reactivated the death squad, with dozens of government opponents having been murdered since the ascent of the Michiletti and Lobo governments.

==== Mexico ====
===== National Synarchist Union =====

The largest far-right party in Mexico is the National Synarchist Union. It was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to clerical fascism and Falangism, strongly opposed to the left-wing and secularist policies of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and its predecessors that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and 2012 to 2018.

==== Peru ====

===== Fujimorism =====

During the internal conflict in Peru and a struggling presidency of Alan García, the Peruvian Armed Forces created Plan Verde, initially a coup plan that involved establishing a government that would carry out the genocide of impoverished and indigenous Peruvians, the control or censorship of media and the establishment of a neoliberal economy controlled by a military junta in Peru. Military planners also decided against the coup as they expected Mario Vargas Llosa, a neoliberal candidate, to be elected in the 1990 Peruvian general election. Vargas Llosa later reported that Anthony C. E. Quainton, the United States Ambassador to Peru, personally told him that allegedly leaked documents of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) purportedly being supportive of his opponent Alberto Fujimori were authentic, reportedly due to Fujimori&#x27;s relationship with Vladimiro Montesinos, a former National Intelligence Service (SIN) officer who was tasked with spying on the Peruvian military for the CIA. An agreement was ultimately adopted between the armed forces and Fujimori after he was inaugurated president, with the Fujimori implementing many of the objectives outlined in Plan Verde. Fujimori then established Fujimorism, an ideology with authoritarian and conservative traits that is still prevalent throughout Peru&#x27;s institutions, leading Peru through the 1992 Peruvian coup d&#x27;état until he fled to Japan in 2000 during the Vladivideos scandal. Following Alberto Fujimori&#x27;s arrest and trial, his daughter Keiko Fujimori assumed leadership of the Fujimorist movement and established Popular Force, a far-right political party. The 2016 Peruvian general election resulted with the party holding the most power in the Congress of Peru from 2016 to 2019, marking the beginning of a political crisis. Following the 2021 Peruvian general election, far-right politician Rafael López Aliaga and his party Popular Renewal rose in popularity and a far-right Congress – with the body&#x27;s largest far-right bloc being Popular Force, Popular Renewal and Advance Country – was elected into office. Following the election, La Resistencia Dios, Patria y Familia, a neofascist militant organization would promote Fujimorism and oppose President Pedro Castillo.

==== United States ====

In United States politics, the terms &quot;extreme right&quot;, &quot;far-right&quot;, and &quot;ultra-right&quot; are labels used to describe &quot;militant forms of insurgent revolutionary right ideology and separatist ethnocentric nationalism&quot;, according to &quot;The Public Eye&quot;. The terms are used for groups and movements such as Christian Identity, the Creativity Movement, the Ku Klux Klan, the National Socialist Movement, the National Alliance, the Joy of Satan Ministries, and the Order of Nine Angles. These far-right groups share conspiracist views of power which are overwhelmingly anti-Semitic and reject pluralist democracy in favour of an organic oligarchy that would unite the perceived homogeneously racial &quot;Völkish&quot; nation. The far-right in the United States is composed of various neo-fascist, neo-Nazi, white nationalist, and white supremacist organizations and networks who have been known to refer to an &quot;acceleration&quot; of racial conflict through violent means such as assassinations, murders, terrorist attacks, and societal collapse, in order to achieve the building of a white ethnostate.

===== Radical right =====
Starting in the 1870s and continuing through the late 19th century, numerous white supremacist paramilitary groups operated in the South, with the goal of organizing against and intimidating supporters of the Republican Party. Examples of such groups included the Red Shirts and the White League. The Second Ku Klux Klan, which was formed in 1915, combined Protestant fundamentalism and moralism with right-wing extremism. Its major support came from the urban South, the Midwest, and the Pacific Coast. While the Klan initially drew upper middle class support, its bigotry and violence alienated these members and it came to be dominated by less educated and poorer members.

Between the 1920s and the 1930s, the Ku Klux Klan developed an explicitly nativist, pro-Anglo-Saxon Protestant, anti-Catholic, anti-Irish, anti-Italian, and anti-Jewish stance in relation to the growing political, economic, and social uncertainty related to the arrival of European immigrants on the American soil, predominantly composed of Irish people, Italians, and Eastern European Jews. The Ku Klux Klan claimed that there was a secret Catholic army within the United States loyal to the Pope, that one million Knights of Columbus were arming themselves, and that Irish-American policemen would shoot Protestants as heretics. Their sensationalistic claims eventually developed into full-blown political conspiracy theories, to the point that the Klan claimed that Roman Catholics were planning to take Washington and put the Vatican in power and that all presidential assassinations had been carried out by Roman Catholics. The prominent Klan leader D. C. Stephenson believed in the antisemitic canard of Jewish control of finance, claiming that international Jewish bankers were behind the World War I and planned to destroy economic opportunities for Christians. Other Klansmen believed in the Jewish Bolshevism conspiracy theory and claimed that the Russian Revolution and communism were orchestrated by the Jews. They frequently reprinted parts of &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; and New York City was condemned as an evil city controlled by Jews and Roman Catholics. The objects of the Klan fear tended to vary by locale and included African Americans as well as American Roman Catholics, Jews, labour unions, liquor, Orientals, and Wobblies. They were also anti-elitist and attacked &quot;the intellectuals&quot;, seeing themselves as egalitarian defenders of the common man. During the Great Depression, there were a large number of small nativist groups, whose ideologies and bases of support were similar to those of earlier nativist groups. However, proto-fascist movements such as Huey Long&#x27;s Share Our Wealth and Charles Coughlin&#x27;s National Union for Social Justice emerged which differed from other right-wing groups by attacking big business, calling for economic reforms, and rejecting nativism. Coughlin&#x27;s group later developed a racist ideology.

During the Cold War and the Red Scares, the far right &quot;saw spies and communists influencing government and entertainment. Thus, despite bipartisan anticommunism in the United States, it was the right that mainly fought the great ideological battle against the communists.&quot; The John Birch Society, founded in 1958, is a prominent example of a far-right organization mainly concerned with anti-communism and the perceived threat of communism. Neo-Nazi militant Robert Jay Matthews of the White supremacist group The Order came to support the John Birch Society, especially when conservative icon Barry Goldwater from Arizona ran for the presidency on the Republican Party ticket. Far-right conservatives consider John Birch to be the first casualty of the Cold War. In the 1990s, many conservatives turned against then-President George H. W. Bush, who pleasured neither the Republican Party&#x27;s more moderate and far-right wings. As a result, Bush was primared by Pat Buchanan. In the 2000s, critics of President George W. Bush&#x27;s conservative unilateralism argued it can be traced to both Vice President Dick Cheney who embraced the policy since the early 1990s and to far-right Congressmen who won their seats during the conservative revolution of 1994.

Although small voluntary militias had existed in the United States throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the groups became more popular during the early 1990s, after a series of standoffs between armed citizens and federal government agents, such as the 1992 Ruby Ridge siege and 1993 Waco Siege. These groups expressed concern for what they perceived as government tyranny within the United States and generally held constitutionalist, libertarian, and right-libertarian political views, with a strong focus on the Second Amendment gun rights and tax protest. They also embraced many of the same conspiracy theories as predecessor groups on the radical right, particularly the New World Order conspiracy theory. Examples of such groups are the patriot and militia movements Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters. A minority of militia groups, such as the Aryan Nations and the Posse Comitatus, were White nationalists and saw militia and patriot movements as a form of White resistance against what they perceived to be a liberal and multiculturalist government. Militia and patriot organizations were involved in the 2014 Bundy standoff and the 2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the counter-jihad movement, supported by groups such as Stop Islamization of America and individuals such as Frank Gaffney and Pamela Geller, began to gain traction among the American right. The counter-jihad members were widely dubbed &quot;Islamophobic&quot; for their vocal criticism of the Islamic religion and its founder Muhammad, and their belief that there was a significant threat posed by Muslims living in America. Its proponents believed that the United States was under threat from &quot;Islamic supremacism&quot;, accusing the Council on American-Islamic Relations and even prominent conservatives such as Suhail A. Khan and Grover Norquist of supporting radical Islamist groups and organizations, such as the Muslim Brotherhood. The alt-right emerged during the 2016 United States presidential election cycle in support of the Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign (&quot;see&quot;: Trumpism). It draws influence from paleoconservatism, paleolibertarianism, white nationalism, the manosphere, and the Identitarian and neoreactionary movements. The alt-right differs from previous radical right movements due to its heavy internet presence on websites such as 4chan.

Chetan Bhatt, in &quot;White Extinction: Metaphysical Elements of Contemporary Western Fascism&quot;, says that &quot;The &#x27;fear of white extinction&#x27;, and related ideas of population eugenics, have travelled far and represent a wider political anxiety about &#x27;white displacement&#x27; in the US, UK, and Europe that has fuelled the right-wing phenomena referred to by that sanitizing word &#x27;populism&#x27;, a term that neatly evades attention to the racism and white majoritarianism that energizes it.&quot;

=== Asia ===
==== China ====

In the 21st century, far-right Chinese nationalism has been criticized for being used to justify oppression of the Xinjiang, Hong Kong region and a lack of human rights improvement, but full-scale ultranationalism is deemed to be unlikely. The Chinese Communist Party and its general secretary Xi Jinping have also tolerated or moved closer toward ultraconservative and Han-centric values.

Jiang Shigong is considered a major promoter of the ideas of Carl Schmitt and neoauthoritarianism in China. Some intellectuals &quot;flirted&quot; with neoconservatism and its &quot;fascistic-like characteristics&quot;, but they have not gained wide appeal.

==== India ====

Bharatiya Janata Party in India has been claimed to combine economic nationalism with religious nationalism.

==== Indonesia ====
Some islamists in Indonesia are far-right.

==== Israel ====
Kach was a radical Orthodox Jewish, religious Zionist political party in Israel, existing from 1971 to 1994. Founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1971, based on his Jewish-Orthodox-nationalist ideology subsequently known as Kahanism, which held the view that most Arabs living in Israel are enemies of Jews and Israel itself, and believed that a Jewish theocratic state, where non-Jews have no voting rights, should be created. The party secured a single seat in the Knesset in the 1984 election, but was subsequently barred from standing in elections, and both it and Kahanism organisations were banned outright in 1994 by the Israeli cabinet under 1948 anti-terrorism laws, following statements by it in support of the 1994 Cave of the Patriarchs massacre by a Kach supporter.

In 2015, the Kach party and Kahanist movement were believed to have an overlapping membership of fewer than 100 people, with links to the modern party Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, which, running on a Kahanist and anti-Arab platform, won six seats in the 2022 Israeli legislative election, having run jointly with fellow far-right parties Religious Zionist Party and Noam. The thirty-seventh government of Israel which formed after the 2022 Israeli legislative election as subsequently been critiqued as Israel&#x27;s most hardline and far-right government to date. The coalition government consists of six parties: Likud, United Torah Judaism, Shas, Otzma Yehudit, Religious Zionist Party and Noam, so having half of its coalition partners hailing from the far-right. The government has been noted for its significant shift towards far-right policies, and the appointment of controversial far-right politicians, including Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, to positions of considerable influence.

==== Japan ====

In 1996, the National Police Agency estimated that there were over 1,000 extremist right-wing groups in Japan, with about 100,000 members in total. These groups are known in Japanese as &quot;Uyoku dantai&quot;. While there are political differences among the groups, they generally carry a philosophy of anti-leftism, hostility towards China, North Korea and South Korea, and justification of Japan&#x27;s role and war crimes in World War II. &quot;Uyoku dantai&quot; groups are well known for their highly visible propaganda vehicles fitted with loudspeakers and prominently marked with the name of the group and propaganda slogans. The vehicles play patriotic or wartime-era Japanese songs. Activists affiliated with such groups have used Molotov cocktails and time bombs to intimidate moderate Japanese politicians and public figures, including former Deputy Foreign Minister Hitoshi Tanaka and Fuji Xerox Chairman Yotaro Kobayashi. An ex-member of a right-wing group set fire to Liberal Democratic Party politician Koichi Kato&#x27;s house. Koichi Kato and Yotaro Kobayashi had spoken out against Koizumi&#x27;s visits to Yasukuni Shrine. Openly revisionist, Nippon Kaigi is considered &quot;the biggest right-wing organization in Japan.&quot;

====Malaysia====
Far-right non-governmental organizations have been appropriating human rights language in Malaysia.

==== South Korea ====

Since the founding of the South Korea in 1948, authoritarian conservative dictatorships such as Syngman Rhee, Park Chung-hee, and Chun Doo-hwan have continued until 1987.

Yoon Suk Yeol, who has been sworn in as South Korea&#x27;s president since 2022, is criticized for far-right political views.

==== Taiwan (Republic of China) ====
===== Before 1992 =====

In 1947, the February 28 incident was created by the Kuomintang–led nationalist government. In the aftermath of this incident, martial law was enforced in Taiwan from 1949, and the Great Retreat took place the same year. Chiang Kai-shek ruled authoritarian conservative, anti-communist and Chinese ultranationalist. Until martial law was lifted in 1987, Taiwanese nationalists, leftists and liberals were politically suppressed.

===== After 1992 =====
In modern Taiwanese politics after 1992 Consensus, the &#x27;mainstream&#x27; political left advocated Taiwanese nationalism (including independence) and the political right defended Chinese nationalism (including unification). As a result, Taiwan&#x27;s political landscape is somewhat unique from Western countries; the &quot;far-right&quot; New Party, Patriot Alliance Association, Chinese Unification Promotion Party, and others advocate for one country, two systems, the unification policy proposed by the Chinese Communist Party. These far-right [Chinese] nationalists are sometimes referred to as &quot;radical pro-unification factions&quot; (). By contrast, most politicians in the centre-right conservative Kuomintang after Taiwanese democratization are reject one country, two systems.

Some radical Taiwanese nationalists are also considered far-right: the Taiwan Statebuilding Party is officially a &quot;left-wing&quot; in support of Taiwanese independence, but is also referred to as &quot;far-right&quot; due to anti-Chinese nativism; the Taiwanese Localism Front, a radical anti-communist organization, is also referred to as the &quot;far-right&quot;.

=== Europe ===
==== Armenia ====
The Armenian-Aryan Racialist Political Movement and the Adequate Party are the main far-right political movements in Armenia.

==== Croatia ====

Individuals and groups in Croatia that employ far-right politics are most often associated with the historical Ustaše movement, hence they have connections to neo-Nazism and neo-fascism. That World War II political movement was an extremist organization at the time supported by the German Nazis and the Italian Fascists. The association with the Ustaše has been called neo-Ustashism by Slavko Goldstein. Most active far-right political parties in Croatia openly state their continuity with the Ustaše. These include the Croatian Party of Rights and Authentic Croatian Party of Rights. Croatia&#x27;s far-right often advocates the false theory that the Jasenovac concentration camp was a &quot;labour camp&quot; where mass murder did not take place.

The coalition led by Miroslav Škoro&#x27;s far-right Homeland Movement came third at the 2020 parliamentary election, winning 10.9% of the vote and 16 seats.

==== Estonia ====

Estonia&#x27;s most significant far-right movement was the Vaps movement. Its ideological predecessor Valve Liit was founded by Admiral Johan Pitka and later banned for maligning the government. The organization became politicized quickly Vaps soon turned into a mass fascist movement. In 1933, Estonians voted on Vaps&#x27; proposed changes to the constitution and the party later won a large proportion of the vote. However, the State Elder Konstantin Päts declared state of emergency and imprisoned the leadership of the Vaps. In 1935, all political parties were banned. In 1935, a Vaps coup attempt was discovered, which led to the banning of the Finnish Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement&#x27;s youth wing that had been secretly aiding and arming them.
During World War II, the Estonian Self-Administration was a collaborationist pro-Nazi government set up in Estonia, headed by Vaps member Hjalmar Mäe. In the 21st century, the coalition-governing Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia been described as far right. The neo-Nazi terrorist organization Feuerkrieg Division was found and operates in the country, with some members of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia having been linked to the Feuerkrieg Division. The party&#x27;s youth organisation Blue Awakening organises an annual torchlight march through Tallinn on Estonia&#x27;s Independence Day. The event has been harshly criticized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center that described it as &quot;Nuremberg-esque&quot; and likened the ideology of the participants to that of the Estonian Nazi collaborators.

==== Finland ====
In Finland, support for the far right was most widespread between 1920 and 1940 when the Academic Karelia Society, Lapua Movement, Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement and Vientirauha operated in the country and had hundreds of thousands of members. Far-right groups exercised considerable political power during this period, pressuring the government to outlaw communist parties and newspapers and expel Freemasons from the armed forces. During the Cold War, all parties deemed fascist were banned according to the Paris Peace Treaties and all former fascist activists had to find new political homes. Despite Finlandization, many continued in public life. Three former members of the Waffen SS served as ministers of defense; Sulo Suorttanen and Pekka Malinen as well as Mikko Laaksonen.
The skinhead culture gained momentum during the late 1980s and peaked during the late 1990s. Numerous hate crimes were committed against refugees, including a number of racially motivated murders.

Today, the most prominent neo-Nazi group is the Nordic Resistance Movement, which is tied to multiple murders, attempted murders and assaults of political enemies was found in 2006 and proscribed in 2019. Prominent far-right parties include the Blue-and-Black Movement and Power Belongs to the People. The second biggest Finnish party, the Finns Party, has been described as far right. The former leader of the Finns party and current speaker of the Parliament Jussi Halla-aho, has been convicted of hate speech due to his comments stating that, &quot;Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile and Islam justifies pedophilia and Pedophilia was Allah&#x27;s will.&quot; Finns Party members have frequently supported far-right and neo-Nazi movements such as the Finnish Defense League, Soldiers of Odin, Nordic Resistance Movement, Rajat Kiinni (Close the Borders), and Suomi Ensin (Finland First). &quot; In the 1990s and 2000s, before the breakthrough of the Finns Party, a few neo-Nazi candidates enjoyed success, like Janne Kujala of Finland - Fatherland (founded as Aryan Germanic Brotherhood) and Jouni Lanamäki who was previously associated with the Nordic Reich Party. Pekka Siitoin of the National Democracy Party was the fifth most popular candidate in Naantali city council elections.

The NRM and Finns party and other far-right groups organize an annual torch march demonstration in Helsinki in memory of the Finnish SS-battalion on the Finnish independence day which ends at the Hietaniemi cemetery where members visit the tomb of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim and the monument to the Finnish SS Battalion. The event is protested by antifascists, leading to counterdemonstrators being violently assaulted by NRM members who act as security. The demonstration attracts close to 3,000 participants according to the estimates of the police and hundreds of officers patrol Helsinki to prevent violent clashes.

==== France ====
The largest far-right party in Europe is the French anti-immigration party National Rally, formally known as the National Front. The party was founded in 1972, uniting a variety of French far-right groups under the leadership of Jean-Marie Le Pen. Since 1984, it has been the major force of French nationalism. Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s daughter Marine Le Pen was elected to succeed him as party leader in 2012. Under Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s leadership, the party sparked outrage for hate speech, including Holocaust denial and Islamophobia.

==== Germany ====
In 1945, the Allied powers took control of Germany and banned the swastika, Nazi Party and the publication of . Explicitly Nazi and neo-Nazi organizations are banned in Germany. In 1960, the West German parliament voted unanimously to &quot;make it illegal to incite hatred, to provoke violence, or to insult, ridicule or defame &#x27;parts of the population&#x27; in a manner apt to breach the peace.&quot; German law outlaws anything that &quot;approves of, glorifies or justifies the violent and despotic rule of the National Socialists.&quot; Section 86a of the &quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot; (Criminal Code) outlaws any &quot;use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations&quot; outside the contexts of &quot;art or science, research or teaching&quot;. The law primarily outlaws the use of Nazi symbols, flags, insignia, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. In the 21st century, the German far right consists of various small parties and two larger groups, namely Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Pegida. In March 2021, the Germany domestic intelligence agency Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution placed the AfD under surveillance, the first time in the post-war period that a main opposition party had been subjected to such scrutiny.

==== Greece ====
===== Metaxism =====
The far right in Greece first came to power under the ideology of Metaxism, a proto-fascist ideology developed by dictator Ioannis Metaxas. Metaxism called for the regeneration of the Greek nation and the establishment of an ethnically homogeneous state. Metaxism disparaged liberalism, and held individual interests to be subordinate to those of the nation, seeking to mobilize the Greek people as a disciplined mass in service to the creation of a &quot;new Greece&quot;.

The Metaxas government and its official doctrines are often compared to conventional totalitarian-conservative dictatorships such as Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spain or António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s Portugal. The Metaxist government derived its authority from the conservative establishment and its doctrines strongly supported traditional institutions such as the Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek Royal Family; essentially reactionary, it lacked the radical theoretical dimensions of ideologies such as Italian Fascism and German Nazism.

===== Axis occupation of Greece and aftermath =====
The Metaxis regime came to an end after the Axis powers invaded Greece. The Axis occupation of Greece began in April 1941. The occupation ruined the Greek economy and brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population. The Jewish population of Greece was nearly eradicated. Of its pre-war population of 75–77,000, only around 11–12,000 survived, either by joining the resistance or being hidden. Following the short-lived interim government of Georgios Papandreou, the military seized power in Greece during the 1967 Greek coup d&#x27;état, replacing the interim government with the right-wing United States-backed Greek junta. The Junta was a series of military juntas that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974. The dictatorship was characterised by right-wing cultural policies, restrictions on civil liberties and the imprisonment, torture and exile of political opponents. The junta&#x27;s rule ended on 24 July 1974 under the pressure of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, leading to the Metapolitefsi (&quot;regime change&quot;) to democracy and the establishment of the Third Hellenic Republic.

Until 2019, the dominant far-right party in Greece in the 21st century was the neo-Nazi and Mataxist inspired Golden Dawn. At the May 2012 Greek legislative election, Golden Dawn won 21 seats in the Hellenic Parliament, receiving 6.97% of the vote. It became the third largest party in the Greek Parliament with 17 seats after the January 2015 election, winning 6.28% of the vote.

Founded by Nikolaos Michaloliakos, Golden Dawn had its origins in the movement that worked towards a return to right-wing military dictatorship in Greece. Following an investigation into the 2013 murder of Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, by a supporter of the party, Michaloliakos and several other Golden Dawn parliamentarians and members were arrested and held in pre-trial detention on suspicion of forming a criminal organization. The trial began on 20 April 2015 and eventually led to the conviction of 7 of its leaders for heading a criminal organisation and 61 other defendants for participating in a criminal organisation. Guilty verdicts on charges of murder, attempted murder, and violent attacks on immigrants and left-wing political opponents were also delivered and prison sentences of a combined total of over 500 years were handed out.

Golden Dawn later lost all of its remaining seats in the Greek Parliament in the 2019 Greek legislative election, and a 2020 survey showed the party&#x27;s popularity plummeting to just 1.5%, down from 2.9% in previous year&#x27;s elections. This means that the largest party in Greece that is considered right wing to far right is Greek Solution, which has been described as ideologically ultranationalist and right-wing populist. The party garnered 3.7% of the vote in the 2019 Greek legislative election, winning 10 out of the 300 seats in the Hellenic Parliament and 4.18% of the vote in the 2019 European Parliament election in Greece, winning one seat in the European Parliament.

==== Italy ====

The far right has maintained a continuous political presence in Italy since the fall of Mussolini. The neo-fascist party Italian Social Movement (1946–1995), influenced by the previous Italian Social Republic (1943–1945), became one of the chief reference points for the European far-right from the end of World War II until the late 1980s.

Silvio Berlusconi and his party dominated politics from 1994. According to some scholars, it gave neo-fascism a new respectability. Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, great-grandson of Benito Mussolini, stood for the 2019 European Parliament election as a member of the far right Brothers of Italy party. In 2011, it was estimated that the neo-fascist CasaPound party had 5,000 members. The name is derived from the fascist poet Ezra Pound. It has also been influenced by the Manifesto of Verona, the Labour Charter of 1927 and social legislation of fascism. There has been collaboration between CasaPound and the identitarian movement.

The European migrant crisis has become an increasingly divisive issue in Italy. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has been courting far-right voters. His Northern League party has become an anti-immigrant, nationalist movement. Both parties are using Mussolini nostalgia to further their aims.

==== Netherlands ====

Despite being neutral, the Netherlands was invaded by Nazi Germany on 10 May 1940 as part of Fall Gelb. About 70% of the country&#x27;s Jewish population were killed during the occupation, a much higher percentage than comparable countries such as Belgium and France. Most of the south of the country was liberated in the second half of 1944. The rest, especially the west and north of the country still under occupation, suffered from a famine at the end of 1944 known as the Hunger Winter. On 5 May 1945, the whole country was finally liberated by the total surrender of all German forces. Since the end of World War II, the Netherlands has had a number of small far-right groups and parties, the largest and most successful being the Party for Freedom led by Geert Wilders. Other far-right Dutch groups include the neo-Nazi Dutch People&#x27;s Union (1973–present), the Centre Party (1982–1986), the Centre Party &#x27;86 (1986–1998), the Dutch Block (1992–2000), New National Party (1998–2005) and the ultranationalist National Alliance (2003–2007).

==== Poland ====
Following the collapse of Communist Poland, a number of far-right groups came to prominence including The National Revival of Poland, the European National Front, the Association for Tradition and Culture &quot;Niklot&quot;. The All-Polish Youth and National Radical Camp were recreated in 1989 and 1993, respectively becoming Poland&#x27;s most prominent far-right organizations. In 1995, the Anti-Defamation League estimated the number of far-right and white power skinheads in Poland at 2,000. Since late 2000s smaller fascist groups have merged to form the neo-Nazi Autonome Nationalisten. A number of far-right parties have run candidates in elections including the League of Polish Families, the National Movement with limited success.

In 2019, the Confederation Liberty and Independence had the best performance of any far-right coalition to date, earning 1,256,953 votes which was 6.81% of the total vote in an election that saw a historically high turnout. Members of far-right groups make up a significant portion of those taking part in the annual Independence March in central Warsaw which started in 2009 to mark Independence Day. About 60,000 were in the 2017 march marking the 99th anniversary of independence, with placards such as &quot;Clean Blood&quot; seen on the march.

==== Romania ====

The preeminent far-right party in Romania is the Greater Romania Party, founded in 1991 by Tudor, who was formerly known as a &quot;court poet&quot; of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and his literary mentor, the writer Eugen Barbu, one year after Tudor launched the &quot;România Mare&quot; weekly magazine, which remains the most important propaganda tool of the PRM. Tudor subsequently launched a companion daily newspaper called &quot;Tricolorul&quot;. The historical expression &quot;Greater Romania&quot; refers to the idea of recreating the former Kingdom of Romania which existed during the interwar period. Having been the largest entity to bear the name of &quot;Romania&quot;, the frontiers were marked with the intent of uniting most territories inhabited by ethnic Romanians into a single country and it is now a rallying cry for Romanian nationalists. Due to internal conditions under Communist Romania after World War II, the expression&#x27;s use was forbidden in publications until after the Romanian Revolution in 1989. The party&#x27;s initial success was partly attributed to the deep rootedness of Ceaușescu&#x27;s national communism in Romania.

Both the ideology and the main political focus of the Greater Romania Party are reflected in frequently strongly nationalistic articles written by Tudor. The party has called for the outlawing of the ethnic Hungarian party, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, for allegedly plotting the secession of Transylvania.

==== Russia ====

The period of development of Russian fascism in the 1930s–1940s was characterized by sympathy for Italian fascism and German Nazism and pronounced anti-communism and antisemitism.
Russian fascism has its roots in the movements known in history as the Black Hundreds and the White movement. It was distributed among white émigré circles living in Germany, Manchukuo, and the United States. In Germany and the United States (unlike Manchukuo), they practically did not conduct political activity, limiting themselves to the publication of newspapers and brochures.

Some ideologues of the white movement, such as Ivan Ilyin and Vasily Shulgin, welcomed the coming to power of Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Germany, offering their comrades-in-arms the fascist &quot;method&quot; as a way to fight socialism, communism, and godlessness. At the same time, they did not deny fascist political repression and antisemitism and even justified them.

With the outbreak of World War II, Russian fascists in Germany supported Nazi Germany and joined the ranks of Russian collaborators.

Some Russian neo-Nazi organizations are part of the international World Union of National Socialists (WUNS, founded in 1962). As of 2012, six Russian organizations are among the officially registered members of the union: National Resistance, National Socialist Movement – Russian Division, All-Russian Public Patriotic Movement &quot;Russian National Unity&quot;, National Socialist Movement &quot;Slavic Union&quot; (prohibited by a court decision in June 2010), and others. The following organizations are not included in WUNS: the National Socialist Society (banned by a court decision in 2010), the Russian All-National Union (banned in September 2011), and others, such as skinheads: Legion Werewolf (liquidated in 1996), Schultz-88 (liquidated in 2006), White Wolves (liquidated in 2008–2010), New Order (ceased to exist), Russian goal (ceased to exist), and others. Some of the more radical neo-Nazi organizations, using terrorist methods, belonged to skinhead groups such as the Werewolf Legion (liquidated in 1996), Schultz-88 (liquidated in 2006), White Wolves (liquidated in 2008–2010), New Order (ceased to exist), &quot;Russian Goal&quot; (ceased to exist), and others.

Until the end of the 1990s, one of the largest parties of Russian national extremists was the neo-Nazi socio-political movement &quot;Russian National Unity&quot; (RNE), founded by Alexander Barkashov in 1990. At the end of 1999, the RNE made an unsuccessful attempt to take part in the elections to the State Duma. Barkashov considered &quot;true Orthodoxy&quot; as a fusion of Christianity with paganism and advocated the &quot;Russian God&quot; and the &quot;Aryan swastika&quot; allegedly associated with it. He wrote about the Atlanteans, the Etruscans, and the &quot;Aryan&quot; civilization as the direct predecessors of the Russian nation, in a centuries-old struggle with the &quot;Semites&quot;, the &quot;world Jewish conspiracy&quot;, and the &quot;dominance of the Jews in Russia&quot;. The symbol of the movement was a modified swastika. Barkashov was a parishioner of the &quot;True Orthodox (&quot;Catacomb&quot;) Church&quot;, and the first cells of the RNE were formed as brotherhoods and communities of the RTOC.

The ideology of Russian neo-Nazism is closely connected with the ideology of Slavic neo-paganism (rodnovery). In a number of cases, there are also organizational ties between neo-Nazis and neo-pagans. One of the founders of Russian neo-paganism, the former dissident Alexey Dobrovolsky (pagan name – Dobroslav) shared the ideas of Nazism and transferred them to his neo-pagan teaching. Modern Russian neo-paganism took shape in the second half of the 1970s and is associated with the activities of Dobrovolsky and Moscow Arabist Valery Yemelyanov (neo-pagan name – Velemir), both supporters of antisemitism. Rodnoverie is a popular religion among Russian skinheads. These skinheads, however, do not usually practice their religion.

Historian Dmitry Shlapentokh wrote that, as in Europe, neo-paganism in Russia pushes some of its adherents to antisemitism. This antisemitism is closely related to negative attitudes towards Asians, and this emphasis on racial factors can lead neo-pagans to neo-Nazism. The tendency of neo-pagans to antisemitism is a logical development of the ideas of neo-paganism and imitation of the Nazis, and is also a consequence of a number of specific conditions of modern Russian politics. Unlike previous regimes, the modern Russian political regime, as well as the ideology of the middle class, combines support for Orthodoxy with philosemitism and a positive attitude towards Muslims. These features of the regime contributed to the formation of specific views of neo-Nazi neo-pagans, which are represented to a large extent among the socially unprotected and marginalized Russian youth. In their opinion, power in Russia was usurped by a cabal of conspirators, including hierarchs of the Orthodox Church, Jews, and Muslims. Contrary to external differences, it is believed that these forces have united in their desire to maintain power over the Russian &quot;Aryans&quot;.

==== Serbia ====
In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, multiple far-right organizations and parties operated during the late Interwar period such as the Yugoslav National Movement (Zbor), Yugoslav Radical Union (JRZ) and Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists (ORJUNA). Zbor was headed by Dimitrije Ljotić, who during the World War II collaborated with the Axis powers. Ljotić was a supporter of Italian fascism, and he advocated for the establishment of a centralized Yugoslav state that would be dominated by Serbs, and a return to Christian traditions. Zbor was the only registered political party in Yugoslavia that openly promoted antisemitism and xenophobia. JRZ was registered as a political party in 1934 by Milan Stojadinović, a right-wing politician who expressed his support towards Italian fascism during his premiership. JRZ was initially a coalition made up of Stojadinović&#x27;s, Anton Korošec&#x27;s and Mehmed Spaho&#x27;s supporters, and the party was the main stronghold for Yugoslav ethnic nationalists and supporters of Karađorđević dynasty. ORJUNA was a prominent organization in the 1920s that was influenced by fascism. During World War II, Chetniks, an ethnic ultranationalist movement rose to prominence. Chetniks were staunchly anti-communist and they supported monarchism and the creation of a Greater Serbian state. They, including their leader Draža Mihailović, extensively collaborated with the Axis powers in the second half of the World War II against their common enemy, the Yugoslav Partisans.

After the re-establishment of the multi-party system in Serbia in 1990, multiple right-wing movements and parties began getting popularity from which the Serbian Radical Party was the most successful. Vojislav Šešelj, who founded the party, promoted popular notions of &quot;international conspiracy against the Serbs&quot; during the 1990s which gained him popularity in the 1992 and 1997 election. During the 1990s, SRS has been also described as neofascist due to their vocal support of ethnic ultranationalism and irredentism. Its popularity went into decline after the 2008 election when its acting leader Tomislav Nikolić seceded from the party to form the Serbian Progressive Party. Besides SRS, during the 2000s multiple neofascist and Neo-Nazi movements began getting popular, such as Nacionalni stroj, Obraz and 1389 Movement. Dveri, an organization turned political party, was also a prominent promoter of far-right content, and they were mainly known for their clerical-fascist, socially conservative and anti-Western stances. Since 2019, the far-right Serbian Party Oathkeepers has gained popularity mainly due to their ultranationalist views, including the openly neofascist Leviathan Movement.

==== Slovenia ====
==== Spain ====
==== United Kingdom ====

The British far-right rose out of the fascist movement. In 1932, Oswald Mosley founded the British Union of Fascists (BUF) which was banned during World War II. Founded in 1954 by A. K. Chesterton, the League of Empire Loyalists became the main British far-right group at the time. It was a pressure group rather than a political party, and did not contest elections. Most of its members were part of the Conservative Party and were known for politically embarrassing stunts at party conferences. Other fascist parties included the White Defence League and the National Labour Party who merged in 1960 to form the second British National Party (BNP).

With the decline of the British Empire becoming inevitable, British far-right parties turned their attention to internal matters. The 1950s had seen an increase in immigration to the UK from its former colonies, particularly India, Pakistan, the Caribbean and Uganda. Led by John Bean and Andrew Fountaine, the BNP opposed the admittance of these people to the UK. A number of its rallies such as one in 1962 in Trafalgar Square ended in race riots. After a few early successes, the party got into difficulties and was destroyed by internal arguments. In 1967 it joined forces with John Tyndall and the remnants of Chesterton&#x27;s League of Empire Loyalists to form Britain&#x27;s largest far-right organisation, the National Front (NF). The BNP and the NF supported extreme loyalism in Northern Ireland, and attracted Conservative Party members who had become disillusioned after Harold Macmillan had recognised the right to independence of the African colonies and had criticised Apartheid in South Africa.

Some Northern Irish loyalist paramilitaries have links with far-right and neo-Nazi groups in Britain, including Combat 18, the British National Socialist Movement and the NF. In 2004, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that loyalist paramilitaries had been responsible for numerous racist attacks in loyalist areas. During the 1970s, the NF&#x27;s rallies became a regular feature of British politics. Election results remained strong in a few working-class urban areas, with a number of local council seats won, but the party never came anywhere near winning representation in parliament.

Since the 1970s, the NF&#x27;s support has been in decline whilst Nick Griffin and the current British National Party (BNP) grew in popularity. Around the turn of the 21st century, the BNP won a number of council seats. At its peak in the late 2000s, the party had 54 local council seats, one seat in the London Assembly, two seats in the European Parliament, and were the official opposition in the Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council. The party received almost a million votes in the 2009 European Parliament elections, and contested the majority of UK parliamentary seats in the 2010 general election. The party&#x27;s membership was 12,632 and its financial resources were an estimated £1,983,947. By the early 2010s the BNP saw its support and membership quickly collapse due to internal divisions caused by a disappointing performance in the 2010 elections. Griffin was ousted as leader in 2014 after losing his European Parliament seat, and since then the party has been in terminal decline under the leadership of Adam Walker.

A number of breakaway groups have been established by former members of the BNP, such as Britain First by ex-councillor Paul Golding, the British Democrats by ex-MEP and leadership candidate Andrew Brons, as well as Patriotic Alternative by Mark Collett. UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage claimed that his party absorbed much of the BNP&#x27;s former voters during their electoral peak in the early 2010s. The party was accused of shifting towards far-right, anti-Islam politics under the leadership of Paul Nuttall and Gerard Batten during its decline in the late 2010s. Anti-Islam activist and former UKIP leadership candidate Anne Marie Waters established the far-right For Britain Movement, which gained a small number of ex-BNP councillors. It was deregistered in 2022, and subsequently a large portion of prominent far-right activists began coalescing around the British Democrats, which (following UKIP&#x27;s loss of its few councillors on 4 May 2023, leaving it with only a few parish and town councillors) quickly established itself as the UK&#x27;s only far-right party with any electoral representation.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====
Coming to prominence in Sydney with the formation of the New Guard (1931) and the Centre Party (1933), the far right has played a part in Australian political discourse since the second world war. These proto-fascist groups were monarchist, anti-communist and authoritarian in nature. Early far-right groups were followed by the explicitly fascist Australia First Movement (1941). The far right in Australia went on to acquire more explicitly racial connotations during the 1960s and 1970s, morphing into self-proclaimed Nazi, fascist and antisemitic movements, organisations that opposed non-white and non-Christian immigration such as the neo-Nazi National Socialist Party of Australia (1967) and the militant white supremacist group National Action (1982).

Since the 1980s, the term has mainly been used to describe those who express the wish to preserve what they perceive to be Judeo-Christian, Anglo-Australian culture and those who campaign against Aboriginal land rights, multiculturalism, immigration and asylum seekers. Since 2001, Australia has seen the development of modern neo-Nazi, neo-fascist or alt-right groups such as the True Blue Crew, the United Patriots Front, Fraser Anning&#x27;s Conservative National Party and the Antipodean Resistance.

==== New Zealand ====

A small number of far-right organisations have existed in New Zealand since World War II, including the Conservative Front, the New Zealand National Front and the National Democrats Party. Far-right parties in New Zealand lack significant support, with their protests often dwarfed by counter protest. After the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019, the National Front &quot;publicly shut up shop&quot; and largely went underground like other far-right groups.

==== Fiji ====
===== Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party =====

The Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party was a far-right political party which advocated Fijian ethnic nationalism. In 2009, party leader Iliesa Duvuloco was arrested for breaching the military regime&#x27;s emergency laws by distributing pamphlets calling for an uprising against the military regime. In January 2013, the military regime introduced regulations that essentially de-registered the party.

===Pan-national===
==== European Union ====
The development of a pan-European identity among far-right members of the European parliament has been claimed.

==== Islamic extremism ====
Some Islamic extremists view Islam superior to all other ideologies and non-Muslims as inferior. Some Islamic extremism can be seen as far-right, and can have some social acceptance in some countries. Dhimmi refers to the inferior status of non-Muslims in some historic Islamic states.

== Online ==
A number of far-right internet pages and forums are focused on and frequented by the far right. These include Stormfront and Iron March.

Far-right internet movements gained popularity and notoriety online in 2012, and this has not stopped. In the United States, they gained many followers during the 2016 presidential election, the time after the election during Obama&#x27;s last months in office in 2016, and in 2017.

=== Stormfront ===

Stormfront is the oldest and most prominent neo-Nazi website, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center and other media organizations as the &quot;murder capital of the internet&quot;. In August 2017, Stormfront was taken offline for just over a month when its registrar seized its domain name due to complaints that it promoted hatred and that some of its members were linked to murder. The Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law claimed credit for the action after advocating for Stormfront&#x27;s web host, Network Solutions, to enforce its Terms of Service agreement which prohibits users from using its services to incite violence.

=== Iron March ===

Iron March was a fascist web forum founded in 2011 by Russian nationalist Alexander &quot;Slavros&quot; Mukhitdinov. An unknown individual uploaded a database of Iron March users to the Internet Archive in November 2019 and multiple neo-Nazi users were identified, including an ICE detention center captain and several active members of the United States Armed Forces. As of mid 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Center linked Iron March to nearly 100 murders. Mukhitdinov remained a murky figure at the time of the leaks.

=== Terrorgram ===

The Terrorgram community on Telegram is a network of Telegram channels and accounts that subscribe to and promote militant accelerationism. Terrorgram channels are neofascist in ideology, and regularly share instructions and manuals on how to carry out acts of racially-motivated violence and anti-government, anti-authority terrorism. In 2021, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), an international think-tank, exposed more than two hundred neo-Nazi pro-terrorism telegram channels that make up the Terrorgram network, many of which contained instructions to build weapons and bombs.

== Right-wing terrorism ==
Right-wing terrorism is terrorism motivated by a variety of far right ideologies and beliefs, including anti-communism, neo-fascism, neo-Nazism, racism, xenophobia and opposition to immigration. This type of terrorism has been sporadic, with little or no international cooperation. Modern right-wing terrorism first appeared in western Europe in the 1980s and it first appeared in Eastern Europe following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Right-wing terrorists aim to overthrow governments and replace them with nationalist or fascist-oriented governments. The core of this movement includes neo-fascist skinheads, far-right hooligans, youth sympathisers and intellectual guides who believe that the state must rid itself of foreign elements in order to protect rightful citizens. However, they usually lack a rigid ideology.

According to Cas Mudde, far-right terrorism and violence in the West have been generally perpetrated in recent times by individuals or groups of individuals &quot;who have at best a peripheral association&quot; with politically relevant organizations of the far right. Nevertheless, Mudde follows, &quot;in recent years far-right violence has become more planned, regular, and lethal, as terrorists attacks in Christchurch (2019), Pittsburgh (2018), and Norway (2011) show.&quot;

<text>A stomach rumble, also known as a bowel sound, peristaltic sound, abdominal sound, bubble gut or borborygmus (pronounced ; plural borborygmi), is a rumbling, growling or gurgling noise produced by movement of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract as they are propelled through the small intestine by a series of muscle contractions called peristalsis. A trained healthcare provider can listen to these intestinal noises with a stethoscope, but they may be audible enough to be heard with the naked ear as the fluid and gas move forward in the intestines (in the vicinity of, but not actually within the stomach). The lack of bowel sounds is indicative of ileus, intestinal obstruction, or some other serious pathology.

==Etymology==
The scientific name borborygmus is related to the 16th-century French word &quot;borborygme&quot;, itself from Latin, ultimately from Ancient Greek βορβορυγμός (&quot;borborygmós&quot;). The Greek term is probably onomatopoetic in origin.

== Other causes ==
Other causes of stomach rumbles:
* Incomplete digestion of food can lead to excess gas in the intestine. In humans, this can be due to incomplete digestion of carbohydrate-containing foods, including milk and other dairy products (lactose intolerance or the use of α-glucosidase inhibitors by diabetics), gluten (protein in wheat, barley, and rye) (coeliac disease), fruit, vegetables, beans, legumes, and high-fiber whole grains. In rare instances, excessive abdominal noise may be a sign of digestive disease, especially when accompanied by abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation. Some examples of diseases that may be associated with this symptom include carcinoid neoplasm and coeliac sprue.
* Louder rumbles may occur when the individual is hungry. The sound of air moving around the lumen of the stomach is amplified by the empty space. Around two hours after the stomach has been emptied, it sends signals to the brain, which tells the digestive muscles to restart peristalsis in a wave called the migrating motor complex. Food left behind after the first cycle is swept up, and the vibrations of the empty stomach produce the physical sensation of hunger. Appetite also plays a big role in this situation. Peristalsis recurs about every hour, and one&#x27;s appetite may cause 10- to 20-minute food cravings.
* Stomach rumbles can form further along the gastrointestinal system when air is swallowed while talking, eating, and drinking. This phenomenon occurs in most people and is typical. Stomach rumbles may also occur due to carbon dioxide moving through the stomach and intestines following the consumption of carbonated drinks.

==Diseases and conditions==
* Celiac disease is a condition that prevents the small intestine from absorbing parts of food that are needed to stay healthy. Consuming food containing gluten is dangerous for people with this disease: Intestinal villi help to absorb nutrients from food, but when gluten is consumed, the immune system attacks these villi as a result. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, and bulky or foul smelling stools.
* Colitis is swelling of the large intestine. The many different forms of colitis include cytomegalovirus or &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; infection, and necrotizing and pseudomembranous colitis. The usual causes of colitis are infection and lack of blood flow. Symptoms may include bloody stools, chills, dehydration, diarrhea, and fever.
* Diverticulitis is a condition where small bulging sacs, usually found in the large intestine, become inflamed or infected. The most probable cause is a low-fiber diet, possibly a result of eating processed food. Diverticulitis is usually seen in about half the American population over the age of 60. Symptoms may include bloating, fever, and nausea.
* Irritable bowel syndrome, a disorder in the lower intestinal tract, is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. It is more common in women and it usually occurs during early adulthood. There are many risk factors such as emotional stress and a low-fiber diet. These can all cause stomach disorders.

==Nonmedical usage==
The word &quot;borborygmic&quot; has been used in literature to describe noisy plumbing. In &quot;Ada&quot;, Vladimir Nabokov wrote: &quot;All the toilets and waterpipes in the house had been suddenly seized with borborygmic convulsions&quot;.
In &quot;A Long Way Down&quot; (New York: Harper, 1959, p. 54), Elizabeth Fenwick wrote: &quot;The room was very quiet, except for its borborygmic old radiator&quot;.
Graham Greene&#x27;s short story &quot;Alas, Poor Maling&quot; tells the tale of a luckless individual whose borborygmus takes the form of irritating noises that he has recently heard.

The word &quot;borborygmus&quot; has also been used in journalism to describe political turbulence. In an article in The Atlantic, Graeme Wood used the word to describe the effects of mass refugee migration into Europe: &quot;Central Europe had to digest a massive refugee flow from Syria and Afghanistan, and the resulting borborygmus upended European politics and enabled a populist wave that has yet to crest.&quot;

<doc id="221223" wikidata="Q1640717" url="?curid=221223" title="Ecclesiastical court">
<text>An ecclesiastical court, also called court Christian or court spiritual, is any of certain non-adversarial courts conducted by church-approved officials having jurisdiction mainly in spiritual or religious matters. Historically, they interpret or apply canon law, a basis of which was the of Justinian, which is also considered the source of the civil law legal tradition.

In the Middle Ages, these courts had much wider powers in many areas of Europe than after the development of nation states, including family law, equitable relief, probate, and cases involving priests or religious or public heretics. 

== Medieval courts ==
Secular courts in medieval times were numerous and decentralized: each secular division (king, prince, duke, lord, abbot or bishop as landholder, manor, city, forest, market, etc.) could have their own courts, customary law, bailiffs and gaols with arbitrary and unrecorded procedures, including in Northern Europe trial by combat and trial by ordeal, and in England trial by jury.

Ecclesiastical courts generally followed the better regulated inquisition, accusation or denunciation judicial procedures. In medieval times, they had a very wide jurisdiction including family law and dowry disputes, probate, equity, defamation, failure to observe holy days, and cases involving priests and religious communities and individuals or public heretics.

In Britain, secular courts that took over the functions of the Ecclesiastic courts, e.g. in family law, are still known as &quot;Courts Ecclesiastical&quot; as distinct from &quot;Courts Temporal&quot;.

==Catholic Church (Modern)==
The tribunals of the Catholic Church are governed by the 1983 Code of Canon Law in the case of the Western Church (Latin Church), and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches in the case of the Eastern Catholic Churches (Byzantine, Ukrainian, Maronite, Melkite, etc.). Both systems of canon law underwent general revisions in the late 20th century, resulting in the new code for the Latin Church in 1983, and the compilation for the first time of the Eastern Code in 1990.

===First instance ===

Cases normally originate in the tribunal of the particular church (i.e. the diocese or eparchy) of the parties to the case. This tribunal in canon law is called the &quot;tribunal of first instance&quot;. The bishop of the church possesses the power to judge for his church; however, since the bishop has many different duties in his diocese, most cases are handled by judges whom he appoints, led by a priest known as the judicial vicar or &quot;officialis&quot;.

A single judge can handle normal contentious and penal cases. A college of at least three judges, however, must try cases involving an excommunication, the dismissal of a cleric, or the annulment of the bond of marriage or of sacred ordination (can. 1425 §1). The bishop can assign up to five judges to a case that is very difficult or important (can. 1425 §2). Otherwise, the judicial vicar assigns cases to the judges and, in those cases which require three or more judges, presides over the panel or assigns one of his assistant judicial vicars to preside, if there are any. The judicial vicar and the assistant judicial vicars must be priests with doctorates or at least licentiates in canon law. The other judges need only be clerics with licentiates, but the episcopal conference can permit members of the laity with the same academic qualifications to serve as judges on a panel.

There are other officers of the tribunal. The promoter of justice, for instance, is a canon lawyer whose job is to represent the diocese as the prosecutor in penal cases and who also can intervene in contentious cases if they concern the &quot;public good&quot;, acting as a watch dog for the people of the diocese. Another important officer is the defender of the bond, another canon lawyer whose job is to present reasons to the tribunal why a marriage is valid in cases of alleged nullity and why an ordination is valid in the rare cases of alleged nullity of Holy Orders. The tribunal also has notaries who swear in witnesses and commit their testimony to writing. Parties in a case have the right to appoint an advocate who can argue for them at the tribunal. If a person cannot afford an advocate, the tribunal can assign one to them free of charge.

Unlike courts of common law tradition, ecclesiastical tribunals do not follow the adversarial system. Based on the same Roman civil law that is behind much European law, the procedure of a canonical court is more akin to the inquisitorial system, with the judges leading the investigation. As a general rule, the defendant has the favorable presumption of law, which means that the defendant will win by default unless a majority of the judges is convinced with moral certainty of the petitioner&#x27;s case (can. 1608). This presumption also applies in penal cases (can. 1728). There are few exceptions to this rule; in those cases, the burden shifts to the defendant.

Some matters cannot be introduced at the diocesan level and can only be introduced before the following:
* Appellate tribunal for the diocese: cases against the diocese itself or an institution represented by the diocesan bishop
* Roman Rota: cases against the heads of religious orders, cases against dioceses or church institutions that are immediately subject to the Holy See, and non-penal cases against bishops
* The Pope himself: any case where a cardinal, Eastern rite patriarch, papal legate, or head of state is a defendant and any penal case involving a bishop.

=== Appeal ===
The appellate tribunal is known as the &quot;tribunal of second instance&quot;. Normally the second instance tribunal is the tribunal of the metropolitan bishop. In the case where the appeal is from a first instance decision of the metropolitan&#x27;s own tribunal, the appeal is taken to a court which the metropolitan designated with approval of the Holy See, usually another nearby metropolitan, thus ensuring that appeals from one diocese are never heard by the same diocese. As an example, a case in the Diocese of Springfield, Massachusetts, would be appealed to the tribunal of the Archdiocese of Boston, but a case originating in the Archdiocese of Boston would be appealed to the tribunal of the Archdiocese of New York, by agreement between the archbishops of New York and Boston.

Some cases are automatically appealed (for instance, when a marriage is found to be null). The appealing party does not need to appeal to the metropolitan; the party can instead appeal to the Holy See, in which case the Roman Rota would hear the case in the second instance. If the case was before the Rota in the first instance, then a different panel of the Rota hears it in the second instance.

With the exception of cases regarding personal status, if the first instance and second instance tribunals agree on the result of the case, then the case becomes &quot;res judicata&quot; and there is no further appeal. If they disagree, then the case can be appealed to the Roman Rota, which serves as the &quot;tribunal of third instance&quot;. The Rota is a court of fifteen judges called &quot;auditors&quot; who take cases in panels of three and serve as the final arbiters of most cases.

There is no appeal from a court case that the Pope has decided personally.

=== Other tribunals ===
The Roman Curia has two other tribunals which either deal with specialized cases or which do not deal with cases at all. The first is the Apostolic Signatura, a panel of five cardinals which serves as the highest court in the Roman Catholic Church. Normal cases rarely reach the Signatura, the exception being if a party appeals to the Pope and he assigns the case to them or if the Pope on his own initiative pulls a case from another court and gives it to them. The court mainly handles cases regarding the use of administrative power, including penal cases which were decided using executive instead of judicial power, which is the usual case. It also handles disputes between dicasteries and other tribunals over jurisdiction, complaints that a Rotal decision is null and should be retried, and matters regarding advocates and inter-diocesan tribunals.

There is normally no right of appeal from the decision of the Apostolic Signatura (can. 1629 #1); however, laypersons and clerics have, on rare occasions, convinced the Pope to hear their case afterwards. This is usually reserved for cases where they are facing excommunication or some other form of severe censure, such as the loss of the right to teach theology or to administer the sacraments. Facing censure, a theologian and priest got Pope John Paul II to hear his case and even asked the Pope to alter his own decision, though the Pope did not reverse the ruling in either case.

The other tribunal is the Apostolic Penitentiary. This tribunal has no jurisdiction in what is known as &quot;the external forum&quot;, meaning cases and events which are publicly known, only matters of the &quot;internal forum&quot;, which involve entirely confidential and secret matters, including (but not limited to) what is confessed in the Sacrament of Penance. It primarily deals with cases that arise only within the confessional and which by their nature are private, confidential or whose facts are secret. Such cases are normally brought before the court by a person&#x27;s confessor, who writes up the relevant facts of the cases, but only what is absolutely necessary, using standardized Latin pseudonyms. The confidentiality of the person, and the priest&#x27;s absolute obligation to preserve the secrecy of the Sacrament of Penance, are still in force in such cases. This court, under the authority of the Cardinal Major Penitentiary, who acts in the Pope&#x27;s name, answers the confessor and empowers him to impose a penance and lift a penalty. For instance, the act of desecrating the Eucharist is one which incurs an automatic excommunication for the person who so acts (an excommunication from the moment of the act, which no court need actually meet to impose), and the power to lift this excommunication is reserved by the Pope to himself. Should this person then approach a priest in confession, repentant, and explain his act and the fact that he acted in secret, the confessor would write to the tribunal laying out the simplest outline of facts, keeping the person&#x27;s identity secret, and would most likely be empowered to lift the excommunication and impose some private act of penance on the person.

== Anglican Communion ==

=== Church of England ===
In the Church of England, the ecclesiastical courts are a system of courts, held by authority of the Crown, who is &quot;ex officio&quot; the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The courts have jurisdiction over matters dealing with the rights and obligations of church members, now limited to controversies in areas of church property and ecclesiastical disciplinary proceedings. In England these courts, unlike common law courts, are based upon and operate along civil law procedures and Canon law-based jurisprudence.

The ecclesiastical courts formerly had jurisdiction over the personal estates of deceased persons to grant probate or administration. This jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts was transferred to the Court of Probate by the Court of Probate Act 1857.

Offences against ecclesiastical laws are dealt with differently based on whether the laws in question involve church doctrine. For non-doctrinal cases, the lowest level of the court is the &quot;Archdeaconry Court&quot;, which is presided over by the local archdeacon. The next court in the hierarchy is the bishop&#x27;s court, which is in the Diocese of Canterbury called the &quot;Commissary Court&quot; and in other dioceses the &quot;consistory court&quot;. The Commissary Court is presided over by a commissary-general; a consistory Court is presided over by a chancellor. The chancellor or commissary-general must be thirty years old and either have a seven-year general qualification under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 section 71 or have held high judicial office.

Specialist courts in the Province of Canterbury are the Court of Faculties, the Court of Peculiars and the Court of the Vicar-General of the Province of Canterbury. In the northern province there is the Court of the Vicar-General of the Province of York.

The next court is the archbishop&#x27;s court, which is in Canterbury called the &quot;Arches Court&quot;, and in York the &quot;Chancery Court&quot;. Each court includes five judges; one judge is common to both courts. The common judge is called the Dean of Arches in Canterbury and the Auditor in York; he or she is appointed jointly by both archbishops with the approval of the Crown, and must either hold a ten-year High Court qualification under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, s 71, or have held high judicial office. Two members of each court must be clergy appointed by the Prolocutor of the Lower House of the provincial convocation. Two further members of each court are appointed by the Chairman of the House of Laity of the General Synod; these must possess such legal qualifications as the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain requires.

In cases involving church doctrine, ceremony or ritual, the aforementioned courts have no jurisdiction. Instead, the &quot;Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved&quot; hears the case. The Court is composed of three diocesan bishops and two appellate judges; it has jurisdiction over both of the provinces of Canterbury and York. The Court, however, meets very rarely.

Appeal from the Arches Court and Chancery Court (in non-doctrinal cases) lies to the King-in-Council. In practice, the case is heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which includes present and former Lords Chancellor, a number of Lords of Appeal and other high judicial officers. The King-in-Council does not have jurisdiction over doctrinal cases from the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved, which instead go to an &quot;ad hoc&quot; Commission of Review, composed of two diocesan bishops and three Lords of Appeal (who are also members of the Judicial Committee).

Commissions of Convocation are appointed by the Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury or of York to try a bishop for an offence (except for an offence of doctrine). Both Convocations make the appointment if an archbishop is prosecuted. This would comprise four diocesan bishops and the Dean of the Arches.

====Guernsey====
The Ecclesiastical Court in Guernsey predates its first written evidence from the 13th Century. Its powers have been reduced over the centuries but it still meets weekly to prove wills and to grant marriage licences.

=== Episcopal Church in the United States of America ===
Ecclesiastical courts in the American Episcopal Church have jurisdiction only over disciplinary cases involving clergy and are divided into two separate systems: one for trials of bishops (at the level of the national Episcopal Church) and the other for trials of priests and deacons (at the level of the diocese for original jurisdiction and at the provincial level for appeals). (At least one diocese, however, Diocese of Minnesota, has provided in its canons for a court with broader jurisdiction over a wide range of canonical issues, although such a court has not yet been implemented by the convention of that diocese.) In each disciplinary case, two courts are provided, one for trials and one for appeals. When a charge is first made, it is brought before an initial review committee (similar to a grand jury in secular criminal law) whose job is to determine when a case should be brought and to supervise the Church Attorney who acts as a sort of prosecutor.

Courts and procedure for trials of bishops are provided for by the Canons of the General Convention (the triennial legislative body of the national church). There is one Court for the Trial of a bishop, composed of nine bishops (though there have been proposals to include lay persons and lower clergy in this court). Appeals are heard by the Court of Review for the Trial of a bishop, also comprising nine bishops. The Constitution of the national Episcopal Church provides that this court must be composed only of bishops.

For priests and deacons, initial trial is held by an ecclesiastical court established by the diocese in which the cleric is canonically resident. Appeals are taken to the Court of Review for the Trial of a Priest or Deacon, one of which is established in each of the nine provinces of the Episcopal Church (a province is a geographic combination of dioceses). Dioceses have some discretion about the procedure and membership for the ecclesiastical court, but most rules and procedure are established church-wide by the national canons. Trial courts are made up of lay persons and of priests or deacons, with the clergy to have a majority by one. The various courts of review comprise one bishop, three priests or deacons, and three lay persons.

Since the 18th century the Constitution of the national Episcopal Church has permitted the creation of a national Court of Appeal, which would be &quot;solely for the review of the determination of any Court of Review on questions of Doctrine, Faith, or Worship&quot;. No such court has ever been created, though proposals have occasionally been made to establish the House of Bishops itself as such a court.

== Other denominations ==

=== Eastern Orthodox churches ===
The dioceses of many Eastern Orthodox denominations, such as the Russian Orthodox Church, have their own ecclesiastical courts. In addition, the Russian Orthodox Church has a General Ecclesiastical Court with jurisdiction throughout the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as the Court of the Bishops’ Council which serves as the court of final appeal. Under the Russian Empire, Russian Orthodox ecclesiastical courts held jurisdiction over cases of adultery, incest, bestiality, and blasphemy. They also held responsibility for divorce, which could only be obtained in cases of adultery. 

The Greek Eastern Orthodox churches have ecclesiastical courts. For example, the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople has such courts for determining whether to grant divorce after the State has.

=== United Methodist Church ===
The Judicial Council is the highest court in the United Methodist Church. It consists of nine members, both laity and clergy, elected by the General Conference for an eight-year term. The ratio of laity to clergy alternates every four years. The Judicial Council interprets the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; between sessions of General Conference, and during General Conference the Judicial Council rules on the constitutionality of laws passed by General Conference. The Council also determines whether actions of local churches, annual conferences, church agencies, and bishops are in accordance with church law. The Council reviews all decisions of law made by bishops The Judicial Council cannot create any legislation; it can only interpret existing legislation. The Council meets twice a year at various locations throughout the world. The Judicial Council also hears appeals from those who have been accused of chargeable offenses that can result in defrocking or revocation of membership.

=== Presbyterian Church USA ===
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has Permanent Judicial Commissions for each synod, presbytery and the General Assembly of the denomination, all of which are elected by members and are composed of ministers and elders subject to its jurisdiction. The PJC of the General Assembly consists of one member from each of the sixteen synods which compose the denomination and the PJC has original jurisdiction over remedial cases and appeals.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, church courts are formally known as church membership councils. Church courts consider possible membership withdrawal or restriction based on a member&#x27;s violation of church standards. Any stake, ward, or mission of the church may convene a church court.

The Common Council of the Church—which has only been convened twice—is a church court which has the authority to remove a president of the church or one of his counselors in the First Presidency for misbehavior.

<text>Midsummer is a celebration of the season of summer, taking place on or near the date of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere; the longest day of the year. The name &quot;midsummer&quot; mainly refers to summer solstice festivals of European origin. These cultures traditionally regard it as the middle of summer, with the season beginning on May Day. Although the summer solstice falls on 20, 21 or 22 June in the Northern Hemisphere, it was traditionally reckoned to fall on 23–24 June in much of Europe. These dates were Christianized as Saint John&#x27;s Eve and Saint John&#x27;s Day. It is usually celebrated with outdoor gatherings that include bonfires and feasting.

== History ==


There is evidence that the summer solstice has been culturally important since the Neolithic era, with many ancient monuments throughout Eurasia and the Americas aligned with sunrise or sunset on the summer solstice.

The name &#x27;midsummer&#x27; is attested in Old English as &quot;midsumor&quot;, and refers to the time around the summer solstice. Astronomically, the solstice falls on 20, 21 or 22 June, but traditionally, in northern Europe, the solstice and midsummer was reckoned as the night of 23–24 June, with summer beginning on May Day.

Likewise, in the ancient Roman world, the traditional date of the summer solstice was 24 June, and Marcus Terentius Varro wrote in the 1st century BC that Romans saw this as the middle of summer. In the city of Rome, it was the festival of the goddess Fors Fortuna. People thronged the River Tiber and rowed in boats to the temples of Fortuna; &quot;after undisclosed rituals they rowed back, garlanded and inebriated&quot;.

Sandra Billington says there is no evidence that the pre-Christian Germanic peoples celebrated the summer solstice.

The historian Ronald Hutton says that the &quot;lighting of festive fires upon Saint John&#x27;s Eve is first recorded as a popular custom by Jean Belethus, a theologian at the University of Paris, in the early twelfth century&quot;, but is undoubtedly much older. In England, the earliest reference to this custom occurs in the 13th century AD, in the &quot;Liber Memorandum&quot; of the parish church at Barnwell in the Nene Valley, which stated that parish youth would gather on the day to light fires, sing songs and play games. A Christian monk of Lilleshall Abbey, in the same century, wrote:

The 13th-century monk of Winchcomb, Gloucestershire, who compiled a book of sermons for Christian feast days, recorded how St John&#x27;s Eve was celebrated in his time:

Let us speak of the revels which are accustomed to be made on St. John&#x27;s Eve, of which there are three kinds. On St. John&#x27;s Eve in certain regions the boys collect bones and certain other rubbish, and burn them, and therefrom a smoke is produced on the air. They also make brands and go about the fields with the brands. Thirdly, the wheel which they roll. ... The wheel is rolled to signify that the sun then rises to the highest point of its circle and at once turns back

Saint John&#x27;s Fires, explained the monk of Winchcombe, were to drive away dragons, which were abroad on St John&#x27;s Eve, poisoning springs and wells. A Christian interpretation of midsummer fires is that they are &quot;an emblem of St. John the Baptist, who was &#x27;a burning and shining light,&#x27; and the preparer of the way of Christ.&quot; The fires were also believed to repel witches and evil spirits.

On St John&#x27;s Day in 1333, Petrarch watched women at Cologne rinsing their hands and arms in the Rhine &quot;so that the threatening calamities of the coming year might be washed away by bathing in the river.&quot;

In 1482, German Franciscan friar Paul Walther provided an early documentation of the Albanian traditional practice of lighting fires (zjarre) on Saint John&#x27;s eve.

In the 16th century AD, English historian John Stow described the celebration of Midsummer:

Saint John&#x27;s Day is also a popular day for infant baptisms and in the 19th century, &quot;baptisms of children who had died &#x27;pagans&#x27; were acted out&quot;. In Sweden, young people visited holy springs as &quot;a reminder of how John the Baptist baptised Christ in the River Jordan.&quot;

== Religious observance ==
=== Christian ===
The early Christian Church designated 24 June as the feast day of the early Christian martyr St John the Baptist, and the observance of St John&#x27;s Day begins the evening before, known as Saint John&#x27;s Eve. These are commemorated by many Christian denominations, such as the Roman Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, and Anglican Communion, as well as by freemasonry. In Sweden, Midsummer is such an important festivity that there have been proposals to celebrate the National Day of Sweden then, instead of on 6 June. There and in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Midsummer is a public holiday. In Denmark and Norway, it may also be referred to as St. Hans Day.

In the 4th century AD, the undivided Christian Church made 24 June the feast day of Saint John the Baptist; it marks his birth, which the Gospel of Luke says was six months before Jesus. Christians marked the birth of Jesus (Christmas) on 25 December, the Roman date of the winter solstice, so the feast of St John was set exactly six months earlier.

Within Christian theology, John the Baptist &quot;was understood to be preparing the way for Jesus&quot;, with stating &quot;He must increase, but I must decrease&quot;; this is symbolized in the fact that the sun&#x27;s height in the sky and length of the day &quot;begins to diminish&quot; after the summer solstice and begins to increase after the winter solstice. By the 6th century AD, several churches were dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and a vigil, Saint John&#x27;s Eve, was added to the feast day. Christian priests held three Masses in churches for the celebration.

=== Neopagan ===
Many neopagans celebrate midsummer. As forms of Neopaganism have widely different origins, observances can vary considerably despite the shared name. Some celebrate in a manner as close as possible to how they believe ancient pagans observed the summer solstice, while others observe the holiday with rituals culled from numerous other unrelated sources.

At the ancient monument of Stonehenge, in the English county of Wiltshire, many people gather to observe the sunrise alignment with the stones on the summer solstice.

In Neo-druidism, the term &quot;Alban Hefin&quot; is used for the summer solstice, as coined by the 18th century Welsh Romantic author and prolific literary forger Iolo Morganwg.

Germanic neopagans call their summer solstice festival Litha, which is part of the reconstructed Germanic calendar used by some Germanic Neopagans and takes its name from Bede&#x27;s that provides Anglo-Saxon names for the two months roughly corresponding to June and July as &quot;līða&quot;, distinguished in Bosworth and Toller&#x27;s dictionary as &quot;sē ǽrra líða&quot; (&quot;the earlier Litha&quot;) and &quot;sē æftera līða&quot; (&quot;the later Litha&quot;) with an intercalary third month of &quot;līða&quot; on leap years or &quot;Triliði&quot; (&quot;three-Litha&quot; years). In modern times, Litha is celebrated by neopagans who emphasize what they believe to be the reconstruction of Anglo-Saxon Germanic paganism.

== Observance by country ==

Midsummer is traditionally celebrated throughout Europe, including in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Flanders, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, and parts of the United Kingdom (Cornwall especially), as well as other parts of the world: Canada, the United States, Puerto Rico, and also in the Southern Hemisphere (mostly in Brazil, Argentina and Australia). In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Quebec (Canada), the traditional Midsummer day, 24 June, is a public holiday. So it was formerly also in Sweden and Finland, but in these countries it was, in the 1950s, moved to the Friday and Saturday between 19 June and 26 June, respectively.

=== Albania ===
The summer solstice is celabrated by Albanians often with the name &quot;Shën Gjini&quot;–&quot;Shën Gjoni&quot; (&quot;Saint John&quot;), but also with the name &quot;Festa e Malit&quot; or &quot;Festa e Bjeshkës&quot; (&quot;Mountain Feast&quot;), as well as &quot;Festa e Blegtorisë&quot; (&quot;Livestock Feast&quot;). It is associated with the production in agricultural and livestock activities.

To celebrate this feast, bonfires are traditionally lit where straw is burned and ashes are thrown on the ground, as a &quot;burning for regeneration&quot; ritual. Tribal or community fires (zjarre) are traditionally made with straw, with people jumping across them. In some regions, plumes of burning chaff were carried in the air, running through the fields and hills. The ashes of the straw that burned in the ritual fires of this event are traditionally thrown to the field for good luck.

During this feast sheep shearing is traditionally performed by shepherds.

=== Austria ===
In Austria, the Midsummer solstice is celebrated each year with a procession of ships down the Danube River as it flows through the wine-growing Wachau Valley north of Vienna. Up to 30 ships sail down the river in line as fireworks erupt from the banks and hill tops while bonfires blaze and the vineyards are lit up. Lighted castle ruins also erupt with fireworks during the 90-minute cruise downstream.

=== Bulgaria ===

On Midsummer day, Bulgarians celebrate Enyovden. On the same day, the Eastern Orthodox church celebrates the day of John the Baptist and the rites and traditions of both holidays are often mixed. A fire-related ritual may also be performed in Bulgaria on that day; it involves barefoot dance on smoldering embers and is called Nestinarstvo. Bulgarian folklore states the beginning of summer starts on Enyovden. It is thought that in the morning of Enyovden, when the sun rises, it &quot;winks&#x27; and &quot;plays&quot;. Anyone seeing the sunrise will be healthy throughout the year. It is believed that on Enyovden a variety of herbs have the greatest healing power, and that this is especially true at sunrise. Therefore, they have to be picked early in the morning before dawn. Women – sorceresses and enchantresses – go to gather herbs by themselves to cure and make charms. The number of herbs gathered for the winter must be seventy-seven and a half – for all diseases, known and unknown.

=== Brazil ===
&quot;Festa Juninas&quot;, &quot;June Festival&quot; in Brazil, also known as São João Festivals because they celebrate the nativity of Saint John the Baptist (24 June), are annual Brazilian celebrations adapted from the European summer solstice, which occurs in the middle of the southern hemisphere&#x27;s winter. These festivities, introduced by the Portuguese during the colonial period (1500–1822), are celebrated throughout the country during the month of June. The festival is mainly celebrated on the eves of the Catholic solemnities of Saint Anthony, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter.

As the Northeast of Brazil is largely arid or semi-arid, these festivals not only coincide with the end of the rainy seasons in most states of the region but also offer people the opportunity to thank Saint John for the rain. They also celebrate rural life and feature typical clothing, food, and dances (mainly the quadrille).

=== Canada ===

In Newfoundland and Labrador, St. John&#x27;s Day is observed on the Monday nearest 24 June and commemorates John Cabot&#x27;s discovery of Newfoundland in 1497. In Quebec, the celebration of 24 June was brought to New France by the first French colonists. Great fires were lit at night. According to the &quot;Jesuit Relations&quot;, the first celebrations of St John&#x27;s Day in New France took place around 1638. In 1834, Ludger Duvernay, printer and editor of &quot;La Minerve&quot; took the leadership of an effort to make 24 June the national holiday of the &quot;Canadiens&quot; (French Canadians). In 1908, Pope Pius X designated John the Baptist as the patron saint of the French-Canadians. In 1925, 24 June became a legal holiday in Quebec and in 1977, it became the secular National Holiday of Quebec. It is still the tradition to light great fires on the night of 24 June.

=== Denmark ===

In Denmark, the solstitial celebration is called &quot;sankthans&quot; or &quot;sankthansaften&quot; (&quot;St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot;). It was an official holiday until 1770, and in accordance with the Danish tradition of celebrating a holiday on the evening before the actual day, it takes place on the evening of 23 June. It is the day where the medieval wise men and women (the doctors of that time) would gather special herbs that they needed for the rest of the year to cure people.

Bonfires on the beach, speeches, picnics and songs are traditional, although they are built in many other places where beaches may not be close by (i.e. on the shores of lakes and other waterways, parks, etc.) Bonfires are lit in order to repel witches and other evil spirits, with the burnings sending the &quot;witch&quot; away to Bloksbjerg, the Brocken mountain in the Harz region of Germany where the great witch gathering was thought to be held on this day. Some Danes regard this tradition of burning witches as inappropriate.

In Scandinavia, young people visited holy springs as &quot;a reminder of how John the Baptist baptised Christ in the River Jordan.&quot;

On Saint John&#x27;s Eve and Saint John&#x27;s Day, churches arrange Saint John&#x27;s worship services and family reunions also occur, which are an occasion for drinking and eating.

In 1885, Holger Drachmann wrote a &quot;midsommervise&quot; (Midsummer hymn) called &quot;Vi elsker vort land...&quot; (&quot;We Love Our Country&quot;) with a melody composed by P.E. Lange-Müller that is sung at most bonfires on this evening.

=== Estonia ===

&quot;Jaanipäev&quot; (&quot;Jaan&#x27;s Day&quot; or &quot;Midsummer Day&quot; in English or &quot;St. John&#x27;s Day&quot; for Christians) was celebrated long before the arrival of Christianity in Estonia, although the day was given its modern name by Christians. The day is still known by its many names as: &quot;leedopäev&quot;, &quot;suvine pööripäiv&quot;, &quot;suvepööripäev&quot;, &quot;püäripääv&quot;, &quot;päevakäänak&quot;, &quot;päiväkäänäk&quot;, &quot;päiväkäändjäne&quot;, &quot;päevapesa&quot;, &quot;pesapäev&quot; and &quot;suured päevad&quot;. The arrival of Christianity, however, did not end pagan beliefs and fertility rituals surrounding this holiday. In 1578, Balthasar Russow wrote in his &quot;Livonian Chronicle&quot; about Estonians who placed more importance on the festival than going to church. He complained about those who went to church, but did not enter, and instead spent their time lighting bonfires, drinking, dancing, singing and following pagan rituals. Midsummer marks a change in the farming year, specifically the break between the completion of spring sowing and the hard work of summer hay-making.

Understandably, some of the rituals of &quot;Jaanipäev&quot; have very strong folkloric roots. One of the best-known Jaanik or midsummer ritual is the lighting of the bonfire and jumping over it. This is seen as a way of guaranteeing prosperity and avoiding bad luck. Likewise, to not light the fire is to invite the destruction of your house by fire. The fire also frightened away mischievous spirits who avoided it at all costs, thus ensuring a good harvest. So, the bigger the fire, the further the mischievous spirits stayed away. Estonian midsummer traditions are most similar to Finnish midsummer traditions but also have some similarities with Latvian, Lithuanian and Scandinavian traditions.

Estonians celebrate &quot;Jaaniõhtu&quot; on the eve of the Summer Solstice (23 June) with bonfires. On the islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, old fishing boats may be burned in the large pyres set ablaze. On &quot;Jaaniõhtu&quot;, Estonians all around the country will gather with their families, or at larger events to celebrate this important day with singing and dancing, as Estonians have done for centuries. The celebrations that accompany &quot;Jaaniõhtu&quot; carry on usually through the night, they are the largest and most important of the year, and the traditions are almost identical to Finland (read under Finland) and similar to neighbors Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden (read under Sweden).

&quot;Jaanipäev&quot; is usually spent in a summer cottage, where people light bonfires, or at a festival, such as Pühajärve Jaanituli in Otepää.

Since 1934, 23 June is also national Victory Day of Estonia and both 23rd and 24th are holidays and flag flying days. The Estonian flag is not lowered in the night between these two days.

=== Faroe Islands ===
On the Faroe Islands, St. John&#x27;s Eve (&quot;jóansøka&quot;) is generally not celebrated. However, on the southernmost island of Suðuroy it is observed by lighting a bonfire. Only one bonfire is lit on the island as one of the two biggest towns hosts the celebration alternately every other year.

=== Finland ===

The pre-Christian name for the summer solstice was &quot;Ukon juhla&quot; (&quot;Ukko&#x27;s celebration&quot;) after the Finnish god Ukko. After the celebrations were Christianized, the holiday became known as &quot;juhannus&quot; after John the Baptist (Finnish: &quot;Johannes Kastaja&quot;).

Since 1955, the holiday has always been on a Saturday (between 20 June and 26 June). Previously it was always on 24 June. Many of the celebrations of midsummer take place on Friday, midsummer eve, when many workplaces are closed and shops may close their doors at noon.

In the Finnish midsummer celebration, bonfires (Finnish &quot;kokko&quot;) are very common and are burned at lakesides and by the sea. Often branches from birch trees (&quot;koivu&quot;) are placed on both side of the front door to welcome visitors. Swedish-speaking Finns often celebrate by erecting a midsummer or maypole (Swedish &quot;midsommarstång&quot;, &quot;majstång&quot;). Some Swedish-speaking Finns call the holiday &quot;Johannes&quot; or &quot;Johanni&quot; after the Finnish term &quot;juhannus&quot; – or more accurately after the Biblical John the Baptist (=&quot;Johannes Döparen&quot; in Swedish).

In folk magic, midsummer was a very potent night and the time for many small rituals, mostly for young maidens seeking suitors and fertility. Will-o&#x27;-the-wisps were believed to appear at midsummer night, particularly to finders of the mythical &quot;fern in bloom&quot; and possessors of the &quot;fern seed&quot;, marking a treasure. In the old days, maidens would use special charms and bend over a well, naked, in order to see their future husband&#x27;s reflection. In another tradition that continues still today, an unmarried woman collects seven different flowers and places them under her pillow to dream of her future husband.

An important feature of the midsummer in Finland is the white night and the midnight sun. Because of Finland&#x27;s location around the Arctic Circle, the nights near Midsummer day are short (with twilight even at midnight) or non-existent. This gives a great contrast to the darkness of the winter time. The temperature can vary between 0 °C and +30 °C, with an average of about 20 °C in the South.

Many Finns leave the cities for Midsummer and spend time in the countryside. Nowadays many spend at least a few days there, and some Finns take their whole vacation at a summer cottage. Traditions include bonfires, cookouts, sauna and spending time together with friends or family. Heavy drinking is also associated with the Finnish midsummer, which is one common reason for the increase in the number of accidents, such as drowning.

Many music festivals of all sizes are organized on the Midsummer weekend. It is also common to start summer vacation on Midsummer day. For many families, Midsummer is the time when they move to the countryside to their summer cottage by the sea or lake. Midsummer is also a Finnish Flag Day: the national flag is hoisted at 6 pm on Midsummer&#x27;s Eve and flown throughout the night until 9 pm the next evening. This is an exception to the normal rule of flying the flag from 8 am to sunset. Finnish Canadians in the New Finland district, Saskatchewan, Canada celebrate Juhannus.

=== France ===
In France, the (feast of St John) is traditionally celebrated with bonfires (), and is a Catholic festivity in celebration of Saint John the Baptist. It takes place on 24 June, on Midsummer day (St John&#x27;s Day). In certain French towns, a tall bonfire is built by the inhabitants in order to be lit on St John&#x27;s Day. In the region and in the Southern part of , this huge bonfire is named .

France also rejoices on 21 June for the Fête de la Musique, which became an international celebration over time.

=== Germany ===

The summer solstice is called in German of which a word by word translation is &quot;summer sun turning&quot;. On 20 June 1653, the Nuremberg town council issued the following order: Where experience herefore have shown, that after the old heathen use, on John&#x27;s day in every year, in the country, as well in towns as villages, money and wood have been gathered by young folk, and there upon the so-called or &quot;zimmet fire&quot; kindled, and thereat winebibbing, dancing about the said fire, leaping over the same, with burning of sundry herbs and flowers, and setting of brands from the said fire in the fields, and in many other ways all manner of superstitious work carried on — Therefore the Hon. Council of Nürnberg town neither can nor ought to forbear to do away with all such unbecoming superstition, paganism, and peril of fire on this coming day of St. John.

Bonfires are still a custom in many areas of Germany. People gather to watch the bonfire and celebrate solstice.

The date also marks the end of harvest for spring vegetables such as asparagus (&quot;Spargelsilvester&quot;) or for rhubarb.

Besides many Midsummernight festivals, the Mainzer Johannisnacht commemorates the person Johannes Gutenberg in his native city since 1968.

=== Greece ===
According to Eastern Orthodox tradition, the eve of the day of the Nativity of John the Baptist is celebrated with festivals in many towns and villages, both in the mainland and in the Greek isles. Traditionally, the midsummer&#x27;s celebration is called () meaning sign or oracle, and was considered a time when unmarried girls would discover their potential mates through a ritual. It is also customary to this day to burn the Mayday wreaths that are used to decorate the doors of the houses for the previous two months, in large communal bonfires, accompanied by music, dancing and jumping over the flames. It takes place on 30 and 31 May.

=== Hungary ===
On 23 June, Hungarians celebrate &quot;Saint Ivan&#x27;s Night&quot; (; being derived from the Slavic form of Johannes/John, &quot;Ivan&quot;, which may correspond to Hungarian , , ). The whole month of June was once called the Month of St. Ivan until the 19th century. Setting fires is a folklore tradition this night. Girls jumped over it, while boys watched the spectacle.

Most significant among the customs of the summer is lighting the fire of Midsummer Night () on the day of St. John (24 June), when the sun follows the highest course, when the nights are the shortest and the days the longest. The practice of venerating Saint John the Baptist developed in the Catholic Church during the 5th century, and at this time they put his name and day on 24 June. The summer solstice was celebrated among most peoples, so the Hungarians may have known it even before the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin. Although the Arab historian Ibn Rusta speaks of the Hungarians&#x27; fire worshipping, so far there is no data that could connect it to this day. In the Middle Ages, it was primarily an ecclesiastical festivity, but from the 16th century on the sources recall it as a folk custom. The most important episode of the custom is the lighting of the fire.

The custom survived longest and in the most complete form in the northwestern part of the linguistic region, where as late as the 1930s they still lit a Midsummer Night fire. The way of arranging the participants by age and by sex has suggested the possibility that these groups sang by answering each other, but there are hardly any remnants that appear to support this possibility. People jumped over the fire after they lit it. This practice is mentioned as early as the 16th century, although at that time in connection with a wedding; still, it is called &quot;Midsummer Night fire&quot;. The purpose of jumping over the fire is partly to purify, partly because they believed that those whose jump was very successful would get married during the following carnival.

=== Ireland ===
Many towns and cities in Ireland have &#x27;Midsummer Carnivals&#x27; with fairs, concerts and fireworks either on or on the weekend nearest to Midsummer. In rural spots throughout the west, northwest, southwest and County Cork, bonfires are lit on hilltops on Saint John&#x27;s Eve. The Irish Environmental Protection Agency, after much initial upset in the west of Ireland, has an exemption for the burning of fires outdoors during midsummer night.

=== Italy ===

In Italy, St John&#x27;s (&quot;San Giovanni&#x27;s&quot;) Day has been celebrated in Florence since medieval times with festivals sometimes lasting three days from 21 to 24 June. In medieval Florence, midsummer celebrations were &quot;an occasion for dramatic representations of the Baptist&#x27;s life and death&quot; and &quot;the feast day was marked by processions, banquets, and plays, culminating in a fireworks show that the entire city attended.&quot; The 15th-century diarist Goro Dati described the celebration of Saint John&#x27;s Day in Florence as being one in which guilds prepared their workshops with fine displays, and one in which solemn church processions took place, with men dressed in the costumes of Christian saints and angels.

Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of Florence, Genoa and Turin where fireworks displays take place during the celebration. In Turin, Saint John&#x27;s festival has been practiced since medieval times, with people from the surrounding areas coming to dance around the bonfire in the central square.

Italian neopagans usually celebrate Midsummer with rites, dances and festivals all around the country.

=== Jersey ===
In Jersey most of the former midsummer customs are largely ignored nowadays. The custom known as &quot;Les cônes d&#x27;la Saint Jean&quot; was observed as late as the 1970s – horns or conch shells were blown. Ringing the &quot;bachîn&quot; (a large brass preserving pan) at midsummer to frighten away evil spirits survived as a custom on some farms until the 1940s and has been revived as a folk performance in the 21st century.

=== Latvia ===
In Latvia, Midsummer is called &quot;Jāņi&quot; (plural of Latvian name Jānis, which is equivalent to John) or Līgo svētki (svētki = festival). It is a national holiday celebrated from the night of 23 June through 24 June on a large scale by almost everyone in Latvia and by people of Latvian origin abroad. Celebrations consist of a lot of traditional and mostly pagan elements – eating, Jāņi cheese, drinking beer, baking pīrāgi, singing Latvian folk songs dedicated to Jāņi, burning bonfires to keep light all through the night and jumping over it, wearing wreaths of flowers (for women) and oak leaves (for men) together with modern commercial products and ideas. There are tens and hundreds of different beliefs and traditions all over Latvia on what should be done on that day for good harvest, for predicting the future, for attracting one&#x27;s future spouse etc. People decorate their houses and lands with birch or sometimes oak branches and flowers as well as leaves, especially fern. In rural areas, livestock is also decorated. In modern days, small oak branches with leaves are attached to the cars in Latvia during the festivity. Jāņi has been a strong aspect of Latvian culture throughout history, originating in pre-Christian Latvia as an ancient fertility cult.

In the western town of Kuldīga, revellers mark the holiday by running naked through the town at three in the morning. The event has taken place since 2000. Runners are rewarded with beer, and police are on hand in case any &quot;puritans&quot; attempt to interfere with the naked run.

According to a 2023 survey, Jāņi is the most celebrated festival in Latvia, outranking even Christmas.

=== Lithuania ===

Midsummer is commonly called John&#x27;s Day (&quot;Joninės&quot;) in Lithuania, and is also known as Saint Jonas&#x27; Festival, Rasos (Dew Holiday), Kupolė, Midsummer Day and St. John&#x27;s Day. It is celebrated in the night from 23 June to 24 June and on 24 June. The traditions include singing songs and dancing until the sun sets, telling tales, searching to find the magic fern blossom at midnight, jumping over bonfires, greeting the rising midsummer sun and washing the face with a morning dew, young girls float flower wreaths on the water of river or lake. These are customs brought from pagan culture and beliefs. The latter Christian tradition is based on the reverence of Saint John. Lithuanians with the names Jonas, Jonė, Janina receive many greetings from their family, relatives and friends.

=== Norway ===
As in Denmark, &quot;Sankthansaften&quot; is celebrated on 23 June in Norway. The day is also called &quot;Jonsok&quot;, which means &quot;John&#x27;s wake&quot;, important in Roman Catholic times with pilgrimages to churches and holy springs. For instance, up until 1840, there was a pilgrimage to the Røldal Stave Church in Røldal (southwest Norway) whose crucifix was said to have healing powers. Today, however, &quot;Sankthansaften&quot; is largely regarded as a secular or even pre-Christian event.

Midsummer day, &quot;Sankthansdagen&quot;, 24 June, was a public holiday in Norway until 1770. In Vestfold county, it was re-introduced in the early 20th century, until the 1990s. The city of Sandefjord kept up the tradition. In the city of Tønsberg, the holiday was turned into a flexible day off for municipal workers in 2011 and abolished completely in 2014. Labor unions sued to get the holiday – or a flexible day off – re-introduced, but lost the case in 2016.

In most places, the main event is the burning of a large bonfire. In Western Norway, a custom of arranging mock weddings, both between adults and between children, is still kept alive. The wedding was meant to symbolize the blossoming of new life. Such weddings are known to have taken place in the 1800s, but the custom is believed to be older.

It is also said that, if a girl puts flowers under her pillow that night, she will dream of her future husband.

=== Poland ===
Especially in northern Poland – the Eastern Pomeranian and Kashubian regions – midsummer is celebrated on 21 or 22 June. Girls throw wreaths made of flowers and candles into the Baltic Sea, and into lakes or rivers. The Midsummer day celebration starts at about 8:00 p.m. and lasts all night until sunrise. People celebrate this special day every year and call it &quot;Noc Świętojańska&quot; which means St. John&#x27;s Night. On that day in big Polish cities (like Warsaw and Kraków), there are many organized events, the most popular event being in Kraków, called the &quot;Wianki,&quot; which means wreaths. In many parts of Poland, the Summer solstice is celebrated as &quot;Kupala Night&quot;. Also, an important tradition is looking in the forest for the flower of the fern (as fern does not flower, this means something impossible to find without an interference of magic). Jumping above bonfires used to be a widely spread custom too.

=== Portugal ===


In Portugal, Midsummer festivities are included in what is known today as &quot;Santos Populares&quot; (Popular Saints celebrations), celebrating the three main saints of June: St. Anthony (13 June), celebrated in Lisbon, Estarreja, Vila Nova de Famalicão, and Vila Real among others; São João (St. John&#x27;s Day, 24 June) in Porto, Braga, Figueira da Foz, Vila do Conde, Almada and many others; St. Peter&#x27;s day (29 June) in Seixal, Sintra, Póvoa de Varzim, Barcelos, and various other locations, mostly associated with fishermen.

In anticipation of Popular Saints, streets are decorated with balloons and arches made out of brightly coloured paper, people dance in the city&#x27;s squares, and &quot;Cascatas&quot; (makeshift altars), dedicated to the saints, are put up to show each neighbourhood&#x27;s devotion and pride. These holidays are days of festivities with good food and refreshments. Typical dishes include Caldo verde (Portuguese cabbage and potato soup), sardinhas assadas na brasa (open grilled sardines), boroa (oven baked bread), funfair food (mostly cotton candy and &quot;farturas&quot;, a fried batter with sugar and cinnamon) and drink (mostly) red wine and água-pé (grape juice with a small percentage of alcohol).

Around the day of the festivities, there is also group folk dancing, traditional music, including &quot;Cantar à desgarrada&quot; (musical rhyming duels), and the inescapable firework displays. Until fire regulations brought about by some serious forest fires discouraged them, bonfires and hot air balloons were lit, around which all these events used to happen. Revellers would try to jump over the bonfire, mostly young men trying to show off to the young women, and older men trying to convince themselves that they are still young. Other typical activities include trying to clime a pau-de-sebo (greased pole) to claim a reward (frequently a cod or ham) and &quot;Rusgas&quot; which are a mixture of running, singing, dancing and tomfoolery, mostly by youthful groups. Funfair attractions have also become a mainstay of festivities.

In Lisbon, in Avenida da Liberdade, there are the &quot;Marchas&quot;, a parade of folklore and costumes of the inhabitants from the city&#x27;s different traditional quarters, with hundreds of singers and dancers and a vast audience applauding their favourite participants. As St. Anthony is the matchmaker saint, it is still the tradition in Lisbon to celebrate multiple marriages (200 to 300) and according to tradition, one can declare oneself to someone one fancies in the heat of the festivities by offering the loved one a &quot;manjerico&quot; (a flower-pot with a sweet basil plant) and a love poem.

In Porto and Braga, St. John&#x27;s is celebrated in the streets, where many normally frowned-upon things are permitted. People carry a plant of flowering leek (&quot;alho-porro,&quot; which has a pungent smell) with them, and run it over the face of other people. Starting in 1963, people have also carried a small plastic hammer which they use to bang their neighbors over the head. The tradition is that St. John was a scalliwag in his youth and the people hit him on the head with the garlic saying &quot;return to the right path&quot;.

In traditional fisher towns, festivities take place on Saint Peter&#x27;s Day, Póvoa do Varzim, which became a municipal holiday in the 1960s. Póvoa de Varzim&#x27;s Saint Peter Festival keeps traditional &quot;Santos Populares&quot; elements, such as the bonfire, street celebrations, and include the &quot;rusgas&quot;, in which inhabitants of one quarter (&quot;bairro&quot;) parade to other neighbourhoods in the evening of 28 June. Women are dressed as tricana (women dressed in a traditional costume with a sensual walking style). Each neighbourhood has its own festival and colors for identification.

=== Romania ===
In Romania, the Midsummer celebrations are named &quot;Drăgaica&quot; or &quot;Sânziene&quot;. Drăgaica is celebrated by a dance performed by a group of 5–7 young girls of which one is chosen as &quot;the Drăgaica&quot;. She is dressed as a bride, with wheat wreath, while the other girls, dressed in white wear a veil with bedstraw flowers. Midsummer fairs are held in many Romanian villages and cities. The oldest and best known midsummer fair in Romania is the Drăgaica fair, held in Buzău between 10 and 24 June every year. There are many superstitions related to this day, particularly those involving marriage or death. The term Sânziene originates in the Latin &quot;Sancta Diana&quot;, and superstitions relating to this day are mainly romantic in nature, referring to young girls and their marriage prospects.

=== Russia ===
Many rites of this holiday are connected with water, fertility and autopurification. The girls, for example, would float their flower garlands on the water of rivers and tell their fortunes from their movement. Lads and girls would jump over the flames of bonfires. Nude bathing is likewise practiced. Nights on the Eve of Ivan Kupala inspired Modest Mussorgsky to create his &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;. A prominent Ivan Kupala night scene is featured in Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s film &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot;. Also, in Saint Petersburg the White Nights Festival is also predominantly connected with water.

The Yakut people of the Sakha Republic celebrate a solstitial ceremony, &quot;Yhyakh&quot;, involving tethering a horse to a pole and circle dancing around it. Betting on Reindeer or horse racing would often take place afterward. The traditions are derived from Tengriism, the ancient sun religion of the region which has since been driven out by the Russian Empire, Russian Orthodox Church and finally the Communist Party. The traditions have since been encouraged.

=== Serbia ===
&quot;Ivanjdan&quot; is celebrated on 7 July, according to the Serbian Orthodox Church. Saint John (Sveti Jovan) is known by the name &quot;Igritelj&quot; (dancer) because it is thought the sun is dancing on this day. Among traditions are that girls watch the sunrise through their wreath, to become red as the sun, towards the evening in the heights, &quot;Ivanjske vatre&quot; (kresovi, &quot;bonfire&quot;) are lit, and dancing and singing takes place. It is a tradition for people to become godfathers and blood brothers on this day, as John is a symbol of character and rectitude.

=== Slovenia ===
In Slovenia, &quot;Kresna noč&quot; (Midsummer Night) used to be celebrated on 21 June, but the celebration was later moved to 1 May, International Workers Day. Kresna noč used to be connected with the Slavic god Kresnik, who was later replaced by St. John the Baptist.

=== Spain ===

The traditional midsummer party in Spain is the celebration in honour of Saint John the Baptist (Spanish: &quot;San Juan&quot;, Catalan: &quot;Sant Joan&quot;, Galician: &quot;San Xoán&quot;, Asturian: &quot;San Xuan&quot;) and takes place in the evening of 23 June, Saint John&#x27;s Eve. It is common in many areas of the country. In some areas, bonfires are traditionally named &quot;tequeos&quot;, which means people of the dance. Parties are organized usually at beaches, where bonfires are lit and a set of firework displays usually take place. On the Mediterranean coast, especially in Catalonia and Valencia, special foods such as &quot;coca de Sant Joan&quot; are also served on this occasion. In Alicante, since 1928, the bonfires of Saint John were developed into elaborate constructions inspired by the Falles, or Fallas, of Valencia.

Midsummer tradition is also especially strong in northern areas of the country, such as Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria and the Basque Country. What follows is a summary of Galician traditions surrounding St. John&#x27;s festival:
* Medicinal plants: Traditionally, women collect several species of plants on St. John&#x27;s eve. These vary from area to area, but mostly include fennel, different species of fern (e.g. &quot;Dryopteris filix-mas&quot;, &quot;Osmunda regalis&quot;), rue (herb of grace, &quot;Ruta graveolens&quot;), rosemary (&quot;Rosmarinus officinalis&quot;), dog rose (&quot;Rosa canina&quot;), lemon verbena (&quot;Aloysia citrodora&quot;), St John&#x27;s wort (&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;), mallows (&quot;Malva sylvestris&quot;), laburnum, foxgloves (&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot;) and elder (&quot;Sambucus&quot;) flowers. In some areas, these are arranged in a bunch and hung in doorways. In most others, they are dipped in a vessel with water and left outside exposed to the dew of night until the following morning (o dia de San Xoan – St. John&#x27;s day), when people (in some areas only women) use the resulting flower water to wash their faces.
* Water: Tradition holds it that the medicinal plants mentioned above are most effective when dipped in water collected from seven different springs. Also, on some beaches, it was traditional for women who wanted to be fertile to bathe in the sea until they were washed by 9 waves.
* Fire: Bonfires are lit, usually around midnight both on beaches and inland, so much so that one usually cannot tell the smoke from the mist common in this Atlantic corner of Iberia at this time of the year, and it smells burnt everywhere. Occasionally, a dummy is placed at the top, representing a witch or the devil. Young and old gather around them and feast mostly on pilchards, potatoes boiled in their skins and maize bread. When it is relatively safe to jump over the bonfire, it is done three times (although it could also be nine or any odd number) for good luck at the cry of &quot;meigas fora&quot; (witches off!). It is also common to drink &quot;Queimada&quot;, a beverage resulting from setting alight Galician grappa mixed with sugar, coffee beans and pieces of fruit, which is prepared while chanting an incantation against evil spirits.
* Pranks: At least in Galicia, it was common in rural areas to prank neighbors by taking carts, doors, etc. and left them in visible areas like roads or in the middle of the town. The prank was performed at night and left until the owner find the items.

=== Sweden ===

Midsummer is one of Sweden&#x27;s most important traditions, second only to Christmas according to some, and is widely celebrated. It is more of a gathering for friends, rather than a family reunion like Christmas.

Raising and dancing around a maypole () is an activity that attracts families and many others. Greenery placed over houses and barns was supposed to bring good fortune and health to people and livestock; this old tradition of decorating with greens continues, though most people no longer take it seriously. To decorate with greens was called &quot;att maja&quot; (to May) and may be the origin of the word coming originally from the month May, or vice versa. Other researchers say the term came from German merchants who raised the maypole in June because the Swedish climate made it impossible to find the necessary greens and flowers in May, and continued to call it a maypole.In earlier times, small spires wrapped in greens were erected; this probably predates the maypole tradition, which is believed by many to have come from the continent in the Middle Ages.

In Sweden, Midsummer day is a Saturday between 20 June and 26 June, but as is usual in Sweden the actual celebration is on the eve, i.e. a Friday between 19 June and 25 June. Midsummer&#x27;s Eve is a de facto public holiday in Sweden with offices and many shops closed. The day before Midsummer, the state-owned liquor store Systembolaget typically see a sharp increase in alcohol sales.

Various traditions and customs are practiced during a Swedish Midsummer, including ending it with a skinny dip at night and to place flowers under the pillow. It is not mandatory to be naked, but many will be completely naked accompanied with an old or new partner after a couple of the famous schnapps. At bedtime, it is common to place seven or nine different types of flowers under the pillow, as it is believed to reveal whom the person will end up with.

The Swedish Midsummer tradition has also been the subject of film adaptations, such as the horror movie &quot;Midsommar&quot; (2019).

=== Ukraine ===

Ivan Kupala was the old Kyiv Rus&#x27; name for John the Baptist. Up to the present day, the Rus&#x27; Midsummer Night (or Ivan&#x27;s Day) is known as one of the most expressive Kyiv Rus&#x27; folk and pagan holidays. Ivan Kupala Day is the day of summer solstice celebrated in Ukraine on 23 June NS and 6 July OS. Before the day was named for St John, this was a celebration of a pagan fertility rite involving bathing in water. Since St John the Baptist&#x27;s birth is celebrated at this time, some elements of Kupala&#x27;s pagan origins were seen to be roughly synonymous with Christian meanings, most notably the parallel of Baptism as cleansing from sins, so the holiday in a Christian-modified form has been accepted into the Orthodox Christian calendar.

===United Kingdom===

In Great Britain from the 13th century, Midsummer was celebrated on Midsummer Eve (St. John&#x27;s Eve, 23 June) and St. Peter&#x27;s Eve (28 June) with the lighting of bonfires, feasting, and merrymaking.

==== England ====
In late 14th-century England, John Mirk of Lilleshall Abbey, Shropshire, gives the following description: &quot;At first, men and women came to church with candles and other lights and prayed all night long. In the process of time, however, men left such devotion and used songs and dances and fell into lechery and gluttony turning the good, holy devotion into sin.&quot; The church fathers decided to put a stop to these practices and ordained that people should fast on the evening before, and thus turned waking into fasting.

Mirk adds that at the time of his writing, &quot;...in worship of St John the Baptist, men stay up at night and make three kinds of fires: one is of clean bones and no wood and is called a &quot;bonnefyre&quot;; another is of clean wood and no bones, and is called a &quot;wakefyre&quot;, because men stay awake by it all night; and the third is made of both bones and wood and is called, &quot;St. John&#x27;s fire&quot; (Festial 182).&quot; These traditions largely ended after the Reformation, but persisted in rural areas up until the 19th century before petering out.

Other Midsummer festivities had uneasy relations with the Reformed establishment. The Chester Midsummer Watch Parade, begun in 1498, was held at every Summer Solstice in years when the Chester Mystery Plays were not performed. Despite the cancellation of the plays in 1575, the parade continued; in 1599, however, the Lord Mayor ordered that the parades be banned and the costumes destroyed. The parade was permanently banned in 1675.
Traditional Midsummer bonfires are still lit on some high hills in Cornwall (see Carn Brea and Castle an Dinas on Castle Downs). This tradition was revived by the Old Cornwall Society in the early 20th century. Bonfires in Cornwall were once common as part of , which is now celebrated at Penzance, Cornwall. This week long festival normally starts on the Friday nearest St John&#x27;s Day. lasts several days and culminates in Mazey Day. This is a revival of the Feast of St John () with fireworks and bonfires.

In England, Midsummer Day (24 June) is traditionally one of the quarter days.

==== Scotland ====
Midsummer festivals are celebrated throughout Scotland, notably in the Scottish Borders where Peebles holds its Beltane Week. The Eve of St. John has special magical significance and was used by Sir Walter Scott as the title, and theme, for a pseudo-ballad poem. He invented a legend in which the lady of Smailholm Tower, near Kelso, keeps vigil by the midnight fires three nights in a row (see above) and is visited by her lover; but when her husband returns from battle, she learns he slew that lover on the first night, and she has been entertained by a very physical ghost.

==== Wales ====
In Wales, it is called , or (St John&#x27;s of Midsummer) to distinguish it from (St John&#x27;s of Midwinter, the feast of John the Evangelist). Great agricultural fairs used to be held at this time, along with merriment and dancing. A bonfire was also kept this night. With the advent of non-conformist beliefs on the Welsh socio-political culture, this (among so many other similar festivals) suffered greatly, and its observance finally died out in south-east Wales by the end of the 19th century. However, since 1977, a folk-dance revival started in Cardiff, and is held now annually on this feast day

=== United States ===

Midsummer celebrations held throughout the United States are largely derived from the cultures of immigrants who arrived from various European nations since the 19th century. With the rise of earth-centered spirituality, many, including Unitarian Universalists, celebrate the summer solstice as a religious holiday.

==== Alaska ====
As the state of Alaska, northernmost state in the nation, straddles the Arctic Circle, midsummer is a time when most of the state is in daylight or civil twilight the entire day. The Midnight Sun Game is an annual tradition in the city of Fairbanks, in which a regulation game of baseball is played at 10:30 p.m. local time, through the midnight hour, with no artificial lighting.

==== California ====
Since 1974, Santa Barbara has hosted an annual Summer Solstice celebration, typically on the weekend of or the weekend after the actual solstice. It includes a festival and parade.

In Santa Clara County, the Swedish American Patriotic League has held a Midsummer celebration at Sveadal for more than 120 years. It includes a parade, decorating and raising a maypole, dancing and other activities.

==== Illinois ====

In the Chicago area, Midsummer is celebrated in several locations. The historically Swedish neighborhood of Andersonville is prominent among them. A stretch of Clark street is sectioned off for three days and there are vendors, live music, and a raising of the maypole. Geneva hosts a Swedish Day () festival on the third Sunday of June. The event, featuring maypole-raising, dancing, and presentation of an authentic Viking ship, dates back to 1911.

==== Kansas ====
Lindsborg, Kansas, commonly called Little Sweden, hosts an annual Midsummer celebration in honor of its 1869 Swedish founding. The festival includes a 5K Run, free swim at the local pool, Kubb tournament, Swedish dancing, craft demonstrations, and food vendors, including the Lindsborg Swedish Folkdancers serving Viking-on-a-Stick. The town is also the home of the Swedish Pavilion historic site, built as an international exposition building for the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair and features a maypole year-round.

==== Maine ====
New Sweden, Maine. Ever since 51 Swedish immigrants came to Aroostook County, Maine in 1870, supported by a Legislative Act authored by William W. Thomas Jr., who had served as American Consul in Sweden under Abraham Lincoln, residents of the town have celebrated Midsommar. Celebrations are usually held the weekend before the holiday in Sweden and merge Swedish traditions such as the decorating and raising of the Midsommar pole, folk dancing, and feasting alongside American traditions. Thomas Jr. selected this region for a Swedish colony, in part, because the landscape, flora and fauna are similar to that of Dalarna County, Sweden.

==== Michigan ====
In Kaleva, is celebrated annually on or near the Summer Solstice by Gathering at the Village Roadside Park. Traditionally (Finnish Oven Baked Pancake) and strawberry shortcake is enjoyed followed by a bonfire or . was founded in 1900 by Finnish immigrants.

==== Oregon ====
The Astoria Scandinavian Midsummer Festival has been a tradition on the North Coast of Oregon for over forty years. The Festival takes place typically on the 3rd full weekend of June. The festival embodies the rich cultural heritage that was transplanted to the Astoria, Oregon, region by emigrating Scandinavians. In the Pacific Northwest, they found the same bounteous seas and forests as in their native lands and the demand for their skills at managing them.

==== New York ====
The NYC Swedish Midsummer celebrations in Battery Park, New York City, attracts some 3,000–5,000 people annually, which makes it one of the largest celebrations after the ones held in Leksand and at the Skansen Park in Stockholm. Sweden Day, a Midsummer celebration which also honors Swedish heritage and history, has been held annually on the sound in Throgs Neck in New York since 1941. Swedish Midsummer is also celebrated in other places with large Swedish and Scandinavian populations, such as Rockford, Illinois, Chicago, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Lindsborg, Kansas. The Swedish &quot;language village&quot; (summer camp) , run by Concordia College in Minnesota, also celebrates Midsummer.

==== Washington ====
The Seattle neighborhood of Fremont puts on a large Summer Solstice Parade and Pageant, which for many years has controversially included painted naked cyclists. In St. Edwards Park in Kenmore, the Skandia Folkdance Society hosts , which includes a Scandinavian solstice pole.

<text>Hemoptysis or haemoptysis is the discharge of blood or blood-stained mucus through the mouth coming from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs. It does not necessarily involve coughing. In other words, it is the airway bleeding. This can occur with lung cancer, infections such as tuberculosis, bronchitis, or pneumonia, and certain cardiovascular conditions. Hemoptysis is considered massive at . In such cases, there are always severe injuries. The primary danger comes from choking, rather than blood loss.

==Diagnosis==

* Past history, history of present illness, family history
** history of tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, mitral stenosis, etc.
** history of cigarette smoking, occupational diseases by exposure to silica dust, etc.
* Blood
** duration, frequency, amount
** Amounts of blood: large amounts of blood, or there is blood-streaked sputum
** Probable source of bleeding: Is the blood coughed up, or vomited?
* Bloody sputum
** color, characters: blood-streaked, fresh blood, frothy pink, bloody gelatinous.
* Accompanying symptoms
** fever, chest pain, coughing, purulent sputum, mucocutaneous bleeding, jaundice.
* Imaging examination
** chest X-ray, CT scan and 3D reconstruction images or CT virtual bronchoscopy, bronchial angiography.
* Laboratory tests
** blood test: WBC
** Sputum: cells and bacterial examinations, sputum culture
* Bronchial fiber endoscopy

==Differential diagnosis==

The most common causes for hemoptysis in adults are chest infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia. In children, hemoptysis is commonly caused by the presence of a foreign body in the airway. Other common causes include lung cancers and tuberculosis. Less common causes include aspergilloma, bronchiectasis, coccidioidomycosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonic plague, and cystic fibrosis. Rarer causes include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome), Goodpasture&#x27;s syndrome, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. A rare cause of hemoptysis in women is endometriosis, which leads to intermittent hemoptysis coinciding with menstrual periods in 7% of women with thoracic endometriosis syndrome. Hemoptysis may be exacerbated or even caused by overtreatment with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin.

Blood-laced mucus from the sinus or nose area can sometimes be misidentified as symptomatic of hemoptysis (such secretions can be a sign of nasal or sinus cancer, but also a sinus infection). Extensive non-respiratory injury can also cause one to cough up blood. Cardiac causes like congestive heart failure and mitral stenosis should be ruled out. The origin of blood can be identified by observing its color. Bright-red, foamy blood comes from the respiratory tract, whereas dark-red, coffee-colored blood comes from the gastrointestinal tract. Sometimes hemoptysis may be rust-colored.
* Lung cancer, including both non-small cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma.
* Sarcoidosis
* Aspergilloma
* Tuberculosis
* Histoplasmosis
* Pneumonia
* Pulmonary edema
* Endometriosis and thoracic endometriosis syndrome
* Foreign body aspiration and aspiration pneumonia
* Goodpasture&#x27;s syndrome
* Microscopic polyangiitis
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* Bronchitis
* Bronchiectasis
* Pulmonary embolism
* Anticoagulant use
* Trauma
* Lung abscess
* Mitral stenosis
* Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia
* Bleeding disorders
* Hughes-Stovin syndrome and other variants of Behçet&#x27;s disease
* Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations

== Massive hemoptysis and mortality ==

Although there are reports that the fatality rate is as high as 80%, the mortality rate for hospitalized hemoptysis patients is 9.4% (with n=28539), calculated from the data in the article by Kinoshita et al. This is probably the most reasonable figure considering the overwhelming number of cases.

The general definition of massive hemoptysis is more than 200 ml within 24 hours, but there is a wide range in the literature (100–600 ml). Considering that the total volume of the tracheal and bronchial lumen is about 150 cc, it may be reasonable to define massive hemoptysis as 200 ml, which is a little more than 150 ml, in terms of setting the threshold for fatal hemoptysis. More than 400ml/day is not adequate for screening purposes.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Treatments include iced saline, and topical vasoconstrictors such as adrenaline or vasopressin. Tranexamic acid was proved to improve in-hospital mortality. Selective bronchial intubation can be used to collapse the lung that is bleeding. Also, endobronchial tamponade can be used. Laser photocoagulation can be used to stop bleeding during bronchoscopy. Angiography of bronchial arteries can be performed to locate the bleeding, and it can often be embolized. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is the first line treatment nowadays. Surgical option is usually the last resort and can involve removal of a lung lobe or removal of the entire lung. Cough suppressants can increase the risk of choking.

<text>Muhammad Naji Shawkat [[Bey]] () (May 26, 1891 – May 11, 1980) was an Iraqi politician who served as the prime minister of Iraq under King Faisal I.

== Early life==
Muhammad Naji Shawkat was born to an Arabized family of Georgian origins in the Iraqi town of al-Kut where his father was stationed as provincial governor. He had three brothers: Saaib, Sami and Rifat and a sister. Concurrent with Naji&#x27;s conclusion of his school education in Baghdad, his father was elected to the Ottoman parliament of 1909, thereby providing him with the opportunity to join the Ottoman Law School in Istanbul.

==Military service==
Naji Shawkat was the assistant general prosecutor in the Iraqi city of al-Hila when World War I broke out, upon which he interrupted his legal career and joined the Ottoman army as a reserve officer. After two years of involvement in the Ottoman military defense of Iraq, Shawkat was captured by the advancing British troops in March 1917. He was subsequently taken to a British Indian prison camp where he, like many other detained Arab officers, was offered the choice of joining the Arab Revolt, an offer he promptly accepted.

== Political career ==

=== Naji Shawkat Ministry ===
The Ministry of Naji Shawkat consisted of the following ministers:

* Finance Minister, Nusrat Al-Farsi
* Minister of Justice, Jamil Al-Wadi
* Minister of Economy and Communications, Jalal Baban
* Minister of Defense, Rashid Al-Khoja
* Foreign Minister, Abdul Qadir Rashid
* Minister of Education, Abbas Mahdi

=== Prime Minister of Iraq ===
In 1932, Shawkat was called on by Faisal to head a non-partisan government that was intended to clear the political congestion which accompanied the signing of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty. Faced with strong opposition from within the Iraqi political establishment and the anti-treaty campaign, Shawkat&#x27;s government lasted only five months. Thereafter, he was appointed as representative of Iraq in Ankara where he cultivated strong relations with the Turkish ruling circles and developed a sense of admiration for modern Turkey.

Afterwards, Shawkat worked as a minister in Ankara. During the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état, he was appointed at the Minister of Interior. Following the fall of the regime in the Anglo-Iraqi War, Shawkat fled to Iran, then to South Africa. He was later brought to trial in Iraq and sentenced to 15 years in prison for treason by a military court. Shawkat was pardoned in 1948.

<doc id="221244" wikidata="Q816022" url="?curid=221244" title="Bellman–Ford algorithm">
<text>The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
It is slower than Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers. The algorithm was first proposed by , but is instead named after Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr., who published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively. Edward F. Moore also published a variation of the algorithm in 1959, and for this reason it is also sometimes called the Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.

Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs. This is why this algorithm is useful.
If a graph contains a &quot;negative cycle&quot; (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from the source, then there is no &quot;cheapest&quot; path: any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle. In such a case, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect and report the negative cycle.

== Algorithm ==

Like Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, Bellman–Ford proceeds by relaxation, in which approximations to the correct distance are replaced by better ones until they eventually reach the solution. In both algorithms, the approximate distance to each vertex is always an overestimate of the true distance, and is replaced by the minimum of its old value and the length of a newly found path.

However, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm uses a priority queue to greedily select the closest vertex that has not yet been processed, and performs this relaxation process on all of its outgoing edges; by contrast, the Bellman–Ford algorithm simply relaxes &quot;all&quot; the edges, and does this formula_1 times, where formula_2 is the number of vertices in the graph.

In each of these repetitions, the number of vertices with correctly calculated distances grows, from which it follows that eventually all vertices will have their correct distances. This method allows the Bellman–Ford algorithm to be applied to a wider class of inputs than Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm. The intermediate answers depend on the order of edges relaxed, but the final answer remains the same.

Bellman–Ford runs in formula_3 time, where formula_2 and formula_5 are the number of vertices and edges respectively.

 function BellmanFord(&quot;list&quot; vertices, &quot;list&quot; edges, &quot;vertex&quot; source) is
 &quot;// This implementation takes in a graph, represented as&quot;
 &quot;// lists of vertices (represented as integers [0..n-1]) and edges,&quot;
 &quot;// and fills two arrays (distance and predecessor) holding&quot;
 &quot;// the shortest path from the source to each vertex&quot;
 distance := &quot;list&quot; of size &quot;n&quot;
 predecessor := &quot;list&quot; of size &quot;n&quot;
 &quot;// Step 1: initialize graph&quot;
 for each vertex v in vertices do
 // Initialize the distance to all vertices to infinity
 distance[v] := inf
 // And having a null predecessor
 predecessor[v] := null
 // The distance from the source to itself is zero
 distance[source] := 0
 &quot;// Step 2: relax edges repeatedly&quot;
 repeat |V|−1 times:
 for each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges do
 if distance[u] + w &lt; distance[v] then
 distance[v] := distance[u] + w
 predecessor[v] := u
 &quot;// Step 3: check for negative-weight cycles&quot;
 for each edge (u, v) with weight w in edges do
 if distance[u] + w &lt; distance[v] then
 predecessor[v] := u
 &quot;// A negative cycle exists; find a vertex on the cycle &quot;
 visited := &quot;list&quot; of size &quot;n&quot; initialized with false
 visited[v] := true
 while &quot;not&quot; visited[u] do
 visited[u] := true
 u := predecessor[u]
 &quot;// u is a vertex in a negative cycle, find the cycle itself&quot;
 ncycle := [u]
 v := predecessor[u]
 while v != u do
 ncycle := concatenate([v], ncycle)
 v := predecessor[v]
 error &quot;Graph contains a negative-weight cycle&quot;, ncycle
 return distance, predecessor

Simply put, the algorithm initializes the distance to the source to 0 and all other nodes to infinity. Then for all edges, if the distance to the destination can be shortened by taking the edge, the distance is updated to the new lower value.

The core of the algorithm is a loop that scans across all edges at every loop. For every formula_6, at the end of the formula_7-th iteration, from any vertex , following the predecessor trail recorded in yields a path that has a total weight that is at most , and further, is a lower bound to the length of any path from source to that uses at most edges.

Since the longest possible path without a cycle can be formula_1 edges, the edges must be scanned formula_1 times to ensure the shortest path has been found for all nodes. A final scan of all the edges is performed and if any distance is updated, then a path of length formula_2 edges has been found which can only occur if at least one negative cycle exists in the graph.

The edge (u, v) that is found in step 3 must be reachable from a negative cycle, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily part of the cycle itself, which is why it&#x27;s necessary to follow the path of predecessors backwards until a cycle is detected. The above pseudo-code uses a Boolean array (codice_1) to find a vertex on the cycle, but any cycle finding algorithm can be used to find a vertex on the cycle.

A common improvement when implementing the algorithm is to return early when an iteration of step 2 fails to relax any edges, which implies all shortest paths have been found, and therefore there are no negative cycles. In that case, the complexity of the algorithm is reduced from formula_3 to formula_12 where formula_13 is the maximum length of a shortest path in the graph.

== Proof of correctness ==

The correctness of the algorithm can be shown by induction:

Lemma. After &quot;i&quot; repetitions of &quot;for&quot; loop,
* if Distance(&quot;u&quot;) is not infinity, it is equal to the length of some path from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;u&quot;; and
* if there is a path from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;u&quot; with at most &quot;i&quot; edges, then Distance(u) is at most the length of the shortest path from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;u&quot; with at most &quot;i&quot; edges.

Proof. For the base case of induction, consider codice_2 and the moment before &quot;for&quot; loop is executed for the first time. Then, for the source vertex, codice_3, which is correct. For other vertices &quot;u&quot;, codice_4, which is also correct because there is no path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;u&quot; with 0 edges.

For the inductive case, we first prove the first part. Consider a moment when a vertex&#x27;s distance is updated by
codice_5. By inductive assumption, codice_6 is the length of some path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;u&quot;. Then codice_7 is the length of the path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;v&quot; that follows the path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;u&quot; and then goes to &quot;v&quot;.

For the second part, consider a shortest path &quot;P&quot; (there may be more than one) from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;v&quot; with at most &quot;i&quot; edges. Let &quot;u&quot; be the last vertex before &quot;v&quot; on this path. Then, the part of the path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;u&quot; is a shortest path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;u&quot; with at most &quot;i-1&quot; edges, since if it were not, then there must be some strictly shorter path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;u&quot; with at most &quot;i-1&quot; edges, and we could then append the edge &quot;uv&quot; to this path to obtain a path with at most &quot;i&quot; edges that is strictly shorter than &quot;P&quot;—a contradiction. By inductive assumption, codice_6 after &quot;i&quot;−1 iterations is at most the length of this path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;u&quot;. Therefore, codice_9 is at most the length of &quot;P&quot;. In the &quot;ith&quot; iteration, codice_10 gets compared with codice_9, and is set equal to it if codice_9 is smaller. Therefore, after &quot;i&quot; iterations, codice_10 is at most the length of &quot;P&quot;, i.e., the length of the shortest path from &quot;source&quot; to &quot;v&quot; that uses at most &quot;i&quot; edges.

If there are no negative-weight cycles, then every shortest path visits each vertex at most once, so at step 3 no further improvements can be made. Conversely, suppose no improvement can be made. Then for any cycle with vertices &quot;v&quot;[0], ..., &quot;v&quot;[&quot;k&quot;−1],

codice_14

Summing around the cycle, the &quot;v&quot;[&quot;i&quot;].distance and &quot;v&quot;[&quot;i&quot;−1 (mod &quot;k&quot;)].distance terms cancel, leaving

codice_15

I.e., every cycle has nonnegative weight.

== Finding negative cycles ==
When the algorithm is used to find shortest paths, the existence of negative cycles is a problem, preventing the algorithm from finding a correct answer. However, since it terminates upon finding a negative cycle, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can be used for applications in which this is the target to be sought – for example in cycle-cancelling techniques in network flow analysis.

== Applications in routing ==

A distributed variant of the Bellman–Ford algorithm is used in distance-vector routing protocols, for example the Routing Information Protocol (RIP). The algorithm is distributed because it involves a number of nodes (routers) within an Autonomous system (AS), a collection of IP networks typically owned by an ISP.
It consists of the following steps:

# Each node calculates the distances between itself and all other nodes within the AS and stores this information as a table.
# Each node sends its table to all neighboring nodes.
# When a node receives distance tables from its neighbors, it calculates the shortest routes to all other nodes and updates its own table to reflect any changes.
The main disadvantages of the Bellman–Ford algorithm in this setting are as follows:

* It does not scale well.
* Changes in network topology are not reflected quickly since updates are spread node-by-node.
* Count to infinity if link or node failures render a node unreachable from some set of other nodes, those nodes may spend forever gradually increasing their estimates of the distance to it, and in the meantime there may be routing loops.
== Improvements ==
The Bellman–Ford algorithm may be improved in practice (although not in the worst case) by the observation that, if an iteration of the main loop of the algorithm terminates without making any changes, the algorithm can be immediately terminated, as subsequent iterations will not make any more changes. With this early termination condition, the main loop may in some cases use many fewer than iterations, even though the worst case of the algorithm remains unchanged. The following improvements all maintain the formula_3 worst-case time complexity.

A variation of the Bellman–Ford algorithm described by , reduces the number of relaxation steps that need to be performed within each iteration of the algorithm. If a vertex &quot;v&quot; has a distance value that has not changed since the last time the edges out of &quot;v&quot; were relaxed, then there is no need to relax the edges out of &quot;v&quot; a second time. In this way, as the number of vertices with correct distance values grows, the number whose outgoing edges that need to be relaxed in each iteration shrinks, leading to a constant-factor savings in time for dense graphs. This variation can be implemented by keeping a collection of vertices whose outgoing edges need to be relaxed, removing a vertex from this collection when its edges are relaxed, and adding to the collection any vertex whose distance value is changed by a relaxation step. In China, this algorithm was popularized by Fanding Duan, who rediscovered it in 1994, as the &quot;shortest path faster algorithm&quot;.

 described another improvement to the Bellman–Ford algorithm. His improvement first assigns some arbitrary linear order on all vertices and then partitions the set of all edges into two subsets. The first subset, &quot;Ef&quot;, contains all edges (&quot;vi&quot;, &quot;vj&quot;) such that &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot;; the second, &quot;Eb&quot;, contains edges (&quot;vi&quot;, &quot;vj&quot;) such that &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;j&quot;. Each vertex is visited in the order , relaxing each outgoing edge from that vertex in &quot;Ef&quot;. Each vertex is then visited in the order , relaxing each outgoing edge from that vertex in &quot;Eb&quot;. Each iteration of the main loop of the algorithm, after the first one, adds at least two edges to the set of edges whose relaxed distances match the correct shortest path distances: one from &quot;Ef&quot; and one from &quot;Eb&quot;. This modification reduces the worst-case number of iterations of the main loop of the algorithm from to formula_15.

Another improvement, by , replaces the arbitrary linear order of the vertices used in Yen&#x27;s second improvement by a random permutation. This change makes the worst case for Yen&#x27;s improvement (in which the edges of a shortest path strictly alternate between the two subsets &quot;Ef&quot; and &quot;Eb&quot;) very unlikely to happen. With a randomly permuted vertex ordering, the expected number of iterations needed in the main loop is at most formula_16.

, at Georgetown University, created an improved algorithm that with high probability, runs in formula_17 time.

<text>The regions of Italy () are the first-level administrative divisions of the Italian Republic, constituting its second NUTS administrative level. There are twenty regions, five of which are autonomous regions with special status. Under the Constitution of Italy, each region is an autonomous entity with defined powers. With the exception of the Aosta Valley (since 1945), each region is divided into a number of provinces.

==History==
During the Kingdom of Italy, regions were mere statistical districts of the central state. Under the Republic, they were granted a measure of political autonomy by the 1948 Italian Constitution. The original draft list comprised the Salento region (which was eventually included in Apulia); &quot;Friuli&quot; and &quot;Venezia Giulia&quot; were separate regions, and Basilicata was named &quot;Lucania&quot;. Abruzzo and Molise were identified as separate regions in the first draft, but were later merged into &quot;Abruzzi e Molise&quot; in the final constitution of 1948, before being separated in 1963.

Implementation of regional autonomy was postponed until the first Regional elections of 1970. The ruling Christian Democracy party did not want the opposition Italian Communist Party to gain power in the regions where it was historically rooted (the &quot;red belt&quot; of Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria and the Marches).

Regions acquired a significant level of autonomy following a constitutional reform in 2001 (brought about by a centre-left government and confirmed by popular referendum), which granted them residual policy competence. A further federalist reform was proposed by the regionalist party and in 2005, the centre-right government led by Silvio Berlusconi proposed a new reform that would have greatly increased the power of regions.

The proposals, which had been particularly associated with , and seen by some as leading the way to a federal state, were rejected in the 2006 Italian constitutional referendum by 61.7% &quot;no&quot; to 38.3% &quot;yes&quot;. The results varied considerably among the regions, ranging from 55.3% in favour in Veneto to 82% against in Calabria.

==Political control==
Number of regions governed by each coalition since 1995:


==Regions==
==Macroregions==
Macroregions are the first-level NUTS of the European Union.(it)

==Status==

Every region has a statute that serves as a regional constitution, determining the form of government and the fundamental principles of the organization and the functioning of the region, as prescribed by the &quot;Constitution of Italy&quot; (). Although all the regions except Tuscany define themselves in various ways as an &quot;autonomous Region&quot; in the first article of their Statutes, fifteen regions have ordinary statutes and five have special statutes, granting them extended autonomy.

===Regions with ordinary statute===
These regions, whose statutes are approved by their regional councils, were created in 1970, even though the Italian Constitution dates back to 1948. Since the constitutional reform of 2001 they have had residual legislative powers: &quot;the regions have exclusive legislative power with respect to any matters not expressly reserved to state law&quot; (). Yet their financial autonomy is quite modest: they keep just 20% of all levied taxes, mostly used to finance the region-based healthcare system.

===Autonomous regions with special statute===
 of the Italian Constitution grants home rule to five regions, namely the Aosta Valley, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sardinia, Sicily, and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, allowing them some legislative, administrative and financial power to a varying extent, depending on their specific statute. These regions became autonomous in order to take into account cultural differences and protect linguistic minorities. Moreover, the government wanted to prevent them from potentially seceding or being taken away from Italy after the defeat in World War II.

==Institutions==
Each region has an elected parliament, called &quot;Consiglio Regionale&quot; (regional council), or &quot;Assemblea Regionale&quot; (regional assembly) in Sicily, and a government called &quot;Giunta Regionale&quot; (regional committee), headed by a governor called &quot;Presidente della Giunta Regionale&quot; (president of the regional committee) or &quot;Presidente della Regione&quot; (regional president). The latter is directly elected by the citizens of each region, with the exceptions of Aosta Valley and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regions where the president is chosen by the regional council.

Under the 1995 electoral law, the winning coalition receives an absolute majority of seats on the council. The president chairs the &quot;giunta&quot;, and nominates or dismisses its members, called &quot;assessori&quot;. If the directly elected president resigns, new elections are called immediately.

In the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region, the regional council is made up of the joint session of the two provincial councils of Trentino and of South Tyrol. The regional president is one of the two provincial commissioners.

==Representation in the Senate==

Article 57 of the Constitution of Italy originally established that the Senate of the Republic was to be elected on a regional basis by Italian citizens aged 25 or older (unlike the Chamber of the Deputies, which was elected on a national basis and by all Italian citizens aged 18 or older). No region could have less than 7 senators, except for the two smallest regions: Aosta Valley (1 senator) and Molise (2 senators). From 2006 to 2020, 6 out of 315 senators (and 12 out of 630 deputies) were elected by Italians residing abroad.

After two constitutional amendments were passed respectively in 2020 (by constitutional referendum) and 2021, however, there have been changes. The Senate is still elected on a regional basis, but the number of senators was reduced from 315 to 200, who are now elected by all citizens aged 18 or older, just like deputies (themselves being reduced from 630 to 400). Italians residing abroad now elect 4 senators (and 8 deputies).

The remaining 196 senators are assigned to each region proportionally according to their population. The amended Article 57 of the Constitution provides that no region can have fewer than 3 senators representing it, barring Aosta Valley and Molise, which retained 1 and 2 senators respectively.

<doc id="221252" wikidata="Q1054726" url="?curid=221252" title="Contract of sale">
<text>In contract law, a contract of sale, sales contract, sales order, or contract for sale is a legal contract for the purchase of assets (goods or property) by a buyer (or purchaser) from a seller (or vendor) for an agreed upon value in money (or money equivalent).

An obvious ancient practice of exchange, in many common law jurisdictions it is now governed by statutory law. See commercial law.

Contracts of sale involving goods are governed by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code in most jurisdictions in the United States. In Quebec, such contracts are governed by the Civil Code of Quebec as a nominate contract in the book on the law of obligations. In some Muslim countries it is governed by sharia (Islamic law); however, many Muslim countries apply other law to contacts (e.g. the Egyptian Civil Code, based on the Napoleonic Code, which beyond its application in Egypt serves as the model for the civil codes of several other Arab states).

A contract of sale lays out the terms of a transaction of goods or services, identifying the goods sold, listing delivery instructions, inspection period, any warranties and details of payment.

==Formation and stages==
According to the Civil Code of the Philippines Article 1458, the contract of sale has three stages: negotiation, perfection, and consummation.

*Negotiation begins when prospective contracting parties indicate interest in the contract, ending with its finalization.
*Perfection begins upon the concurrence of the elements of sale. These elements include the meeting of the minds, determinate subject matter or object, and the price certain in money or its equivalent.
*Consummation happens when the parties perform their respective undertaking, resulting to the extinguishment of the contract.

In the United States, according to the Uniform Commercial Code Article 2, the contract of sale can be formed in different ways: (1) offer and acceptance, where a sale begins with an offer and acceptance; (2) firm offers, where a merchant&#x27;s written offer remains open for a specified time; and (3) battle of the forms, where conflicting terms in exchanged forms are resolved by the UCC.
