<doc id="225760" wikidata="Q164027" url="?curid=225760" title="Santiago Bernabéu Stadium">
<text>Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (, ) is a retractable roof football stadium in Madrid, Spain. With a seating capacity of 78,297 the stadium has the second-largest seating capacity for a football stadium in Spain. It has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.

Named after footballer and Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu (1895–1978), the stadium is one of the world&#x27;s most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980, 2010. The stadium also hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Finals, making Santiago Bernabéu the only stadium to host the two most important premier continental cup finals (UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores).

The final matches for the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA Euro final and a FIFA World Cup final.

==History==
=== Origins and construction ===
In the early 1940s, the old Campo de Chamartín had become too small for the growing population of Madrid and the increasing popularity of football. Despite successive renovations that had expanded its capacity to 25,000 seats, the stadium was still insufficient for the club&#x27;s needs. Faced with this situation, in the spring of 1943, President Antonio Santos Peralba expressed the need to build a new stadium with an initial capacity of 40,000 spectators, although the club&#x27;s financial difficulties raised uncertainties about its realization.

With the arrival of Santiago Bernabéu to the presidency in September 1943, the plan for the new stadium gained decisive and much more ambitious momentum. In his first meeting with the Board of Directors, Bernabéu declared: &quot;Gentlemen, we need a bigger field and we are going to build it&quot;. Bernabéu&#x27;s vision was to build an even larger stadium than the one proposed by Peralba, with a capacity close to 75,000 spectators. Bernabéu firmly believed that a larger stadium would allow the club to raise more money, which in turn would enable the club to grow, sign better players, and attract more fans, creating a virtuous cycle that would benefit the team in the long run. On 1 November 1943, the Board of Directors visited the land adjacent to the Campo de Chamartín, located in the extension of the Paseo de la Castellana, to analyze its possible expansion. These lands belonged to the &quot;Villa Ulpiana&quot; estate and another known as &quot;Entrecanales,&quot; owned by the Maqueda and Chávarri families. Shortly thereafter, negotiations began to acquire them for a total cost of 3,000,000 pesetas.

On 22 June 1944, the land acquisitions were formalized before a notary: 256,667 square feet for 2,000,000 pesetas from the Ruiz del Villar family and 93,877 square feet for 1,001,069 pesetas from the Maqueda and Chávarri families. Additionally, the necessary expropriations for the urbanization of the area, including the future streets Concha Espina and Plaza de los Sagrados Corazones, cost 1,000,000 pesetas.

To choose the design for the new stadium, a Competition of Ideas and Sketches was organized, in which renowned architects participated. The architects Pedro Muguruza and Javier Barroso, former goalkeepers of Athletic de Madrid and friends of Bernabéu, were part of the jury along with board members Fernando de Cárcer Disdier, first vice president, and Pedro Méndez Cuesta, board member responsible for the field and an architect by profession. In September 1944, after evaluating the seven submitted projects, the jury awarded the first prize to the design of Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler. The award-winning works were exhibited at the Círculo de Bellas Artes, where they sparked great interest and debate among fans.

On 27 October 1944, the land was blessed, and construction was symbolically initiated with a groundbreaking strike by Santiago Bernabéu.

The financing of the construction presented significant challenges due to the distrust of members and banking entities. Despite the skepticism of many people, including some members and supporters, regarding the project&#x27;s feasibility, Bernabéu remained steadfast in his purpose. In a context where banks did not consider football a safe investment and where official support from sports organizations was not obtainable, Bernabéu delegated to treasurer Luis Corrales Ferras the task of designing an innovative financing plan. This plan involved the issuance of bonds with mortgage guarantees on the club&#x27;s properties.

The next step was crucial: Bernabéu presented this plan to Rafael Salgado, president of Banco Mercantil e Industrial and a Real Madrid supporter. Thanks to Bernabéu&#x27;s passionate and detailed explanation, Salgado agreed to finance the project, convinced of the viability and potential of the new stadium. This decision was crucial for the project&#x27;s realization, and in recognition of his support, one of the streets adjacent to the stadium bears his name.

The financing plan was structured into three staggered bond issues:

* First issue of 20,000 bonds for a total of 10,000,000 pesetas on 9 November 1944.
* Second issue of 30,000 bonds for 15,000,000 pesetas on 18 March 1946.
* Third issue of 10,000 bonds totaling 5,000,000 pesetas on 8 October 1947.

All the issues were covered on the day they were released to the Stock Market, thanks to the enthusiasm and confidence of the members, even the most modest ones. The plan was a complete success and allowed for staggered financing adjusted to the construction needs.

The construction was awarded to the company Huarte y Compañía, S.A., beginning in June 1945 under the direction of architects Alemany and Muñoz Monasterio and with the collaboration of civil engineer Carlos Fernández Casado. Over 30 months, the works faced numerous obstacles, from the shortage of basic materials in post-war Spain to technical difficulties due to a nearby railway link popularly known as the &quot;tunnel of laughter&quot;. However, the project progressed with enthusiasm and dedication.

The construction of the new field took place on the grounds of the old field and on the lands of Villa Ulpiana, which could have disrupted the club&#x27;s life. However, this only happened from 1946 when Real Madrid was forced to play home games at the Stadium Metropolitano during the 1946-47 season and in five matches of the 1947-48 season. Despite these inconveniences, Real Madrid maintained its sports activities while the new stadium took shape over part of the old site and on the adjacent lands.

This is how Fernando de Cárcer Disdier, the club&#x27;s first vice president, summarized the development of the construction in 1947:

The total cost of the works, in round numbers, was broken down into the following items:

# Land. Acquisitions, capital gains, real rights, stamps, writing expenses, cancellation of commitments, and lifting of the mortgage on the old Chamartín: 4,500,000 pesetas.
# Loans. Costs of the same: 2,000,000 pesetas.
# Works. Material execution of the stadium: 28,000,000 pesetas. Execution of the office: 1,500,000 pesetas.
# Fees. Architects, quantity surveyors, and awards from the Ideas and Sketches Competition: 1,300,000 pesetas.
# Compensation for Expropriations of land carried out by the City Council: 1,000,000 pesetas.
Total disbursed: 38,300,000 pesetas (230,183 euros).

=== Opening ===
The stadium was inaugurated on 14 December 1947 with a match between Real Madrid and the Portuguese side Os Belenenses. After the preliminaries, at 15:30 referee Pedro Escartín from the Madrid school started the match. Real Madrid striker Sabino Barinaga scored the first goal in the 15th minute with a header. At the end of the match, Barinaga received a recognition pennant. Afterward, players and managers of both teams celebrated with a dinner. The first official match took place on 28 December 1947 on matchday 12 of La Liga against Atlético de Bilbao, which had been postponed due to the inauguration of the stadium. The match was refereed by José Fombona Fernández from the Asturian school and ended with a 5–1 victory for &quot;Los Blancos&quot;. The first goal was scored in the 4th minute by Madrid midfielder Chus Alonso after receiving a pass from Barinaga.

The stadium&#x27;s official name at the time was , although it continued to be known among fans as () or simply . The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans.

===1950s===

The first major renovation occurred in 1955. On 19 June of that year, the stadium expanded to accommodate 125,000 spectators. Thus, the Madrid coliseum became the biggest stadium of all the participants of the newly established European Cup.

On 4 January 1955, after the General Assembly of Members Compromisaros, it was decided that the stadium adopt its present name in honour of club President Santiago Bernabéu.

In March 1957, floodlights were installed to allow nighttime games. On 18 May of the same year, the new floodlights were officially inaugurated in a game against Brazilian club Sport Recife, which Real Madrid won 5–3.

===1960s and 1970s===
In 1965, the transfer of all the club&#x27;s offices to the stadium was completed, which previously had been moved between multiple venues in the capital.

On 14 December 1972, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the Santiago Bernabéu&#x27;s inauguration, the first electronic scoreboard was installed inside the stadium and later utilized for the first time in a friendly match against the same rival that Madrid faced in 1947, the Portuguese Belenenses. The match ended with a 2–1 Real victory. Days before the scoreboard had already been used for the farewell ceremony of the Madrid legend Paco Gento.

===1980s===
The next big changes did not occur until the early 1980s with the hosting of the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. The stadium had to adapt to the changing times and with this, architects Rafael Luis Alemany and Manuel Salinas were hired for the stadium&#x27;s renovation project. The brothers were sons of Luis Alemany Soler, who carried out the original construction project next to Muñoz Monasterio. The work lasted 16 months and had a cost of 704 million pesetas (US $4.7 million), of which 530 million was paid by the City of Madrid.

The improvements included a number of points. First, FIFA forced two-thirds of the seating area to be covered. For this reason, Real Madrid installed a roof covering the perimeter of the first and second tiers of seating, except the east side. The stadium&#x27;s capacity was reduced from 120,000 to 90,000 spectators, starting downsizing in 1978. 24,550 of which were covered by the new roof. The project also involved remodeling the façade, the installation of new electronic signs in the north and south ends, as well as the renovation of the press areas, lockers rooms, access, and ancillary areas.

The stadium hosted four matches in the World Cup: three second-round Group Two matches (West Germany vs. England, West Germany vs. Spain, and Spain vs. England) and the prestigious final match (Italy vs. West Germany). The final between Italy and Germany was played in front of a sold out stadium of 90,000 people.

===1990s===
Following a series of spectator fatalities in the 1980s (most notably the Heysel Stadium in Belgium and the Hillsborough Stadium in England), English authorities released the Taylor Report on how to improve football spectator safety in English venues. UEFA followed suit across Europe. The stadium was forced to create separate shortcuts to different stadium sections and seats for all spectators.

In 1992, the board of Ramón Mendoza awarded an expansion and renovation project to Gines Navarro Construcciones, S.A. The work started on 7 February 1992 and concluded on 7 May 1994 with a final cost of more than 5 billion pesetas, substantially raising the debt of the club, which no longer had any institutional support. The work concluded with the creation of an amphitheater on the west side and in the foundations, as well as the opening of the new commercial center, &quot;La esquina del Bernabéu.&quot; In total, 20,200 upgraded seats were installed, with each seat having a tilt of 87 degrees, ensuring a perfect view and proximity to the pitch. In addition, four entrance towers were erected on the outside, each with two staircases and a central spiral ramp, so the spectators could access the new tier and exit more quickly.

With the new structure, the height of the stadium was increased from 22 m to 45 m. This caused problems during the winter, leaving two-thirds of the field of play in the shade. This lack of sunlight led to grass deterioration on the pitch. For this reason, a polypropylene pipe network was installed at a 20 cm depth under the pitch. At over 30 km long the pipe system circulates hot water, keeping the turf from freezing in cold temperatures.

Also, due to the height of the stand, it was necessary to improve and increase the lighting capability. A retractable protective roof was also installed to protect the fans from the elements. After the renovation, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was 106,000 spectators.

In 1997, with Lorenzo Sanz as president, UEFA required the Santiago Bernabéu to adopt an all-seating arrangement, bringing its capacity down from 106,000 to 74,328 spectators.

On 20 May 1999, the Tour Bernabéu opened, along with the club museum.

===2000s===

As the club kept growing in all regards, thoughts for further changes to the stadium appeared. When Florentino Pérez became the president of the club, he launched a &quot;Master Plan&quot; with one goal: to improve the comfort of the Santiago Bernabéu and the quality of its facilities, and maximise revenue for the stadium.

Pérez invested €127 million in five years (2001–2006) by adding an expansion to the east side of the stadium, as well as adding a new façade on Father Damien street, new boxes and VIP areas, new dressing rooms, a new stage in honour of the east side, a new press area (also located on the east side), a new audio system, new bars, integration of heating in the stands, panoramic lifts, new restaurants, escalators in the tower access, and implementation of the multipurpose building in Father Damien street. Following the enlargement of the lateral east side and the creation of new galleries, the capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu was expanded to 80,354, all seated.

After these renovations, on 14 November 2007, one month before the 60th anniversary of the stadium&#x27;s opening, UEFA awarded the Santiago Bernabéu the category of Elite Stadium and designated it as the venue for the 2010 UEFA Champions League final.

===2010s===
In the summer of 2011, expansion work was carried out in the first amphitheater, adding an additional row to the overhang of the grandstand, which increased the capacity by 900 seats, reaching a total capacity of 81,044 spectators. In December 2018, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium was selected as the venue for the second leg of the Copa Libertadores de América final, becoming the first stadium in the world to host the final of four of the five most important tournaments in the world: the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA European Championship, the Copa América, the Copa Libertadores de América, and the UEFA Champions League.

==== Renovation 2019–2024 ====

After investing a total of 256 million euros since 2000, the Board of Directors, led by Florentino Pérez, decided to take advantage of the stadium&#x27;s prime location to launch an ambitious renovation project with a dual objective: to transform the Santiago Bernabéu into a global icon of sports architecture and to make it one of the club&#x27;s main sources of direct revenue, allowing it to continue competing economically with clubs owned by large private capital in the future.

This proposal was announced at the Ordinary General Assembly on 12 September 2010, and approved by the delegate members at the Extraordinary Assembly on 25 September 2011. To implement it, the Madrid City Council and the Government of the Community of Madrid approved a specific amendment to the General Urban Development Plan in 2012, allowing the club to increase the buildability of the stadium and modify its facade. The proposed plan included a new architectural envelope, roof covering for all seats, and the incorporation of bioclimatic systems with renewable energy, as well as the construction of two new public plazas, a hotel, and a large shopping center on the side facing Paseo de la Castellana.

To carry out this proposal, an International Architecture Competition was held in 2012 in which four teams of world-renowned prestige participated: one formed by the studios of Herzog &amp; de Meuron and Rafael Moneo; another composed of Foster and Partners and Rafael de la Hoz; a third consisting of the teams of Populous and Estudio Lamela; and a fourth formed by GMP Architekten, L35, and Ribas &amp; Ribas, whose proposal was announced as the winning project on 31 January 2014.

However, the project was halted in February 2015, when the Superior Court of Justice of Madrid annulled the approval of the specific amendment to the General Urban Development Plan of Madrid, considering it contrary to the general interest and urban planning regulations. The court argued that the plan entailed a substantial alteration of land use and an unjustified free grant of urban development rights to Real Madrid. Faced with this situation, the club decided to modify the winning project to comply with current laws and reduce its urban impact. Thus, in 2016, it presented a new project that eliminated the hotel and shopping center, raised the height of the stadium by only for the construction of the roof, reaching a total height of , and eliminated the possibility of increasing the capacity.

Finally, on 31 May 2017, the Madrid City Council approved the renovation by approving the &quot;Special Plan for the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium&quot;. After approving the replotting project, the sustainable mobility plan, and the urbanization project, the club awarded the renovation works to the construction company FCC Construcciones, which finally began in June 2019.

For the financing of the works, the Real Madrid Board of Directors approved a loan of 575 million euros on 12 April 2019, for 30 years with a fixed interest rate of 2.5%, including a 3-year grace period, resulting in an annual payment of 29.5 million euros starting from 30 July 2023. Additionally, on 7 December 2021, the financing was extended with an additional loan of 225 million euros for 27 years with a fixed interest rate of 1.53% and a grace period until 30 July 2024, with an annual payment of 10.5 million euros starting from that date. Finally, on 11 November 2023, a third loan of 370 million euros for 30 years was requested to cover cost overruns due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Thus, the total financing amounts to 1.170 billion euros at an average interest rate of 3%, with an annual payment of 60 million euros over 30 years, which is less than half of the new expected annual profits after the completion of the works.

==Location==

During the planned second leg on 24 November 2018 at El Monumental, the home stadium of River Plate, numerous River Plate fans threw glass bottles, bricks, dirts, stones, sands at the Boca Juniors team bus headed to the stadium, injuring numerous players as a result. CONMEBOL postponed the match and moved the second leg to Europe for 9 December 2018 in Madrid, a neutral site, for security and travel reasons.

During his pastoral visit to Spain in 1982, Pope John Paul II addressed some 160,000 young individuals at the stadium.

===Concerts===
The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium has hosted many touring musicians with dates in Madrid due to its expansive seating capacity and centralised location.

On 12 September 1983, famed Madrid-based singer Julio Iglesias (father of Enrique Iglesias, and who played as a goalkeeper for Real Madrid Castilla in the late 1950s) performed for nearly 100,000 people at the stadium. On 21 September 1989, Iglesias gave a free concert to a crowd of 70,000 people at the stadium.

On 25 September 1986, American singer Frank Sinatra performed at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, his only concert in the Spanish capital.

On 15 July 1987, Irish rock band U2 held their first concert in Spain at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu as part of their &quot;Joshua Tree Tour&quot;, along with English bands Big Audio Dynamite, The Pretenders, and UB40 as the opening acts. Spanish journalist Javier Menéndez Flores believed that as many as 75,000 spectators may have been in attendance.

On 1 June 2002, the cast (16 contestants) of the reality singing competition show &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot; performed a sold-out concert at the Bernabéu Stadium as part of a 27-city Spanish tour. Their Bernabéu Stadium concert aired on La 1 to 5.14 million viewers, with a 39.5% share, becoming the most-watched concert in the country.

American rock musician Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the stadium on three separate tours, making him the first artist to perform at the stadium on more than one occasion. The first date was during the &quot;Magic Tour&quot; on 17 July 2008, where the band played to an audience of 53,783. Their second concert was part of the &quot;Wrecking Ball World Tour&quot; on 17 June 2012, with an audience of 54,639 people, the first time Springsteen and his band sold-out the stadium. Four years after that, the band returned to the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 21 May 2016 for &quot;The River Tour&quot;, performing to a sell-out crowd of 55,695.

The Bernabéu Stadium would have hosted its first music festival on 30 June 2012 entitled &quot;El Gol de la Vida&quot; (&quot;the goal of life&quot;), a benefit concert featuring Dominican musician Juan Luis Guerra (as part of his &quot;A Son de Guerra&quot; World Tour), new flamenco singer Antonio Carmona, Mexican singer Marcela Gándara, and American Christian singer Marcos Witt. However, the event was postponed and moved to the indoor arena, Palacio de Deportes de la Comunidad de Madrid (the home of Real Madrid Baloncesto) for unknown reasons, possibly due to weather concerns, scheduling conflicts or capacity issues.

American pop singer Taylor Swift performed at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 29 and 30 May 2024 for her global &quot;Eras Tour&quot;. Aside from being the first international artist to perform at the stadium in over a decade, Swift held the first concerts at the newly-renovated (for 2024) stadium, which has been outfitted with up-to-date technology to optimize the audience’s experience at large-scale concerts, based on a comprehensive acoustic study. Reem Abdalazem of &quot;Diario AS&quot; also noted that the concert&#x27;s announcement marked &quot;the first major event announcement for the newly constructed stadium.&quot;

<text>Proxemics is the study of human use of space and the effects that population density has on behavior, communication, and social interaction. Proxemics is one among several subcategories in the study of nonverbal communication, including haptics (touch), kinesics (body movement), vocalics (paralanguage), and chronemics (structure of time).

Edward T. Hall, the cultural anthropologist who coined the term in 1963, defined proxemics as &quot;the interrelated observations and theories of humans&#x27; use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture&quot;. In his foundational work on proxemics, &quot;The Hidden Dimension&quot;, Hall emphasized the impact of proxemic behavior (the use of space) on interpersonal communication. According to Hall, the study of proxemics is valuable in evaluating not only the way people interact with others in daily life, but also &quot;the organization of space in [their] houses and buildings, and ultimately the layout of [their] towns&quot;. Proxemics remains a hidden component of interpersonal communication that is uncovered through observation and strongly influenced by culture.

== Human distances ==

The distance surrounding a person forms a space. The space within intimate distance and personal distance is called &quot;personal space&quot;. The space within social distance and out of personal distance is called &quot;social space&quot;, and the space within public distance is called &quot;public space&quot;.

Personal space is the region surrounding a person which they regard as psychologically theirs. Most people value their personal space and feel discomfort, anger, or anxiety when their personal space is encroached. Permitting a person to enter personal space and entering somebody else&#x27;s personal space are indicators of perception of those people&#x27;s relationship. An intimate zone is reserved for close friends, lovers, children and close family members. Another zone is used for conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions. A further zone is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances. A fourth zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.

Entering somebody&#x27;s personal space is normally an indication of familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it can be difficult to maintain personal space, for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable, though it is accepted as a fact of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, is unacceptable physical contact.

A person&#x27;s personal space is carried with them everywhere they go. It is the most inviolate form of territory. Body spacing and posture, according to Hall, are unintentional reactions to sensory fluctuations or shifts, such as subtle changes in the sound and pitch of a person&#x27;s voice. Social distance between people is reliably correlated with physical distance, as are intimate and personal distance, according to the delineations below. Hall did not mean for these measurements to be strict guidelines that translate precisely to human behavior, but rather a system for gauging the effect of distance on communication and how the effect varies between cultures and other environmental factors.

=== Interpersonal distance ===
Hall described the interpersonal distances of humans (the relative distances between people) in four distinct zones:
* Intimate distance for embracing, touching or whispering
** &quot;Close phase&quot; – less than one inch (0.01 to 0.02 m)
** &quot;Far phase&quot; – 
* Personal distance for interactions among good friends or family
** &quot;Close phase&quot; – 
** &quot;Far phase&quot; – 
* Social distance for interactions among acquaintances
** &quot;Close phase&quot; – 
** &quot;Far phase&quot; – 
* Public distance used for public speaking
** &quot;Close phase&quot; – 
** &quot;Far phase&quot; – or more.

==== Vertical ====
The distances mentioned above are horizontal distance. There is also vertical distance that communicates something between people. In this case, however, vertical distance is often understood to convey the degree of dominance or sub-ordinance in a relationship. Looking up at or down on another person can be taken literally in many cases, with the higher person asserting greater status.

Teachers, and especially those who work with small children, should realize that students will interact more comfortably with a teacher when they are in same vertical plane. Used in this way, an understanding of vertical distance can become a tool for improved teacher-student communication. On the other hand, a disciplinarian might put this information to use in order to gain psychological advantage over an unruly student.

==Explanations==

=== Biometrics ===

Hall used biometric concepts to categorize, explain, and explore the ways people connect in space. These variations in positioning are impacted by a variety of nonverbal communicative factors, listed below.

* Kinesthetic factors: This category deals with how closely the participants are to touching, from being completely outside of body-contact distance to being in physical contact, which parts of the body are in contact, and body part positioning.
* Haptic code: This behavioral category concerns how participants are touching one another, such as caressing, holding, feeling, prolonged holding, spot touching, pressing against, accidental brushing, or not touching at all.
* Visual code: This category denotes the amount of eye contact between participants. Four sub-categories are defined, ranging from eye-to-eye contact to no eye contact at all.
* Thermal code: This category denotes the amount of body heat that each participant perceives from another. Four sub-categories are defined: conducted heat detected, radiant heat detected, heat probably detected, and no detection of heat.
* Olfactory code: This category deals in the kind and degree of odor detected by each participant from the other.
* Voice loudness: This category deals in the vocal effort used in speech. Seven sub-categories are defined: silent, very soft, soft, normal, normal+, loud, and very loud.

=== Neuropsychology ===

Whereas Hall&#x27;s work uses human interactions to demonstrate spatial variation in proxemics, the field of neuropsychology describes personal space in terms of the kinds of &quot;nearness&quot; to an individual body.
* Extrapersonal space: The space that occurs outside the reach of an individual.
* Peripersonal space: The space within reach of any limb of an individual. Thus, to be &quot;within arm&#x27;s length&quot; is to be within one&#x27;s peripersonal space.
* Pericutaneous space: The space just outside our bodies but which might be near to touching it. Visual-tactile perceptive fields overlap in processing this space. For example, an individual might see a feather as not touching their skin but still experience the sensation of being tickled when it hovers just above their hand. Other examples include the blowing of wind, gusts of air, and the passage of heat.

Previc further subdivides extrapersonal space into &quot;focal-extrapersonal&quot; space, &quot;action-extrapersonal&quot; space, and &quot;ambient-extrapersonal&quot; space. Focal-extrapersonal space is located in the lateral temporo-frontal pathways at the center of our vision, is retinotopically centered and tied to the position of our eyes, and is involved in object search and recognition. Action-extrapersonal-space is located in the medial temporo-frontal pathways, spans the entire space, and is head-centered and involved in orientation and locomotion in topographical space. Action-extrapersonal space provides the &quot;presence&quot; of our world. Ambient-extrapersonal space initially courses through the peripheral parieto-occipital visual pathways before joining up with vestibular and other body senses to control posture and orientation in earth-fixed/gravitational space. Numerous studies involving peripersonal and extrapersonal neglect have shown that peripersonal space is located dorsally in the parietal lobe whereas extrapersonal space is housed ventrally in the temporal lobe.

The amygdala is suspected of processing people&#x27;s strong reactions to personal space violations since these are absent in those in which it is damaged and it is activated when people are physically close. Research links the amygdala with emotional reactions to proximity to other people. First, it is activated by such proximity, and second, in those with complete bilateral damage to their amygdala, such as patient S.M., lack a sense of personal space boundary. As the researchers have noted: &quot;Our findings suggest that the amygdala may mediate the repulsive force that helps to maintain a minimum distance between people. Further, our findings are consistent with those in monkeys with bilateral amygdala lesions, who stay within closer proximity to other monkeys or people, an effect we suggest arises from the absence of strong emotional responses to personal space violation.&quot;

=== Kinematics ===
Some quantitative theories propose that the zone sizes are generated by the potential kinematics of the two agents, and their abilities to cause or avoid contact with one another. Such models also suggest that the zone sizes and shapes should change according to the sizes and speeds of the agents.

==Organization of space in territories==

While personal space describes the immediate space surrounding a person, territory refers to the area which a person may &quot;lay claim to&quot; and defend against others. There are four forms of human territory in proxemic theory. They are:
* Public territory: a place where one may freely enter. This type of territory is rarely in the constant control of just one person. However, people might come to temporarily own areas of public territory.
* Interactional territory: a place where people congregate informally
* Home territory: a place where people continuously have control over their individual territory
* Body territory: the space immediately surrounding us
These different levels of territory, in addition to factors involving personal space, suggest ways for us to communicate and produce expectations of appropriate behavior.

In addition to spatial territories, the interpersonal territories between conversants can be determined by &quot; axis&quot;, or the &quot;angle formed by the axis of the conversants&#x27; shoulders&quot;. Hall has also studied combinations of postures between dyads (two people) including lying prone, sitting, or standing.

==Cultural factors==
Personal space is highly variable, due to cultural differences and personal preferences. On average, preferences vary significantly between countries. A 2017 study found that personal space preferences with respect to strangers ranged between more than 120 cm in Romania, Hungary and Saudi Arabia, and less than 90 cm in Argentina, Peru, Ukraine and Bulgaria.

The cultural practices of the United States show considerable similarities to those in northern and central European regions, such as Germany, Scandinavia, and the United Kingdom. Greeting rituals tend to be the same in Europe and in the United States, consisting of minimal body contact—often confined to a simple handshake. The main cultural difference in proxemics is that residents of the United States like to keep more open space between themselves and their conversation partners (roughly compared to in Europe). European cultural history has seen a change in personal space since Roman times, along with the boundaries of public and private space. This topic has been explored in &quot;A History of Private Life&quot; (2001), under the general editorship of Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby. On the other hand, those living in densely populated places likely have lower expectations of personal space. Residents of India or Japan tend to have a smaller personal space than those in the Mongolian steppe, both in regard to home and individual spaces. Different expectations of personal space can lead to difficulties in intercultural communication.

Hall notes that different culture types maintain different standards of personal space. Realizing and recognizing these cultural differences improves cross-cultural understanding, and helps eliminate discomfort people may feel if the interpersonal distance is too large (&quot;stand-offish&quot;) or too small (intrusive).

==Adaptation==
People make exceptions to and modify their space requirements. A number of relationships may allow for personal space to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, where there is a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. Personal space is affected by a person&#x27;s position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger personal space. Personal space also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more as they get older). Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of personal space by age twelve.

Under circumstances where normal space requirements cannot be met, such as in public transit or elevators, personal space requirements are modified accordingly. According to the psychologist Robert Sommer, one method of dealing with violated personal space is dehumanization. He argues that on the subway, crowded people often imagine those intruding on their personal space as inanimate. Behavior is another method: a person attempting to talk to someone can often cause situations where one person steps forward to enter what they perceive as a conversational distance, and the person they are talking to can step back to restore their personal space.

==Applications==

===Architecture===
Hall&#x27;s original work on proxemics was conducted with the aim of informing architectural and urban planning practice, to design living and working spaces to better fit human needs and feelings, and to avoid behavioral sink. In particular, Hall emphasized the need for individuals to be allocated enough personal space for comfort, and the differences in these needs between cultures, especially the multiple, different, immigrant cultures found in large cities.

===Work psychology===

The theory of proxemics is often considered in relation to the impact of technology on human relationships. While physical proximity cannot be achieved when people are connected virtually, perceived proximity can be attempted, and several studies have shown that it is a crucial indicator in the effectiveness of virtual communication technologies. These studies suggest that various individual and situational factors influence how close we feel to another person, regardless of distance. The mere-exposure effect originally referred to the tendency of a person to positively favor those who they have been physically exposed to most often. However, recent research has extended this effect to virtual communication. This work suggests that the more someone communicates virtually with another person, the more he is able to envision that person&#x27;s appearance and workspace, therefore fostering a sense of personal connection. Increased communication has also been seen to foster common ground, or the feeling of identification with another, which leads to positive attributions about that person. Some studies emphasize the importance of shared physical territory in achieving common ground, while others find that common ground can be achieved virtually, by communicating often.

Much research in the fields of communication, psychology, and sociology, especially under the category of organizational behavior, has shown that physical proximity enhances peoples&#x27; ability to work together. Face-to-face interaction is often used as a tool to maintain the culture, authority, and norms of an organization or workplace. An extensive body of research has been written about how proximity is affected by the use of new communication technologies. The importance of physical proximity in co-workers is often emphasized.

===Cinema===
Proxemics is an essential component of cinematic mise-en-scène, the placement of characters, props and scenery within a frame, creating visual weight and movement. There are two aspects to the consideration of proxemics in this context, the first being character proxemics, which addresses such questions as: &quot;How much space is there between the characters?&quot;, &quot;What is suggested by characters who are close to&quot; (&quot;or, conversely, far away from&quot;) &quot;each other?&quot;, &quot;Do distances change as the film progresses?&quot; and, &quot;Do distances depend on the film&#x27;s other content?&quot; The other consideration is camera proxemics, which answers the single question: &quot;How far away is the camera from the characters/action?&quot; Analysis of camera proxemics typically relates Hall&#x27;s system of proxemic patterns to the camera angle used to create a specific shot, with the long shot or extreme long shot becoming the &quot;public proxemic&quot;, a full shot (sometimes called a figure shot, complete view, or medium long shot) becoming the &quot;social proxemic&quot;, the medium shot becoming the &quot;personal proxemic&quot;, and the close up or extreme close up becoming the &quot;intimate proxemic&quot;.

Film analyst Louis Giannetti has maintained that, in general, the greater the distance between the camera and the subject (in other words, the public proxemic), the more emotionally neutral the audience remains, whereas the closer the camera is to a character, the greater the audience&#x27;s emotional attachment to that character. Or, as actor/director Charlie Chaplin put it: &quot;Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long shot.&quot;

===Education===

Implementing appropriate proxemic cues has been shown to improve success in monitored behavioral situations like psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see active listening). Instructional situations have likewise seen increased success in student performance by lessening the actual or perceived distance between the student and the educator (perceived distance is manipulated in the case of instructional videoconferencing, using technological tricks such as angling the frame and adjusting the zoom). Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with stigmatized minorities within a population. For example, those who do not have experience dealing with disabled persons tend to create more distance during encounters because they are uncomfortable. Others may judge that the disabled person needs to have an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.

=== Virtual environments ===

Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, and Loomis conducted an experiment in 2001, testing Argyle and Dean&#x27;s (1965) equilibrium theory&#x27;s speculation of an inverse relationship between mutual gaze, a nonverbal cue signaling intimacy, and interpersonal distance. Participants were immersed in a 3D virtual room in which a virtual human representation (that is, an embodied agent) stood. The focus of this study is on the &quot;subtle nonverbal exchanges&quot; that occur between a person and an embodied agent. Participants in the study clearly did not treat the agent as a mere animation. On the contrary, the results suggest that, in virtual environments, people were influenced by the 3D model and respected personal space of the humanoid representation. The result of the experiment also indicated that women are more affected by the gaze behaviors of the agent and adjust their personal space more accordingly than do men. However, men do subjectively assign gaze behavior to the agent, and their proxemic behavior reflects this perception. Furthermore, both men and women demonstrate less variance in their &quot;proxemic behavior&quot; when the agent displays mutual gaze behavior than when the agent does not.

Other researchers have established that proxemics can be a valuable tool for measuring the behavioral realism of an agent or an avatar. People tend to perceive nonverbal gestures on an implicit level, and degree of personal space appears to be an accurate way to measure people&#x27;s perception of &quot;social presence&quot; and realism in virtual environments. Nick Yee in his PhD thesis at Stanford discovered that real world proxemic distances also were applied in the virtual world of Second Life. Other studies demonstrate that implicit behavioral measures such as body posture can be a reliable measure of the user&#x27;s sense of presence in virtual environments. Similarly, personal space may be a more reliable measure of social presence than a typical ratings survey in immersive virtual environments.

=== Social robotics ===
Proxemic zones have been proposed as tools to control interactions between autonomous robots and humans, such as between self-driving cars and pedestrians. Robot navigation is often controlled using costmaps which these models link to proxemic zones.
=== Cyberbullying ===
Cyberbullying is a communication phenomenon in which a bully utilizes electronic media in order to harass peers. Adolescents favor texting or computer-mediated communication as an alternative to the more directly combative face-to-face interactions because it takes advantage of evading imposed social norms such as &quot;school rules&quot;, which are likely to be especially repressive of aggression involving females. Online bullying has a lot in common with bullying in school: Both behaviors include harassment, humiliation, teasing, and aggression. Cyberbullying presents unique challenges in the sense that the perpetrator can attempt to be anonymous, and attacks can happen at any time of day or night.

The main factor that encourages cyberbullying is the fact that a cyberbully can hide behind the shield of online anonymity. In other words, social media magnifies the face-to-face &quot;social space&quot; into a virtual space where a cyberbully can say anything about the victims without the pressure of facing them.

=== Social distancing ===

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries enforced social distancing, the requirement to maintain a minimum distance between people at all times. These distances were typically larger than in normal interactions, and proxemics may help to explain the social effects of the change, including long-term changes in levels of interpersonal trust.

It has been suggested that the pandemic has made people adverse to hugs or handshakes, less trusting, and more transactional, as a long-term cultural change. In an article in &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, author Jane Adams discussed &quot;boundary style&quot; as the way people behave when they come in contact with others. &quot;Some changes in how we interact with others may be temporary while others could be long-lasting,&quot; she says.

<doc id="225762" wikidata="Q387480" url="?curid=225762" title="Little Lord Fauntleroy">
<text>Little Lord Fauntleroy is a children&#x27;s novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It was published as a serial in &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot; from November 1885 to October 1886, then as a book by Scribner&#x27;s (the publisher of &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;) in 1886. The illustrations by Reginald B. Birch set fashion trends and the novel set a precedent in copyright law when Burnett won a lawsuit in 1888 against E. V. Seebohm over the rights to theatrical adaptations of the work.

==Etymology==
The title surname &quot;Fauntleroy&quot; is an Anglo-French term ultimately derived from &quot;Le enfant le roy&quot; (&quot;child of the king&quot;), evoking the image of being pampered and spoiled. More proximally, it is from a Middle English variant &quot;faunt&quot; from &quot;enfaunt&quot;, meaning child or infant. It is attested as a real surname since the 13th century.

==Plot==
In a shabby New York City side street in the mid-1880s, young Cedric Errol lives with his mother (known to him as &quot;Dearest&quot;) in genteel poverty after the death of his father, Captain Cedric Errol. One day, they are visited by a British lawyer named Liam with a message from young Cedric&#x27;s paternal grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt, a millionaire who despises the United States and was very disappointed when his youngest son married an American woman. With the deaths of his father&#x27;s elder brothers, Cedric has now inherited the title Lord Fauntleroy and is the heir to the earldom and a vast estate. Cedric&#x27;s grandfather wants him to live in the United Kingdom and be educated as a British aristocrat. He offers his son&#x27;s widow a house and guaranteed income, but refuses to have anything else to do with her, even after she declines his money.

However, the Earl is impressed by the appearance and intelligence of his American grandson and is charmed by his innocent nature. Cedric believes his grandfather to be an honorable man and benefactor, and the Earl cannot disappoint him. The Earl therefore becomes a benefactor to his tenants, to their delight, though he takes care to let them know that their benefactor is the child, Lord Fauntleroy.

Meanwhile, back in New York, a homeless bootblack named Dick Tipton tells Cedric&#x27;s old friend Mr. Hobbs, a New York City grocer, that a few years prior, after the death of his parents, Dick&#x27;s older brother Benjamin married an awful woman who got rid of their only child together after he was born and then left. Benjamin moved to California to open a cattle ranch while Dick ended up in the streets. At the same time, a neglected pretender to Cedric&#x27;s inheritance appears in the United Kingdom, the pretender&#x27;s mother claiming that he is the offspring of the Earl&#x27;s eldest son, Bevis. The claim is investigated by Dick and Benjamin, who come to the United Kingdom and recognize the woman as Benjamin&#x27;s former wife. She flees, and the Tipton brothers and the pretender, Benjamin&#x27;s son, do not see her again. Afterward, Benjamin goes back to his cattle ranch in California where he happily raises his son by himself. The Earl is reconciled to his American daughter-in-law, realizing that she is far superior to the impostor.

The Earl had planned to teach his grandson how to be an aristocrat. Instead, Cedric teaches his grandfather that an aristocrat should practice compassion towards those dependent on him. The Earl becomes the man Cedric always innocently believed him to be. Cedric is happily reunited with his mother and with Mr. Hobbs, who decides to stay to help look after Cedric.

==Impact on fashion==
The Fauntleroy suit (see also Buster Brown suit), so well described by Burnett and realised in Reginald Birch&#x27;s detailed pen-and-ink drawings, created a fad for formal dress for American middle-class children:

The Fauntleroy suit appeared in Europe as well but nowhere was it as popular as in America. The classic Fauntleroy suit was a velvet cut-away jacket and matching knee pants, worn with a fancy blouse and a large lace or ruffled collar. These suits appeared right after the publication of Burnett&#x27;s story (1885) and were a major fashion for boys until after the turn of the 20th century. Many boys who did not wear an actual Fauntleroy suit wore suits with Fauntleroy elements, such as a fancy blouse or floppy bow. Only a minority of boys wore ringlet curls with these suits, but the photographic record confirms that many boys did.

It was most popular for boys about 3–8 years of age, but some older boys wore them as well. It has been speculated that the popularity of the style encouraged many mothers to breech their boys earlier than before, and it was a factor in the decline of the fashion for dressing small boys in dresses and other skirted garments. Clothing that Burnett popularised was modelled on the costumes which she tailored herself for her two sons, Vivian and Lionel.

== Reception ==
Polly Hovarth writes that &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; &quot;was the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; of his time and Frances Hodgson Burnett was as celebrated for creating him as J. K. Rowling is for Potter&quot;. During the serialisation in &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; magazine, readers looked forward to new installments. The fashions in the book became popular with velvet Lord Fauntleroy suits being sold, as well as other Fauntleroy merchandise such as velvet collars, playing cards, and chocolates. During a period when sentimental fiction was the norm, and in the United States the &quot;rags to riches&quot; story popular, &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; was a hit.

Edith Nesbit included in her own children&#x27;s book &quot;The Enchanted Castle&quot; (1907) a rather unflattering reference:

Gerald could always make himself look interesting at a moment&#x27;s notice (...) by opening his grey eyes rather wide, allowing the corners of his mouth to droop, and assuming a gentle, pleading expression, resembling that of the late little Lord Fauntleroy who must, by the way, be quite old now, and an awful prig.

==Adaptations==
===Stage===
The first stage adaptation of Hodgson&#x27;s novel, titled simply &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, opened at the Prince of Wales&#x27; Theatre in London on 23 Feb 1888. Written by E.V. Seebohm, the piece in three acts was &quot;suggested by Mrs F. H, Burnett&#x27;s story&quot;, starred Annie Hughes as Cedric and played only a short season of matinees. After discovering her novel had been plagiarized for the stage, Burnett successfully sued and then wrote her own theatrical adaptation titled &quot;The Real&quot; &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;. Opening on 14 May, at Terry&#x27;s Theatre in London it played for 57 matinees and was subsequently presented in the English provinces, France, Boston and New York City.

The Broadway production of Burnett&#x27;s play opened on 10 December 1888, at the Broadway Theatre, New York City. The original cast follows:
* Earl of Dorincourt – J. H. Gilmour
* Cedric Errol (Lord Fauntleroy) – Elsie Leslie and Tommy Russell
* Mr. Havisham, a Solicitor – F. F. Mackay
* Mr. Hobbs, a Grocer – George A. Parkhurst
* Dick, a Bootblack – Frank E. Lamb
* Higgins, a Farmer – John Swinburne
* Wilkins, a Groom – Alfred Klein
* Thomas, a Footman – John Sutherland
* James, a Servant – T. J. Plunkett
* Mrs. Errol (&quot;Dearest&quot;) – Kathryn Kidder
* Minna – Alice Fischer
* Mary – Effie Germon

Touring versions of the play were common in the late 19th and early 20th century. A 1906 version cast 11-year-old Buster Keaton in the role of Lord Fauntleroy.
In 1994, an Australian open-air/site specific theatre production of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, adapted by Julia Britton and directed by Robert Chuter, was presented in the historical gardens of the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) property Rippon Lea.

<text>The half guinea gold coin of the Kingdom of England and later of Great Britain was first produced in 1669, some years after the Guinea entered circulation. It was officially eliminated in the Great Recoinage of 1816, although, like the guinea, it was used in quoting prices until decimalisation.

== Value ==

The value of the guinea fluctuated over the years from twenty to thirty shillings, and back down to twenty-one shillings and sixpence by the start of George I&#x27;s reign. A Royal Proclamation of December 1717 fixed the value of the guinea at twenty-one shillings. The value of the half guinea was thus fixed at ten shillings and sixpence (written as 10&quot;s.&quot; 6&quot;d.&quot; or 10/6.

A half-guinea weighed .

The present day value of a 1717 half guinea is about £. A golden half guinea in fine condition would be worth considerably more.

== History ==
=== Charles II ===
During the reign of King Charles II, the elephant and castle logo of the Africa Company appeared on some coins from 1676 to 1684, although the denomination was produced in all years between 1669 and 1684. The coin weighed 4.2 grams and was 20 millimetres in diameter. 

The obverse and reverse of this coin were designed by John Roettier (1631 – ). The obverse showed a fine right-facing bust of the king wearing a Laurel wreath, surrounded by the legend , while the reverse showed four crowned cruciform shields bearing the arms of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, between which were four sceptres, and in the centre were four interlinked &quot;C&quot;s, surrounded by the inscription . To avoid confusion with gilded silver coins the edge was milled to deter clipping or filing—in 1669 the milling was perpendicular to the coin, giving vertical grooves, while from 1670 the milling was diagonal to the coin.

=== James II ===
John Roettier continued to design the dies for this denomination in the reign of King James II. In this reign, the coins were of the same dimensions as before, and were minted in 1686-1688. The elephant and castle mark was only used on some coins in 1686, which are particularly scarce. The King&#x27;s head faces left in this reign, and is surrounded by the inscription , while the obverse is the same as in Charles II&#x27;s reign except for omitting the interlinked &quot;C&quot;s in the centre of the coin. The edge of the coins are milled diagonally.

=== William and Mary ===
With the removal of James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, his daughter Mary, and her husband Prince William of Orange ruled jointly by agreement as co-monarchs. Their heads appear conjoined on the guinea piece in Roman style, with William&#x27;s head uppermost, with the legend . In a departure from the previous reigns the reverse featured a totally new design of a large crowned shield which bore the arms of France in the first quarter, of Scotland in the second quarter, of Ireland in the third quarter, and of England in the fourth quarter, the whole ensemble having a small shield in the centre bearing the rampant lion of Nassau; the legend on the obverse read . By the early part of this reign the value of the guinea had increased to nearly thirty shillings. The half guineas of this reign weighed 4.2 grams, were 20 millimetres in diameter. The credit for the design of the gold coinage of this reign is usually given to James and Norbert Roettier, but the 1689 coin bears somewhat caricatured heads of the monarchs, and it is thought that this is in the style of George Bower (d. 1689/90), an artist who designed the first type of penny and halfpenny of 1689 and also produced a number of medals with grotesque and cartoon-like busts. Records show that Bower was instructed in July 1689 &#x27;to make a puncheon for the Halfe Guinneys ande to worke it in the Mint&#x27;; the heads of the halfpenny, penny, and half guinea of 1689 don&#x27;t share the harmony of design of later Roettier work. Half guineas were produced in all years between 1689 and 1694 with the elephant and castle appearing in 1691 and 1692.

=== William III ===
Following the death of Queen Mary from smallpox in 1694, William continued to reign as William III. The half guinea coin was produced in all years from 1695 to 1701, with the elephant and castle appearing on some coins from 1695, 1696, and 1698, the design probably being the work of James Roettier and John Croker.

The coins of William III&#x27;s reign weighed 4.2 grams with a diameter of 20 millimetres. William&#x27;s head faces right on his coins, with the legend , while the reverse design of William and Mary&#x27;s reign was judged to be unsuccessful, so the design reverted to that used by Charles II and James II, but with a small shield with the lion of Nassau in the centre, with the legend . The coin had a diagonal milled edge.

=== Anne ===
The reign of Queen Anne (1702–1714) produced pre-Union half guineas in 1702, 1703, and 1705. The 1703 half guinea bears the word VIGO under the Queen&#x27;s bust, to commemorate the origin of the gold taken from the Spanish ships at the Battle of Vigo Bay. With the Union of England and Scotland the design of the reverse of the half guinea was changed. Until the Union, the cruciform shields on the reverse showed the arms of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland in order, separated by sceptres and with a central rose, and the legend . With the union, the English and Scottish arms appear conjoined on one shield, with the left half being the English arms and the right half being the Scottish arms, and the order of arms appearing on the shields becomes England+Scotland, France, England+Scotland, Ireland and the legend . The centre of the reverse design shows Star of the Order of the Garter. The coins weighed 4.2 grams, were 20 millimetres in diameter. The edge of the coin is milled diagonally.

The dies for all half-guineas of Queen Anne and King George I were engraved by John Croker, an immigrant originally from Dresden in the Duchy of Saxony.

=== George I ===
King George I&#x27;s half guinea coins were struck between 1715 and 1727 except 1716, with the elephant and castle sometimes appearing in 1721. The coins weighed 4.2 grams, were 20 millimetres in diameter, with a diagonally milled edge.

The obverse shows the right-facing portrait of the king with the legend . The reverse follows the same general design as before, except the order of the shields is England+Scotland, France, Ireland, and Hanover, with the legend date (&quot;Brunsuicensis Et Lueneburgensis Dux, Sacri Romani Imperii Archi-Tessarius et Elector&quot;, &quot;Of Brunswick and Lüneburg Duke, of the Holy Roman Empire Arch-Treasurer and Elector&quot;).

=== George II ===
King George II&#x27;s guinea pieces marks are a complex issue, with eight obverses and five reverses used through the 33 years of the reign. The coins were produced in all years of the reign except 1735, 1741, 1742, 1744, 1754, and 1757. The coins weighed 4.2 grams, and were 20 millimetres in diameter. Some coins issued between 1729 and 1739 carry the mark EIC under the king&#x27;s head, to indicate the gold was provided by the East India Company, while some 1745 coins carry the mark LIMA to indicate the gold came from Admiral Anson&#x27;s round-the-world voyage. The edge of the coin was milled diagonally, the coin being too thin to take the chevron milling applied to the larger gold coins from 1739. 

The obverse has a left-facing bust of the king with the legend ( between 1740 and 1745), while the reverse features a single large crowned shield with the quarters containing the arms of England+Scotland, France, Hanover, and Ireland, and the legend (, &quot;Of Great Britain, France and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, of Brunswick and Lüneburg Duke, of the Holy Roman Empire Arch-Treasurer and Elector&quot;).

=== George III ===
The half guinea was minted in nearly all the years of the long reign of King George III (1760–1820). 

The half guineas of George III weighed 4.2 grams and were 20 millimetres in diameter except from 1787 when they were 20-21 millimetres in diameter. They were issued with seven different obverses and three reverses in 1762-1766, 1768, 1769, 1772–1779, 1781, 1783–1798, 1800–1806, 1808–1811 and 1813. All the obverses show right-facing busts of the king with the legend with different portraits of the king. The reverse of half guineas issued between 1761 and 1786 show a crowned shield bearing the arms of England+Scotland, France, Ireland and Hanover, with the legend . In 1787 a new design of reverse featuring a spade-shaped shield was introduced, with the same legend; this has become known as the &quot;Spade Half-Guinea&quot;.

In 1774 almost 20 million worn guineas of William III and Queen Anne were melted down and recoined as guineas and half-guineas.

In 1801 the king relinquished his claim on the French throne, and the legend on the reverse was altered to reflect this, and the Hanoverian arms were removed from the coat of arms. The reverse of the 1801-1813 half guinea features a crowned shield within a Garter, with on the Garter, and around the edge, and date between the edge inscription and the garter.

=== Replacement ===
In the Great Recoinage of 1816, the half-guinea was replaced by the half sovereign, worth 10 shillings.

<text>Bratwurst () is a type of German sausage made from pork or, less commonly, beef or veal. The name is derived from the Old High German , from , finely chopped meat, and , sausage, although in modern German it is often associated with the verb , to pan fry or roast. Beef and veal are usually incorporated amongst a blend often including pork. Beef or veal is usual in halal and kosher Bratwurst sausages, which never include pork for religious reasons.

==History==
The first documented evidence of the Bratwurst in Germany dates to 1313 in the Franconian city of Nuremberg, which is still internationally renowned for the production of grilling sausages.

==Types and traditions==
===Germany===

Recipes for the sausage vary by region and even locality; some sources list over 40 different varieties of German bratwurst, many of the best known originating in Franconia (today for the most part situated in northern Bavaria, but still culturally quite distinct), its northern neighbour Thuringia and adjacent areas. How the sausages are served is also locally different, but most commonly they are regarded as a simple snack served with or in a white bread roll made from wheat flour and eaten with mustard. As a pub dish, it is often accompanied by sauerkraut or potato salad and sometimes served with dark, crusty country bread made predominantly from rye flour, or less commonly with a &quot;Brezel&quot; (pretzel). It is a very popular form of fast food in German-speaking countries, often cooked and sold by street vendors from small stands, and is also traditionally popular with fans at football games.
====Franconian varieties====
=====&quot;Fränkische Bratwurst&quot;=====

The Franconian sausage is a relatively long (), thick, coarse sausage, common to the whole Franconian region with slight variations. It dates back to 1313. With marjoram as a characteristic ingredient, it is close in taste to the &quot;Nürnberger Bratwurst&quot; but juicier, due to its size and coarseness. The &quot;Fränkische Bratwurst&quot; is traditionally served with sauerkraut or potato salad.

=====&quot;Coburger Bratwurst&quot;=====
&quot;Bratwurst&quot; originating in the city of Coburg in Franconia was first documented there in 1498. It is made from pork and a minimum of 15% beef, seasoned with only salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lemon zest, and bound with raw egg. It is coarse in texture and is about long. Traditionally, it is grilled over pinecones and served in a bread roll (&quot;Brötchen&quot;).

=====&quot;Kulmbacher Bratwurst&quot;=====
The &quot;Kulmbacher Bratwurst&quot; is a finely-ground Rohwurst from the city of Kulmbach in Upper Franconia. Long and thin, it is made mostly from very finely ground veal, with very little pork. This sausage may be seasoned with salt, white pepper, nutmeg, lemon peel, marjoram, caraway, and garlic. The exact mixture is a closely guarded trade secret of each butcher. Kulmbacher bratwursts are usually pan-fried, or grilled over a wood fire. They are sold and served freshly grilled from vendors&#x27; stands in the Marktplatz, in pairs, with or without mustard, on crusty rolls sprinkled with anise.

=====&quot;Nürnberger Rostbratwurst&quot;=====

The small, thin bratwurst from Franconia&#x27;s largest city, Nuremberg, was first documented in 1567; it is long, and weighs between 20 and 25 g. The denominations &quot;Nürnberger Bratwurst&quot; and &quot;Nürnberger Rostbratwurst&quot; (&quot;Rost&quot; comes from the grill above the cooking fire) are Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) under EU law since 2003, and may therefore only be produced in the city of Nürnberg, where an &quot;Association for the Protection of &quot;Nürnberger Bratwürste&quot;&quot; was established in 1997.

Pork-based and typically seasoned with fresh marjoram which gives them their distinctive flavour, these sausages are traditionally grilled over a beechwood fire. As a main dish six sausages are served on a pewter plate with either sauerkraut or potato salad, and accompanied by a dollop of horseradish or mustard. They are also sold as a snack by street vendors as &quot;Drei im Weckla&quot; (three in a bun; the spelling &quot;Drei im Weggla&quot; is also common, &quot;Weggla&quot;/&quot;Weckla&quot; being the word for &quot;bread roll&quot; in the Nuremberg dialect), with mustard.

Another way of cooking Nuremberg sausages is in a spiced vinegar and onion stock; this is called &quot;Blaue Zipfel&quot; (blue lobes).

=====&quot;Würzburger Bratwurst&quot;=====
The &quot;Würzburger Bratwurst&quot;, also known as the &quot;Winzerbratwurst&quot;, comes from the city of Würzburg in Franconia. Its size is similar to the &quot;Thüringer Rostbratwurst&quot;, but its ingredients include white wine from the region.

==== Other varieties ====

=====&quot;Thüringer Rostbratwurst&quot;=====
The &quot;Thüringer Rostbratwurst&quot; is a spicy sausage from Thuringia. It is thin and long. It is traditionally grilled over a charcoal fire and eaten with mustard and bread. The name &quot;Thüringer Rostbratwurst&quot; is also recognised as a PGI under EU law.

Triggered by the discovery in 2000 of an account entry of 1404 first mentioning the &quot;Bratwurst&quot; in Thuringia in the town of Arnstadt, the association &quot;Friends of the &quot;Thuringian Bratwurst&quot;&quot; was founded in 2006. In the same year, the association established the &quot;Erstes Deutsches Bratwurstmuseum&quot; (First German Bratwurst Museum) in the village of Holzhausen. A two-metre-high wooden monument of a &quot;Bratwurst&quot; in a bun on a local traffic roundabout advertises the museum.

In 2016, a kosher version of Thuringian bratwurst made with veal and chicken packed into goat intestines was introduced at the annual Onion Festival in Weimar.

=====&quot;Nordhessische Bratwurst&quot;=====
The -long &quot;Nordhessische Bratwurst&quot; (from northern Hessen) is similar to the &quot;Thüringer Rostbratwurst&quot; in taste. It is made from coarsely ground pork and is heavily seasoned. Traditionally, it is grilled over a wood fire and served on a cut-open roll with mustard.

=====&quot;Rote Wurst&quot;=====

The &quot;Rote Wurst&quot; (red sausage) is a favorite &quot;Bratwurst&quot; of the Swabian region. It is similar to the &quot;Bockwurst&quot;, and is made from finely ground pork and bacon, and has a spicy taste. To prevent splitting during grilling or pan frying, an X is cut into the ends of the sausage, which opens during cooking. Sometimes a row of x-shaped cuts are made along its length.

===== Banater Bratwurst =====
Banat Swabians, Danube Swabians living in the Banat, that immigrated to Germany brought with them Banater Bratwurst which was influenced by regional cuisine and as a result is made with hot and sweet paprika.

=== Switzerland ===

In 1438, bratwurst started to become popular in eastern Switzerland, especially in St. Gallen. &quot;St. Galler Bratwurst&quot;, traditionally made from veal, has been famous since then. St. Galler bratwurst with a round bread is sold on the street, and also served in restaurants with rösti.

===United States ===
Bratwurst, often shortened to &quot;brat&quot; in American English, is a common type of sausage in the United States, especially in the Upper Midwestern region, which is home to many people of German-American ethnicity. Wisconsin, where the largest ancestry group is German, is known for its bratwursts. Brats are also popular in other Midwestern states such as Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa, as well as cities with large populations like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Originally brought to North America by German immigrants, it is a common sight at summer cookouts, along with hot dogs. Many grocery stores and butcher shops sell varieties with popular additions such as cheddar cheese and jalapeño peppers. Wisconsin is the home of the &quot;beer brat&quot;, where the brats are simmered in beer (generally a mixture of a pilsner style beer with butter and onions) before or after grilling over charcoal.

Bratwurst was popularized in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, in the 1920s. In general, each local butcher shop would take orders and hand make bratwurst fresh to be picked up on a particular day. The fat content of the sausages was substantial, making daily pick up necessary to avoid spoilage; some of the fat is lost on cooking over charcoal. 
Bratwurst has also become popular as a mainstay of sports stadiums, especially baseball parks, after Bill Sperling introduced bratwurst to Major League Baseball in Milwaukee County Stadium in 1954, when the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee. The brats, which sold for 35 cents, were grilled and placed into a container of a special tomato sauce with green pepper and onions before being served. The bratwursts were so popular, Sperling said, that Duke Snider of the Brooklyn Dodgers took a case back to New York City. American Family Field in Milwaukee sells more bratwurst than hot dogs. Current American Family Field foodservice provider Delaware North (through their Sportservice subsidiary) markets Secret Stadium Sauce at retail as a complement to bratwurst.

Every year, during the Memorial Day weekend, the city of Madison, Wisconsin, hosts Brat Fest, which is billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest bratwurst festival&quot;.

The town of Bucyrus, Ohio, (which calls itself the &quot;Bratwurst Capital of America&quot;) has held the three-day Bucyrus Bratwurst Festival annually since 1967.

<text>Warren Mears is a fictional character that is portrayed by Adam Busch in the American television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The character also appears in canonical comic book series continuation of that series. He is the main antagonist in season 6, until Willow turns to her dark side and kills him.

==Characterization==
Actor Adam Busch claims that he does not see Warren as simply a villain or purely evil person. He explains that the character has various flaws and positives, and is always given the chance to redeem himself. &quot;He&#x27;s always given that moment where he can do the right thing that he never ever does,&quot; says Busch. &quot;Because he &quot;is&quot; flawed and he does have a lot of issues and an inability to communicate or talk to anyone or really explain what it is that he wants.&quot; Writer Jane Espenson draws a parallel between Warren and Buffy Summers: &quot;When Buffy&#x27;s talking with Warren about his break-up with April, she&#x27;s actually identifying with him, because she did a lot of the same stuff with Riley that he did with April.&quot;

Warren forms alliances with Andrew Wells, summoner of demons; and Jonathan Levinson, caster of spells. Together, the three are known as &quot;The Trio.&quot; The Trio strive to neutralize Buffy, the Slayer, and thus the primary obstacle to their ultimate goal of taking over Sunnydale. Though initially comic relief and little more than a nuisance to the Scooby Gang, they take a darker turn by the episode &quot;Dead Things&quot;. Most of their schemes combine science and mysticism, and they are able to avoid detection by the Scoobies (who merely assume their activities to be the doings of demons) until halfway through the season.

==Appearances==
Warren has made 31 canonical Buffyverse appearances.

<doc id="225777" wikidata="Q61100" url="?curid=225777" title="Battle of Civitate">
<text>The Battle of Civitate was fought on 18 June 1053 in southern Italy, between the Normans, led by the Count of Apulia Humphrey of Hauteville, and a Swabian-Italian-Lombard army, organised by Pope Leo IX and led on the battlefield by Gerard, Duke of Lorraine, and Rudolf, Prince of Benevento. The Norman victory over the allied papal army marked the climax of a conflict between the Norman mercenaries who came to southern Italy in the eleventh century, the de Hauteville family, and the local Lombard princes. By 1059 the Normans would create an alliance with the papacy, which included a formal recognition by Pope Nicholas II of the Norman conquest in south Italy, investing Robert Guiscard as Duke of Apulia and Calabria, and Count of Sicily.

==Background==

===The arrival of the Normans in Italy===

The Normans had arrived in Southern Italy in 1017, in a pilgrimage to the sanctuary of St. Michael Archangel in Monte Sant&#x27;Angelo sul Gargano (Apulia). These warriors had been used to counter the threat posed by the Saracens, who, from their bases in Sicily, raided South Italy without much resistance from the Lombard and Byzantine rulers of the affected lands.

The availability of this mercenary force (the Normans were famous for being &quot;militariter lucrum quaerens&quot;, &quot;seeking wealth through military service&quot;) could not escape the notice of the Christian rulers of Southern Italy, who employed the Normans in their internal wars. The Normans took advantage of this turmoil; in 1030, Rainulf Drengot obtained the County of Aversa.

After this first success, many other Normans sought to expand into Southern Italy. Among their most important leaders were Hauteville family members. In short time, the Hauteville created their own state: William Iron Arm became, in 1042, Count of Apulia.

===The anti-Norman coalition===
The Norman advances in southern Italy had alarmed the papacy for many years, though the impetus for the battle itself came about for several reasons. First, the Norman presence in Italy was more than just a case of upsetting the power balance, for many of the Italian locals did not take kindly to the Norman raiding and wished to respond in kind, regarding them as little better than brigands. An abbot from Normandy, John of Fécamp, for example wrote of such local sentiments in a letter to Pope Leo himself:

The raiding activities which brought about such hatred also occurred in the see of Benevento, a deed not emphasized in the Norman chronicles, but for Pope Leo this was the more significant concern in the political instability of the region. In fact, according to Graham Loud, the Beneventians, who previously had been approached by both the German Emperor Henry III and by the Pope previously to swear fealty, finally appealed and submitted to Leo to personally take over the control of the city (as well as lifting a previous excommunication) in 1051. At this point, Benevento was also the border and march land between Rome and the German Empire and the newly established Norman holdings.

The second reason behind the conflict of Civitate was the instability brought about on the Norman side by the murder in unclear circumstances of Drogo de Hauteville, who up to that time had been the nominal war leader of the Normans and Count of Apulia. According to Malaterra&#x27;s account, the native Lombards were responsible for the plot, and a courtier named Rito committed the deed at the &quot;castrum&quot; of Montillaro. Despite the benefit the pope and both Greek and German emperors would have drawn from his murder, it is difficult to speculate beyond Malaterra&#x27;s report since the details of the murder do not appear in most other sources, particularly the Norman chronicles. Nevertheless, there was certainly a strong reaction to Drogo&#x27;s death, with his brother Humphrey taking over the leadership position and in response scoured the countryside for his enemies:

Finally, in 1052, Leo met his relative Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor in Saxony, and asked for aid in curbing the growing Norman power. Initially, substantial aid was refused and Leo returned to Rome in March 1053 with only 700 Swabian infantry. Adalbert II, Count of Winterthur (modern day Switzerland), their leader, raised the 700 Swabian knights from the very House out of which the House of Kyburg would later emerge. The Duchy of Swabia, at the time, included most modern day German-speaking Cantons of Switzerland.

But there were others worried about the Norman power, in particular the Italian and Lombard rulers in the south. The Prince of Benevento, Rudolf, the Duke of Gaeta, the Counts of Aquino and Teano, the Archbishop and the citizens of Amalfi — together with Lombards from Apulia, Molise, Campania, Abruzzo and Latium — answered the call of the Pope, and formed a coalition that moved against the Normans. However, while these forces included troops from almost every great Italian magnate, they did not include forces from Prince of Salerno, who would have gained more than the others from a Norman defeat.

The Pope had also another friendly power, the Byzantine Empire ruled by Constantine IX. At first, the Byzantines, established in Apulia, had tried to buy off the Normans and press them into service within their own largely mercenary army; since the Normans were famous for their avarice. So, the Byzantine commander, the Lombard Catepan of Italy Argyrus, offered money to disperse as mercenaries to the Eastern frontiers of the Empire, but the Normans rejected the proposal, explicitly stating that their aim was the conquest of southern Italy. Thus spurned, Argyrus contacted the Pope, and when Leo and his army moved from Rome to Apulia to engage the Normans in battle, a Byzantine army personally led by Argyrus moved from Apulia with the same plan, catching the Normans in a pinch.

The Normans understood the danger and collected all available men and formed a single army under the command of the new Count of Apulia and Drogo&#x27;s eldest surviving brother, Humphrey of Hauteville, as well as the Count of Aversa, Richard Drengot, and others of the de Hauteville family, amongst which was Robert, later known under the name of Robert Guiscard.

==The battle==
Despite several contemporary sources of the background and lead-up to the battle, the narrative source which gives the most detail of the battle itself is the &quot;Gesta Wiscardi&quot; of William of Apulia.

To begin with, Leo moved to Apulia, and reached the Fortore River near the city of Civitate (or Civitella, northwest of Foggia). The Normans went forth to intercept the Papal army near Civitella and prevent its union with the Byzantine army, led by Argyrus. The Normans were short on supplies because of the harvest season, and had fewer men than their enemies, with no more than 3,000 horsemen and 500 infantry against 6,000 horsemen and infantry. Both Amatus&#x27; account and William of Apulia agree that the Normans were suffering from hunger and lack of nutrition, and both also add that the Normans forces were in fact so lacking that they, &quot;by the example of the Apostles took the heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate the kernels,&quot; some may have cooked them over the fire beforehand as well. Because of this, the Normans were driven to ask for a truce, but were refused, though there is some disagreement on who the greater enemies of the Normans were in refusing the negotiations, varying between the Lombards, the Germans, and the curia of Pope Leo himself, whom the Normans in fact wished to swear their &quot;fidelitas&quot;.

The two armies were divided by a small hill. The Normans put their horsemen in three companies, with the heavy cavalry of Richard of Aversa on the right, Humphrey with infantry, dismounted knights and archers in the center, and Robert Guiscard, with his horsemen and his infantry (the &quot;sclavos&quot;, the Slavic infantry), on the left. Other Norman commanders included Peter and Walter, the illustrious sons of Amicus, Aureolanus, Hubert, Rainald Musca, and Count Hugh and Count Gerard, who commanded respectively the Beneventans and the men of Telese, and also Count Radulfus of Boiano. In front of them, the Papal army was divided into two parts, with the heavy Swabian infantry on a thin and long line from the center extending to the right, and the Italian levies amassed in a mob on the left, under the command of Rudolf. Pope Leo was in the city, but his standard, the &quot;vexillum sancti Petri&quot;, was with his allied army.

The battle started with the attack of Richard of Aversa against the Italians on the left with a flanking movement and charge. After moving across the plain, they arrived in front their opponents, who broke formation and fled without even trying to resist. The Normans killed many of them as they retreated and moved further towards the Papal field-camp, before eventually attempting to return to the main engagement.

The Swabians, in the meantime, had moved to the hill, and came into contact with the Norman center and the forces of Humphrey, skirmishing with arrows and archers before entering a general melee. Most likely, this engagement was primarily on foot, as the Germans are often referred to as &quot;taking up their swords and shields&quot;, William of Apulia adds that this was a part of their German character:

The fight with the Swabians was the main focus of much of the battle, with the Normans attempting to flank the Swabians while Humphrey engaged them. Robert Guiscard, seeing his brother in danger, moved with the left wing to the hill, and succeeded in easing the Swabian pressure, and also displayed his personal bravery with the aid of the Calabrians under the command of Count Gerard.

The situation on the center however, remained balanced. Yet thanks to the continued Norman discipline in holding the line against the Swabians, the day was at last decided by the return of Richard&#x27;s forces from pursuing the Italians, which resulted in the defeat of the Papal coalition.

==Aftermath==

After preparing a siege of the town of Civitate itself, the Pope was taken prisoner by the victorious Normans.

There is some uncertainty over how this happened. Papal sources say that Leo left Civitate and surrendered himself to prevent further bloodshed. Other sources including Malaterra indicate that the inhabitants of Civitate handed over the Pope and drove him &quot;out of the gates,&quot; after seeing the Norman threat manifested in siege towers and earthen ramparts. He was treated respectfully but was imprisoned at Benevento for almost nine months, and forced to ratify a number of treaties favorable to the Normans. However, according to the Norman accounts, Leo was treated more as an honored guest than as a prisoner, and by no means lacked for comforts, Amatus claims that &quot;they continually furnished him with wine, bread, and all the necessities,&quot; and was &quot;protected&quot; by the Normans until he returned to Rome ten months later. According to John Julius Norwich, Leo attempted a long, passive resistance to agreeing to anything for the Normans, and was waiting for an imperial relief army from Germany. In addition, Norwich believes that despite the lack of concrete support until later popes, Leo did eventually acknowledge the Normans as the rulers of the South in order to get a release for his freedom. Meanwhile, Argyros and the Byzantine army were forced to disband and return to Greece via Bari, since their forces were not strong enough to fight the Normans now that the papal forces had been defeated. Argyros may even have been banished from the Empire by Constantine himself.

More importantly, the Battle of Civitate proved to be a turning point in the fortunes of the Normans in Italy, who were able to win a victory despite their differences even among themselves, and solidifying their legitimacy in the process. Not only that, it was the first major victory for Robert Guiscard, who would eventually rise to prominence as the leader of the Normans in the South. In terms of its implications, the Battle of Civitate had the same long-term political ramifications as had the Battle of Hastings in England and Northern Europe, a reorientation of power and influence into a Latin-Christendom world. Finally, while Leo attempted to maintain an anti-Norman alliance with the Byzantines in hopes of driving them out on religious grounds, the inability of the papal legates to negotiate with the Greek court in addition to Leo&#x27;s untimely death negated any hope for aid from the Byzantines, except at the command of the Eastern emperor himself. The schism, in this case, worked to the favor of the Normans at least in the political realm.

After six more years, and three more anti-Norman popes, the Treaty of Melfi (1059) marked the recognition of the Norman power in South Italy. There were two reasons for this change in papal politics. First, the Normans had shown themselves to be a powerful (and nearby) enemy, whereas the emperor was a weak (and far off) ally. Second, Pope Nicholas II had decided to cut the bonds between the Roman Church and the Holy Roman emperors, reclaiming for the Roman cardinals the right to elect the pope (see Investiture Controversy), thus reducing the importance of the emperor. And in the foreseeable struggle against the Empire, a strong ally was more desirable than a strong enemy.

<doc id="225779" wikidata="Q1156793" url="?curid=225779" title="Program optimization">
<text>In computer science, program optimization, code optimization, or software optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources. In general, a computer program may be optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or to make it capable of operating with less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power.

==Overview==
Although the term &quot;optimization&quot; is derived from &quot;optimum&quot;, achieving a truly optimal system is rare in practice, which is referred to as superoptimization. Optimization typically focuses on improving a system with respect to a specific quality metric rather than making it universally optimal. This often leads to trade-offs, where enhancing one metric may come at the expense of another. One popular example is space-time tradeoff, reducing a program’s execution time by increasing its memory consumption. Conversely, in scenarios where memory is limited, engineers might prioritize a slower algorithm to conserve space. There is rarely a single design that can excel in all situations, requiring engineers to prioritize attributes most relevant to the application at hand.

Furthermore, achieving absolute optimization often demands disproportionate effort relative to the benefits gained. Consequently, optimization processes usually stop once sufficient improvements are achieved, without striving for perfection. Fortunately, significant gains often occur early in the optimization process, making it practical to stop before reaching diminishing returns.

==Levels of optimization==
Optimization can occur at a number of levels. Typically the higher levels have greater impact, and are harder to change later on in a project, requiring significant changes or a complete rewrite if they need to be changed. Thus optimization can typically proceed via refinement from higher to lower, with initial gains being larger and achieved with less work, and later gains being smaller and requiring more work. However, in some cases overall performance depends on performance of very low-level portions of a program, and small changes at a late stage or early consideration of low-level details can have outsized impact. Typically some consideration is given to efficiency throughout a project though this varies significantly but major optimization is often considered a refinement to be done late, if ever. On longer-running projects there are typically cycles of optimization, where improving one area reveals limitations in another, and these are typically curtailed when performance is acceptable or gains become too small or costly.

As performance is part of the specification of a program a program that is unusably slow is not fit for purpose: a video game with 60 Hz (frames-per-second) is acceptable, but 6 frames-per-second is unacceptably choppy performance is a consideration from the start, to ensure that the system is able to deliver sufficient performance, and early prototypes need to have roughly acceptable performance for there to be confidence that the final system will (with optimization) achieve acceptable performance. This is sometimes omitted in the belief that optimization can always be done later, resulting in prototype systems that are far too slow often by an order of magnitude or more and systems that ultimately are failures because they architecturally cannot achieve their performance goals, such as the Intel 432 (1981); or ones that take years of work to achieve acceptable performance, such as Java (1995), which only achieved acceptable performance with HotSpot (1999). The degree to which performance changes between prototype and production system, and how amenable it is to optimization, can be a significant source of uncertainty and risk.

===Design level===
At the highest level, the design may be optimized to make best use of the available resources, given goals, constraints, and expected use/load. The architectural design of a system overwhelmingly affects its performance. For example, a system that is network latency-bound (where network latency is the main constraint on overall performance) would be optimized to minimize network trips, ideally making a single request (or no requests, as in a push protocol) rather than multiple roundtrips. Choice of design depends on the goals: when designing a compiler, if fast compilation is the key priority, a one-pass compiler is faster than a multi-pass compiler (assuming same work), but if speed of output code is the goal, a slower multi-pass compiler fulfills the goal better, even though it takes longer itself. Choice of platform and programming language occur at this level, and changing them frequently requires a complete rewrite, though a modular system may allow rewrite of only some component for example, a Python program may rewrite performance-critical sections in C. In a distributed system, choice of architecture (client-server, peer-to-peer, etc.) occurs at the design level, and may be difficult to change, particularly if all components cannot be replaced in sync (e.g., old clients).

===Algorithms and data structures===
Given an overall design, a good choice of efficient algorithms and data structures, and efficient implementation of these algorithms and data structures comes next. After design, the choice of algorithms and data structures affects efficiency more than any other aspect of the program. Generally data structures are more difficult to change than algorithms, as a data structure assumption and its performance assumptions are used throughout the program, though this can be minimized by the use of abstract data types in function definitions, and keeping the concrete data structure definitions restricted to a few places.

For algorithms, this primarily consists of ensuring that algorithms are constant O(1), logarithmic O(log &quot;n&quot;), linear O(&quot;n&quot;), or in some cases log-linear O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) in the input (both in space and time). Algorithms with quadratic complexity O(&quot;n&quot;2) fail to scale, and even linear algorithms cause problems if repeatedly called, and are typically replaced with constant or logarithmic if possible.

Beyond asymptotic order of growth, the constant factors matter: an asymptotically slower algorithm may be faster or smaller (because simpler) than an asymptotically faster algorithm when they are both faced with small input, which may be the case that occurs in reality. Often a hybrid algorithm will provide the best performance, due to this tradeoff changing with size.

A general technique to improve performance is to avoid work. A good example is the use of a fast path for common cases, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary work. For example, using a simple text layout algorithm for Latin text, only switching to a complex layout algorithm for complex scripts, such as Devanagari. Another important technique is caching, particularly memoization, which avoids redundant computations. Because of the importance of caching, there are often many levels of caching in a system, which can cause problems from memory use, and correctness issues from stale caches.

===Source code level===
Beyond general algorithms and their implementation on an abstract machine, concrete source code level choices can make a significant difference. For example, on early C compilers, codice_1 was slower than codice_2 for an unconditional loop, because codice_1 evaluated 1 and then had a conditional jump which tested if it was true, while codice_4 had an unconditional jump . Some optimizations (such as this one) can nowadays be performed by optimizing compilers. This depends on the source language, the target machine language, and the compiler, and can be both difficult to understand or predict and changes over time; this is a key place where understanding of compilers and machine code can improve performance. Loop-invariant code motion and return value optimization are examples of optimizations that reduce the need for auxiliary variables and can even result in faster performance by avoiding round-about optimizations.

===Build level===
Between the source and compile level, directives and build flags can be used to tune performance options in the source code and compiler respectively, such as using preprocessor defines to disable unneeded software features, optimizing for specific processor models or hardware capabilities, or predicting branching, for instance. Source-based software distribution systems such as BSD&#x27;s Ports and Gentoo&#x27;s Portage can take advantage of this form of optimization.

===Compile level===
Use of an optimizing compiler tends to ensure that the executable program is optimized at least as much as the compiler can predict.

===Assembly level===
At the lowest level, writing code using an assembly language, designed for a particular hardware platform can produce the most efficient and compact code if the programmer takes advantage of the full repertoire of machine instructions. Many operating systems used on embedded systems have been traditionally written in assembler code for this reason. Programs (other than very small programs) are seldom written from start to finish in assembly due to the time and cost involved. Most are compiled down from a high level language to assembly and hand optimized from there. When efficiency and size are less important large parts may be written in a high-level language.

With more modern optimizing compilers and the greater complexity of recent CPUs, it is harder to write more efficient code than what the compiler generates, and few projects need this &quot;ultimate&quot; optimization step.

Much of the code written today is intended to run on as many machines as possible. As a consequence, programmers and compilers don&#x27;t always take advantage of the more efficient instructions provided by newer CPUs or quirks of older models. Additionally, assembly code tuned for a particular processor without using such instructions might still be suboptimal on a different processor, expecting a different tuning of the code.

Typically today rather than writing in assembly language, programmers will use a disassembler to analyze the output of a compiler and change the high-level source code so that it can be compiled more efficiently, or understand why it is inefficient.

===Run time===
Just-in-time compilers can produce customized machine code based on run-time data, at the cost of compilation overhead. This technique dates to the earliest regular expression engines, and has become widespread with Java HotSpot and V8 for JavaScript. In some cases adaptive optimization may be able to perform run time optimization exceeding the capability of static compilers by dynamically adjusting parameters according to the actual input or other factors.

Profile-guided optimization is an ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation optimization technique based on run time profiles, and is similar to a static &quot;average case&quot; analog of the dynamic technique of adaptive optimization.

Self-modifying code can alter itself in response to run time conditions in order to optimize code; this was more common in assembly language programs.

Some CPU designs can perform some optimizations at run time. Some examples include out-of-order execution, speculative execution, instruction pipelines, and branch predictors. Compilers can help the program take advantage of these CPU features, for example through instruction scheduling.

===Platform dependent and independent optimizations===
Code optimization can be also broadly categorized as platform-dependent and platform-independent techniques. While the latter ones are effective on most or all platforms, platform-dependent techniques use specific properties of one platform, or rely on parameters depending on the single platform or even on the single processor. Writing or producing different versions of the same code for different processors might therefore be needed. For instance, in the case of compile-level optimization, platform-independent techniques are generic techniques (such as loop unrolling, reduction in function calls, memory efficient routines, reduction in conditions, etc.), that impact most CPU architectures in a similar way. A great example of platform-independent optimization has been shown with inner for loop, where it was observed that a loop with an inner for loop performs more computations per unit time than a loop without it or one with an inner while loop. Generally, these serve to reduce the total instruction path length required to complete the program and/or reduce total memory usage during the process. On the other hand, platform-dependent techniques involve instruction scheduling, instruction-level parallelism, data-level parallelism, cache optimization techniques (i.e., parameters that differ among various platforms) and the optimal instruction scheduling might be different even on different processors of the same architecture.

==Strength reduction==
Computational tasks can be performed in several different ways with varying efficiency. A more efficient version with equivalent functionality is known as a strength reduction. For example, consider the following C code snippet whose intention is to obtain the sum of all integers from 1 to :
int i, sum = 0;
for (i = 1; i &lt;= N; ++i) {
 sum += i;
printf(&quot;sum: %d\n&quot;, sum);
This code can (assuming no arithmetic overflow) be rewritten using a mathematical formula like:
int sum = N * (1 + N) / 2;
printf(&quot;sum: %d\n&quot;, sum);
The optimization, sometimes performed automatically by an optimizing compiler, is to select a method (algorithm) that is more computationally efficient, while retaining the same functionality. See algorithmic efficiency for a discussion of some of these techniques. However, a significant improvement in performance can often be achieved by removing extraneous functionality.

Optimization is not always an obvious or intuitive process. In the example above, the &quot;optimized&quot; version might actually be slower than the original version if were sufficiently small and the particular hardware happens to be much faster at performing addition and looping operations than multiplication and division.

== Trade-offs ==
In some cases, however, optimization relies on using more elaborate algorithms, making use of &quot;special cases&quot; and special &quot;tricks&quot; and performing complex trade-offs. A &quot;fully optimized&quot; program might be more difficult to comprehend and hence may contain more faults than unoptimized versions. Beyond eliminating obvious antipatterns, some code level optimizations decrease maintainability.

Optimization will generally focus on improving just one or two aspects of performance: execution time, memory usage, disk space, bandwidth, power consumption or some other resource. This will usually require a trade-off where one factor is optimized at the expense of others. For example, increasing the size of cache improves run time performance, but also increases the memory consumption. Other common trade-offs include code clarity and conciseness.

There are instances where the programmer performing the optimization must decide to make the software better for some operations but at the cost of making other operations less efficient. These trade-offs may sometimes be of a non-technical nature such as when a competitor has published a benchmark result that must be beaten in order to improve commercial success but comes perhaps with the burden of making normal usage of the software less efficient. Such changes are sometimes jokingly referred to as &quot;pessimizations&quot;.

==Bottlenecks==
Optimization may include finding a bottleneck in a system a component that is the limiting factor on performance. In terms of code, this will often be a hot spot a critical part of the code that is the primary consumer of the needed resource though it can be another factor, such as I/O latency or network bandwidth.

In computer science, resource consumption often follows a form of power law distribution, and the Pareto principle can be applied to resource optimization by observing that 80% of the resources are typically used by 20% of the operations. In software engineering, it is often a better approximation that 90% of the execution time of a computer program is spent executing 10% of the code (known as the 90/10 law in this context).

More complex algorithms and data structures perform well with many items, while simple algorithms are more suitable for small amounts of data — the setup, initialization time, and constant factors of the more complex algorithm can outweigh the benefit, and thus a hybrid algorithm or adaptive algorithm may be faster than any single algorithm. A performance profiler can be used to narrow down decisions about which functionality fits which conditions.

In some cases, adding more memory can help to make a program run faster. For example, a filtering program will commonly read each line and filter and output that line immediately. This only uses enough memory for one line, but performance is typically poor, due to the latency of each disk read. Caching the result is similarly effective, though also requiring larger memory use.

==When to optimize==
Optimization can reduce readability and add code that is used only to improve the performance. This may complicate programs or systems, making them harder to maintain and debug. As a result, optimization or performance tuning is often performed at the end of the development stage.

Donald Knuth made the following two statements on optimization:

&quot;We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%&quot;
(He also attributed the quote to Tony Hoare several years later, although this might have been an error as Hoare disclaims having coined the phrase.)
 &quot;In established engineering disciplines a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal and I believe the same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering&quot;

&quot;Premature optimization&quot; is a phrase used to describe a situation where a programmer lets performance considerations affect the design of a piece of code. This can result in a design that is not as clean as it could have been or code that is incorrect, because the code is complicated by the optimization and the programmer is distracted by optimizing.

When deciding whether to optimize a specific part of the program, Amdahl&#x27;s Law should always be considered: the impact on the overall program depends very much on how much time is actually spent in that specific part, which is not always clear from looking at the code without a performance analysis.

A better approach is therefore to design first, code from the design and then profile/benchmark the resulting code to see which parts should be optimized. A simple and elegant design is often easier to optimize at this stage, and profiling may reveal unexpected performance problems that would not have been addressed by premature optimization.

In practice, it is often necessary to keep performance goals in mind when first designing software, but the programmer balances the goals of design and optimization.

Modern compilers and operating systems are so efficient that the intended performance increases often fail to materialize. As an example, caching data at the application level that is again cached at the operating system level does not yield improvements in execution. Even so, it is a rare case when the programmer will remove failed optimizations from production code. It is also true that advances in hardware will more often than not obviate any potential improvements, yet the obscuring code will persist into the future long after its purpose has been negated.

==Macros==
Optimization during code development using macros takes on different forms in different languages.

In some procedural languages, such as C and C++, macros are implemented using token substitution. Nowadays, inline functions can be used as a type safe alternative in many cases. In both cases, the inlined function body can then undergo further compile-time optimizations by the compiler, including constant folding, which may move some computations to compile time.

In many functional programming languages, macros are implemented using parse-time substitution of parse trees/abstract syntax trees, which it is claimed makes them safer to use. Since in many cases interpretation is used, that is one way to ensure that such computations are only performed at parse-time, and sometimes the only way.

Lisp originated this style of macro, and such macros are often called &quot;Lisp-like macros&quot;. A similar effect can be achieved by using template metaprogramming in C++.

In both cases, work is moved to compile-time. The difference between C macros on one side, and Lisp-like macros and C++ template metaprogramming on the other side, is that the latter tools allow performing arbitrary computations at compile-time/parse-time, while expansion of C macros does not perform any computation, and relies on the optimizer ability to perform it. Additionally, C macros do not directly support recursion or iteration, so are not Turing complete.

As with any optimization, however, it is often difficult to predict where such tools will have the most impact before a project is complete.

==Automated and manual optimization==

&quot;See also :Category:Compiler optimizations&quot;

Optimization can be automated by compilers or performed by programmers. Gains are usually limited for local optimization, and larger for global optimizations. Usually, the most powerful optimization is to find a superior algorithm.

Optimizing a whole system is usually undertaken by programmers because it is too complex for automated optimizers. In this situation, programmers or system administrators explicitly change code so that the overall system performs better. Although it can produce better efficiency, it is far more expensive than automated optimizations. Since many parameters influence the program performance, the program optimization space is large. Meta-heuristics and machine learning are used to address the complexity of program optimization. 

Use a profiler (or performance analyzer) to find the sections of the program that are taking the most resources the &quot;bottleneck&quot;. Programmers sometimes believe they have a clear idea of where the bottleneck is, but intuition is frequently wrong. Optimizing an unimportant piece of code will typically do little to help the overall performance.

When the bottleneck is localized, optimization usually starts with a rethinking of the algorithm used in the program. More often than not, a particular algorithm can be specifically tailored to a particular problem, yielding better performance than a generic algorithm. For example, the task of sorting a huge list of items is usually done with a quicksort routine, which is one of the most efficient generic algorithms. But if some characteristic of the items is exploitable (for example, they are already arranged in some particular order), a different method can be used, or even a custom-made sort routine.

After the programmer is reasonably sure that the best algorithm is selected, code optimization can start. Loops can be unrolled (for lower loop overhead, although this can often lead to &quot;lower&quot; speed if it overloads the CPU cache), data types as small as possible can be used, integer arithmetic can be used instead of floating-point, and so on. (See algorithmic efficiency article for these and other techniques.)

Performance bottlenecks can be due to language limitations rather than algorithms or data structures used in the program. Sometimes, a critical part of the program can be re-written in a different programming language that gives more direct access to the underlying machine. For example, it is common for very high-level languages like Python to have modules written in C for greater speed. Programs already written in C can have modules written in assembly. Programs written in D can use the inline assembler.

Rewriting sections &quot;pays off&quot; in these circumstances because of a general &quot;rule of thumb&quot; known as the 90/10 law, which states that 90% of the time is spent in 10% of the code, and only 10% of the time in the remaining 90% of the code. So, putting intellectual effort into optimizing just a small part of the program can have a huge effect on the overall speed if the correct part(s) can be located.

Manual optimization sometimes has the side effect of undermining readability. Thus code optimizations should be carefully documented (preferably using in-line comments), and their effect on future development evaluated.

The program that performs an automated optimization is called an optimizer. Most optimizers are embedded in compilers and operate during compilation. Optimizers can often tailor the generated code to specific processors.

Today, automated optimizations are almost exclusively limited to compiler optimization. However, because compiler optimizations are usually limited to a fixed set of rather general optimizations, there is considerable demand for optimizers which can accept descriptions of problem and language-specific optimizations, allowing an engineer to specify custom optimizations. Tools that accept descriptions of optimizations are called program transformation systems and are beginning to be applied to real software systems such as C++.

Some high-level languages (Eiffel, Esterel) optimize their programs by using an intermediate language.

Grid computing or distributed computing aims to optimize the whole system, by moving tasks from computers with high usage to computers with idle time.

==Time taken for optimization==
Sometimes, the time taken to undertake optimization therein itself may be an issue.

Optimizing existing code usually does not add new features, and worse, it might add new bugs in previously working code (as any change might). Because manually optimized code might sometimes have less &quot;readability&quot; than unoptimized code, optimization might impact maintainability of it as well. Optimization comes at a price and it is important to be sure that the investment is worthwhile.

An automatic optimizer (or optimizing compiler, a program that performs code optimization) may itself have to be optimized, either to further improve the efficiency of its target programs or else speed up its own operation. A compilation performed with optimization &quot;turned on&quot; usually takes longer, although this is usually only a problem when programs are quite large.

In particular, for just-in-time compilers the performance of the run time compile component, executing together with its target code, is the key to improving overall execution speed.

<text>Macclesfield Town Football Club was an association football club based in Macclesfield, Cheshire, England.

Initially known as Macclesfield F.C., the club was formed in 1874 and from 1891 played home games at Moss Rose. It competed in the short-lived Combination league in the 1890–91 season, reforming in the Manchester League at the end of the century. The club won the Manchester League title twice, before becoming inaugural members of the Cheshire County League at the start of the 1919–20 season, ultimately winning the League six times. Renamed Macclesfield Town in 1946, the club were founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, winning the league in its first two years, as well as the FA Trophy in 1970. They were promoted to the Conference after they won their third Northern Premier League title in 1986–87.

Manager Sammy McIlroy led Macclesfield Town to the top of the Conference in 1993–94, but they were not promoted as Moss Rose did not meet Football League requirements. They won the FA Trophy for a second time in 1996. They again won the Conference title in 1996–97 and this time were promoted, winning promotion in their inaugural Football League campaign with a second-place finish in the Third Division in 1997–98. However they were immediately relegated from the Second Division. The club stayed in the fourth tier of the Football League from 1999 to 2012, losing a play-off semi-final in 2005, before being relegated back into the Conference. Despite financial constraints, manager John Askey led the club back into the Football League as champions of the National League in 2017–18. In 2018–19, the club avoided relegation back to the National League, but financial issues continued to affect it. After a points deduction activated on 11 August 2020, the club was relegated to the National League, the 5th tier of English football, for the 2020–21 season.

The club was wound-up after a High Court ruling on 16 September 2020, and the club was initially suspended and then expelled from the National League with effect from 12 October 2020. In October 2020, local businessman Robert Smethurst purchased the assets of Macclesfield Town, and established Macclesfield F.C., entering it into the North West Counties Football League in the 2021–22 season.

==History==
===19th century===

The beginnings of Macclesfield Town Football Club can be traced, at least in part, to the 8th Cheshire Rifle Volunteers who were formed in 1873 and played regularly in Macclesfield from October 1874. It was agreed at a public meeting on 21 October 1876 that the 8th Cheshire Rifle Volunteers and the Olympic Cricket club teams be merged to form Macclesfield F.C.; initially matches alternated between association and rugby rules. At the beginning of the 1878–79 Macclesfield United Football Club merged with Macclesfield Football Club. The club played in the FA Cup competition for the first time on 18 November 1882, losing 3–4 to Lockwood Brothers and first entered the Cheshire Senior Cup in the 1879–80 season, winning this competition for the first time on 22 March 1890 when they beat Nantwich 4–1 and went on to be winners on three more occasions before the turn of the century.

Macclesfield became members of The Combination at the start of the 1890–91 season and moved from Victoria Road to the Moss Rose on 12 September 1891 which remains the home of the Silkmen today. In July 1894 the first limited company, Macclesfield Football and Athletic Club Limited, was formed but only lasted until the end of the 1896–97 season when it was wound up and Macclesfield Football Club withdrew from The Combination due to financial constraints. For the 1897–98 season, and the following two seasons, local amateur side Hallefield moved their fixtures to the Moss Rose.

===1900 to World War II===

Having re-formed, Macclesfield became members of the Manchester League for the 1900–01 season and were champions in the 1908–09 and 1910–11 seasons. They fielded two senior teams for the 1911–12 season, continuing in the Manchester League with the second team competing in the Lancashire Combination 2nd Division. Having withdrawn from the Manchester League at the end of the 1911–12 season, the club reverted to one senior team for the 1912–13 season which competed in the Lancashire Combination 2nd Division. They gained promotion as runners-up at the end of the 1913–14 season to compete in the 1st Division for the 1914–15 season. In line with all other football clubs after a decree by the government there was no further competitive football at the Moss Rose during hostilities.

Macclesfield became inaugural members of the Cheshire County League at the start of the 1919–20 season of which they were champions in the 1931–32 and 1932–33 seasons. In the 1933–34 season, Albert Valentine set an all-time club record scoring 83 goals in the season. The first ever manager, James Stevenson, was appointed for the 1936–37 season. Between 1900 and 1939 they won the Cheshire Senior Cup three times (1910–11, 1929–30 and 1934–35). Although a member of the Cheshire War-time League (1939 West Series and 1940 East Series), due to dwindling attendances and increasing debts Macclesfield withdrew from the league at the end of the 1939–40 season and no further football was played on the Moss Rose during the Second World War. It would be just prior to the 1946–47 season before the outstanding debts were settled.

===1946 to 1999===

When competitive football resumed after World War II, Macclesfield Town Football Club Ltd was formed and the club gained their current name. The club re-joined the Cheshire County League in 1946–47, playing their first game after reformation on 31 August 1946, a 2–0 defeat to Buxton. The club&#x27;s form in the remainder of the 1940s was largely indifferent, with the exception of a Cheshire League Challenge Cup win in 1948. The 1950s proved more successful, with four trophies in as many years from 1951 to 1954, including the club&#x27;s first Cheshire County League title in 20 years in 1953, though the team&#x27;s fortunes faded in the latter half of the decade.

Macclesfield Town progressed through four qualifying rounds to make their first appearance in the FA Cup first round in 1960 under manager Frank Bowyer, but lost 7–2 to Southport. At the end of that season the club won the Cheshire County League, beginning a nine-year period in which they won three league titles and finished no lower than fifth, and in 1964 won the Cheshire County League by a record-equalling 13 point margin. The club reached the FA Cup third round for the first time in 1968, meeting First Division Fulham at Craven Cottage. Macclesfield Town lost 4–2, but the performance resulted in Macclesfield Town&#x27;s Keith Goalen becoming the first non-league player to be named &quot;Footballer of the Month&quot; by the London Evening Standard.

The club were founder members of the Northern Premier League, one of three leagues at the fifth tier of English football, upon its creation in 1968. Macclesfield Town were champions in each of the first two seasons of the competition, finishing 12 points clear in 1968–69, and by goal average in 1969–70. The 1969–70 season also resulted in a trip to Wembley for the inaugural final of the FA Trophy, a knockout competition for non-league clubs. Macclesfield Town defeated Telford United 2–0 in front of more than 28,000 spectators to win the competition. A period of decline then followed, despite the performances of Willie Mailey in goal, and the side&#x27;s fortunes reached a nadir when the club finished bottom of the Northern Premier League in 1979, a year when the stronger teams from the division formed the national Alliance Premier League (now known as the National League). The 1980s saw steady rebuilding. The club finished as Northern Premier League runners-up in the 1984–85 season.

Macclesfield Town&#x27;s third Northern Premier League title in the 1986–87 season resulted in promotion to the Football Conference; they also lifted the League Challenge Cup and President&#x27;s Cup. They finished in mid-table in their first Conference season, and eliminated two League teams, Carlisle and Rotherham, from the FA Cup. The club reached the FA Trophy final for the second time in 1989, facing Telford United. However, the team did not match the achievement of their predecessors 19 years earlier, losing 1–0. From a high of a fourth place league finish in 1989–90, Macclesfield Town&#x27;s final standing diminished each season, and following a struggle against relegation in 1992–93, manager Peter Wragg was sacked, and replaced with former Manchester United midfielder Sammy McIlroy.

McIlroy took charge at the start of the 1993–94 season, and guided the club to the Football Conference championship in his second season as manager. However. the club was denied promotion to the English Football League because the Moss Rose did not meet league requirements of having a 6,000 total capacity including at least 1,000 seats by the League&#x27;s deadline of 31 December 1994. Macclesfield Town won the Conference title again two seasons later in 1996–97, by which time the stadium had been upgraded and they were promoted to Division Three of the Football League in place of Hereford United.

Upon gaining League status, the club turned fully professional. Macclesfield Town&#x27;s first League match was a 2–1 win at home to Torquay United on 9 August 1997. Town&#x27;s first ever goal in the Football League was scored by Efe Sodje who also became Macclesfield Town&#x27;s first Black player that day. The momentum of the Conference success continued, and, unbeaten at home in their first League season, Macclesfield Town finished runners-up in Division Three and were promoted for the second consecutive season, this time to Division Two. However, the higher level proved a step too far for the club, who finished the 1998–99 season bottom of Division Two and were relegated. McIlroy soon left to become the Northern Ireland national coach and was replaced by former Manchester United colleague Peter Davenport.

===2000 to 2020===

A dismal start to the following season cost Davenport his job though, and Gil Prescott took over for the remainder of the season, keeping Macclesfield Town clear of relegation. David Moss in turn succeeded Prescott as manager and delivered two decent mid-table finishes, but a bad start to the 2003–04 season resulted in his sacking. Club stalwart John Askey succeeded Moss initially on a temporary basis, and earned the job permanently with some promising early results. However, a terrible run of one win in three months meant that Askey&#x27;s term as manager was short-lived.

In March 2004, with relegation to the Conference threatening, Macclesfield Town turned to the experienced 55-year-old Brian Horton to take charge. Horton reinvigorated Macclesfield Town who finished fifth in the 2004–05 season, resulting in a playoff place, but the team were eliminated in the semi-finals by Lincoln City. In 2005–06, the team finished an undistinguished 17th. Horton was sacked by the club in late September 2006, following a 12-game winless start to the season, leaving the club bottom of the Football League.

On 23 October 2006, Paul Ince was confirmed as Macclesfield Town&#x27;s new player-manager. He lost his first match in charge 3–2 to Mansfield Town, and it took Macclesfield Town until 20 games into the season to record their first league win under Ince, on 5 December 2006. The team then went on a nine match unbeaten run, earning Ince the League Two Manager of the Month award for December 2006, and also securing an FA Cup tie against then English champions Chelsea away in the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which Town lost 6–1. They were then just able to survive after drawing 1–1 with Notts County on the final day of the 2006–07 season, after a poor run of results landed the team back in the relegation zone; this game also saw the last appearance (and booking) of Paul Ince as a professional footballer. On 24 June 2007, Ince resigned to become MK Dons manager.

On 29 June 2007, Ian Brightwell was announced as the new manager, with Asa Hartford as his assistant. Macclesfield Town started the 2007–08 season away with a 1–1 draw to former Premier League club Bradford City and narrowly lost 1–0 to another former Premier League team Leeds United in the first round of the Football League Cup. Away from the pitch, in January 2008, Chairman Rob Bickerton left the club after 7 years to join Shrewsbury Town. He was replaced by club supporter Mike Rance, with ex-player Andy Scott, founder of Bank Fashion Retail stores, as vice-chairman.

Following a poor run of results and with the club again flirting with the relegation zone to the Football Conference, on 27 February 2008, Brightwell and Hartford left the club with immediate effect. Keith Alexander was named as manager until the end of the season. Alexander kept the Silkmen in League Two following a run of four wins and three draws in nine games and was awarded a new two-year contract. On 3 March 2010, Macclesfield Town announced that manager Alexander had died at the age of 53. Alexander, who suffered a brain aneurysm in November 2003, died after arriving home from the League Two match at Notts County. Subsequently, on 13 April 2010, Macclesfield Town announced Gary Simpson, previously Alexander&#x27;s assistant, as manager on a two-year contract in May 2011, which was subsequently extended by a further year. On 10 January 2011, it was announced that midfield player Richard Butcher had died aged 29. The club retired the number 21 shirt in his honour.

Macclesfield Town failed to win any match from the start of January 2012 until the end of the season (23 league and two FA Cup games; eight draws and 17 defeats). After defeat at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on 17 March continued a winless streak of 14 League matches, Simpson was asked to step down as manager by chairman Mike Rance, and was replaced by Brian Horton. However, Horton was unable to change Town&#x27;s poor form and the team were relegated to the Conference Premier on 28 April 2012 following a home defeat to Burton Albion. Horton then left the club and Glyn Chamberlain took charge of the team for the final game of the season, before Steve King was appointed as manager on 21 May 2012. At the same time, it was announced that Andy Scott would stand down as deputy chairman with immediate effect, and that three other directors, including Rance, would stand down in due course.

On 5 January 2013, Macclesfield Town beat Championship Leaders Cardiff City in the FA Cup 3rd round 2–1. This gave them a place in the 4th round of the tournament for the first time in their 139-year history. Macclesfield Town were generally in or around the Conference National play-off places for much of the season, but a failure to secure a play-off spot resulted in the sacking of Steve King just before the season ended, with the club reappointing former manager John Askey as King&#x27;s replacement.

Macclesfield regularly finished in the top half of the fifth tier despite financial difficulties and on 21 May 2017, the club visited Wembley Stadium for a fourth time, their first appearance since the stadium was rebuilt, losing the 2017 FA Trophy Final 3–2 against York City, who Askey would later go on to manage. A total of 7,698 Silkmen supporters attended the final. Macclesfield topped the National League table for the majority of the 2018/19 season and on 21 April 2018, the Silkmen beat Eastleigh 2–0 to win the title along with promotion back to the Football League after six years playing non-league football.

Following the departure of John Askey for Shrewsbury Town, Mark Yates was named as manager in June 2018. Yates departed the club in October 2018 after failing to win any of his first twelve league games in charge. After Danny Whitaker and Neil Howarth briefly took temporary charge, former Premier League and England defender Sol Campbell was appointed manager in November 2018. In his first managerial role, Campbell secured safety (and 22nd place) on the final day of the season with a draw against Cambridge United.

====2019–20 financial issues and relegation====
In early 2019, off-pitch financial issues meant players were not paid for three months, with some players threatening to boycott the Cambridge game. Six players issued a winding-up order against the club, which was taken over by HM Revenue and Customs in September but the High Court hearing was adjourned 10 times. A hearing on 25 March 2020 was then postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to 17 June, when it was adjourned for an 11th time, to 9 September 2020.

Campbell left the club by mutual consent on 15 August 2019, with Daryl McMahon taking over as manager; Campbell later backed the HMRC winding-up bid, claiming to be owed £180,000.

In October 2019, players again went unpaid, seeking help from the EFL – which, in November, began a formal investigation into the club&#x27;s failure to pay its players. A strike by first team players over the unpaid wages jeopardised Macclesfield&#x27;s FA Cup first round tie against non-league Kingstonian at the Moss Rose on 10 November 2019, but the club fulfilled the fixture, fielding six youth team players and five loanees, losing the tie 4–0 amid protests from Macclesfield supporters, many of whom boycotted the game. Meanwhile, local businessman Joe Sealey, son of former Manchester United goalkeeper Les Sealey, said he wanted to buy the club, though the takeover later (21 November) stalled.

On 14 November 2019, Macclesfield was charged with misconduct by the EFL and referred to a disciplinary panel after failing to pay players. As some players remained unpaid, they said they would not play in the 16 November League Two fixture against Mansfield Town unless paid by 6pm GMT on 15 November. Most were paid so the game went ahead. Two weeks later, Macclesfield players again told the club&#x27;s owner they would not train, or play on 7 December against Crewe Alexandra, if owed wages were not paid. The game was officially &#x27;suspended&#x27; on 6 December, with the EFL triggering further disciplinary action. On 19 December, the EFL docked Macclesfield six points (with a further four-point deduction suspended) over this infraction, but after a January 2020 arbitration panel upheld a &quot;lenient&quot; penalty imposed on Bolton Wanderers for not fulfilling two 2019 fixtures, Maccclesfield Town appealed against its points deduction and the deduction was reduced to four points (with three suspended). The 21 December fixture against Plymouth Argyle was then postponed due to a Moss Rose ground safety issue; the EFL again charged the club with misconduct for failing to fulfil its fixture obligations.

Meanwhile, Macclesfield supporters set up a hardship fund, raising over £11,000 to provide short-term financial emergency support for players and non-playing staff, fearing their club could follow Bury F.C. into &quot;extinction&quot; and blaming owner Amar Alkhadi. He claimed to be in &quot;advanced negotiations with various third parties&quot; over a possible takeover of the club, and on 15 January 2020 said a bid to buy the club had been accepted in principle.

Frustrated by the club&#x27;s financial position, with December&#x27;s pay arriving late, manager McMahon resigned after four months in charge, on 2 January 2020, joining Dagenham &amp; Redbridge the following day, along with assistant Steve Gritt. After Danny Whitaker took temporary charge, on 16 January 2020, Mark Kennedy was appointed head coach. On 29 January, three Macclesfield players (Emmanuel Osadebe, Theo Vassell and Miles Welch-Hayes) approached the EFL and had their contracts terminated ahead of the transfer deadline. Club staff wages for February were also not paid on time, leading the PFA to contact the club. On 9 March, the club was charged with misconduct by the EFL for failing to pay players on time, and was referred to an independent disciplinary commission after failing to fulfil the Crewe and Plymouth fixtures. In April 2020, it was reported that the club had not paid its players for a fifth time, failing to pay March&#x27;s wages, and later that the first team, backroom staff and most office staff had been put on furlough (temporary leave) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2020, the club was given a seven-point deduction (with a further two-point deduction suspended) for failing to fulfil the Plymouth fixture in December 2019, and for failing to pay players&#x27; wages. After the Silkmen Supporters&#x27; Trust provided a loan of £10,000 to help towards the payment of players&#x27; wages for April, further misconduct charges were brought by the EFL on 1 June, relating to late payment of salaries in March. These latest charges left Macclesfield at risk of relegation as, on 9 June, an EFL EGM agreed outstanding promotion and relegation issues, with &quot;ongoing disciplinary matters&quot; meaning Macclesfield could go down in place of Stevenage if further points deductions were made. Continued uncertainty ahead of the disciplinary hearing on 19 June 2020 was reported to be affecting the mental health of the club&#x27;s players and staff, and having an impact on the club&#x27;s potential sale to Joe Sealey, who said he would only be interested if EFL status was retained. On 1 June, Macclesfield received a two-point deduction – retaining the club&#x27;s League Two status – along with a suspended four-point deduction and a £20,000 fine plus costs. However, on 3 July, the EFL said it would appeal against the independent disciplinary panel&#x27;s sanctions on Macclesfield; the hearing was set for 11 August 2020. In the meantime, the club provided the EFL with a &quot;robust&quot; business plan showing sustainable future financial and management resources, and on 4 August, chairman Amar Alkadhi resigned his position.

On 11 August 2020, the club was relegated to the National League following the EFL&#x27;s appeal. The suspended four-point deduction was activated, dropping Macclesfield to the bottom of the table, and reprieving Stevenage. The following day, manager Mark Kennedy and his assistant resigned.

==2020 winding-up order==
On 9 September 2020, the High Court granted Macclesfield a seven-day extension (effectively a 12th adjournment) to a winding-up petition over unpaid tax to give time for a possible takeover of the club by Robert Benwell (previously linked with a move to buy Bury F.C.). If the takeover – said to be at &quot;an advanced stage&quot; – fell through, current owner Amar Alkadhi said outstanding debts would be paid (HMRC was owed £188,721.09, with eight creditors owed £592,000).

On 16 September 2020, the High Court made a winding-up order against the club, pushing the club into liquidation. Judge Sebastian Prentis made the order after receiving no evidence relating to the club&#x27;s sale or satisfactory evidence of the club&#x27;s ability to pay creditors, saying &quot;nothing gives me comfort that the club can pay its debts in a reasonable period&quot;.

The Silkmen Supporters&#x27; Trust were reported to be exploring what actions they could take to save the club, and to be seeking a meeting with the receiver. However, on 29 September 2020, the club was suspended by the National League and its first three scheduled games were postponed, pending a notice of expulsion taking effect from 12 October 2020.

The club&#x27;s final match was a 2–1 victory in a friendly match at Cheshire neighbours Witton Albion on 15 September 2020.

===Macclesfield Football Club establishment===
On 13 October 2020, the official receiver confirmed that the assets of Macclesfield Town had been sold to Macc Football Club Limited. Local businessman (and owner of 10th tier Stockport Town) Robert Smethurst had purchased the assets, intending to establish a new club, Macclesfield Football Club, and enter the North West Counties Football League in the 2021–22 campaign. Former Wales international Robbie Savage, then a Stockport Town player, joined the club&#x27;s board, and former Town player Danny Whittaker became team manager.

==Kit and badge==
Macclesfield Town&#x27;s colours were blue and white; the club have used combinations of these colours since 1947, with the exception of the 1975–76 season, when the team wore tangerine and black as part of a sponsorship deal. Earlier incarnations of the club wore several colours. The first Macclesfield kit was amber and black stripes, but between 1882 and 1947 the club also used red and white, red, yellow and blue, blue and white, and black and white. The club currently play in a blue home shirt and a black away shirt. Their sponsors include ZAM and Macclesfield College.

The club crest is based upon the coat of arms of Macclesfield, and features a blue Lion Rampant holding a wheatsheaf. A new club crest was planned for the start of the 2007–08 season. However, many loyal supporters were not happy with the modern design so the plans were delayed and a re-designed badge was introduced in early 2008, which won the approval of the majority of fans.

==Stadium==
Macclesfield Town played their home games at the Moss Rose stadium in the south of the town from 1891. The first game at the ground adjoining the then named Moss Rose Inn took place on 12 September 1891. Before moving to the Moss Rose, three other grounds were used: Macclesfield Grammar School, Rostron&#x27;s Field (near Coare Street) and Victoria Road (then known as Bowfield Lane).

The current capacity of the Moss Rose is 6,335, of which 2,599 is seated. The &quot;Silk FM Stand&quot; (traditionally known as the London Road or Main Stand) runs along one side of the pitch and consists of a seated grandstand with open air terracing to either side, and the opposite side is the seated &quot;Alfred McAlpine Stand&quot;. The club&#x27;s most vociferous supporters congregate in the &quot;Star Lane End&quot;, which is a mixture of terracing and seating. Visiting supporters are housed in the open air &quot;Silkman End&quot; (named after a public house which formerly adjoined the terrace) and part of the McAlpine Stand.

The record attendance for Macclesfield Town at the Moss Rose is sometimes given as 7,002 for an FA Cup tie against Spennymoor United in 1968. Phythian&#x27;s &quot;Saga of the Silkmen&quot; (p. 85) and the &quot;News of the World Football Annual&quot; both give the record attendance of Moss Rose games involving Macclesfield Town as 9,003, in the Cheshire Cup tie vs. Winsford United, 14 February 1948. The &quot;Macclesfield Times&quot; (19 February 1948) reported that 80 coachloads of supporters had arrived from Winsford. Euro 96 winners Germany used the Moss Rose as a training base during the championships.

In September 2007, the club made a statement about possibly relocating to a new stadium in the proposed &#x27;South Macclesfield Development Area&#x27;, approximately one mile south of the Moss Rose. However, with the club in the lower part of League Two, and as England lost the bid to host the 2018 World Cup (which would have helped the cause for a new stadium), the Moss Rose stadium remained the club&#x27;s ground.

==Supporters and rivalries==
During their spell as a Football League club, Macclesfield Town had a low level of support in comparison with other teams playing at the same level. The club&#x27;s average attendance of 1,832 in the 2010–11 season was the lowest in Football League Two and the Football League; in 2019–2020, average attendance was 1,998—less than half of the averages achieved by nearby League Two rivals Port Vale and Crewe Alexandra. Reasons for this include the proximity of Macclesfield to cities with large football clubs such as Manchester and Liverpool, and a lack of historical success, as Macclesfield Town had only been a Football League club since 1997.

Most supporters are from Macclesfield and its environs with small pockets of fans from Norway, Japan, Port Talbot in south Wales and Fleet in Hampshire (The Southern Silkmen Lads – SSL). In April 2011, football magazine &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; voted Macclesfield Town supporters &quot;League Two Best Away Fans&quot;.

Macclesfield Town&#x27;s traditional rivals were Altrincham and Northwich Victoria, rivalries dating back to when all three clubs were in the Cheshire League, and later the Northern Premier League and Football Conference. Their closest rival in the Football League years has been Stockport County; however, as Stockport were relegated at the end of the 2010–11 season this rivalry was briefly interrupted. Following relegation for the Silkmen, this local derby was briefly resumed, until Stockport&#x27;s relegation to the Conference North at the end of the 2012–13 season. Altrincham were promoted to the National League in the 2013/14 season; however, two years later, they were relegated to the National League North.

On 23 April 2021, local band and Macclesfield fans, Glass Ankle released a video for their song &quot;Super Silkmen&quot; which featured clips recorded by supporters whilst in COVID lockdown, as well as photos of former players and managers held in high esteem. Lyrics within the second verse reference the rivalries held with Crewe, Altrincham, and Stockport County.

<doc id="225801" wikidata="Q113678037" url="?curid=225801" title="Performance tuning">
<text>Performance tuning is the improvement of system performance. Typically in computer systems, the motivation for such activity is called a performance problem, which can be either real or anticipated. Most systems will respond to increased load with some degree of decreasing performance. A system&#x27;s ability to accept higher load is called scalability, and modifying a system to handle a higher load is synonymous to performance tuning.

Systematic tuning follows these steps:
# Assess the problem and establish numeric values that categorize acceptable behavior.
# Measure the performance of the system before modification.
# Identify the part of the system that is critical for improving the performance. This is called the bottleneck.
# Modify that part of the system to remove the bottleneck.
# Measure the performance of the system after modification.
# If the modification makes the performance better, adopt it. If the modification makes the performance worse, put it back the way it was.

This is an instance of the measure-evaluate-improve-learn cycle from quality assurance.

A performance problem may be identified by slow or unresponsive systems. This usually occurs because high system loading, causing some part of the system to reach a limit in its ability to respond. This limit within the system is referred to as a bottleneck.

A handful of techniques are used to improve performance. Among them are code optimization, load balancing, caching strategy, distributed computing and self-tuning.

== Performance analysis ==
: &quot;See the main article at Performance analysis&quot;
Performance analysis, commonly known as profiling, is the investigation of a program&#x27;s behavior using information gathered as the program executes. Its goal is to determine which sections of a program to optimize.

A profiler is a performance analysis tool that measures the behavior of a program as it executes, particularly the frequency and duration of function calls. Performance analysis tools existed at least from the early 1970s. Profilers may be classified according to their output types, or their methods for data gathering.

== Performance engineering ==
: &quot;See the main article at Performance engineering&quot;

Performance engineering is the discipline encompassing roles, skills, activities, practices, tools, and deliverables used to meet the non-functional requirements of a designed system, such as increase business revenue, reduction of system failure, delayed projects, and avoidance of unnecessary usage of resources or work.

Several common activities have been identified in different methodologies:
* Identification of critical business processes.
* Elaboration of the processes in use cases and system volumetrics.
* System construction, including performance tuning.
* Deployment of the constructed system.
* Service management, including activities performed after the system has been deployed.

== Code optimization ==
:&quot;See the main article at Optimization (computer science)&quot;.

Some optimizations include improving the code so that work is done once before a loop rather than inside a loop or replacing a call to a simple selection sort with a call to the more complicated algorithm for a quicksort.

== Configuration optimization ==

Modern software systems, e.g., Big data systems, comprises several frameworks (e.g., Apache Storm, Spark, Hadoop). Each of these frameworks exposes hundreds configuration parameters that considerably influence the performance of such applications. Some optimizations (tuning) include improving the performance of the application finding the best configuration for such applications. 
== Caching strategy ==
Caching is a fundamental method of removing performance bottlenecks that are the result of slow access to data. Caching improves performance by retaining frequently used information in high speed memory, reducing access time and avoiding repeated computation. Caching is an effective manner of improving performance in situations where the principle of locality of reference applies. The methods used to determine which data is stored in progressively faster storage are collectively called caching strategies. Examples are ASP.NET cache, CPU cache, etc.

== Load balancing ==
A system can consist of independent components, each able to service requests. If all the requests are serviced by one of these systems (or a small number) while others remain idle then time is wasted waiting for used system to be available. Arranging so all systems are used equally is referred to as load balancing and can improve overall performance.

Load balancing is often used to achieve further gains from a distributed system by intelligently selecting which machine to run an operation on based on how busy all potential candidates are, and how well suited each machine is to the type of operation that needs to be performed.

== Distributed computing ==
Distributed computing is used for increasing the potential for parallel execution on modern CPU architectures continues, the use of distributed systems is essential to achieve performance benefits from the available parallelism. High-performance cluster computing is a well-known use of distributed systems for performance improvements.

Distributed computing and clustering can negatively impact latency while simultaneously increasing load on shared resources, such as database systems. To minimize latency and avoid bottlenecks, distributed computing can benefit significantly from distributed caches.

== Self-tuning ==
A self-tuning system is capable of optimizing its own internal running parameters in order to maximize or minimize the fulfillment of an objective function; typically the maximization of efficiency or error minimization. Self-tuning systems typically exhibit non-linear adaptive control. Self-tuning systems have been a hallmark of the aerospace industry for decades, as this sort of feedback is necessary to generate optimal multi-variable control for nonlinear processes.

== Bottlenecks ==

The bottleneck is the part of a system which is at capacity. Other parts of the system will be idle waiting for it to perform its task.

In the process of finding and removing bottlenecks, it is important to prove their existence, typically by measurements, before acting to remove them. There is a strong temptation to &quot;guess&quot;. Guesses are often wrong.

<text>A boombox is a transistorized portable music player featuring one or two cassette tape players/recorders and AM/FM radio, generally with a carrying handle. Beginning in the mid-1990s, a CD player was often included. Sound is delivered through an amplifier and two or more integrated loudspeakers. A boombox is a device typically capable of receiving radio stations and playing recorded music (usually cassette tapes or CDs usually at a high volume). Many models are also capable of recording onto cassette tapes from radio and other sources. In the 1990s, some boomboxes were available with MiniDisc recorders and players. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by batteries as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the late 1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a suitcase. Some larger boomboxes even contained vertically mounted record turntables. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.

The boombox quickly became associated with urban society in the United States, particularly African American and Latino youth. The wide use of boomboxes in urban communities led to the boombox being coined a &quot;ghetto blaster&quot;. Some cities petitioned for the banning of boomboxes from public places, and over time, they became less acceptable on city streets. The boombox became closely linked to American hip hop culture and was instrumental in the rise of hip hop music.

==History==
The first boombox was developed by the inventor of the audio compact cassette, Philips of the Netherlands. Their first &#x27;Radiorecorder&#x27; was released in 1966. The Philips innovation was the first time that radio broadcasts could be recorded onto cassette tapes without the cables or microphones that previous stand-alone cassette tape recorders required. Recordings of radio were still subject to interferences from automobiles and other vehicles nearby with the same frequency, limiting their overall quality. Although the sound quality of early cassette tape recordings was poor, improvements in technology and the introduction of stereo recording, chromium tapes, and Dolby noise reduction made hifi quality devices possible. Several European electronics brands, such as Grundig, also introduced similar devices.

Boomboxes were soon also sold in Japan since 1967. The first three manufacturers were Crown, Matsushita(currently Panasonic) and AIWA, and AIWA&#x27;s TPR-101 was exported from Japan. In the 1970s, Sony, Hitachi, Tokyo Shibaura Electric (Toshiba), Japan Victor (currently JVCKenwood), Mitsubishi Electric, Sanyo Electric, and Sharp Corporation also began to sell boomboxes, and boomboxes soon became popular there due to their compact size and impressive sound quality. The Japanese brands rapidly took over a large portion of the European boombox market and were often the first Japanese consumer electronics brands that a European household might purchase. In some cases, there were even Japanese boomboxes manufactured as O.E.M. for European brands. Japanese brands innovated by creating different sizes, form factors, and technology, introducing such advances as stereo boomboxes, removable speakers, and built-in CD players.
The boombox became popular in America during the late 1970s, with most then being produced by Panasonic, Sony, General Electric, and Marantz. It was immediately noticed by the urban adolescent community and soon developed a mass market, especially in large metropolitan centers such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

The earlier models were a hybrid that combined the booming sound of large in-home stereo systems and the portability of small portable cassette players; they were typically small, black or silver, heavy, and capable of producing high volumes. The effective AM/FM tuner, standard in all early boomboxes, was the most popular feature of the early boombox up until the incorporation of input and output jacks into the boxes, which allowed for the coupling of devices such as microphones,
turntables, and CD players.

The development of audio jacks brought the boombox to the height of its popularity, and as its popularity rose, so did the level of innovation in the features included in the box. Consumers enjoyed the portability and sound quality of boomboxes, but one of the most important features, especially to the youth market, was the bass. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes.

Regardless of the increasing weight and size, the devices continued to become larger to accommodate the increased bass output; newer boombox models had heavy metal casings to handle the vibrations from the bass.

==Design==

A boombox, in its most basic form, is composed of two or more loudspeakers, an amplifier, a radio tuner, and a cassette and/or CD player component, all housed in a single plastic or metal case with a handle for portability. Most units can be powered by AC or DC cables or batteries.

As boomboxes grew in popularity, they also became more complex in design and functionality. By the mid-1980s, many boomboxes included separate high and low frequency speakers and a second tape deck to allow the boombox to record both from the radio and from other pre-recorded cassettes. Equalizers, balance adjusters, Dolby noise reduction, and LED sound gauges were other later additions.

In the mid-1980s, the boombox began to become a status symbol; the popularity among young urbanites caused increasing demand for extravagant boxes. The growing popularity of the compact disc (CD) in the late 1980s led to the introduction of the CD player in standard boombox design. During the 1990s, boombox manufacturers began designing smaller, more compact boomboxes, which were often made out of plastic instead of metal as their counterparts from the previous decade had been.

The rectangular, angular, chrome aesthetic of many 1980s models was frequently replaced with black plastic in the 1990s, and modern designs are typically characterized by a rounded, curved appearance instead of sharp angles. However, the designs of the older models are a source of much interest among boombox enthusiasts and collectors, who frequently seek the larger feature-packed models that represented the cutting edge of portable music technology in their day. Today most boomboxes have replaced the cassette player with iPod docks to access MP3 technology, and some even come equipped with integrated or removable satellite radio tuners.

Boombox designs vary greatly in size. Larger, more powerful units may require 10 or more size-D batteries, may measure more than in width, and can weigh more than . Some take a 12-volt sealed lead-acid battery, or can be a portable enclosure for a car audio head unit.

Audio quality and feature sets vary widely, with high-end models providing features and sound comparable to some home stereo systems. Most models offer volume, tone and balance (left/right) controls.

More sophisticated models may feature dual cassette decks (often featuring high-speed dubbing, or sometimes even digitally controlled servo cassette mechanics), separate bass and treble level controls, five- or ten-band graphic equalizers, Dolby noise reduction, analog or LED sound level (VU) meters or even VFD, larger speakers, &#x27;soft-touch&#x27; tape deck controls, multiple shortwave (SW) band reception with fine tuning, digital tuner with PLL (phase-locked loop), automatic song search functions for cassettes, line and/or phono inputs and outputs, microphone inputs, loudness switches, and detachable speakers, full function infrared remote control. A handful of models even featured an integrated record turntable, an 8-track tape player, a minidisc player/recorder, or a (typically black-and-white) television screen, although the basic radio/cassette models have historically been by far the most popular.

==Cultural significance==
The boombox quickly became associated with urban society, particularly black and Hispanic youth. The wide use of boomboxes in urban communities led to the boombox being coined a &quot;ghetto blaster&quot;, a nickname which was soon used as part of a backlash against the boombox and hip hop culture. The character Radio Raheem in Spike Lee&#x27;s drama film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989) personifies the connotations associated with &quot;ghetto blasters&quot; and is a prominent example of the boombox&#x27;s use by urban youth in American media. Cities began banning boomboxes from public places, and they became less acceptable on city streets as time progressed.

The boombox became intrinsically linked to hip hop culture and, as Fab Five Freddy puts it, was &quot;instrumental&quot; in the rise of hip hop. Certain models like the JVC RC-M90 and the Sharp GF-777 were known as the boombox kings, having the power to drown out other ghetto blasters; they were frequently used in music battles. The Beastie Boys embraced the boombox as a signature, The Clash always had a boombox with them, and Schoolly D carried around a Conion C-100F in the UK.

==Decline==
The 1990s were a turning point for the boombox in popular culture. The rise of the Walkman and other advanced electronics eliminated the need to carry around such large and heavy audio equipment, and boomboxes quickly disappeared from the streets. As boombox enthusiast Lyle Owerko puts it, &quot;Towards the end of any culture, you have the second or third generation that steps into the culture, which is so far from the origination, it&#x27;s the impression of what&#x27;s real, but it&#x27;s not the full definition of what&#x27;s real. It&#x27;s just cheesy.&quot; The Consumer Electronics Association reported that only 329,000 boombox units without CD players were shipped in the United States in 2003, compared to 20.4 million in 1986.

==Compressed digital audio and the future of boomboxes==

Although many boomboxes had dual cassette decks and included dubbing, line, and radio recording capabilities, the rise of recordable CDs, the decline of audio cassette technology, and the popularity of high-density MP3 players and smart phones have reduced the popularity of high-quality boomboxes to such an extent that it is difficult to find a new dual-decked stereo. Dubbing remains popular among audiophiles, bootleggers, and pirates, though most tasks are now accomplished through digital means or analog-to-digital conversion technology.
Most modern boomboxes include a CD player compatible with CD-R and CD-RW, which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium. Many also permit iPod and similar devices to be plugged into them through one or more auxiliary ports. Some also support formats such as MP3 and WMA. Some models, typically higher-end, are able to display metadata such as title, artist, album (known as &quot;ID3 tag&quot; on MP3 specifically), file name, and parent folder or file path, on the segment display itself or a separate character row.

The simplest way to connect an older boombox to an MP3 player is to use a cassette adapter, which interfaces an MP3 player&#x27;s output directly to the cassette player&#x27;s heads. The &#x27;Line In&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Aux In&#x27;) can be used if the boombox has one.

Some modern boombox designs provide other connections for MP3 (and sometimes other digital formats) such as a USB connector for use with a removable USB drive, slots for various flash memory media such as SD, MMC, SmartMedia, and Memory Stick, or even a CD drive capable of reading MP3s directly from a CD, thus allowing for a relatively cheap and large music storage to be carried and played back at full volume.

Starting in mid-2010, there are new lines of boomboxes that use Bluetooth technology known as Stereo Bluetooth, or A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile). They use the wireless Bluetooth technology to &quot;stream&quot; audio to the boombox from a compatible Bluetooth device, such as a mobile phone or Bluetooth MP3 player. An example of this is the JAMBOX, which is marketed as a &quot;Smart Speaker&quot; as it can also function as a speakerphone for voice calls in addition to being an audio playback device.

Another modern variant is a DVD player/boombox with a top-loading CD/DVD drive and an LCD video screen in the position once occupied by a cassette deck. Many models of this type of boombox include inputs for external video (such as television broadcasts) and outputs to connect the DVD player to a full-sized television.

Some newer boomboxes, may also have DAB/DAB+ radio, internet radio, or network capabilities and various apps, like TuneIn, Spotify, MusicCast, DLNA, etc. Also they have Wi-Fi, Network RJ45 connection. However, this may limit their portability, as internet access is needed to use them at full potential. Without internet service, they can operate as standard, radio (both FM, AM and DAB), USB and CD player (if available), aux input, and bluetooth (if available).

<text>Quintus Naevius Cordus Sutorius Macro (21 BC – AD 38) was a prefect of the Praetorian Guard, from 31 until 38, serving under the Roman Emperors Tiberius and Caligula. Upon falling out of favour, he killed himself.

==Biography==

Macro was born in 21 BC at Alba Fucens, a Roman town at the foot of Monte Velino, situated on a hill just to the north of the Via Valeria in Italy. Inscriptional evidence from the ruins of this town reveal that, prior to becoming Praetorian prefect, Macro had served as &quot;Praefectus vigilum&quot;, prefect of the vigiles, the Roman fire brigade and night watch. The date of this appointment and the length of his tenure are unknown.

Macro was appointed Praetorian prefect by Tiberius after the arrest of Sejanus. According to Tacitus, Macro was active in discrediting Sejanus and in directing the subsequent purge against his family and followers. As prefect, Macro wielded considerable influence. He furthered his ambitions by befriending Tiberius&#x27; grand-nephew Caligula, one of the Emperor&#x27;s prospective heirs. According to Suetonius, Macro gained further favour by turning a blind eye to his wife Ennia Thrasylla&#x27;s affair with Caligula, around the year 34.

When Tiberius died in the year 37, Macro sided with the new Emperor Caligula. According to Tacitus, Macro even played a role in bringing about Caligula&#x27;s rise to power, by ordering Tiberius to be killed after it was revealed that reports of his death had been premature: Caligula had begun to take power immediately upon hearing that Tiberius had died of natural causes but without making sure that Tiberius was dead. Tiberius was still alive and, shortly after, was heard calling for food. In order to prevent an embarrassing and potentially dangerous situation, should Tiberius have reacted angrily to Caligula&#x27;s hasty ascension to power, Macro &quot;ordered the old Emperor to be smothered under a huge heap of clothes.&quot;

Macro was confident of rapid promotion for past services but Emperor Caligula was aware of the potential threat Macro posed and soon removed him from office. According to some sources, Macro was promised the governorship of Egypt but upon arriving at Ostia with Ennia to take ship, he was instead arrested and stripped of his office. Macro committed suicide soon after. Macro was able to leave enough money to provide an amphitheatre for his home town of Alba Fucens.

== Modern depictions ==

<text>Eugène-Henri Gravelotte (6 February 1876 – 23 August 1939) was a French fencer. He was the first modern Olympic champion in foil and first French gold medalist, winning the event at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. He was born in Paris.

Gravelotte was undefeated in his group for the preliminary round, defeating Greek fencers Athanasios Vouros, Konstantinos Komninos-Miliotis, and Georgios Balakakis in succession. He then faced fellow Frenchman Henri Callot, who had gone undefeated in the other group, in the final. Gravelotte won that match 3–2.

Gravelotte died in Bénodet on 23 August 1939, aged 63.

<doc id="225811" wikidata="Q872522" url="?curid=225811" title="Halizah">
<text>Halitsah or chalitzah () in Rabbinical Judaism is the process by which a childless widow and a brother of her deceased husband may avoid the duty to marry under the biblical system of yibbum (levirate marriage)

The process involves the widow making a declaration, taking off a shoe of the brother (i.e., her brother-in-law), and spitting on the floor. Through this ceremony, the brother and any other brothers are released from the obligation of marrying the woman to conceive a child that would be considered the progeny of the deceased man. The ceremony of halitsa makes the widow free to marry whomever she desires, except for a Kohen &quot;priest&quot;. (). 

It is sufficient for only one brother-in-law to perform the ceremony. Yibbum () is thus modified in the Deuteronomic code attributed to Moses by permitting the surviving brother to refuse to marry his brother&#x27;s widow provided he submits to the ceremony of halitsa. In the Talmudic period, this tendency was intensified by the apprehension that the brother-in-law might desire to marry his brother&#x27;s widow for motives other than that of &quot;establishing a name unto his brother.&quot; Therefore, many Talmudic and later rabbis preferred halitsa to marriage. As a result, yibbum fell into disuse; now halitsa is the general rule and marriage is the rare exception. However, the yibbum law is still presumed to be in force, thus making a childless widow who remarries someone other than her brother-in-law without performing the halitsa ceremony an adulterer.

==The ceremony==
Deuteronomy describes the ceremony simply. In the presence of town elders, the widow recites a prescribed formula which scolds him for not building his brother&#x27;s household, loosens the shoe of the brother-in-law, and spits on the floor. In the Talmud, however, the rabbis explained the ceremony as a more solemn and public act. The Halizah is a very humiliating ceremony for both the parties involved. It is believed that when the ceremony is performed publicly, the humiliation and the shame that the brother and the widow feel is meant to break the bond that they hold. The ceremony must take place before a court of three, who need not be very learned, but must at least understand Hebrew. All those who are disqualified from testifying in legal matters are disqualified also from acting on this board of judges. These three appoint two others to assist them, and at the service on the evening preceding the day of the ceremony they appoint a place for its performance, to give the matter more publicity. The place chosen is usually the synagogue court or the house of the rabbi, although the ceremony may take place in the house of the widow. All investigations into the concerned parties are conducted the previous day, on which both are instructed in ceremony details, and on which the &quot;yebamah&quot; (widowed sister-in-law) is not allowed to eat. The &quot;halitzah&quot; should not be performed in the evening, nor on a Sabbath or a holiday, nor on the eve of a Sabbath or a holiday.

On the day set for the &quot;halitzah&quot;, immediately after the morning service, when all the people are still in the synagogue, the three judges and their two assistants, who also act as witnesses, meet at the appointed place. The three judges sit on one bench, the two assistants on a bench placed beside it; the &quot;yabam&quot; (brother-in-law) and the &quot;yebamah&quot; stand between them. Before the ceremony, a public examination establishes the relationship of the parties and their maturity. If one is a minor, a deaf-mute, a mute, or mentally handicapped, or has a crooked or turned foot, the &quot;halitzah&quot; cannot be performed. The court must also know whether she is left-handed or whether he is left-footed, and must be convinced that more than ninety-one days have passed since the death of her husband.

To establish these matters it is not necessary to have legally eligible witnesses. Even those who are otherwise disqualified from testifying may become witnesses. Both the &quot;yabam&quot; and the &quot;yebamah&quot; must be made aware of the fact that by this ceremony the widow becomes free to marry whomever she may desire.

==The &quot;halitzah&quot; shoe==
After these preliminary details, and after the &quot;yabam&quot; makes a public declaration that he has not been forced by outside influence to submit to the &quot;halitzah&quot;, but acts of his own free will, the ceremony commences. The shoe, which is usually the property of the community, is brought forth and examined as to cleanliness and construction, in accordance with the precepts of the law. The &quot;halitzah&quot; shoe is made entirely of leather, usually from the hide of a kosher animal.

It is made of two pieces, the upper part and the sole, sewn together with leather threads. Three small straps are attached to the front of the shoe, each of which has a knot (&quot;humrata&quot;) at the top to fit a hole made on the other side of the shoe. Two white leather straps attach to either side of the shoe and fasten it to the leg.

The &quot;yabam&quot; must have his right foot, on which the shoe is placed, washed very scrupulously, and after he has strapped it on he must walk four cubits in the presence of the judges. Then the chief judge reads the following passage, which the &quot;yebamah&quot; repeats word for word: 
: &quot;My brother-in-law refuses to raise unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not marry me.&quot;
Then the &quot;yabam&quot; repeats the sentence: 
: &quot;I do not wish to take her.&quot;
He then presses his right foot against the floor while she loosens the straps with her right hand and, holding his leg in her left hand, takes off the shoe and throws it some distance away. Then she places herself in front of the &quot;yabam&quot;, spits on the floor in front of him, and repeats these words after the presiding judge:
: &quot;So shall it be done unto that man who will not build up his brother&#x27;s house, and his name shall be called in Israel, &#x27;the house of him that hath his shoe loosed.&quot;
She repeats the last phrase three times and the assembly recites it three times after her. Then the &quot;yabam&quot; returns the shoe to the court, and the judges say:
: &quot;May it be the will [of God] that Jewish women be no more subjected to &quot;halitzah&quot; or to &quot;yibbum&quot;.&quot; 
As they rise, the chief of the judges says:
: &quot;Blessed be He who sanctified us with the commandments and statutes of Abraham our father.&quot;
All the passages recited by the &quot;yabam&quot; and by the &quot;yebamah&quot; must be read in Hebrew as they are found in the original in Deuteronomy. If the parties do not understand Hebrew the passages must be translated for them.

The ceremony of loosening the shoe has been explained in various ways. From the incident in the Book of Ruth (), which certainly refers to this ancient custom, it seems the loosening of the shoe symbolized a transfer of rights, and had no stigma attached to it. Some later rabbis—Yechiel of Paris, for instance—say the removal of the shoe symbolized the entrance into a state of mourning. From the time the &quot;yabam&quot; refused to marry his brother&#x27;s widow and thus perpetuate his name in Israel, the brother was considered dead, and the &quot;yebamah&quot;, by drawing off his shoe, thus declared to him that from that time on he was a mourner.

Another possibility comes from &quot;Wesley&#x27;s Notes&quot;: 
 Deut 25:10 His name - That is, his person, and his posterity also. So it was a lasting blot.

A similar example of renouncing rights by removing one&#x27;s shoe, in this case the renunciation of rights to redeem one&#x27;s brother&#x27;s land, appears in the Book of Ruth.

==Halitzah document==
To prevent the &quot;yabam&quot; from extorting money from the widow who wishes release from the shackles of perpetual widowhood, the Rabbis established the institution of the &quot;shetar halitzah&quot; (&quot;&quot;halitzah&quot; document&quot;). This institution provides that at a young couple&#x27;s marriage, all brothers must sign a document pledging to submit to &quot;halitzah&quot; without remuneration, in case their brother dies childless. In the case of a minor brother, who could not legally sign the document, the institution of the &quot;shetar bitchon halitzah&quot;, established by the Rabbis for such cases, had the father of the groom promise to pay money to the bride if the minor son should later refuse the &quot;halitzah&quot; ceremony. The practice of signing these &quot;halitzah&quot; documents has fallen out of currency in North America.

==Frequency==

Today Halizhah is a requirement of law in Israel. No Orthodox rabbi will perform the Yibbum , most dismiss the idea of Levirate marriage as being an outdated idea. Reform Jews on the other hand dismiss both the idea of Yibbum and Halizhah all together. Therefore, although rare, only Orthodox Jews still observe halitzah in all its details when the occasion requires. There are generally only between 10 and 20 ceremonies per year in Israel.

==In Reform Judaism==

The Reform view, as expressed in various treatises written by the leaders of the movement, and as adopted at the different rabbinical conferences held in Germany and in America, is that the ceremony of &quot;halitzah&quot; is not essential to the remarriage of the widow. The Philadelphia Conference (1869) resolved that &quot;the precept of levirate marriage and of &quot;halizah&quot; has lost to us all meaning, import, and binding force.&quot; The Second Israelite Synod, held in Augsburg (1871), passed a resolution to the same effect, adding that &quot;for the sake of liberty of conscience, however, no rabbi will refuse, on request of the parties, to conduct the ceremony of &quot;halizah&quot; in a proper form.&quot;

<doc id="225812" wikidata="Q6932817" url="?curid=225812" title="Phil Harding (archaeologist)">
<text>Philip Harding DL FSA (born 25 January 1950) is a British field archaeologist. He became a familiar face on the Channel 4 television series &quot;Time Team&quot;.

Harding trained on various excavations with the Bristol University Extra Mural Department and other bodies from 1966; he has been a professional archaeologist since 1971.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Born in Oxford on 25 January 1950 and brought up in Wexcombe, Wiltshire, Harding was educated at Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School in Marlborough. As a young boy, he became fascinated with the Stone Age. He learned flint-knapping from his uncle, Fred, and in only a few months became a skilled knapper, crafting many hunting tools from pieces of flint. He made his first archaeological finds digging up his parents&#x27; garden, much to the annoyance of his mother, Elsie. In 1966, while still at school, he attended a training excavation by Bristol University Extra Mural Department in Fyfield and West Overton. Since then, he has dug every year, though at first his archaeological activities had to be fitted into holidays and any spare time.

===Career===
After Harding left school, he worked in a puppet factory in Marlborough until he became a full-time archaeologist in 1971. He worked initially for the Southampton City Council Archaeology Unit, combining this with five seasons of excavations (1972–1976) run by the British Museum at the Neolithic flint mines of Grimes Graves, Norfolk. He has since become an acknowledged expert on flint-knapping and is skilled in lithic reduction using both percussive techniques and pressure flaking, in which, instead of striking the flint with blows, pressure is exerted on the edges to shape the tool.

From the mid-1970s, he worked on excavations in Berkshire, Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire and the Isle of Wight for the Department of the Environment (DOE). In 1979, the archaeological section of the DOE for the region became Wessex Archaeology, a non-profit organisation which is one of the biggest archaeological practices in the country. He continues to work for Wessex Archaeology.

He has been a member of the Institute of Field Archaeologists since 1985, and in 2006 was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. On 24 July 2008, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Southampton in archaeology. As a qualified SCUBA diver, he is the president of the Nautical Archaeology Society, a Portsmouth-based charity formed to further interest in nautical cultural heritage. Since 2015, Harding has been an archaeological supervisor for the veteran support charity Waterloo Uncovered, which conducts archaeology on the battlefield of Waterloo alongside veterans and serving personnel.

In 2010, the radio series A History of the World in 100 Objects featured Harding speaking on the creation of pre-historic stone tools.

====Television====
In 1991, Harding took part in the series &quot;Time Signs&quot;, which was produced by Tim Taylor, who went on to create Channel 4&#x27;s popular archaeology series &quot;Time Team&quot;. Harding was a regular on &quot;Time Team&quot; from the first series in 1994 until its cancellation in 2013. He also took part in the various spin-off series such as &quot;Time Team Extra&quot; (1998), &quot;Time Team Digs&quot; (2002) and &quot;Time Team Live&quot;.

<doc id="225813" wikidata="Q200989" url="?curid=225813" title="Old World flycatcher">
<text>The Old World flycatchers are a large family, the Muscicapidae, of small passerine birds restricted to the Old World (Europe, Africa and Asia), with the exception of several vagrants and two species, bluethroat (&quot;Luscinia svecica&quot;) and northern wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;), found also in North America. These are mainly small arboreal insectivores, many of which, as the name implies, take their prey on the wing. The family is relatively large and includes 357 species, which are divided into 54 genera.

==Taxonomy==
The name Muscicapa for the family was introduced by the Scottish naturalist John Fleming in 1822. The word had earlier been used for the genus &quot;Muscicapa&quot; by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. Muscicapa comes from the Latin &quot;&quot; meaning a fly, and &quot;&quot; to catch.

In 1910, the German ornithologist Ernst Hartert found it impossible to define boundaries between the three families Muscicapidae, Sylviidae (Old World warblers) and Turdidae (thrushes). He therefore treated them as subfamilies of an extended flycatcher family that also included Timaliidae (Old World babblers) and Monarchidae (Monarch flycatchers). Forty years later, a similar arrangement was adopted by the American ornithologists Ernst Mayr and Dean Amadon in an article published in 1951. Their large family, Muscicapidae, which they termed the &quot;primitive insect eaters&quot; contained 1460 species divided into eight subfamilies. The use of the extended group was endorsed by a committee set up following the Eleventh International Ornithological Congress held in Basel in 1954. Subsequent DNA–DNA hybridization studies by Charles Sibley and others showed that the subfamilies were not closely related to one another. As a result, the large group was broken up into a number of separate families, although for a while most authorities continued to retain the thrushes in Muscicapidae. In 1998 the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union chose to treat the thrushes as a separate family in the seventh edition of their &quot;Check-list of North American birds&quot; and subsequently most authors have followed their example.

===Genera===
The family formerly included fewer species. At the time of the publication of the third edition of Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World in 2003, the genera &quot;Myophonus&quot;, &quot;Alethe&quot;, &quot;Brachypteryx&quot; and &quot;Monticola&quot; were included in the thrush family Turdidae. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species in these four genera are more closely related to species in Muscicapidae. As a consequence, these four genera are now placed here. In contrast, the genus &quot;Cochoa&quot; which was previously placed in Muscicapidae has been shown to belong in Turdidae.

Two large molecular phylogenetic studies of species within Muscicapidae published in 2010 showed that the genera &quot;Fraseria&quot;, &quot;Melaenornis&quot; and &quot;Muscicapa&quot; were non-monophyletic. The authors were unable to propose revised genera as not all the species were sampled and not all the nodes in their phylogenies were strongly supported. A subsequent study published in 2016, that included 37 of the 42 Muscicapini species, confirmed that the genera were non-monophyletic and proposed a reorganised arrangement of the species with several new or resurrected genera.


The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union recognises 357 species and divides the family into 54 genera. Subdivisions have been proposed by Sangster &quot;et al&quot; (2010). For a complete list of species, see &quot;List of Old World flycatcher species&quot;.

The cladogram below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the family by Min Zhao and collaborators that was published in 2023. Some regions of the phylogenetic tree were not strongly supported by the sequence data. Both the genera included and the number of species in each genera are taken from the list of birds maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

==Description==
The appearance of these birds is very varied, but they mostly have weak songs and harsh calls. They are small to medium birds, ranging from 9 to 22 cm in length. Many species are dull brown in colour, but the plumage of some can be much brighter, especially in the males. Most have broad, flattened bills suited to catching insects in flight, although the few ground-foraging species typically have finer bills.

Old World flycatchers live in almost every environment with a suitable supply of trees, from dense forest to open scrub, and even the montane woodland of the Himalayas. The more northerly species migrate south in winter, ensuring a continuous diet of insects.

Depending on the species, their nests are either well-constructed cups placed in a tree or cliff ledge, or simply lining in a pre-existing tree hole. The hole-nesting species tend to lay larger clutches, with an average of eight eggs, rather than just two to five.

<text>The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day is an English-language encyclopedia containing over 15,000 articles on the history, culture, and state of Judaism up to the early 20th century. The encyclopedia&#x27;s managing editor was Isidore Singer and the editorial board was chaired by Isaac K. Funk and Frank H. Vizetelly.

The work&#x27;s scholarship is still highly regarded. The American Jewish Archives deemed it &quot;the most monumental Jewish scientific work of modern times&quot;, and Rabbi Joshua L. Segal said &quot;for events prior to 1900, it is considered to offer a level of scholarship superior to either of the more recent Jewish encyclopedias written in English.&quot;

It was originally published in 12 volumes between 1901 and 1906 by Funk &amp; Wagnalls of New York, and reprinted in the 1960s by KTAV Publishing House. It is now in the public domain.

==History==
===Conception===

Singer conceived of a Jewish encyclopedia in Europe and proposed creating an &quot;Allgemeine Encyklopädia für Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums&quot; in 1891. He envisioned 12 volumes, published over 10 to 15 years, at a cost of 50 dollars as a set. They would contain scientific and unbiased articles on ancient and modern Jewish culture. This proposal received good press coverage and interest from the Brockhaus publishing company. After the House of Rothschild in Paris, consulted by Zadoc Kahn, offered to back the project with only eight percent of the minimum funds requested by Brockaus, the project was abandoned. Following the Dreyfus affair and associated unpleasantness, Singer emigrated to New York City.

Initially believing that American Jews could do little more than provide funding for his project, Singer was impressed by the level of scholarship in the United States. He wrote a new prospectus, changing the title of his planned encyclopedia to &quot;Encyclopedia of the History and Mental Evolution of the Jewish Race&quot;. His radical ecumenism and opposition to orthodoxy upset many of his Jewish readers; nevertheless he attracted the interest of publisher Isaac K. Funk, a Lutheran minister who also believed in integrating Judaism and Christianity. Funk agreed to publish the encyclopedia on the condition that it remain unbiased on issues which might seem unfavorable for Jews. Singer accepted and was established in an office at Funk &amp; Wagnalls on .

Publication of the prospectus in 1898 created a severe backlash, including accusations of poor scholarship and of subservience to Christians. Kaufmann Kohler and Gotthard Deutsch, writing in &quot;American Hebrew&quot;, highlighted Singer&#x27;s factual errors, and accused him of commercialism and irreligiosity. Now considering that the project could not succeed with Singer at the helm, Funk &amp; Wagnalls appointed an editorial board to oversee creation of the encyclopedia.

===Editorial board===
Funk &amp; Wagnalls assembled an editorial board between October 1898 and March 1899. Singer toned down his ideological rhetoric, indicated his desire to collaborate, and changed the work&#x27;s proposed title to &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;. Despite their reservations about Singer, rabbi Gustav Gottheil and Cyrus Adler agreed to join the board, followed by Morris Jastrow, Frederick de Sola Mendes, and two published critics of the project: Kauffmann Kohler and Gotthard Deutsch

Theologian and Presbyterian minister George Foot Moore was added to the board for balance. Soon after work started, Moore withdrew and was replaced by Baptist minister Crawford Toy. Last was added the elderly Marcus Jastrow, mostly for his symbolic imprimatur as America&#x27;s leading Talmudist. In March 1899, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which had been contemplating a competing project, agreed to discuss collaborating with Funk &amp; Wagnalls—thus securing the position of the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; as the only major project of its kind. Shuly Rubin Schwartz describes the payment scheme arranged at this time as follows:

Other editors participating in all 12 volumes were Gotthard Deutsch, Richard Gottheil, Joseph Jacobs, Kaufmann Kohler, Herman Rosenthal, and Crawford Howell Toy. Morris Jastrow, Jr. and Frederick de Sola Mendes assisted with volumes I to II; Marcus Jastrow with volumes I, II, and III; Louis Ginzberg with the first four volumes; Solomon Schechter with volumes IV through VII; Emil G. Hirsch with volumes IV through XII; and Wilhelm Bacher with volumes VIII through XII. William Popper served as assistant revision editor and chief of translation for volumes IV through XII.

The editors plunged into their enormous task and soon identified and solved some inefficiencies with the project. Article assignments were shuffled around and communication practices were streamlined. Joseph Jacobs was hired as a coordinator. He also wrote four hundred articles and procured many of the encyclopedia&#x27;s illustrations. Herman Rosenthal, an authority on Russia, was added as an editor. Louis Ginzberg joined the project and later became head of the rabbinical literature department.

The board naturally faced many difficult editorial questions and disagreements. Singer wanted specific entries for every Jewish community in the world, with detailed information about, for example, the name and dates of the first Jewish settler in Prague. Conflict also arose over what types of Bible interpretation should be included, as some editors feared that Morris Jastrow&#x27;s involvement in &quot;higher criticism&quot; would lead to unfavorable treatment of scripture.

==Scholarship==

The scholarly style of &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; aligns directly to the , an approach to Jewish scholarship and religion that flourished in 19th-century Germany. The encyclopedia may be regarded as the culmination of this movement, which sought to modernize scholarly methods in Jewish research. In the 20th century, the movement&#x27;s members dispersed to Jewish Studies departments in the United States and Israel.

The scholarly authorities cited in the encyclopedia—besides the classical and medieval exegetes—are almost uniformly figures, such as Leopold Zunz, Moritz Steinschneider, Solomon Schechter, Wilhelm Bacher, Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport, David Zvi Hoffmann, and Heinrich Graetz. Its scholarly style is evident by the encyclopedia&#x27;s almost obsessive attention to manuscript discovery, editing, publication, comparison, and dating. These endeavors were among the foremost interests of &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; scholarship.

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; is an English-language work, but the vast majority of the encyclopedia&#x27;s contemporary sources are German-language sources, since this was the mother tongue of the scholars and the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Biblical scholarship in general in that period. Of all works cited not in German—usually the more classical works—the largest part are either in Hebrew or Arabic. The only heavily cited English-language source of contemporary scholarship is Schechter&#x27;s publications in &quot;The Jewish Quarterly Review&quot;.

The significance of the work&#x27;s publication in English rather than German or Hebrew is captured by Harry Wolfson, writing in 1926:
The editors and authors of &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; proved prescient in their choice of language, since within that same span of 25 years, English rose to become the dominant language of academic Jewish scholarship and among Jews worldwide. Wolfson continues that &quot;if a &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; in a modern language were planned for the first time, the choice would undoubtedly have fallen upon English.&quot;

==Editions==
The unedited text of the original can be found at &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; website. The site offers both JPEG facsimiles of the original articles and Unicode transcriptions of all texts.

The search capability is somewhat handicapped by the fact that the search mechanism fails to take into account the decision to maintain all diacritical marks in the transliterated Hebrew and Aramaic from the 1901–1906 text, which used a large number of diacriticals not in common use today. Thus, for example, to successfully search for &quot;Halizah&quot;—the ceremony by which the widow of a brother who has died childless released her brother-in-law from the obligation of marrying her—one would have to know that they have transliterated this as &quot;Ḥaliẓah&quot;. The alphabetic index ignores diacriticals so it can be more useful when searching for an article whose title is known.

The scholarly apparatus of citation is thorough, but can be a bit daunting to contemporary users. Books that might have been widely known among scholars of Judaism at the time the encyclopedia was written (but which are quite obscure to a lay reader today) are referred to by author and title, but with no publication information and often without indication of the language in which they were written.

&quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; was heavily used as a source by the 16-volume &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; in Russian, published by Brockhaus and Efron in Saint Petersburg between 1906 and 1913.

<text>The Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (formerly Cancopy), operating as Access Copyright is a Canadian not-for-profit copyright collective. It collects revenues from licensed Canadian businesses, government, schools, libraries, and other copyright users for the photocopying of print works and distributes those monies to the rightsholders, such as publishers and authors from Canada and around the world.

Access Copyright covers works published in Australia, Argentina, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States.

==University model licence==

When universities sign on to a licence with Access Copyright (negotiated by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) or the Association of Canadian Community Colleges), their professors and students are given permission to do certain copying of copyrighted works. The university is generally charged a base rate per full-time student for this licence, usually passed down to students in the form of mandatory fees.
&quot;2011 AUCC model licence&quot;
A new model, negotiated by AUCC in 2011, would see universities pay a rate of $26 per full-time student. The old agreement, which expired in 2010, charged only $3.38 plus an additional 10 cents per page coursepacks, photocopied compilations of readings designed by instructors and sold to students. Moreover, additional stipulations would proscribe faculty and students from keeping copies of journal articles in personal libraries, or on personal computers or email accounts.

These changes have proved controversial, and numerous universities have opted out of the deal.

&quot;Universities that have opted out:&quot;

*Athabasca University
*Brock University
*Carleton University
*MacEwan University
*McMaster University
*Memorial University
*Mount Allison University
*Mount Royal University
*Queen&#x27;s University
*Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson Univ.)
*University of Alberta
*University of British Columbia
*University of Calgary
*University of New Brunswick
*University of Ottawa
*University of Saskatchewan
*University of Toronto
*University of Victoria
*University of Manitoba
*University of Northern British Columbia
*University of Waterloo
*University of Western Ontario
*University of Windsor
*University of Winnipeg
*York University
&quot;Universities that have signed on:&quot;

==Controversy==

In 2012, Access Copyright started charging universities for e-mailing links to copyrighted information, even in cases where there was no copyrighted material present. They charge a full price for each link e-mailed.

In late 2019, Access Copyright obtained a court order requiring 300 schools across Canada to supply handouts and lesson plans from the last seven years. The demand, intended to find use of copyright material, was described as a &quot;logistical nightmare.&quot;

<text>The United States Playing Card Company (USPC, though also commonly known as USPCC) is a large American producer and distributor of playing cards. It was established in 1867 as Russell, Morgan &amp; Co. and founded in Cincinnati, Ohio in its current incarnation in 1885. Its many brands include Bicycle, Bee, Tally-Ho, Champion, Congress, Aviator, Aristocrat, Mohawk, Maverick, KEM, Hoyle and Fournier. It also produces novelty and custom playing cards, and other playing card accessories such as poker chips. For decades the company was based in Norwood, Ohio, but as of 2009, the USPC is currently headquartered in the Cincinnati suburb of Erlanger, Kentucky.

In December 2019, the United States Playing Card Company became a subsidiary of Belgian card manufacturer Cartamundi.

==History==
The company was founded in Cincinnati in 1867 as Russell, Morgan &amp; Co. and originally specialized in printing posters for traveling circuses. The company took its name from partners A. O. Russell and Robert J. Morgan, who together with James M. Armstrong and John F. Robinson Jr. purchased the Enquirer Job Printing Rooms division of the newspaper &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. Among their printed lithographs were advertisements for performances of Edward Owings Towne&#x27;s &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot;.
===Playing cards===
The company began printing four brands of playing cards in 1881: Tigers ( 101), Sportsman&#x27;s ( 202), Army and Navy (both  303, and also offered in a deluxe version with gold edges as  505), and Congress ( 404 and with gold edges as  606).

Their fifth brand, introduced in 1883, was the bargain-priced Steamboat ( 999) which competed with other cheap steamboat-themed decks offered by other companies. In 1885, they began printing Bicycle cards ( 808), which would become their most popular line and their only early brand that is still in regular use today. A 32-card Euchre deck called Cabinet ( 707) was introduced in 1888, but would be changed to a regular 52-card deck as the popularity of Euchre waned.

Russell &amp; Morgan then set out to fill their catalog with brands at price-points that sat between their existing lines. These early brands included Tourists ( 155) which were marketed as between Tigers and Sportsman&#x27;s in quality, Capitol ( 188) which sat between Sportsman&#x27;s and Bicycle, the casino-oriented Squared Faro ( 366), unenameled cards called Texan ( 45), double-enameled Treasury ( 89), and the top-of-the-line Ivory ( 93). A series of Skat decks were also briefly offered to appeal to German immigrants, featuring either German or American faces.

Business boomed and in 1891 Russell, Morgan, &amp; Co. changed its name to the United States Printing Company. The playing card business was successful enough that it was spun off as a separate business in 1894, as The United States Playing Card Company. Morgan recruited a talented young inventor from New York named Samuel J. Murray, whose patented inventions increased the output of cards at the company&#x27;s Norwood, Ohio plant fourfold and cut labor costs by 66 percent. Murray also created a two-sided enameling machine.
The USPCC has historically supported wartime soldiers, starting with the inexpensive Canteen brand of cards during the Spanish–American War and the Pickett brand during World War I. During World War II, USPCC manufactured spotter cards so soldiers could identify enemy units and cooperated with the U.S. Government in creating clandestine decks given to POWs; these cards could be moistened and peeled apart to reveal escape maps.

In May 2011, Marc Hill was named president of The United States Playing Cards Company. In October 2011, the United States Playing Card Company in a partnership with Encore Software announced that they are launching the 2012 Hoyle product line - Hoyle Card Games 2012, Hoyle Casino Games 2012 and Hoyle Puzzle &amp; Board Games 2012.

===Acquisitions===
Though the years, USPCC has acquired many smaller playing card manufacturers, beginning in 1894 when it absorbed the Standard Playing Card Company of Chicago, the Perfection Playing Card Company of Philadelphia, and the New York Consolidated Card Company. The latter was the maker of the Bee brand and innovators of the &quot;squeezer&quot; card indices in the corners, which became a standard element of playing cards worldwide.

Acquisitions continued in 1907 with the purchase of Andrew Dougherty, adding the Tally-Ho brand, and in 1929 with Russell Playing Card Company, adding the Aristocrat brand. In 1930, New York Consolidated, Andrew Dougherty, and Standard Playing Card Company were merged into a single subsidiary called Consolidated-Dougherty which continued to produce brands from all three predecessors, including Aristocrat, Bee, and Tally-Ho.

Further acquisitions came towards the latter 20th and early 21st century, including an international expansion with the purchase of longtime Spanish card maker Naipes Heraclio Fournier in 1986, Arrco Playing Card Company in 1987, Hoyle Products in 2001, and KEM Playing Cards in 2004.

The USPCC would itself be acquired several times during its history, starting with Diamond International in 1969, Jessup &amp; Lamont in 1982, and Frontenac in 1989. After a brief return to self-ownership from 1994 to 2004, it would be acquired by Jarden which was in turn purchased by Newell Brands. In June 2019, Newell sold USPCC to Belgian card manufacturer Cartamundi, including its two plants in the United States and Spain.

==Production==

The USPCC currently produces cards in Erlanger, Kentucky and at its Fournier factory in Vitoria, Spain. In 2009, the USPCC closed down its long-time factory in Norwood, Ohio and relocated across the Ohio River to Erlanger.

Playing cards produced between 2009 and 2012 at the Erlanger factory had various quality control issues including mis-centering of art and card handling quality. For example, several playing cards produced in 2010 were &quot;sticky&quot;, meaning they did not separate, fan, and perform well. This created a demand for Norwood produced playing cards on the market. Playing cards produced in Norwood typically featured a blue seal, while cards in Kentucky typically feature a black seal, and to this day Norwood produced cards are still sought after by magicians, cardists, professional gamblers, and collectors.

==Primary product lines==

The company offers several brands of playing cards, including:

===Aristocrat===
The Aristocrat brand was created in 1915 by the Russell Playing Card Company of New York, which was acquired by the USPC in 1929. It was best known for its higher quality of card stock and varied but always intricate scroll work, in particular the &quot;bank note&quot; back, which resembled the design of United States currency notes at the time it was introduced, as Russell had acquired the playing card business of the American Bank Note Company in 1914. While the cards sold to the public carried the unique scroll-work, Aristocrat also produced the &quot;Club Special&quot; line of Aristocrat cards specifically for casinos. These were similar to Bee cards in that their backs were borderless with a diamond pattern and could optionally have casino logos added to the backs. Aristocrat was discontinued as a retail brand in the mid-1980s, but continued to be sold directly to casinos.

===Aviator===
Introduced in 1927 in commemoration of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s trans-Atlantic flight in the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, Aviator playing cards (stock  914) feature a bordered, monochrome back design of predominantly circles. Aviator cards are less expensive compared to Bee and Bicycle as the card stock is thinner and has a smooth finish, unlike the textured &quot;air-cushion&quot; finish used in many of the company&#x27;s premium brands. Until the late 1980s, the Aviator Ace of Spades and Joker carried no specific branding. Aviator cards were often used as a generic brand for limited-run, giveaway or promotional/advertising decks. They also were used to fill boxes of cards primarily sold for export or for military or institutional use. Budget brands such as Caravan, Torpedo, Mohawk, Battle Axe, Uncle Sam, and Tuxedo were generally filled with Aviator cards, and a few of these brands are still sold in other countries.

===Bee===

Bee is a casino card brand also sold at retail. Bee playing cards were first manufactured by the New York Consolidated Card Company in 1892, hence the number &quot;92&quot; on the Ace of Spades; the USPC acquired the company two years later, but it continued to operate independently, even after merging with Andrew Dougherty and Standard Playing Card Company to form Consolidated-Dougherty. Standard Bee playing cards have a diamond back, typically blue or red although casinos frequently use customized Bee cards featuring a logo added to the various colored backs. Until 2010, Bee cards were also sometimes printed in a smooth finish, with a back known as &quot;No. 35&quot;, which features worm-like squiggle patterns. Unlike Bicycle cards, Bee cards usually have borderless backs, making the facing of any card that is even partially revealed clearly visible. However, the standard diamond back of the card is very regular and low-profile compared to other back designs, which simplifies &quot;bottom dealing&quot; and some other forms of sleight-of-hand.

===Bicycle===
Bicycle Playing Cards (stock  808) are the USPC&#x27;s flagship brand of cards, introduced in 1885.

The typical Bicycle deck is a standard deck of cards consisting of 52 traditional French-suited playing cards, two jokers and two advertising cards. The Bicycle trademark is printed on the ace of spades. The type number of a Bicycle deck can be found both on the bottom of the deck box and on the stone of the joker artwork. Bicycle cards have a textured &#x27;air cushion&#x27; finish for improved handling.

Bicycle cards are sold in poker and bridge widths, with additional deck configurations for use in other games such as pinochle, rummy, euchre, and canasta. Back designs include the standard &#x27;Rider&#x27; back, similar &#x27;League&#x27; back and &#x27;Maiden&#x27; back, the &#x27;Vintage&#x27; back modeled on the original card design, and many specialty designs. Back colors include traditional red and blue, along with black, silver, and pastel colors. Face designs include standard, jumbo index, low-vision cards for the visually impaired, and a &#x27;PokerPeek&#x27; design on their pro-series decks that simplifies looking at hole cards. Novelty &#x27;Big Bicycle&#x27; cards that are four times the normal bridge card size, and mini-sized cards are also available.

Bicycle playing cards are commonly used by magicians in card magic and flourishes due to their ordinary appearance. The USPCC has released look-alike card designs under stock number 809 called Mandolin-backs and Maiden-backs for use in producing marked decks. In addition to specialty decks specifically designed for magic, cardistry or purely aesthetic reasons, USPC also make other kinds of non-standard card decks, such as a gaff deck (contained in a mirrored-art box) with an assortment of unusually altered cards that can be used with regular cards for tricks.

Starting in 2019, Bicycle started a &quot;Games by Bicycle&quot; division to enter into the hobby board game market, with party games and light strategic games using playing-card sized cards. These include Tattoo Stories, It&#x27;s Blunderful, and Shuffle Grand Prix.

Subject to certain guidelines, the Bicycle brand can be licensed from USPC.

===Hoyle===

The Hoyle brand was originally produced by the Brown &amp; Bigelow Company in 1927, and was the main competitor to USPC&#x27;s Bicycle brand for over 70 years. The cards proved such a success that Brown &amp; Bigelow&#x27;s card division was renamed Hoyle Products in 1975. Hoyle&#x27;s shell back design is well-recognized, but Hoyle&#x27;s most iconic figure is its Joker: a colorful jester whose face (repeated atop his scepter) is an optical illusion. The USPC purchased Hoyle Products from Brown &amp; Bigelow in 2001, and unlike most of its other playing card company acquisitions, has kept a few of the popular Hoyle brands in print. Since production was taken over by the USPCC, Hoyle playing cards are also produced in an all-plastic version.

===KEM===

KEM cards were first manufactured in 1935. Unlike most playing cards which are made from plastic-coated paper, KEM cards are made entirely from cellulose acetate and are waterproof. USPC purchased KEM Cards in 2004. After a two-year hiatus, USPC resumed KEM card production, which continues today. KEM cards are available to the consumer (usually at specialty game shops) with various back colors and designs in both poker and bridge sizes. In 2007, KEM bridge cards (using Bicycle artwork) were adopted as the official cards of the World Series of Poker.

===Maverick===
Maverick was Hoyle&#x27;s budget brand when it was acquired by USPC with the rest of Hoyle Products in 2001. It was introduced in 1959, during the run of the popular &quot;Maverick&quot; TV series. Unlike most USPC current product lines, Maverick is now being printed by outsourced manufacturers.

===Streamline===
Streamline is a low-end brand, similar to Maverick, with a bordered monochrome back and a smooth plastic-coated finish. Streamline came to the USPCC from the Arrco Playing Card Company, longtime manufacturers of a large variety of low-end and budget-priced cards, which the USPC acquired in 1987. Like Maverick, Streamline cards are produced by outsourced manufacturers.

===Tally-Ho===
Tally Ho was originally a product of Andrew Dougherty, one of the earliest American card manufacturers, introduced in 1885, the same year Bicycle was introduced. Dougherty&#x27;s company was acquired by the USPC in 1907, bringing Tally-Ho into its assortment. Dougherty would then be merged with New York Consolidated Card Company and Standard Playing Card Company to form Consolidated-Doughterty. Tally-Ho cards come in two back designs, known as the &quot;fan&quot; back and the &quot;circle&quot; back, typically in traditional red and blue. Due to the unique finish, known as &quot;linoid&quot;, and the distinct designs, they are popular for card flourishes.

==International product lines==
In addition to exporting cards produced within the United States, the USPCC produces some brands specifically for international markets.

===500===

The 500 (or Five Hundred) brand was originally created by the National Playing Card Company as a &quot;6 handed&quot; 60-card rummy deck which includes 11-spot and 12-spot cards, as well as one joker. Eventually 500 decks also included 2 13-spot playing cards for the hearts and diamond suits, bringing up the total number of playing cards to 62 (excluding the joker). When introduced, 500 brand playing cards came in Ivory or Air-Cushion finish and were available in four back designs - Bid, Full-House, Griffin, and Swastika (which was discontinued likely due to association with the Nazi Party). Originally it was stored in an ornate hard tuck case with gold lettering. Around the 1970s the fancier tuck cases were phased out. Sometime during the 1990s the unique box art was changed to a plainer design that says &quot;500 Playing Card Game&quot;. It is currently produced and sold mainly for export to Australia.

===Aladdin===
The Aladdin brand was first produced by the National Card Company of Indianapolis in the 1880s. The stock number is &quot;1001,&quot; although there is also a &quot;1002&quot; version, which is identical except that the 1002 features gilded edges. There is also a &quot;1004&quot; variant, which had no indices in the corners. At least four different back designs were produced, but it is unknown how many were produced, or for how long. Aladdins were retained and marketed by USPCC after USPCC acquired NCC. They are produced by USPCC today primarily for export. The cards are said to be designed to withstand the constant humidity and heat of Singapore. They are produced with a &quot;smooth finish&quot; and an &quot;air-cushion&quot; finish.

===Fournier===

Naipes Heraclio Fournier S.A. manufactures many different sets of playing cards, most for sale in Europe. Fournier cards are also common choices for casinos around the world. In addition to their signature  1 Spanish playing cards, they also produce poker cards (the  18 line), tarot cards, and specialty cards. Since their acquisition by USPC, Fournier has also made use of the Bicycle brand name to distribute special-edition decks featuring unique artwork. They have also taken advantage of USPC&#x27;s acquisition of KEM&#x27;s plastic card technology to sell all-plastic versions of their cards ( 2100 is the all-plastic version of their  1).

==Limited or discontinued brands==

=== Arrco ===
The Arrco Playing Card Company of Chicago began operations in 1927 under the name Arrow Playing Card Company. Arrow&#x27;s founder, Theodore Regensteiner, helped popularized the Arrco brand by implementing a new easy-to-handle plastic coating for his decks. While Arrco sustained sales of a variety of budget and lower quality playing cards throughout the later half of the 20th century, the Regensteiner family sold Arrco to USPC in 1987. The USPC discontinued the Arrco brand in 2011.

===Army &amp; Navy===
One of the first five brands of cards introduced by the company in 1881, when it was still known as Russell, Morgan, and Co., &quot;Army&quot; and &quot;Navy&quot; were originally two separate brands although they shared the same two stock numbers: their standard  303 and the deluxe  505 which had gold edges. The two brands were then merged into the single &quot;Army &amp; Navy&quot; brand in 1884. True to the name, the Joker and Ace of Spades of these brands tended to feature American military imagery, which changed over the years of its production.

===Canteen &amp; Picket===
Stock  515, &quot;Canteen&quot; was issued during the Spanish–American War in 1898. They were of a low quality so as to be inexpensive and easily bought by the soldiers. It was discontinued shortly after the war. In World War I, the stock number was reused for &quot;Picket&quot;, another inexpensive brand which was again printed for sale to soldiers. Printing of &quot;Picket&quot; ceased after the Armistice.

===Congress===
Congress was the most expensive of the first four brands introduced by the company in 1881, when it was still known as Russell, Morgan, and Co. Congress was printed under two stocks: their standard  404 and the deluxe  606 which had gold edges.

In modern use, the Congress brand is used for contract bridge and canasta cards and accessories. Congress cards are available in a wide assortment of pictorial back designs, and are typically housed in a velour covered box with a pull-out tray. Each Congress deck consists of the 52 standard cards, two jokers (which feature an image of the United States Capitol), and an information card describing bridge scoring. Although single decks are available, Congress cards are more frequently sold in coordinated sets of two decks to facilitate the common bridge practice of alternating decks between hands. Early Congress cards came in three variations: Poker size (1881–1922), Whist size (early 1900s to 1922), and bridge size 1922-on). From 1881 to around 1900, decks featured Lord Dundreary as the joker and the backs were solid color borders with gold (and sometimes copper) colored ink, called “lacquer backs”. In 1899, pictorial backs became the norm. Between 1897 and 1904, the jokers were a black and white image of the back design.

===Rambler===
Rambler playing cards (Stock  23,) are another brand of playing cards that were originally produced by National Card Company. They feature gilded edges and a waterproof smooth aluminum oxide finish. They are primarily produced for export along with Aladdin playing cards, for usage in humid regions of Asia. Original production halted in 2009 with the closure of the Norwood factory due to quality control issues at the Kentucky plant and resumed sporadically after 2011.

===Sportsman&#x27;s===
One of the first four brand of cards introduced by the company in 1881, when it was still known as Russell, Morgan, and Co., &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s&quot; (stock  202) was the highest-end brand of playing cards originally produced, featuring hunting and fishing themes. The card backs featured game animals, whilst the ace of spades and jokers featured hunters, guns and hunting dogs. Production of these cards continued until 1936.

===Steamboat 999===
The fifth brand of cards introduced by the USPC (stock  999, introduced in 1883), this brand was introduced to meet a growing demand for inexpensive playing cards (at the time of their introduction, &quot;Steamboat&quot; cards were available for as little as 5¢ a pack). Until the 1990s when the cards had a cardstock change, &quot;Steamboat&quot; was the company&#x27;s least expensive line of playing cards. The cards had a price increase as the original 999 stock was replaced with Aviator and Bicycle 808 stock. Steamboat cards were offered with an Air Cushion finish until 2009 when the United States Playing Card Company moved to Erlanger.

===Stud===
Stud was an exclusive house brand of the Walgreens drug store chain. They were originally produced by the Arrco company, and used the primary Arrco casino export card stock, Stock 21. When acquired by the USPCC in 1986, Stud playing cards stopped being printed on Arrco stock and were printed on the linen finish Aristocrat stock. They feature a &quot;stud&quot; horse on the tuck case, ace of spades, and jokers, as well as windmills on the card backs. The playing cards feature the Arrco styled court cards. Stud playing cards of all ages are widely sought after by cardistry enthusiasts and magicians due to their excellent handling. The Stud name was discontinued briefly and replaced by &quot;Play Right&quot;, but the name change was not popular. Even less popular was the unusual indexing (Red decks were standard size, and blue decks were jumbo size). In 2019, Walgreens stopped ordering Stud playing cards in favor of Theory11 designed cards.

===Squeezers===
 Squeezer brand cards were originally printed by the New York Consolidated Card Company. The New York Consolidated Card Company, Andrew Dougherty and Standard Playing Card Company were all eventually bought out and merged to form the Consolidated-Doughterty branch of the USPCC. Squeezer playing cards are printed with the Cambric Finish of Bee playing cards. Squeezer playing cards traditionally came in several back designs, but only the two most popular (the famous Bulldog and Angel Back) are still printed. Unlike most other USPCC cards, these cards are only printed occasionally.

===Texan No. &#x27;45===

The Texan No. &#x27;45, originally printed as the &#x27;45 Texan, was in print for over 120 years. These playing cards, unlike most, were borderless, and featured a scene of Texas palmetto leaves, with a star in the center. The cards also were unique, as they were slightly asymmetrical. Whilst originally printed in the United States, the Texan No. &#x27;45, in later years, was a Canadian-exclusive brand of playing cards. Unlike some other brands, the Texan brand was still printed after the move to Erlanger. After being in print for over 120 years, the production ceased.

===Tigers===
Stock  101, &quot;Tigers&quot; was the first brand published in 1881 and the cheapest of the earliest four brands. Its name comes from the tiger that appeared on the joker. After the introduction of the &quot;Steamboat&quot; line, the importance of &quot;Tigers&quot; was diminished. It was discontinued around 1930.

<doc id="225823" wikidata="Q266075" url="?curid=225823" title="Ed Greenwood">
<text>Ed Greenwood (born July 21, 1959) is a Canadian fantasy writer and the creator of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; game world. He began writing articles about the Forgotten Realms for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine beginning in 1979, and subsequently sold the rights to the setting to TSR, the creators of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game, in 1986. He has written many Forgotten Realms novels, as well as numerous articles and &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game supplement books.

==Early life and the Forgotten Realms==
Greenwood grew up in the upscale Toronto suburb of Don Mills. He began writing stories about the Forgotten Realms as a child, starting in the mid-1960s; they were his &quot;dream space for swords and sorcery stories&quot;. Greenwood conceived of the Forgotten Realms as one world in a &quot;multiverse&quot; of parallel worlds which includes the Earth. He imagined such worlds as being the source of humanity&#x27;s myths and legends.

Greenwood discovered the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game in 1975 and soon became a regular player. He used the Realms as a setting for his campaigns, which centred on the fictional locales of Waterdeep and Shadowdale, locations that would figure prominently in his later writing. According to Greenwood, his players&#x27; thirst for detail pushed him to further develop the Forgotten Realms setting: &quot;They want[ed] it to seem real, and work on &#x27;honest jobs&#x27; and personal activities, until the whole thing [grew] into far more than a casual campaign.&quot;

Beginning with the periodical&#x27;s 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood published a series of articles set in the Realms in &quot;The Dragon&quot; magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as The Curst. Greenwood&#x27;s articles in &quot;The Dragon&quot; often featured the wizard Elminster describing magic items, monsters, and spells.

==Partnership with TSR==
In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, and assigned Jeff Grubb to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood in his articles for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him &quot;Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?&quot;; he answered &quot;yes&quot; to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition.

Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began to prepare his Forgotten Realms material for official publication. He sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all his rights to the Realms to TSR for a token fee—just $5,000 and a promise to publish Greenwood&#x27;s novels. The following year, Greenwood and coauthor Jeff Grubb wrote and published the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Set&quot; (1987).

The campaign setting was a major success, and Greenwood continued to be involved with the evolution of the Forgotten Realms over the next decades. He went on to write numerous Forgotten Realms novels. Many of these center around the wizard Elminster, whom Greenwood has frequently portrayed at conventions and gaming events.

When TSR was in dire financial difficulties in 1996–1997, Greenwood offered to write some material for them for free to help get them back on their feet. Nothing came of the offer, but after Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR in 1997 and stabilized its finances, CEO Peter Adkison personally called Greenwood at the library he was working at to encourage him to continue writing Realms material. Greenwood responded he was happy to continue writing for the Realms for as long as he could.

Greenwood feels his work on the Realms that he likes best are &quot;those products that impart some of the richness and color of the Realms, such as the novel I wrote with Jeff Grubb, &quot;Cormyr&quot;; the &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guides&quot;; &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;; &quot;The Code of the Harpers&quot;; &quot;City of Splendors&quot;; and stuff that lots of gamers have found useful, such as &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot; and &quot;Ruins of Undermountain&quot;.&quot;

Greenwood has also been contributing editor and creative editor of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine.

==Personal life and other activities==
Greenwood has published over two hundred articles in &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; and &quot;Polyhedron Newszine&quot;, is a lifetime charter member of the Role Playing Game Association (RPGA) network, and has been a Gen Con Game Fair guest of honor many times. Greenwood has written over thirty-five novels for &quot;TSR&quot;, and written, co-written, or contributed to over two hundred books and game products from other publishers. Greenwood has also contributed to &quot;The Book of All Flesh&quot; (2001), an anthology based on &quot;All Flesh Must Be Eaten&quot;, and written short stories based on the &quot;Silver Age Sentinels&quot; role-playing game. Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;Castlemourn&quot; fantasy setting was published by Margaret Weis Productions. He is co-creator (with fantasy novelist Lynn Abbey) of the Mornmist fantasy setting.

He has also contributed to most Forgotten Realms gaming accessories, and authored many more—including the detailed &quot;Volo&#x27;s Guide&quot; series—and continues to DM his own campaign. He writes regular Realmslore columns for the &quot;Wizards of the Coast&quot; website.

In addition to all these activities, Greenwood works as a library clerk (and sometimes as a librarian) and has edited over a dozen small press magazines. When not appearing at conventions, he lives in an old farmhouse in the countryside of Ontario.

As of 1998, Greenwood lived in applegrowing country on Lake Ontario, still working full-time at the North York Community Library, as he had since 1974, and continued to run his original Waterdeep campaign with the same core group he started with, albeit meeting only sporadically.

===Castlemourn===
Castlemourn is a campaign setting by Greenwood for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Margaret Weis Productions introduced the setting to publication with &quot;A Player&#x27;s Guide to Castlemourn&quot; (2006), followed by the d20-based &quot;Castlemourn Campaign Setting&quot; (2007), and then the company released the &quot;Castlemourn Cortex System Quickstart&quot; (2008) as part of the second Free RPG Day and then closed down the line.

====Setting====
Castlemourn is a land searching for its past. Its people are unaware of their origins, the greatness of their history, or what disaster brought about the Dark Age that has engulfed the land. Some three hundred years before the setting&#x27;s current era, there existed a magical place of shining towers and marvelous wonders called the Realm of Castles. Legends tell of a great war against fell creatures that destroyed the realm, leaving scorched ruins and crumbling citadels. Whatever befell this realm was so terrible that the gods have &quot;cordoned&quot; it off. No one is permitted to leave Castlemourn and those who find their way there, do so at their own peril, as adventurers, treasure hunters, and questors scour the land searching for relics, artifacts, and clues to their past. Castlemourn is a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting where kingdoms fight for power through political intrigue and outright warfare; where the brave seek their fortunes in dangerous ruins, and where everyone fears the unspeakable evil that shadows their land.

====Races====
In Castlemourn, one can find almost all of the core races, except half-orc. However, their base abilities all changed in some ways.
*Dwarves: Dwarves are a stout miner race, just like in the core settings. However, they perceive the world as an illusion, so they are more prone to be affected by illusions, but can ignore real dangers, as if they were only illusions.
*Elves: Elves are lithe creatures of the woods, who glow with light, and therefore hardly can hide from others.
*Half-Elves: Just like their elven ancestors, they glow, but with a dimmer light.
*Halflings: Small people, who are the masters of forging magical items.
*Gnomes: Gnomes are little humanoids, who swore to commit a great task in their lives.
*Godaunts: Fell beasts, who are looked down by other races. They are the equivalent of the half-orc.
*Thaele: Vampire-like mysterious race.

====Classes====
There is only one extra class beside the core classes of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;: the buccaneer. The buccaneers are pirates, seafaring swashbucklers. There are six prestige classes as well: dusked, faithless one, rhymesword, servant of the Seven, truesword knight and waymaster.

==Awards and honors==
Greenwood won &quot;best player&quot; at the 1984 Gen Con AD&amp;D Open tournament and several Gamer&#x27;s Choice Awards and Origins Awards for his game design. He was inducted into the Gamer&#x27;s Choice Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Academy of Adventure Gaming&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2003. Order of Cramahe 2017. He received the Port Hope Civic Awards Arts &amp; Culture Award 2019. He was inducted into the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Association Hall of Fame in 2022.

<doc id="225824" wikidata="Q3138838" url="?curid=225824" title="Takeo Yoshikawa">
<text>was a Japanese spy in Hawaii before the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

==Early career==
A 1933 graduate of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima (graduating at the top of his class), Yoshikawa served briefly at sea aboard the armored cruiser &quot;Asama&quot; as well as submarines. He had begun training as a naval pilot near the end of 1934 when a severe stomach ailment prevented his completing his training. He was subsequently discharged from the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1936. As a result, he briefly contemplated suicide.

A year later he began a career in Naval intelligence, being assigned to Navy Headquarters in Tokyo. He became an expert regarding the U.S. Navy, perusing every source he could possibly get his hands on. While on intelligence duty he intercepted a shortwave radio message in plain English that 17 troop transports were en route to England, having cleared the port of Freetown, Sierra Leone. He passed this information to the German Embassy, and many of the ships were destroyed as a result. Yoshikawa subsequently received a personal letter of thanks from Adolf Hitler. In 1940 he became a junior diplomat after passing the Foreign Ministry English examinations.

==A spy in Hawaii==
Because of his expertise on the U.S. Navy, Yoshikawa was sent to Hawaii posing as a vice-consul named Tadashi Morimura (森村 正 &quot;Morimura Tadashi&quot;), arriving on March 27, 1941, with Nagao Kita (喜多 長雄 &quot;Kita Nagao&quot;), the new Japanese Consul-General, aboard the liner &quot;Nitta Maru&quot;. He rented a second-story apartment that overlooked Pearl Harbor and would often wander around the island of Oahu, taking notes on fleet movements and security measures. He rented small airplanes at John Rodgers Airport and flew around, observing U.S. installations; he also dove under the harbor using a hollow reed as a breathing device. He gathered information by taking the Navy&#x27;s own harbor tugboat and listening to local gossip. He worked closely with German Abwehr agent Bernard Kuehn, as well as another former Etajima graduate, Kokichi Seki (関 興吉 &quot;Seki Kō&#x27;kichi&quot;), an untrained spy who served as the consulate&#x27;s treasurer.

According to Yoshikawa, although some 160,000 persons of Japanese ancestry lived in Hawaii at that time, he never tried to make use of this resource in his espionage activities. He and Seki agreed that, while Hawaii should be the &quot;easiest place&quot; to carry out such work in view of the large Japanese population, both looked upon the locals with disdain. &quot;[T]hose men of influence and character who might have assisted me in my secret mission were unanimously uncooperative...&quot; Instead he made &quot;regular use of a Japanese-American military veteran, a driver in the employ of the consulate general for over 20 years, whom he valued for his being “trusted by the Americans.” Another Japanese-American working at the consulate general bought at least one airplane ticket in his own name for Yoshikawa, who wished to avoid suspicion by buying too many tickets himself. He also turned often to a favorite taxi driver, an immigrant with Japanese military experience, who on at least one occasion hid his taxi outside the consulate general to help Yoshikawa avoid surveillance at the beginning of his route.&quot;

Although he had no knowledge of a planned attack on Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Yoshikawa assumed that the intelligence would help prepare for such an eventuality and worked tirelessly to that end. His reports were transmitted by the Japanese consulate in PURPLE code to the Foreign Ministry, which passed them on to the Navy. Although the code had been broken by Allied codebreakers and messages to and from Tokyo were intercepted and decrypted, communications between Tokyo and the consulate were considered low-priority because they contained so many messages that were entirely commercial in nature. However, one such message addressed to Kita (but actually to Yoshikawa) and sent on September 24, 1941, should have received more attention. It divided Pearl Harbor into five distinct zones and requested that the location and number of warships be indicated on a &quot;plot&quot; (i.e., grid) of the harbor. However, due to delays caused by staff shortages and other priorities the message was not decrypted and distributed until mid-October, and then dismissed as being of little consequence. However, it was the reports that he sent twice a week based on this request that enabled Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to finalize his plan for the attack.

When he heard the &quot;East wind, rain&quot; code phrase on the short wave radio bringing the news from Tokyo to signal that an attack against the United States was to proceed, Yoshikawa destroyed all evidence of his activities. When the FBI picked him up on the day of the attack, there was no incriminating evidence of his espionage. He eventually returned to Japan in August 1942 in a diplomat prisoner exchange. It was not known for some time that he was the chief Japanese agent in Hawaii.

==Return to Japan and later life==
Yoshikawa continued to work for naval intelligence during the remainder of the war. When the war ended and Japan was occupied by U.S. forces, he went into hiding (disguised as a Buddhist monk) for fear of being prosecuted for his role in the Pearl Harbor attack. He returned to his wife (whom he had married shortly after his return from the U.S.) when the occupation ended.

Yoshikawa never received official recognition of his services during the war. In 1955, he opened a candy business but it failed as word spread of his role in the war. The locals blamed Yoshikawa for the war. &quot;They even blamed me for the atomic bomb,&quot; he declared in one interview. Penniless and jobless, he was supported by his wife for the rest of his life via her position selling insurance. &quot;My wife alone shows me great respect,&quot; said the old former spy. &quot;Every day she bows to me. She knows I am a man of history.&quot; He died in a nursing home.

Over the years, the mysterious spies of Pearl Harbor were always mentioned in passing in history books. While the Yoshikawa case was used to retroactively justify the decision to intern Japanese Americans, he claimed that he distrusted the Japanese-American community and that it was loyal to America over Japan.

<text>Launceston Elliot (9 June 1874 – 8 August 1930) was a British weightlifter, and the first athlete representing the United Kingdom to become an Olympic champion.

==Biography==
Launceston Elliot was conceived in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia, after which he was named, but before his birth his family moved to India and he was born in Kaladagi and baptised at Guledgudda, now in Karnataka State. His family was an established part of the Scottish aristocracy with Lord Minto being head of the family which had strong connections with India. The 4th Earl Minto served as Viceroy of India (1905–10). Launceston Elliot was the grandson of Sir Charles Elliot, the onetime governor of Saint Helena, and his father Gilbert Wray Elliot served as magistrate with the Indian Civil Service.

In 1887, Elliot&#x27;s father gave up his post in India and took his family to England where he began farming in Essex. The 13-year-old Launceston, an exceptionally well-built youth, who was seeing England for the first time, immediately came under the influence of the great Eugen Sandow and soon developed into an unusually talented lifter. In January 1891, aged only 16, he performed creditably at what is now recognised as the first British Championships held at the fashionable Café Monico in Piccadilly, London. Three years later he was the winner of the championships at the Royal Aquarium, Westminster.

Continuing success encouraged the 21-year-old Elliot to travel to Athens for the first modern Olympic Games. At the time, there were no internationally accepted rules or classifications for weightlifting and the 1896 Olympics added further to the huge variety of classes contested on the contemporary scene. The two-handed lift came first on the program and, after a long drawn out contest, Viggo Jensen of Denmark and Elliot had both lifted 111.5 kilograms, but Prince George awarded the Dane first place for having done so in better style. Jensen&#x27;s lift was accomplished with a superb clean lift whereas Elliot had certainly encountered difficulty. By contrast, the one-handed event was a short, sharp event. Elliot declined Prince George&#x27;s courteous offer of a rest break but he asked that he might this time lift after Jensen, as in the two-handed event the Dane had the advantage of lifting after Elliot. The request was granted although the order of lifting was not to have a material effect on the result. Elliot raised 71.0 kilograms without difficulty whereas Jensen, who had injured his shoulder trying to raise 112.5 kilograms in the two-handed event, could only manage 57.0 kilograms and Britain&#x27;s first Olympic champion was crowned.

Elliot also competed in the 100 metres in the athletics programme. He placed third in his heat and did not advance to the final. In the wrestling event, Elliot was defeated in the first round by Carl Schuhmann of Germany, the gymnastics champion.

He finished last of the five competitors in the rope climbing event on the gymnastics program.

Following his victory in Athens, he set four new records at the 1899 Amateur Championships and, as a prominent figure on the British weightlifting scene, his financial success was virtually assured. He also competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics, throwing the discus and placing eleventh (no weightlifting events were held that year). In 1903 he turned professional. After his retirement Elliot carried on farming in England for a few years before settling in Melbourne in 1923. He died of cancer of the spine on 8 August 1930 aged 56 and is buried in Melbourne&#x27;s Fawkner Cemetery.

Photographs of Launceston Elliot are featured among the distinguished Scottish athletes in the sport section of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh (re-opened after a major refurbishment in 2011).

<text>Alexander Viggo Jensen (born 22 June 1874 in Copenhagen, Denmark; died 2 November 1930 in Copenhagen, Denmark) was a Danish weightlifter, sport shooter, gymnast, and athlete. He was the first Danish and Nordic Olympic champion, at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens.

The first weightlifting event held was the two-handed lift, in a style now known as the clean and jerk. Jensen and Launceston Elliot of Great Britain and Ireland finished the competition tied at 111.5 kilograms, though the judges declared Jensen had performed the lift with better form and would be awarded first place. The British delegation protested, resulting in more attempts being given both lifters to improve their scores. Neither did and therefore Jensen retained first place, but he had injured his shoulder in the extra attempts.

That injury hampered Jensen&#x27;s efforts in the one-handed lift, the snatch. He was able to lift only 57.0 kilograms to Elliot&#x27;s 71.0 kilograms, taking second place in the event. Jensen competed in the shot put, placing fourth. He was not among the top four in the discus throw, placing sixth.

In the gymnastics competitions, Jensen entered the rope climbing event. He did not finish the climb, placing fourth behind the two Greeks who did reach the top of the 14 metre rope and Fritz Hofmann, who had gotten higher than Jensen. He was ahead of Launceston Elliot in the event.

He also competed in the two rifle events. In the military rifle, Jensen placed sixth with a score of 1,640 points and 30 hits of 40 shots. The free rifle was more successful for him, as he finished third at 1,305 points on 31 hits. His scores for each string of 10 shots were 392, 423, 280, and 210.

<text>The Penitent Thief, also known as the Good Thief, Wise Thief, Grateful Thief, or Thief on the Cross, is one of two unnamed thieves in Luke&#x27;s account of the crucifixion of Jesus in the New Testament. The Gospel of Luke describes him asking Jesus to &quot;remember him&quot; when Jesus comes into his kingdom. The other, as the impenitent thief, challenges Jesus to save himself and both of them to prove that he is the Messiah.

He is officially venerated in the Catholic Church. The Roman Martyrology places his commemoration on 25 March, together with the Feast of the Annunciation, because of the ancient Christian tradition that Christ (and the penitent thief) were crucified and died exactly on the anniversary of Christ&#x27;s incarnation.

He is given the name Dismas in the Gospel of Nicodemus and is traditionally known in Catholicism as Saint Dismas (sometimes Dysmas; in Spanish and Portuguese, Dimas). Other traditions have bestowed other names:
* In Coptic Orthodox tradition and the &quot;Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea&quot;, he is named Demas.
* In the &quot;Codex Colbertinus&quot;, he is named Zoatham or Zoathan.
* In the Arabic Infancy Gospel, he is named Titus.
* In Russian Orthodox tradition, he is named Rakh (Russian: Рах).

== Gospel ==
===Narrative===

Two men were crucified at the same time as Jesus, one on his right and one on his left, which the Gospel of Mark interprets as fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah 53:12 (&quot;And he was numbered with the transgressors&quot;). According to the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, respectively, both of the thieves mocked Jesus; Luke, however, relates:
The Gospel of John account of Jesus&#x27; death merely names both of these criminals as &quot;...and two others&quot; without naming their crimes.

===Harmonizations===
Various attempts have been made to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the account in Luke and the overlapping account in Mark and Matthew. Tatian omitted/rejected the Markan/Matthean tradition in his Diatessaron, and Ephrem the Syrian apparently followed suit. Origen of Alexandria, Eustathius of Antioch, and Epiphanius of Salamis described the differences as reflections of different, yet complementary authorial intent. Origen and his many heirs promoted a chronological harmonization, wherein both thieves at first reviled Jesus, only for one thief to repent on the spot. Epiphanius—followed by Ambrose of Milan and Augustine of Hippo—contended that Mark and Matthew, for the sake of concision, employed a figure of speech called &quot;syllepsis&quot; whereby the plural was used to indicate the singular. Later commentators, such as Frederic Farrar, have drawn attention to the difference between the Greek words used: &quot;The two first Synoptists tell us that both the robbers during an early part of the hours of crucifixion &quot;reproached&quot; Jesus (ὠνείδιζον), but we learn from St Luke that only one of them used injurious and insulting language to Him (ἐβλασφήμει).&quot;

===&quot;Amen ... today ... in paradise&quot;===

The phrase translated &quot;Amen, I say to you, today you will be in paradise&quot; in Luke 23:43 (&quot;Ἀμήν σοι λέγω σήμερον μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ.&quot; &quot;Amén soi légo sémeron met&#x27; emoû ése en tôi paradeísoi&quot;) is disputed in a minority of versions and commentaries. The Greek manuscripts are without punctuation, so attribution of the adverb &quot;today&quot; to the verb &quot;be&quot;, as &quot;Amen I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise&quot; (the majority view), or the verb &quot;say&quot;, as &quot;Amen I say to you today, you will be with me in paradise&quot; (the minority view), is dependent on analysis of word order conventions in Koine Greek. The majority of ancient Bible translations also follow the majority view, with only the Aramaic language Curetonian Gospels offering significant testimony to the minority view. As a result, some prayers recognize the good thief as the only person confirmed as a saint—that is, a person known to be in Paradise after death—by the Bible, and by Jesus himself. Thomas Aquinas wrote:
===Unnamed===

Only the Gospel of Luke describes one of the criminals as penitent, and that gospel does not name him.

Augustine of Hippo does not name the thief, but wonders if he might not have been baptized at some point.

According to tradition, the Good Thief was crucified to Jesus&#x27; right and the other thief was crucified to his left. For this reason, depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus often show Jesus&#x27; head inclined to his right, showing his acceptance of the Good Thief. In the Russian Orthodox Church, both crucifixes and crosses are usually made with three bars: the top one, representing the &quot;titulus&quot; (the inscription that Pontius Pilate wrote and was nailed above Jesus&#x27; head); the longer crossbar on which Jesus&#x27; hands were nailed; and a slanted bar at the bottom representing the footrest to which Jesus&#x27; feet were nailed. The footrest is slanted, pointing up towards the Good Thief, and pointing down towards the other.

According to John Chrysostom, the thief dwelt in the desert and robbed or murdered anyone unlucky enough to cross his path. According to Pope Gregory I, he &quot;was guilty of blood, even his brother&#x27;s blood&quot; (fratricide).

===Thief or revolutionary===
According to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops commentary on John 18:40, the term commonly translated as thief – léstés – can also mean &quot;a guerrilla warrior fighting for nationalistic aims.&quot;

===Named===
====&quot;Dismas&quot;====

Luke&#x27;s unnamed penitent thief was later assigned the name Dismas in an early Greek recension of the &quot;Acta Pilati&quot; and the Latin &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;, portions of which may be dated to the late fourth century. The name &quot;Dismas&quot; may have been adapted from a Greek word meaning &quot;dying&quot;. The other thief&#x27;s name is given as Gestas. In the Syriac Infancy Gospel&#x27;s &quot;Life of the Good Thief&quot; (&quot;Histoire Du Bon Larron&quot; French 1868, English 1882), Augustine of Hippo said, the thief said to Jesus, the child: &quot;O most blessed of children, if ever a time should come when I shall crave Thy Mercy, remember me and forget not what has passed this day.&quot;

Anne Catherine Emmerich saw the Holy Family &quot;exhausted and helpless&quot;; according to Augustine of Hippo and Peter Damian, the Holy Family met Dismas, in these circumstances. Pope Theophilus of Alexandria (385–412) wrote a &quot;Homily on the Crucifixion and the Good Thief&quot;, which is a classic of Coptic literature.

====&quot;Demas&quot;====
In Coptic Orthodoxy, he is named Demas. This is the name given to him in the Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea.

====&quot;Titus&quot;====
The apocryphal Syriac Infancy Gospel calls the two thieves Titus and Dumachus, and adds a tale about how Titus (the good one) prevented the other thieves in his company from robbing Mary and Joseph during their flight into Egypt.

====&quot;Rakh&quot;====
In the Russian tradition, the Good Thief&#x27;s name is &quot;Rakh&quot; (Russian: Рах).

===Sainthood===
The Catholic Church remembers the Good Thief on 25 March. In the Roman Martyrology, the following entry is given: &quot;Commemoration of the holy thief in Jerusalem who confessed to Christ and canonized him by Jesus himself on the cross at that moment and merited to hear from him: &#x27;Today you will be with me in Paradise.
A number of towns, including San Dimas, California, are named after him. Also, parish churches are named after him, such as the Church of the Good Thief in Kingston, Ontario, Canada—built by convicts at nearby Kingston Penitentiary, Saint Dismas Church in Waukegan, Illinois, the Old Catholic Parish of St Dismas in Coseley and the Church of St. Dismas, the Good Thief, a Catholic church at the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York.

The Eastern Orthodox Church remembers him on Good Friday, along with the crucifixion. The Synaxarion offers this couplet in his honor:

&lt;poem&gt;
Eden&#x27;s locked gates the Thief has opened wide,
By putting in the key, &quot;Remember me.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
===Prayer and music===
He is commemorated in a traditional Eastern Orthodox prayer (the troparion tou deipnou) said before receiving the eucharist: &quot;I will not speak of Thy Mystery to Thine enemies, neither like Judas will I give Thee a kiss; but like the thief will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord in Thy Kingdom.&quot;. According to the liturgical scholar Robert Taft, this hymn was inserted into the Holy Thursday liturgy in Constantinople in the late 6th century. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, one of the hymns of Good Friday is entitled, &quot;The Good Thief&quot; (or &quot;The Wise Thief&quot;, Church Slavonic: &quot;Razboinika blagorazumnago&quot;), and speaks of how Christ granted Dismas Paradise. Several compositions of this hymn are used in the Russian Orthodox Church and form one of the highlights of the Matins service on Good Friday.

===Art===
The earliest depiction of the thief may be the wooden relief of the doors of Saint Sabine in Rome. Here the good thief is apparently located to the right side of Jesus, similar to the famous late sixth-century depiction of the crucifixion in the Rabbula Gospels. In medieval art, St Dismas is often depicted as accompanying Jesus in the Harrowing of Hell as related in and the Apostles&#x27; Creed (though neither text mentions the thief). Notable books that explore the place of the good thief in art include monographs by Mitchell Merback (The Thief, the Cross, and the Wheel), Mikeal Parsons and Heidi Hornik (Illuminating Luke, vol. 3), and Christiane Klapisch-Zuber (Le voleur de paradis).

===Drama===
In Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, the main characters Vladimir and Estragon briefly discuss the inconsistencies between the Four Evangelists&#x27; accounts of the penitent and impenitent thieves. Vladimir concludes that since only Luke says that one of the two was saved, &quot;then the two of them must have been damned [...] why believe him rather than the others?&quot;

==In popular culture==
The thief features in Christian popular music, as in Christian rock band Third Day&#x27;s 1995 song &quot;Thief&quot;, and the name of the Christian rock band Dizmas. The thief is the narrator in Sydney Carter&#x27;s controversial song &quot;Friday Morning&quot;.

He is portrayed by Stelio Savante in the award-winning Good Friday film &quot;Once We Were Slaves&quot; directed by Dallas Jenkins

St. Dismas is central to the early plot of the video game &quot;Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&quot; in which treasure hunter Nathan Drake uses a St. Dismas cross to aid in his search for pirate treasure.

In &quot;Vida Loka, Pt. 2&quot;, the Brazilian rap group Racionais MC&#x27;s, refer to Dismas as a &quot;first thug life of all time&quot;.

Dismas is the name of one of two starting characters in the video game &quot;Darkest Dungeon&quot;. He is also referred to as a rogue, thief, and highwayman in the in-game descriptions. A comic showing his backstory (as well the descriptions of some items in the game) imply that he is attempting to redeem himself after killing an innocent woman and her child. A special achievement is granted if both starting characters reach the game&#x27;s final challenge, fittingly titled &quot;On the old road, we found redemption.&quot;

In the 1967 romantic comedy caper film &quot;Fitzwilly&quot;, butler mastermind Claude Fitzwilliam (Dick Van Dyke) and his larcenous staff operate St. Dismas Thrift Shoppe in Philadelphia, a fictional charity where they send and store their stolen loot.

St. Dismas is prominently mentioned throughout the 1946 film &quot;The Hoodlum Saint&quot; starring William Powell, Esther Williams and Angela Lansbury.

Dismas Hardy is the main protagonist in a series of legal and crime thriller novels by John Lescroart.

San Dimas, California and San Dimas High School are featured in the &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot; media franchise.

In the 2022 film &quot;Clerks III&quot;, Elias mentions the Good Thief multiple times, quoting him as saying &quot;Jesus did no wrong, whereas we are but thieves&quot;. In a running gag, everybody hears &quot;but thieves&quot; as &quot;butt thieves&quot; and wonders out loud what that means.

In Poul Anderson&#x27;s Technic History (a science fiction story cycle), Nicholas van Rijn (2376 to c. 2500), CEO of Solar Spice and Liquors keeps a Martian sandroot statue of Saint Dismas, to whom he frequently burns candles. At one point he runs out of candles and stuffs a large number of IOU&#x27;s under the statue. He also comments &quot;... Ho! Saint Dismas will think he was martyred in a grease fire.&quot;.

Christian metal band Holyname’s last song on their self titled album is called “St. Dismas” and is about his and Jesus Christ&#x27;s crucifixions.

The rapper Ka’s final album prior to his death was titled &quot;The Thief Next to Jesus.&quot;

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1709.

==Events==
*February 1 or 2 – Alexander Selkirk, the inspiration for &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, is rescued from the Juan Fernández Islands, where he was marooned, and begins his return to civilization.
*April 12 – The magazine &quot;The Tatler&quot; is founded in London by Richard Steele, writing as Isaac Bickerstaff. On July 8 &quot;Mrs. (Phoebe) Crackenthorpe&quot; (perhaps Delarivier Manley) begins publication of &quot;The Female Tatler&quot;.
*April 26 – An act of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland provides for public libraries in presbyteries.
*May–October 20 – Delarivier Manley&#x27;s &quot;roman à clef&quot; &quot;The New Atalantis (Secret Memoirs and Manners of Several Persons of Quality, of both Sexes, From The New Atalantis, an Island in the Mediterranean)&quot; is published in London (in two volumes, anonymously), purporting to be translated from Italian. Its satire of the Whigs is so scurrilous that the author is detained for questioning from October 29 to November 5. It goes through seven editions.
*May 2 – Alexander Pope&#x27;s career as a poet is launched with the publication of the anthology &quot;Poetical Miscellanies, The Sixth Part&quot;, edited by John Dryden and published by Jacob Tonson in London.
*June 28 – Historian Gustaf Adlerfelt is killed at the Battle of Poltava; his eyewitness account is continued by his son.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**&quot;The Works of Mr William Shakespear&quot; edited by dramatist Nicholas Rowe appears. It is the first modern edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, including scene divisions, &quot;dramatis personæ&quot; and a prefatory account of Shakespeare&#x27;s life, the first substantial biography of him. An unauthorised seventh volume, including Shakespeare&#x27;s poems, is perhaps edited by Charles Gildon.
**Ælfric of Eynsham&#x27;s &quot;An English-Saxon Homily on the Birth-day of St. Gregory&quot; is translated from Old English by Elizabeth Elstob.

**Anthim the Iberian, Metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia, sends his pupil Mihai Iștvanovici to establish the first printing press in the Kingdom of Kartli and in Georgia at large. Operating out of Tbilisi Iștvanovici produces the Gospel (&quot;Sahareba&quot;), designing his own fonts for Georgian scripts (the first ones, done by Miklós Tótfalusi Kis, had never reached Tbilisi); his letters are also used for his Romanian-language poem, written as a postface to the Gospel.

<doc id="225860" wikidata="Q166420" url="?curid=225860" title="Dorothy Lamour">
<text>Dorothy Lamour (born Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton; December 10, 1914 – September 22, 1996) was an American actress and singer. She is best remembered for having appeared in the &quot;Road to...&quot; movies, a series of successful comedies starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

Lamour began her career in the 1930s as a big band singer. In 1936, she moved to Hollywood, where she signed with Paramount Pictures. Her appearance as Ulah in &quot;The Jungle Princess&quot; (1936) brought her fame and marked the beginning of her image as the &quot;Sarong Queen&quot;.

In 1940, Lamour made her first &quot;Road series&quot; comedy film &quot;Road to Singapore&quot;. The &quot;Road series&quot; films were popular during the 1940s. The sixth film in the series, &quot;Road to Bali&quot;, was released in 1952. By this time, Lamour&#x27;s screen career had begun to wane, and she focused on stage and television work. In 1961, Crosby and Hope teamed for &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot;, but actress Joan Collins was cast as the female lead. Lamour made a brief appearance and sang a song near the end of that film.

In the 1970s, Lamour revived her nightclub act, and in 1980, released her autobiography &quot;My Side of the Road&quot;. She made her final movie appearance in 1987.

Lamour married her second husband, William Ross Howard III, in 1943. They had two sons and remained married until Howard&#x27;s death in 1978. Lamour died at her home in 1996 at the age of 81.

==Early life==

Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton was born on December 10, 1914, at Charity ward at New Orleans East Hospital in New Orleans, the daughter of Carmen Louise (née LaPorte) and John Watson Slaton, both of whom were restaurant servers. Lamour was of Spanish descent, with some English, French and possibly also distant Irish as well. Her parents&#x27; marriage lasted only a few years. Her mother married for the second time to Clarence Lambour, whose surname Dorothy later adopted and modified as her stage name. That marriage also ended in divorce when Dorothy was a teenager.

Lamour quit school at age 14. After taking a business course, she worked as a secretary to support herself and her mother. She began entering beauty pageants, was crowned Miss New Orleans in 1931, and went on to compete in Galveston&#x27;s Pageant of Pulchritude. Miss Lamour was close friends with Dorothy Dell, who was in the Ziegfeld Follies. Lamour used the prize money to support herself while she worked in a stock theatre company. She and her mother later moved to Chicago. Lamour found a job working at Marshall Field&#x27;s department store, working as an elevator operator at the age of 16. Her boss, Douglas Singleterry, referred to her as &quot;Dolly Face&quot;; he also recalled that she spent a lot of her time auditioning around Chicago. She was discovered by orchestra leader Herbie Kay when he spotted her in performance at a Chicago talent show held at the Hotel Morrison. She had an audition the next day; Kay hired her as a singer for his orchestra and, in 1935, Lamour went on tour with him. Her work with Kay eventually led Lamour to vaudeville and work in radio. In 1935, she had her own 15-minute weekly musical program on NBC Radio. Lamour also sang on the popular Rudy Vallée radio show and &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;. On January 30, 1944, Lamour starred in &quot;For This We Live&quot;, an episode of &quot;Silver Theater&quot; on CBS radio.

==Career==
In 1936, Lamour moved to Hollywood. Around that time, Carmen married her third husband, Ollie Castleberry, and the family lived in Los Angeles. That same year, she did a screen test for Paramount Pictures and signed a contract with them.

Lamour made her first film for Paramount, &quot;College Holiday&quot; (1936), in which she has a bit part as an uncredited dancer.

===&quot;The Jungle Princess&quot; and &quot;sarong&quot; roles===

Her second film for Paramount, &quot;The Jungle Princess&quot; (1936) with Ray Milland, solidified her fame. In the film, Lamour plays the role of &quot;Ulah&quot;, a jungle native who wore an Edith Head-designed sarong throughout the film. &quot;The Jungle Princess&quot; was a big hit for the studio and Lamour would be associated with sarongs for the rest of her career. It also gave her a hit song, &quot;Moonlight and Shadows&quot;.

She followed it with a support role in a Carole Lombard–Fred MacMurray musical &quot;Swing High, Swing Low&quot; (1937) where she got to sing &quot;Panamania&quot;. She was top billed in &quot;The Last Train from Madrid&quot; (1937).

Lamour supported Irene Dunne and Randolph Scott in &quot;High, Wide and Handsome&quot; (1937), singing &quot;The Things I Want&quot;. Sam Goldwyn borrowed her for John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Hurricane&quot; (1937), where she was back in a sarong playing an island princess alongside Jon Hall. Her swimming and diving scenes were handled by stunt double Lila Finn, who at one point dropped the sarong and was filmed diving into a lagoon in the nude. The film was a massive success and gave Lamour another hit song with &quot;The Moon of Manakoora&quot;.

Lamour had a cameo in &quot;Thrill of a Lifetime&quot; (1937) and was third billed in &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot; (1938) after W.C. Fields and Martha Raye; the cast also included Bob Hope in an early appearance.

Paramount reunited her with Milland and a sarong for &quot;Her Jungle Love&quot; (1938). &quot;Tropic Holiday&quot; (1938) cast her as a Mexican alongside Bob Burns, Raye and Milland, then she supported George Raft and Henry Fonda in the adventure film &quot;Spawn of the North&quot; (1938). Raft was meant to be Lamour&#x27;s leading man in &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1939) but he turned down the part and was replaced by Lloyd Nolan.

Lamour was Jack Benny&#x27;s leading lady in the musical &quot;Man About Town&quot; (1939) then played a Chinese girl in a melodrama, &quot;Disputed Passage&quot; (1939).

===The &quot;Road&quot; movies===

In 1940, Lamour starred in &quot;Road to Singapore&quot;, a spoof of Lamour&#x27;s &quot;sarong&quot; films. It was originally meant to co-star Fred MacMurray and Jack Oakie, then George Burns and Gracie Allen, before Paramount decided to use Bob Hope and Bing Crosby; Lamour was billed after Crosby and above Hope. The two male stars began ad-libbing during filming. &quot;I was trying to follow the script but just couldn&#x27;t get my lines out&quot;, she said later. &quot;Finally, I realised that I should just get the general idea of a scene rather than learn the words by heart, then go along with the boys.&quot; Said Hope, &quot;Dottie is one of the bravest gals in pictures. She stands there before the camera and ad-libs with Crosby and me knowing that the way the script is written she&#x27;ll come second or third best, but she fears nothing.&quot;

The movie was a solid hit and response to the team was enthusiastic.

20th Century Fox borrowed her to play Tyrone Power&#x27;s leading lady in the gangster film &quot;Johnny Apollo&quot; (1940). She sang &quot;This is the Beginning of the End&quot; and &quot;Dancing for Nickels and Dimes&quot;.

It was back to sarongs for &quot;Typhoon&quot; (1940). Her male co-star in the latter was Robert Preston who was also with Lamour in &quot;Moon Over Burma&quot; (1940). Fox borrowed her again for &quot;Chad Hanna&quot; (1941) with Henry Fonda.

Response to &quot;Road to Singapore&quot; had been such that Paramount reunited Lamour, Hope and Crosby in &quot;Road to Zanzibar&quot; (1941) which was even more successful and eventually led to a series of pictures (although from this point on Lamour was billed beneath Hope). She and Hope then did &quot;Caught in the Draft&quot; (1941) which was one of the biggest hits of the year.

Lamour was reunited with her old &quot;Hurricane&quot; star, Jon Hall, in &quot;Aloma of the South Seas&quot; (1941). She did a popular musical with Eddie Bracken, William Holden and Betty Hutton, &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In&quot; (1942), which gave her a hit song, &quot;I Remember You&quot;.

There was another sarong movie, &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon&quot; (1942). Both were well liked by the public but neither was as popular as her third &quot;Road&quot; movie, &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; (1942).

Lamour was one of many Paramount stars who did guest shots in &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1942). She and Hope were borrowed by Sam Goldwyn for a comedy &quot;They Got Me Covered&quot; (1943), then she did one with Crosby without Hope, &quot;Dixie&quot; (1943), a popular biopic of Dan Emmett.

During World War II, Lamour was among the more popular pinup girls among American servicemen, along with Betty Grable, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, and Veronica Lake. Lamour was also known for her volunteer work, selling war bonds during tours in which movie stars would travel the country selling U.S. government bonds to the public. Lamour reportedly sold $300 million worth of bonds earning her the nickname &quot;The Bond Bombshell&quot;. She also volunteered at the Hollywood Canteen where she would dance and talk to soldiers. In 1965, Lamour was awarded a belated citation from the United States Department of the Treasury for her war bond sales.

Lamour made &quot;Melody Inn&quot; (1943) with Dick Powell, then &quot;And the Angels Sing&quot; (1944) with Fred MacMurray and Hutton, where she sang &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;. She made one last sarong movie, &quot;Rainbow Island&quot; (1944), co-starring Bracken.

Lamour played a Mexican in &quot;A Medal for Benny&quot; (1945), based on a story by John Steinbeck, co-starring Arturo de Córdova. She was one of many Paramount stars to cameo in &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; (1945), then did a fourth &quot;Road&quot;, &quot;Road to Utopia&quot; (1945), then &quot;Masquerade in Mexico&quot; (1945) with de Cordova.

She was in three big hits in a row: &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot; (1947), a comedy with Hope; &quot;Wild Harvest&quot; (1947), a melodrama with Alan Ladd and Preston; and &quot;Road to Rio&quot; (1947). She also sang a duet with Ladd in &quot;Variety Girl&quot; (1947). Then she left Paramount.

===After Paramount===

Lamour emceed &quot;Front and Center&quot;, a 1947 variety comedy show, as a summer replacement for &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot;, with the Army Air Force recruiting as sponsors. The show changed to &quot;The Sealtest&quot; &quot;Variety Theater&quot; in September 1948.

After leaving Paramount, Lamour made a series of films for producer Benedict Bogeaus: the all-star comedy &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; (1948); &quot;Lulu Belle&quot; (1948), a melodrama with George Montgomery; and &quot;The Girl from Manhattan&quot; (1948), also with Montgomery.

She tried two comedies: &quot;The Lucky Stiff&quot; (1949), produced by Jack Benny co-starring Brian Donlevy, then &quot;Slightly French&quot; (1949) with Don Ameche. &quot;Manhandled&quot; (1950) was a film noir with Dan Duryea for Pine-Thomas. None of these films were particularly popular.

Lamour played a successful season at the London Palladium in 1950 then was in two big hits: &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952), Cecil B. De Mille&#x27;s circus epic, and &quot;Road to Bali&quot; (1952). However this did not seem to lead to better film offers, and Lamour began concentrating on being a nightclub entertainer and a stage actress.

She also began working on television, guest starring on &quot;Damon Runyon Theater&quot; and was on Broadway in &quot;Oh Captain!&quot; (1958).

===1960s===
Lamour returned to movies with a cameo in the final &quot;Road&quot; film, &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962); she was replaced as a love interest by Joan Collins because Bing Crosby wanted a younger actress. However, Bob Hope would not do the film without Lamour, so she appeared in an extended cameo.

She had a bigger part in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Reef&quot; (1963) with John Wayne and Lee Marvin, and made guest appearances on shows like &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, and films such as &quot;Pajama Party&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Phynx&quot; (1970).

Lamour moved to Baltimore with her family, where she appeared on TV and worked on the city&#x27;s cultural commission. Then David Merrick offered her the chance to headline a road company of &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; which she did for over a year near the end of the decade.

==Singing==
Lamour starred in a number of movie musicals and sang in many of her comedies and dramatic films as well. For several years beginning in the late 1930s, Harriet Lee was her voice teacher. Lamour introduced a number of standards, including &quot;The Moon of Manakoora&quot;, &quot;I Remember You&quot;, &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;, &quot;Personality&quot;, and &quot;But Beautiful&quot;.

==Later years==
===1970s===
In the 1970s, Lamour was a popular draw at dinner theatres and in shows such as &quot;Anything Goes&quot;.

She guest starred on shows such as &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and films like &quot;Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976) and &quot;Death at Love House&quot; (1976). In 1977, she toured in the play &quot;Personal Appearance&quot;.

Her husband died in 1978, but she continued to work for &quot;therapy&quot;.

===1980s===
In 1980, Lamour published her autobiography &quot;My Side of the Road&quot; and revived her nightclub act.

During the remainder of the decade, she performed in plays and television shows such as &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;Crazy Like a Fox&quot;, &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;.

In 1984, she toured in a production of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;.

In 1986 she said &quot;I&#x27;m still as busy at 71 as I was when I was just a slip of a girl. I do concerts, television and a lot of dinner theatre, where I sing old songs and talk about Bob and Bing and starting out at Paramount at $200 a week and working myself up to $450,000 a picture...I feel wonderful. Age is only in the mind and I&#x27;m grateful that God has taken care of me. And I&#x27;m very grateful for that sarong. It did a lot for me! But to be truthful, the sarong was never my favorite wearing apparel.&quot;

In 1987, she made her last big-screen appearance in the movie &quot;Creepshow 2&quot;, appearing with George Kennedy as an aging couple who are killed during a robbery. The wooden, Native American statue in front of their general store comes to life to avenge their death. The 72-year-old Lamour quipped: &quot;Well, at my age you can&#x27;t lean against a palm tree and sing &#x27;Moon of Manakoora&#x27;&quot;, she said. &quot;People would look at that and say &#x27;What is she trying to do?

===1990s===
During the 1990s, she made only a handful of professional appearances but remained a popular interview subject for publications and TV talk and news programs. Lamour&#x27;s final stage performance was as &quot;Hattie&quot; in the Long Beach Civic Light Opera&#x27;s 1990 production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;.

In 1995, the musical &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot;, a revue of songs written by Johnny Burke (who wrote many of the most famous &quot;Road to ...&quot; movie songs as well as the score to Lamour&#x27;s film &quot;And the Angels Sing&quot; (1944)) opened on Broadway and ran for three months; Lamour was credited as a &quot;special advisor&quot;. It was nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award; the actress playing her in the road movie segment, Kathy Fitzgerald, also was nominated.

==Personal life==

Lamour&#x27;s first marriage was to orchestra leader Herbie Kay, with whose orchestra Lamour sang. The two married in 1935 and divorced in 1939.

Early in her career, Lamour met J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to Hoover&#x27;s biographer Richard Hack, Hoover pursued a romantic relationship with Lamour, and the two spent a night together at a Washington, D.C., hotel. When Lamour was later asked if she and Hoover had a sexual relationship, she replied: &quot;I cannot deny it.&quot; In her autobiography &quot;My Side of the Road&quot; (1980), Lamour does not discuss Hoover in detail; she refers to him only as &quot;a lifelong friend&quot;.

On April 7, 1943, Lamour married Air Force captain and advertising executive William Ross Howard III in Beverly Hills. The couple had two sons: John Ridgely (1946–2018) and Richard Thomson Howard (born 1949).

In 1957, Lamour and Howard moved to the Baltimore, Maryland, suburb of Sudbrook Park. In 1962, the couple and their two sons moved to Hampton, another Baltimore suburb in Dulaney Valley, with their oldest son, John, attending Towson High School. She also owned a home in Palm Springs, California. Howard died in 1978.

Lamour was a registered Republican who supported the presidency of Ronald Reagan as well as Reagan&#x27;s re-election in 1984.

==Death==
Lamour died at her home in North Hollywood on September 22, 1996, from a heart attack, at the age of 81. Her funeral was held at St. Charles Catholic Church in North Hollywood, California, where she was a member. She was interred in the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

For her contribution to the radio and motion picture industry, Lamour has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her star for her radio contributions is located at 6240 Hollywood Boulevard, and her star for her motion picture contributions is located at 6332 Hollywood Boulevard.

==In popular culture==
Lamour is the heroine of Matilda Bailey&#x27;s young adult novel, &quot;Dorothy Lamour and the Haunted Lighthouse&quot; (1947), whose &quot;heroine has the same name and appearance as the famous actress but has no connection ... it is as though the famous actress has stepped into an alternate reality in which she is an ordinary person.&quot; The story was written for a young teenage audience and is reminiscent of the adventures of Nancy Drew. It is part of a series known as &quot;Whitman Authorized Editions&quot;, 16 books published between 1941 and 1947 that each featured a film actress as heroine.

She was featured in a brief print run of 2-3 issues during the 1950s, in &quot;Dorothy Lamour Jungle Princess Comics&quot;, a series of comic books dedicated to her on-film Jungle Princess persona (featuring screenshots from past movies as the covers).

<text>Samuel Wanamaker (born Samuel Wattenmacker; June 14, 1919 – December 18, 1993) was an American actor and director, whose career on stage and in film and television spanned five decades. He began his career on Broadway, but spent most of his professional life in the United Kingdom, where he emigrated after becoming fearful of being blacklisted in Hollywood due to his communist views in the 1950s.

Wanamaker became extensively involved in British theater, while continuing film and television work, eventually returning to some Hollywood productions while remaining based in the UK. There, he is also credited as the person most responsible for the modern recreation of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe theatre in London, where he is commemorated in the name of the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, the site&#x27;s second theatre. He was awarded an honorary CBE for his work.

Wanamaker was the father of actress Zoë Wanamaker, and the uncle of film historian Marc Wanamaker.

==Early life==
Wanamaker was born in Chicago, the son of tailor Maurice Wattenmacker (Manus Watmakher) and Molly (née Bobele). His parents were both Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. His father Maurice was from Mykolaiv, in present-day Ukraine. He was the younger of two brothers, the elder being William, a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

He trained at the Goodman School of Drama, then at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University) and at Drake University. He began working with summer stock theatre companies in Chicago and northern Wisconsin, where he helped build the stage of the Peninsula Players Theatre in 1937.

==Career==
Wanamaker began his acting career in traveling shows and later worked on Broadway. In 1942, he starred with Ingrid Bergman in &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot; and directed &quot;Two Gentlemen from Athens&quot; the following year.

In 1943, Wanamaker was part of the cast of the play &quot;Counterattack&quot; at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. During the play, he became enamored of the ideals of communism. He attended Drake University before serving in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946, during World War II. In 1947, he returned to civilian life as an actor and director. In 1948, he starred in and directed the original Broadway production of &quot;Goodbye, My Fancy&quot;.
In 1951, Wanamaker made a speech welcoming the return of two of the Hollywood Ten. In 1952, at the height of the McCarthy &quot;Red Scare&quot; period, Wanamaker, who was then acting in the UK, learned that despite his distinguished service in the Army during World War II, his years as a communist could lead to his being blacklisted in Hollywood. He consequently decided to remain in England, where he reestablished his career as a stage and film actor, along with becoming a director and producer. He explained:

In 1952, he made his debut as both actor and director in London in Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Winter Journey&quot;. The play, which co-starred Michael Redgrave, was considered &quot;sensational&quot; by critics. He later appeared in other plays, including &quot;The Big Knife&quot;, &quot;The Shrike&quot;, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, and &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;. In 1956, he directed the British premiere of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill&#x27;s musical play &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (revived in New York in 1954 in a translation by Marc Blitzstein.)

In 1957, he was appointed director of the neglected New Shakespeare Theatre in Liverpool. He brought a number of notable productions to the theatre, such as &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; and &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. It was also transformed into a lively arts centre as a result of including other cultural attractions, such as films, lectures, jazz concerts and art exhibits.

As a result of all his various activities, Wanamaker became London&#x27;s &quot;favourite American actor and director&quot;, noted &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 1959, he joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre company at Stratford-upon-Avon, playing Iago to Paul Robeson&#x27;s Othello in Tony Richardson&#x27;s production that year. In the 1960s and 1970s, he produced or directed several works at venues including the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and directed the Shakespeare Birthday Celebrations in 1974.

As a director and actor, he worked in films and television, with a role in &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1974). Wanamaker eventually returned to Hollywood films including &quot;Private Benjamin&quot; (1980), &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), and &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987). He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in the 1978 ABC television miniseries &quot;Holocaust&quot;.

In 1968, he produced and directed the pilot episode of the Western TV series &quot;Lancer&quot;; a fictionalized version of this is depicted in the 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, and 2021 novelization with Wanamaker portrayed by Nicholas Hammond in the film.

He also directed stage productions, including the world premiere production of Michael Tippett&#x27;s opera &quot;The Ice Break&quot;. In 1980, he directed Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Aida&quot; starring Luciano Pavarotti at San Francisco Opera (now broadcast version released as DVD). He was also featured as the widowed and ruthless department store owner Simon Berrenger on the short-lived television drama &quot;Berrenger&#x27;s&quot; in 1985.

===Restoring the Globe theatre===
In 1970 Wanamaker&#x27;s career took a dramatic turn after he was annoyed that while a number of replicas of the Globe theatre existed in the United States, the site of the original in London was marked by only a plaque on a nearby brewery. He then made it his goal to restore an exact replica of the Globe to feature plays and a museum.

It became Wanamaker&#x27;s &quot;great obsession&quot; to restore Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe at its original location. He secured financial support from philanthropists and fellow lovers of Shakespeare, such as Samuel H. Scripps, to see that it would be created. Wanamaker then founded the Shakespeare Globe Trust, which raised well over ten million dollars.
Though, as in the late 16th and 17th centuries, the 20th century Royal family were more or less supportive, British officialdom was far less so, since they wanted to develop the site for new high-rise housing and commercial use. English Heritage, which controlled the site, refused to give Wanamaker the precise dimensions of the original Globe.

According to Karl Meyer of &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

The Shakespeare project helped Mr. Wanamaker keep his sanity and dignity intact. On his first visit to London in 1949, he had sought traces of the original theatre and was astonished to find only a blackened plaque on an unused brewery. He found this neglect inexplicable, and in 1970 launched the Shakespeare Globe Trust, later obtaining the building site and necessary permissions despite a hostile local council. He siphoned his earnings as actor and director into the project, undismayed by the scepticism of his British colleagues.

On the south bank of the River Thames in London, near where the modern recreation of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe stands today, is a plaque that reads: &quot;In Thanksgiving for Sam Wanamaker, Actor, Director, Producer, 1919–1993, whose vision rebuilt Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre on Bankside in this parish&quot;. There is a blue plaque on the river-side wall of the theatre, and the site&#x27;s Jacobean indoor theatre, opened in January 2014, is named the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse after him.
For his work in reconstructing the Globe theatre, Wanamaker, in July 1993, was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was also honoured with the Benjamin Franklin Medal by the Royal Society of Arts in recognition of his contribution to theatre.

When multi-Tony Award-winning British actor Mark Rylance accepted his third Tony on stage in New York City during the televised ceremonies on June 8, 2014, he did so with a note of thanks to Wanamaker.

==Personal life==
In 1940, Wanamaker married Canadian actress Charlotte Holland.

In the 1970s, he reportedly entered into a long-lasting personal relationship with the American actress Jan Sterling. In the 2014 memoir &quot;I Said Yes to Everything&quot;, Lee Grant claimed that during production of the film &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), Wanamaker engaged in an affair with British actress Lynne Frederick, who was 21 at the time.

Actress Zoë Wanamaker is his daughter, and film historian Marc Wanamaker is his nephew.

==Death==
Wanamaker died of lung cancer in London on December 18, 1993, aged 74, before the grand opening of the Globe by Queen Elizabeth II on June 12, 1997. He was survived by three daughters, Abby, Zoë, and Jessica.

<doc id="225870" wikidata="Q2661372" url="?curid=225870" title="Coca-Cola formula">
<text>The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s formula for Coca-Cola syrup, which bottlers combine with carbonated water to create the company&#x27;s flagship cola soft drink, is a closely guarded trade secret. Company founder Asa Candler initiated the veil of secrecy that surrounds the formula in 1891 as a publicity, marketing, and intellectual property protection strategy. While several recipes, each purporting to be the authentic formula, have been published, the company maintains that the actual formula remains a secret, known only to a very few select, and anonymous, employees. The claim that the recipe is only known to two people and that they cannot fly on the same plane due to the chance they may die, and the recipe will become unknown, is wrong and has been fact-checked and proved as such multiple times.

==History==
Coca-Cola inventor John Pemberton is known to have shared his original formula with at least four people before his death in 1888. In 1891, Asa Candler purchased the rights to the formula from Pemberton&#x27;s estate, founded the Coca-Cola Company, and instituted the shroud of secrecy that has since enveloped the formula. He also made changes to the ingredients list, which by most accounts improved the flavor, and entitled him to claim that anyone in possession of Pemberton&#x27;s original formula no longer knew the &quot;real&quot; formula.

In 1919, Ernest Woodruff led a group of investors in purchasing the company from Candler and his family. As collateral for the acquisition loan, Woodruff placed the only written copy of the formula in a vault at the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. In 1925, when the loan had been repaid, Woodruff relocated the written formula to the Trust Company Bank (Truist Financial) in Atlanta. On December 8, 2011, the company placed it in a vault on the grounds of the World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, with the vault on public display.

According to the company, only two employees are privy to the complete formula at any given time and they are not permitted to travel together. When one dies, the other must choose a successor within the company and impart the secret to that person. The identity of the two employees in possession of the secret is itself a secret.
However, the company&#x27;s &quot;secret formula&quot; policy is more of a marketing strategy than an actual trade secret: any competitor in possession of the genuine Coke recipe would be unable to obtain key ingredients such as processed coca leaf, and even if all components were available, could not market the product as Coca-Cola.
During the late 19th century, Coca-Cola was one of many popular coca-based drinks with purported medicinal properties and benefits to health; early marketing materials claimed that Coca-Cola alleviated headaches and acted as a &quot;brain and nerve tonic&quot;. Coca leaves were used in Coca-Cola&#x27;s preparation; the small amount of cocaine they contained – along with caffeine originally sourced from kola nuts – provided the drink&#x27;s &quot;tonic&quot; quality. In 1903, cocaine was removed, leaving caffeine as the sole stimulant ingredient, and all medicinal claims were dropped. By one account, the FDA continued to screen random samples of Coca-Cola syrup for the presence of cocaine.

Some sources claim that coca leaf chemically processed to remove the cocaine remains part of the formula as a flavoring. According to these accounts, the company obtains the ingredient from the Stepan Company of Maywood, New Jersey, which legally extracts cocaine from coca leaves for use in pharmaceuticals, then sells the processed leaf material for use in Coca-Cola. the company would neither confirm nor deny this, deferring to the secret nature of the formula.

In 1911, the United States government sued the Coca-Cola Company for violations of the Pure Food and Drug Act, claiming that the high concentration of caffeine in Coca-Cola syrup was harmful to health. The case was decided in favor of Coca-Cola, but a portion of the decision was set aside in 1916 by the Supreme Court. As part of a settlement, the company agreed to reduce the amount of caffeine in its syrup.
== Current ingredients ==

The company protects the secrecy of its syrup recipe by shipping ingredients to its syrup factories in the form of anonymous &quot;merchandises&quot;, numbered 1 through 9. Factory managers are told the relative proportions of each numbered merchandise, and the mixing procedure, but not the ingredients in the merchandises, some of which are themselves mixtures of more basic ingredients. Merchandise no. 1 is known to be sugar, in the form of high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose (see variations, below); caramel coloring is no. 2, caffeine is no. 3, and phosphoric acid is no. 4. The identities of merchandises 5 through 9 are a matter of debate – particularly &quot;merchandise 7X&quot; (the &quot;X&quot; has never been explained), which is thought to contain a mixture of essential oils such as orange, lime, lemon, and lavender.

Despite the implications of its name, there is no evidence that the current version of Coca-Cola syrup contains kola nut extract, which was originally included for its caffeine content. The modern source of that additive is probably caffeine citrate, a byproduct of the decaffeination of coffee.

The primary taste of Coca-Cola is thought to come from vanilla and cinnamon, with trace amounts of essential oils, and spices such as nutmeg. A 2014 study identified and measured 58 aroma compounds in the top three US brands of cola, confirming significant amounts of compounds found in the essential oils of cinnamon, lemon, orange, neroli, coriander, nutmeg and vanilla.

==Formula variations in the United States==
During the 1980s, most U.S. Coca-Cola bottlers switched their primary sweetening ingredient from cane sugar (sucrose) to the cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. , the only U.S. bottler still using sucrose year-round was the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Cleveland, which serves northern Ohio and a portion of Pennsylvania. Many bottlers outside the U.S. also continue to use sucrose as the primary sweetener. glass bottles of sucrose-sweetened Coca-Cola imported from Mexico are available in many U.S. markets for those consumers who prefer the sucrose version (see &quot;Mexican Coke&quot;, below).

=== Passover ===
Coca-Cola was certified kosher in 1935 by Rabbi Tobias Geffen after beef tallow-derived glycerin was replaced with vegetable glycerin. However, the high-fructose corn syrup used by most U.S. bottlers since the 1980s is kitniyot (derived from grain/seeds/legumes) by the definitions of Jewish kosher law, and therefore forbidden to Ashkenazi Jews during Passover according to certain traditions. Each year, in the weeks leading up to Passover, bottlers in markets with substantial Jewish populations switch to sucrose sweetener in order to obtain Kosher for Passover certification.

=== &quot;New Coke&quot; ===

In April 1985, in response to marketing research suggesting that a majority of North American consumers preferred the taste of rival Pepsi to Coca-Cola, the company introduced a sweeter, less effervescent version of Coca-Cola in the U.S. and Canada. Although the new formulation had beaten both Pepsi-Cola and the old Coke formula in multiple blind taste tests, consumer response was overwhelmingly negative. The company quickly reintroduced the original beverage, rebranded as &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot;, while continuing to market the new version as simply &quot;Coke&quot;.

The new version remained on the market, in North America only, for 17 years—the last 10 as &quot;Coke II&quot;—until it was quietly discontinued in 2002. The &quot;Classic&quot; designation remained on the original product&#x27;s label, its prominence gradually decreasing over the years, until it was removed entirely in 2009.

=== Mexican Coke ===

In the early 2000s, cane-sugar-sweetened Coca-Cola produced in Mexico began to appear in bodegas and Hispanic supermarkets in the Southwestern United States; in 2005, Costco began offering it. All were obtaining the Mexican product—which was not labeled in accordance with U.S. food labeling laws—outside the official Coca-Cola distribution network. In 2009, the Coca-Cola Company began officially importing Coca-Cola produced in Mexico, with proper labeling, for distribution through official channels.

==Purported revelations of the secret recipe==

===Pemberton recipe===
Coca-Cola inventor John Pemberton is said to have written the following recipe in his diary shortly before his death in 1888. The recipe does not specify when or how the ingredients are mixed, nor the flavoring oil quantity units of measure (though it implies that the &quot;Merchandise 7X&quot; was mixed first). This was common in recipes at the time, as it was assumed that preparers knew the method.

Ingredients:
* caffeine citrate
* citric acid
* vanilla extract
* lime juice
* &quot;flavoring&quot; (i.e., &quot;Merchandise 7X&quot;)
* sugar
* fluid extract of coca leaves (flavor essence of the coca leaf)
* water
*caramel sufficient to give color
*&quot;Mix caffeine, citric acid and lime juice in 1 quart boiling water add vanilla and flavoring when cool.&quot;

Flavoring (Merchandise 7X):
*1 qrt alcohol
*80 oil orange
*40 oil cinnamon
*120 oil lemon
*20 oil coriander
*40 oil nutmeg
*40 oil neroli
*&quot;Let stand 24 hours.&quot;

===Merory recipe===
Recipe is from &quot;Food Flavorings: Composition, Manufacture and Use&quot;. Makes of syrup. Yield (used to flavor carbonated water at per bottle): 128 bottles, .

* Mix of sugar with just enough water to dissolve the sugar fully. (High-fructose corn syrup may be substituted for half the sugar.)
* Add of caramel, caffeine, and phosphoric acid.
* Extract the cocaine from of coca leaf (&quot;Truxillo&quot; growth of coca preferred) with toluol; discard the cocaine extract.
* Soak the coca leaves and kola nuts (both finely powdered); in of 20% alcohol.
** California white wine fortified to 20% strength was used as the soaking solution circa 1909, but Coca-Cola may have switched to a simple water/alcohol mixture.
* After soaking, discard the coca and kola and add the liquid to the syrup.
* Add lime juice (a former ingredient, evidently, that Coca-Cola now denies) or a substitute such as a water solution of citric acid and sodium citrate at lime-juice strength.
* Mix together
** orange oil,
** cassia (Chinese cinnamon) oil,
** lemon oil, traces of
** nutmeg oil, and, if desired, traces of
**coriander,
**neroli, and
**lavender oils.
* Add water to the oil mixture and let stand for twenty-four hours at about . A cloudy layer will separate.
* Take off the clear part of the liquid only and add to the syrup.
* Add glycerine (from vegetable source, not hog fat, so the drink can be sold to Jews and Muslims who observe their respective religion&#x27;s dietary restrictions) and of vanilla extract.
* Add water (treated with chlorine) to make a gallon of syrup.

===Beal recipe===

In 2011, Ira Glass announced on his Public Radio International show, &quot;This American Life&quot;, that show staffers had found a recipe in &quot;Everett Beal&#x27;s Recipe Book&quot;, reproduced in the February 28, 1979 issue of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, that they believed was either Pemberton&#x27;s original formula for Coca-Cola, or a version that he made either before or after the product was first sold in 1886. The formula is very similar to the one found in Pemberton&#x27;s diary. Coca-Cola archivist Phil Mooney acknowledged that the recipe &quot;could be a precursor&quot; to the formula used in the original 1886 product, but emphasized that the original formula is not the same as the one used in the current product.

*Fluid extract of Coca: 3 drams USP
*Citric acid: 3 oz
*Caffeine: 1 oz
*Sugar: 30 lbs
*Water: 2.5 gal
*Lime juice: 2 pints (1 quart)
*Vanilla: 1 oz
*Caramel: 1.5 oz or more for color

The secret 7X flavor (use 2 oz of flavor to 5 gals syrup):
*Alcohol: 8 oz 
*Orange oil: 20 drops
*Cinnamon oil: 10 drops
*Lemon oil: 30 drops
*Coriander oil: 5 drops
*Nutmeg oil: 10 drops
*Neroli oil: 10 drops

<doc id="225873" wikidata="Q208238" url="?curid=225873" title="Vienna Circle">
<text>The Vienna Circle () of logical empiricism was a group of elite philosophers and scientists drawn from the natural and social sciences, logic and mathematics who met regularly from 1924 to 1936 at the University of Vienna, chaired by Moritz Schlick. The Vienna Circle had a profound influence on 20th-century philosophy, especially philosophy of science and analytic philosophy.

The philosophical position of the Vienna Circle was called logical empiricism (German: &quot;logischer Empirismus&quot;), logical positivism or neopositivism. It was influenced by Ernst Mach, David Hilbert, French conventionalism (Henri Poincaré and Pierre Duhem), Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Albert Einstein. The Vienna Circle was pluralistic and committed to the ideals of the Enlightenment. It was unified by the aim of making philosophy scientific with the help of modern logic. Main topics were foundational debates in the natural and social sciences, logic and mathematics; the modernization of empiricism by modern logic; the search for an empiricist criterion of meaning; the critique of metaphysics and the unification of the sciences in the unity of science.

The Vienna Circle appeared in public with the publication of various book series – &quot;Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung&quot; (&quot;Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception&quot;), &quot;Einheitswissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Unified Science&quot;) and the journal &quot;Erkenntnis&quot; – and the organization of international conferences in Prague; Königsberg (today known as Kaliningrad); Paris; Copenhagen; Cambridge, UK, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its public profile was provided by the &quot;Ernst Mach Society&quot; (German: &quot;Verein Ernst Mach&quot;) through which members of the Vienna Circle sought to popularize their ideas in the context of programmes for popular education in Vienna.

During the era of Austrofascism and after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany most members of the Vienna Circle were forced to emigrate. The murder of Schlick in 1936 by former student Johann Nelböck put an end to the Vienna Circle in Austria.

==History of the Vienna Circle==
The history and development of the Vienna Circle shows various stages:

=== The &quot;First Vienna Circle&quot; (1907–1912) ===
The pre-history of the Vienna Circle began with meetings on the philosophy of science and epistemology from 1908 on, promoted by Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn and Otto Neurath.

Hans Hahn, the oldest of the three (1879–1934), was a mathematician. He received his degree in mathematics in 1902. Afterwards he studied under the direction of Ludwig Boltzmann in Vienna and David Hilbert, Felix Klein and Hermann Minkowski in Göttingen. In 1905 he received the Habilitation in mathematics. He taught at Innsbruck (1905–1906) and Vienna (from 1909).

Otto Neurath (1882–1945) studied mathematics, political economy, and history in Vienna and Berlin. From 1907 to 1914 he taught in Vienna at the Neue Wiener Handelsakademie (Viennese Commercial Academy). Neurath married Olga, Hahn&#x27;s sister, in 1911.

Philipp Frank, the youngest of the group (1884–1966), studied physics at Göttingen and Vienna with Ludwig Boltzmann, David Hilbert and Felix Klein. From 1912, he held the chair of theoretical physics in the German University in Prague.

Their meetings were held in Viennese coffeehouses from 1907 onward. Frank remembered:

A number of further authors were discussed in the meetings such as Brentano, Meinong, Helmholtz, Hertz, Husserl, Freud, Russell, Whitehead, Lenin and Frege.

Presumably the meetings stopped in 1912, when Frank went to Prague, to hold the chair of theoretical physics left vacant by Albert Einstein. Hahn left Vienna during World War I and returned in 1921.

=== The formative years (1918–1924) ===
The formation of &quot;the&quot; Vienna Circle began with Hahn returning to Vienna in 1921. Together with the mathematician Kurt Reidemeister he organized seminars on Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus logico-philosophicus&quot; and on Whitehead and Russell&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

With the support of Hahn, Moritz Schlick was appointed to the chair of philosophy of the inductive sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922 – the chair formerly held by Ernst Mach and partly by Boltzmann. Schlick had already published two important works &quot;Raum und Zeit in die gegenwärtigen Physik&quot; (&quot;Space and Time in contemporary Physics&quot;) in 1917 and &quot;Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre&quot; (&quot;General Theory of Knowledge&quot;) in 1918.

Immediately after Schlick&#x27;s arrival in Vienna, he organized discussions with the mathematicians around Hahn. In 1924 Schlick&#x27;s students Friedrich Waismann and Herbert Feigl suggested to their teacher a sort of regular &quot;evening circle&quot;. From winter term 1924 on regular meetings were held at the Institute of Mathematics in Vienna&#x27;s Boltzmanngasse 5 on personal invitation by Schlick. These discussions can be seen as the beginning of the Vienna Circle.

=== The non-public phase of the Vienna Circle – The Schlick Circle (1924–1928) ===
The group that met from 1924 on was quite diverse and included not only recognized scientists such as Schlick, Hahn, Kraft, Philipp Frank, Neurath, Olga Hahn-Neurath, and Heinrich Gomperz, but also younger students and doctoral candidates. In addition, the group invited foreign visitors.
In 1926 Schlick and Hahn arranged to bring Rudolf Carnap to the University of Vienna as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (private lecturer). Carnap&#x27;s &quot;Logical Structure of the World&quot; was intensely discussed in the Circle.

Also Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus logico-philosophicus&quot; was read out loud and discussed. From 1927 on personal meetings were arranged between Wittgenstein and Schlick, Waismann, Carnap and Feigl.

=== The public phase – Schlick Circle and &quot;Verein Ernst Mach&quot; (1928–1934) ===
In 1928 the &quot;Verein Ernst Mach&quot; (&quot;Ernst Mach Society&quot;) was founded, with Schlick as its chairman. The aim of the society was the spreading of a &quot;scientific world conception&quot; through public lectures that were in large part held by members of the Vienna Circle.

In 1929 the Vienna Circle made its first public appearance under this name – invented by Neurath – with the publication of its manifesto &quot;Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung. Der Wiener Kreis&quot; (&quot;The Scientific Conception of the World. The Vienna Circle&quot; also known as &quot;Viewing the World Scientifically: The Vienna Circle&quot;) The pamphlet is dedicated to Schlick, and its preface was signed by Hahn, Neurath and Carnap.

The manifesto was presented at the &quot;Tagung für Erkenntnislehre der exakten Wissenschaften&quot; (&quot;Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences&quot;) in autumn 1929, organized by the Vienna Circle together with the Berlin Circle. This conference was the first international appearance of logical empiricism and the first of a number of conferences: Königsberg (1930), Prague (1934), Paris (1935), Copenhague (1936), Cambridge, UK (1938), Cambridge, Mass. (1939), and Chicago (1941).

While primarily known for its views on the natural sciences and metaphysics, the public phase of the Vienna Circle was explicitly political. Neurath and Hahn were both socialists and believed the rejection of magic was a necessary component for liberation of the working classes. The manifesto linked Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche to their political and anti-metaphysical views, indicating a blur between what are now considered two separate schools of contemporary philosophy – analytic philosophy and continental philosophy.

In 1930 the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Society took over the journal &quot;Annalen der Philosophie&quot; and made it the main journal of logical empiricism under the title &quot;Erkenntnis&quot;, edited by Carnap and Reichenbach. In addition, the Vienna Circle published a number of book series: &quot;Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung&quot; (&quot;Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception&quot;, ed. by Schlick und Frank, 1928–1937), &quot;Einheitswissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Unified Science&quot;, edited by Neurath, 1933–1939), and later the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot; (edited by Neurath, Carnap and Charles W. Morris, 1938–1970).

=== Disintegration, emigration, internationalization (1934–1938) ===
From the beginning of the 1930s first signs of disintegration appeared for political and racist reasons: Herbert Feigl left Austria in 1930. Carnap was appointed to a chair at Prague University in 1931 and left for Chicago in 1935.

1934 marks an important break: Hahn died after surgery, Neurath fled to Holland because of the victory of Austrofascism in the Austrian Civil War following which the &quot;Ernst Mach Society&quot; was dissolved for political reasons by the Schuschnigg regime.

The murder of Moritz Schlick by the former student Hans Nelböck for political and personal reasons in 1936 set an end to the meetings of the Schlick Circle.

Some members of the circle such as Kraft, Waismann, Zilsel, Menger and Gomperz continued to meet occasionally. But the annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany in 1938 meant the definite end of the activities of the Vienna Circle in Austria.

With the emigration went along the internationalization of logical empiricism. Many former members of the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle emigrated to the English-speaking world where they had an immense influence on the development of philosophy of science. The unity of science movement for the construction of an &quot;International Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot;, promoted mainly by Neurath, Carnap, and Morris, is symptomatic of the internationalization of logical empiricism, organizing numerous international conferences and the publication of the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot;.

=== Overview of the members of the Vienna Circle ===
Apart from the central figures of the Schlick Circle the question of membership in the Vienna Circle is in many cases unsettled. The partition into &quot;members&quot; and &quot;those sympathetic to the Vienna Circle&quot; produced in the manifesto from 1929 is representative only of a specific moment in the development of the Circle. Depending on the criteria used (regular attendance, philosophical affinities etc.) there are different possible distributions in &quot;inner circle&quot; and &quot;periphery&quot;.

In the following list (in alphabetical order), the &quot;inner circle&quot; is defined using the criterion of regular attendance.

===Reception in the United States and the United Kingdom===
The spread of logical positivism in the United States occurred throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929 and in 1932, Schlick was a visiting professor at Stanford, while Feigl, who immigrated to the United States in 1930, became lecturer (1931) and professor (1933) at the University of Iowa. The definite diffusion of logical positivism in the United States was due to Carl Hempel, Hans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, and Herbert Feigl, who emigrated and taught in the United States.

Another link to the United States is Willard Van Orman Quine, who traveled in 1932 and 1933 as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow to Vienna, Prague, and Warsaw. Moreover, American semiotician and philosopher Charles W. Morris helped many German and Austrian philosophers emigrate to the United States, including Rudolf Carnap, in 1936.

In the United Kingdom it was Alfred Jules Ayer who acquainted the British academia with the work of the Vienna Circle with his book &quot;Language, Truth, and Logic&quot; (1936). Karl Popper was also important for the reception and critique of their work, even though he never participated in the meetings of the Vienna Circle.

==Congresses and publications==

The Vienna Circle was very active in advertising their new philosophical ideas. Several congresses on epistemology and philosophy of science were organized, with the help of the Berlin Circle. There were some preparatory congresses: Prague (1929), Königsberg (1930), Prague (1934) and then the first congress on scientific philosophy held in Paris (1935), followed by congresses in Copenhagen (1936), Paris (1937), Cambridge, UK (1938), Cambridge, Massachusetts. (1939). The Königsberg congress (1930) was very important, for Kurt Gödel announced that he had proven the completeness of first-order logic and the incompleteness of formal arithmetic. Another very interesting congress was the one held in Copenhagen (1936), which was dedicated to quantum physics and causality.

Between 1928 and 1937, the Vienna Circle published ten books in a collection named &quot;Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung&quot; (&quot;Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception&quot;), edited by Schlick and Frank. Karl Raimund Popper&#x27;s book &quot;Logik der Forschung&quot; was published in this collection. Seven works were published in another collection, called &quot;Einheitswissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Unified Science&quot;). In 1930 Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach undertook the editorship of the journal &quot;Erkenntnis&quot;, which was published between 1930 and 1940 (from 1939 the editors were Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris).

==Topics and debates==
The Vienna Circle cannot be assigned &quot;one&quot; single philosophy. First, there existed a plurality of philosophical positions within the Circle, and second, members often changed their views fundamentally in the course of time and in reaction to discussions in the Circle. It thus seems more convenient to speak of &quot;the philosophies (in the plural) of the Vienna Circle&quot;.

However, some central topics and debates can be identified.

===The Manifesto (1929)===
This states the scientific world-conception of the Vienna Circle, which is characterized &quot;essentially by two features. First it is empiricist and positivist: there is knowledge only from experience. Second, the scientific world-conception is marked by the application of a certain method, namely logical analysis.&quot;

Logical analysis is the method of clarification of philosophical problems; it makes an extensive use of symbolic logic and distinguishes the Vienna Circle empiricism from earlier versions. The task of philosophy lies in the clarification—through the method of logical analysis—of problems and assertions.

Logical analysis shows that there are two different kinds of statements; one kind includes statements reducible to simpler statements about the empirically given; the other kind includes statements which cannot be reduced to statements about experience and thus they are devoid of meaning. Metaphysical statements belong to this second kind and therefore they are meaningless. Hence many philosophical problems are rejected as pseudo-problems which arise from logical mistakes, while others are re-interpreted as empirical statements and thus become the subject of scientific inquiries.

One source of the logical mistakes that are at the origins of metaphysics is the ambiguity of natural language. &quot;Ordinary language for instance uses the same part of speech, the substantive, for things (&#x27;apple&#x27;) as well as for qualities (&#x27;hardness&#x27;), relations (&#x27;friendship&#x27;), and processes (&#x27;sleep&#x27;); therefore it misleads one into a thing-like conception of functional concepts&quot;. Another source of mistakes is &quot;the notion that &quot;thinking&quot; can either lead to knowledge out of its own resources without using any empirical material, or at least arrive at new contents by an inference from given states of affair&quot;. Synthetic knowledge a priori is rejected by the Vienna Circle. Mathematics, which at a first sight seems an example of necessarily valid synthetic knowledge derived from pure reason alone, has instead a tautological character, that is its statements are analytical statements, thus very different from Kantian synthetic statements. The only two kinds of statements accepted by the Vienna Circle are synthetic statements &quot;a posteriori&quot; (i.e., scientific statements) and analytic statements &quot;a priori&quot; (i.e., logical and mathematical statements).

However, the persistence of metaphysics is connected not only with logical mistakes but also with &quot;social and economical struggles&quot;. Metaphysics and theology are allied to traditional social forms, while the group of people who &quot;faces modern times, rejects these views and takes its stand on the ground of empirical sciences&quot;. Thus the struggle between metaphysics and scientific world-conception is not only a struggle between different kinds of philosophies, but it is also—and perhaps primarily—a struggle between different political, social, and economical attitudes. Of course, as the manifesto itself acknowledged, &quot;not every adherent of the scientific world-conception will be a fighter&quot;. Many historians of the Vienna Circle see in the latter sentence an implicit reference to a contrast between the so-called &#x27;left wing&#x27; of the Vienna Circle, mainly represented by Neurath and Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The aim of the left wing was to facilitate the penetration of the scientific world-conception in &quot;the forms of personal and public life, in education, upbringing, architecture, and the shaping of economic and social life&quot;. In contrast, Schlick was primarily interested in the theoretical study of science and philosophy. Perhaps the sentence &quot;Some, glad of solitude, will lead a withdrawn existence on the icy slopes of logic&quot; is an ironic reference to Schlick.

The manifesto lists Walter Dubislav, Josef Frank, Kurt Grelling, Hasso Härlen, Eino Kaila, Heinrich Loewy, F. P. Ramsey, Hans Reichenbach, Kurt Reidemeister, and Edgar Zilsel as people &quot;sympathetic to the Vienna Circle&quot; and Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein as &quot;leading representatives of the scientific world-conception&quot;.

===Unified science===

The final goal pursued by the Vienna Circle was unified science, that is the construction of a &quot;constitutive system&quot; in which every legitimate statement is reduced to the concepts of lower level which refer directly to the given experience. &quot;The endeavour is to link and harmonise the achievements of individual investigators in their various fields of science&quot;. From this aim follows the search for clarity, neatness, and for a symbolic language that eliminates the problems arising from the ambiguity of natural language. The Vienna Circle published a collection, called &quot;Einheitswissenschaft&quot; (&quot;Unified Science&quot;), edited by Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, Jørgen Jørgensen (after Hahn&#x27;s death) and Charles W. Morris (from 1938), whose aim was to present a unified vision of science. After the publication in Europe of seven monographs from 1933 to 1939, the collection was dismissed, because of the problems arising from the World War II. In 1938 a new series of publications started in the United States. It was the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot;, an ambitious project never completed devoted to unified science. Only the first section &quot;Foundations of the Unity of Sciences&quot; was published; it contains two volumes for a total of twenty monographs published from 1938 to 1969. As remembered by Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris in the &quot;Preface&quot; to the 1969 edition of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science:

Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s well known work, &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, was published in this Encyclopedia in 1962, as the number two in the second volume.

===Critique of metaphysics===
The attitude of Vienna Circle towards metaphysics is well expressed by Carnap in the article &#x27;Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache&#x27; in &quot;Erkenntnis&quot;, vol. 2, 1932 (English translation &#x27;The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language&#x27; in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed., &quot;Logical empiricism at its peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath&quot;, New York : Garland Pub., 1996, pp. 10–31). A language—says Carnap—consists of a vocabulary, i.e., a set of meaningful words, and a syntax, i.e., a set of rules governing the formation of sentences from the words of the vocabulary. Pseudo-statements, i.e., sequences of words that at first sight resemble statements but in reality have no meaning, are formed in two ways: either meaningless words occur in them, or they are formed in an invalid syntactical way. According to Carnap, pseudo-statements of both kinds occur in metaphysics.

A word &quot;W&quot; has a meaning if two conditions are satisfied. First, the mode of the occurrence of &quot;W&quot; in its elementary sentence form (i.e., the simplest sentence form in which &quot;W&quot; is capable of occurring) must be fixed. Secondly, if &quot;W&quot; occurs in an elementary sentence &quot;S&quot;, it is necessary to give an answer to the following questions (that are—according to Carnap—equivalent formulation of the same question):
* What sentences is &quot;S&quot; deducible from, and what sentences are deducible from &quot;S&quot;?
* Under what conditions is &quot;S&quot; supposed to be true, and under what conditions false?
* How is &quot;S&quot; verified?
* What is the meaning of &quot;S&quot;?
(Carnap, &quot;The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language&quot; in Sarkar, Sahotra 1996, p. 12)

An example offered by Carnap concerns the word &#x27;arthropod&#x27;. The sentence form &quot;the thing &quot;x&quot; is an arthropod&quot; is an elementary sentence form that is derivable from &quot;&quot;x&quot; is an animal&quot;, &quot;&quot;x&quot; has a segmented body&quot; and &quot;&quot;x&quot; has jointed legs&quot;. Conversely, these sentences are derivable from &quot;the thing &quot;x&quot; is an arthropod&quot;. Thus the meaning of the word &#x27;arthropod&#x27; is determined.

According to Carnap, many words of metaphysics do not fulfill these requirements and thus they are meaningless. As an example, Carnap considers the word &#x27;principle&#x27;. This word has a definite meaning, if the sentence &quot;&quot;x&quot; is the principle of &quot;y&quot; is supposed to be equivalent to the sentence &quot;y&quot; exists by virtue of &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; arises out of &quot;x&quot;. The latter sentence is perfectly clear: &quot;y&quot; arises out of &quot;x&quot; when &quot;x&quot; is invariably followed by &quot;y&quot;, and the invariable association between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is empirically verifiable. But—says Carnap—metaphysicians are not satisfied with this interpretation of the meaning of &#x27;principle&#x27;. They assert that no empirical relation between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; can completely explain the meaning of &quot;x&quot; is the principle of &quot;y&quot;&quot;, because there is something that cannot be grasped by means of the experience, something for which no empirical criterion can be specified. It is the lacking of any empirical criterion—says Carnap—that deprives of meaning the word &#x27;principle&#x27; when it occurs in metaphysics. Therefore, metaphysical pseudo-statements such as &quot;water is the principle of the world&quot; or &quot;the spirit is the principle of the world&quot; are void of meaning because a meaningless word occurs in them.

However, there are pseudo-statements in which occur only meaningful words; these pseudo-statements are formed in a counter-syntactical way. An example is the word sequence &quot;Caesar is a prime number&quot;; every word has a definite meaning, but the sequence has no meaning. The problem is that &quot;prime number&quot; is a predicate of numbers, not a predicate of human beings. In the example the nonsense is evident; however, in natural language the rules of grammar do not prohibit the formation of analogous meaningless word sequences that are not so easily detectable. In the grammar of natural languages, every sequence of the kind &quot;&quot;x&quot; is &quot;y&quot;&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is a noun and &quot;y&quot; is a predicate, is acceptable. In fact, in the grammar there is no distinction between predicate which can be affirmed of human beings and predicate which can be affirmed of numbers. So &quot;Caesar is a general&quot; and &quot;Caesar is a prime number&quot; are both well-formed, in contrast for example with &quot;Caesar is and&quot;, which is ill-formed. In a logically constructed language—says Carnap—a distinction between the various kinds of predicate is specified, and pseudo-statements as &quot;Caesar is a prime number&quot; are ill-formed. Now, and this is the main point of Carnap&#x27;s argument, metaphysical statements in which meaningless words do not occur, are indeed meaningless because they are formed in a way which is admissible in natural languages, but not in logically constructed languages. Carnap attempts to indicate the most frequent sources of errors from which metaphysical pseudo-statements can arise. One source of mistakes is the ambiguity of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, which is sometimes used as a copula (&quot;I am hungry&quot;), and sometimes to designate existence (&quot;I am&quot;). The latter statement incorrectly suggests a predicative form, and thus it suggests that existence is a predicate. Only modern logic, with the introduction of an explicit sign to designate existence (the sign formula_1), which occurs only in statements such as formula_2, never as a predicate, has shown that existence is not a predicate, and thus has revealed the logical error from which pseudo-statements such as &quot;cogito, ergo sum&quot; has arisen.

Another source of mistakes is type confusions, in which a predicate of a kind is used as a predicate of another kind. For example, the pseudo-statements &quot;we know the Nothing&quot; is analogous to &quot;we know the rain&quot;, but while the latter is well-formed, the former is ill-formed, at least in a logically constructed language, because &quot;Nothing&quot; is incorrectly used as a noun. In a formal language, &quot;Nothing&quot; only means formula_3, such as &quot;there is nothing which is outside&quot;—i.e., formula_4, and thus &quot;Nothing&quot; never occurs as a noun or as a predicate.

According to Carnap, although metaphysics has no theoretical content, it does have content: metaphysical pseudo-statements express the attitude of a person towards life, and this is the role of metaphysics. He compares it to an art like lyrical poetry; the metaphysician works with the medium of the theoretical; he confuses art with science, attitude towards life with knowledge, and thus produces an unsatisfactory and inadequate work. &quot;Metaphysicians are musicians without musical ability&quot;.

==Institute Vienna Circle / Vienna Circle Society ==
In 1991 the Institute Vienna Circle (IVC) was established as a society in Vienna. It is dedicated to studying the work and influence of the Vienna Circle. In 2011 it was integrated in the University of Vienna as a subunit of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education. Since 2016 the former society continues its activities in close cooperation with the IVC under the changed name Vienna Circle Society (VCS). In 2015 the institute co-organized an exhibition on the Vienna Circle in the main building of the University of Vienna.

<text>Unsolved Mysteries is an American mystery documentary television series, created by John Cosgrove and Terry Dunn Meurer. Documenting cold cases and paranormal phenomena, it began as a series of seven specials, presented by Raymond Burr, Karl Malden, and Robert Stack, beginning on NBC on January 20, 1987, becoming a full-fledged series on October 5, 1988, hosted by Stack. After nine seasons on NBC, the series moved to CBS for its 10th season on November 13, 1997. After adding Virginia Madsen as a co-host during season 11 failed to boost slipping ratings, CBS canceled the series after only a two-season, 12-episode run on June 11, 1999. The series was revived by Lifetime in 2000, with season 12 beginning on July 2, 2001. &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; aired 103 episodes on Lifetime, before ending on September 20, 2002, an end that coincided with Stack&#x27;s illness and eventual death.

After a six-year absence, the series was resurrected by Spike in 2007, and began airing on October 13, 2008. This new, revived version was hosted by Dennis Farina, who mainly tied together repackaged segments from the original episodes. Farina hosted 175 episodes before the series ended again on April 27, 2010. Cosgrove-Meurer Productions maintains a website for the show, featuring popular accounts and ongoing cold cases (murder or missing persons), with a link to an online form should a viewer have information on an unsolved crime. As of 2017, the show maintains a YouTube page where viewers can submit their own mysteries. If accepted, &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; posts a video of the viewer describing the mystery. That same year, FilmRise acquired worldwide digital distribution rights to the series and announced its intent to release updated versions of its episodes. These shows are currently streaming on Amazon Prime, Tubi TV, and on its own dedicated channel on Pluto TV in the United States and the United Kingdom. Since February 2017, the Spike episodes have been officially posted on YouTube, split into eight seasons. In July 2017, the series began streaming on Hulu in the United States. Between February and March 2019, FilmRise began posting digitally restored and re-edited episodes, hosted by Stack, on YouTube.

On June 22, 2018, Terror Vision Records released the official soundtrack for the series. In 2017, the show&#x27;s creators expressed interest in reviving the series. On January 18, 2019, Netflix picked up a reboot of the series which premiered on July 1, 2020. The first season of the reboot was split into two volumes containing six episodes each. In September 2022, Netflix announced that a third volume of new episodes would begin streaming in October 2022. In February 2024, it was announced that a fourth volume would begin streaming in 2024. It was confirmed that the fourth volume would begin streaming in July 2024. A fifth volume, consisting of four episodes, was announced on July 31, 2024. It began streaming in October the same year.

==Overview==

&quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; used a documentary format to profile real-life mysteries and featured re-enactments of unsolved crimes, missing persons cases, conspiracy theories and unexplained paranormal phenomena (alien abductions, ghosts, UFOs, and &quot;secret history&quot; theories).

The concept was created in a series of three specials produced by John Cosgrove and Terry-Dunn Meurer, which were pitched to NBC in 1985 and shown in 1986 with the title, &quot;Missing... Have You Seen This Person?&quot; The success of the specials led Cosgrove and Meurer to broaden the series to include mysteries of all kinds.

The pilot of what eventually became &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; was a special that aired on NBC on January 20, 1987, with Raymond Burr as host/narrator. Throughout the 1987–88 television season, six more specials aired, the first two hosted by Karl Malden and the final four by Robert Stack. Because of the incorporation of paranormal mysteries, NBC News disowned the series when it aired on the network and required that a disclaimer aired before each show clarify that it was &quot;not a news broadcast.&quot;

In 1988, the show debuted as a weekly program on NBC. Ratings steadily dropped after the 1993–94 season. Until 2002, it was hosted by Stack. In its second season on CBS in 1999, Stack was joined by co-host Virginia Madsen. Episodes released between 1995 and 1997 featured journalist Keely Shaye Smith and television host Lu Hanessian as correspondents in the show&#x27;s &quot;phone center&quot;, where they provided updates on previous stories as information for &quot;special bulletin&quot; segments. A March 14, 1997, episode featured journalist Cathy Scott in the reenactment of rapper Tupac Shakur&#x27;s 1996 unsolved murder. This broadcast was one week after the murder of Biggie Smalls. In 2002, the series was canceled by Lifetime. In 2008, television network Spike revived the series with Dennis Farina as its host; the Spike revival ended in 2010.

The show was known for its eerie theme song composed by Michael Boyd and Gary Remal Malkin, and for Stack&#x27;s grim presence and ominous narration. The theme music was changed seven times, in 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2008, and 2020. The 2020 version of the theme was arranged, performed, and recorded by West Dylan Thordson.

== Updates ==
Viewers were occasionally given updates on success stories, where suspects were brought to justice and loved ones were reunited.

The show itself has been credited for bringing increased attention to certain cases and thus allowing them to be solved. One episode featured a video of an arsonist filming an unidentified house being burned down while he was giving strange commentary. Once it had been featured on the show, viewers were able to identify the house involved, and two suspects were arrested.

==Broadcast history==
===NBC (1987–1997)===
The show first aired on NBC from 1987 to 1997. The pilot episode was hosted by actor Raymond Burr. Karl Malden and Robert Stack were also hired to host further specials. When the series became a full-fledged television program in 1988, Stack became the full-time host. &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; was also one of the few prime-time shows of its era to appeal to fans of the supernatural and used effective special effects to enhance tales of the unexplained.
In 1992, NBC aired a short-lived dramatized court show spin-off program called &quot;Final Appeal: From the Files of Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, also hosted by Stack. The premise of this program was to try to give the unjustly accused a final appeal for help, with the debut episode taking an in-depth look at the Jeffrey MacDonald case. The program was canceled after only a few episodes due to poor ratings.

===CBS (1997–1999)===
The ratings for &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; had been steadily declining ever since it was moved from its original Wednesday evening timeslot to Friday evenings in the fall of 1994. At the end of the 1996–97 season, it was canceled by NBC. Upon the cancelation from NBC, CBS picked up the series for a tenth season. The first episode aired in November 1997 as an &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; special. When CBS canceled its Block Party line-up in the spring of 1998, the network moved the show to its Friday 9:00 pm timeslot. During the show&#x27;s run on CBS, the series was limited to only six-episode seasons, and was airing only on a sporadic schedule. Reruns aired during the summer of 1998 with heavy promotion of the return of the NFL on CBS with the upcoming 1998 NFL season. When the series returned for its abbreviated 11th season in the spring of 1999, Stack was joined by actress Virginia Madsen for hosting duties in an attempt to boost its female audience. The effort failed, and CBS canceled the show soon afterwards. Later cable reruns of segments originally narrated by Madsen were re-dubbed with Stack&#x27;s voice.

===Lifetime (2001–2002)===
Lifetime Television, which had been airing re-runs of the NBC episodes since the early 1990s, had ordered a two-season run of new episodes which began airing in 2001. Consisting of a mixture of new and old cases, these episodes were produced between 2001 and 2002, and usually aired on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. The program ceased producing new episodes when Stack was diagnosed with prostate cancer in late 2002. He died of heart failure in May 2003.

After Stack&#x27;s death, old episodes continued to run in syndication on several television networks in the U.S., Canada, and Australia.
During some shows, callers gave tips to the telecenter. When the show was in active production, the toll free number was displayed on the bottom of the screen below the title logo at the end of each segment. When the show left active production following Stack&#x27;s death and went into reruns, the number was removed and replaced with a P.O. box address.

===Spike TV (2008–2010)===
According to &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot;, in 2007, HBO Distribution announced plans to bring back &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; when the cable channel Lifetime&#x27;s contract expired in 2008. The show featured a new set, a new logo, new music, and updates on old cases. In addition, actor Dennis Farina became the new host, as Stack had died five years earlier. The show debuted on Spike on October 13, 2008.

This repackaged series run was criticized by fans for its presentation of past cases only, with no new case segments being produced. The existing segments were also edited to be shorter so the show could be expanded to present five cases in an hour rather than the four of the original series. Because the majority of the cases were now between 20 and 40 years old, the re-edited segments usually did not reference the years in which the events presented originally occurred. When updates for solved cases aired, Dennis Farina&#x27;s voiceover would refer to cases &quot;in a recent broadcast...&quot;, when the case may have already been solved during the show&#x27;s original run or during the series&#x27; hiatus from 2002 onward. &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; ended its run on Spike on April 27, 2010.

===Netflix (2020–present)===
A 12-part reboot was announced by &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; on January 18, 2019. The series is being &quot;refreshed&quot; by &quot;Stranger Things&quot; executive producer Shawn Levy and his company 21 Laps Entertainment along with Cosgrove-Meurer Productions and Netflix. Cosgrove and Meurer are showrunners for the series, with Levy and Josh Barry being executive producers. Robert Wise is a co-executive producer, along with showrunner Dunn Meurer. Each episode focuses on a single mystery. Cosgrove stated that the reboot would be &quot;pure documentary style&quot; and would have no host or narrator; however, an image of longtime host Robert Stack can be seen in the title sequence for each episode as an homage to his impact on the show. The first six episodes of the new season became available to stream starting July 1, 2020. In August 2020, it was reported that 13.7% of subscribers had watched the series over its first month. On September 1, 2021, Netflix formally announced that it had ordered an additional season of the series set to launch in the summer of 2022. On September 6, 2022, Netflix announced a third volume of nine new episodes, billed as a &quot;three-night event&quot;, would begin streaming October 18, October 25, and November 1, 2022. Netflix announced in February 2024 that a fourth volume of episodes would air sometime that same year. On June 20, 2024, it was announced that the fourth volume would begin streaming on July 31, 2024. A fifth volume consisting of 4 episodes premiered in October 2024.

<doc id="225878" wikidata="Q547247" url="?curid=225878" title="Operation Rolling Thunder">
<text>Operation Rolling Thunder was a gradual and sustained aerial bombardment campaign conducted by the United States (U.S.) 2nd Air Division (later Seventh Air Force), U.S. Navy, and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) against North Vietnam, China and North Korea from 2 March 1965 until 2 November 1968, during the Vietnam War.

The four objectives of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost the morale of South Vietnam; to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without sending ground forces into communist North Vietnam; to destroy North Vietnam&#x27;s transportation system, industrial base, and air defenses; and to halt the flow of men and materiel into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies, and the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People&#x27;s Republic of China and North Korea.

The operation became the most intense air/ground battle waged during the Cold War period; it was the most difficult such campaign fought by the United States since the aerial bombardment of Germany during World War II. Supported by its communist allies, North Vietnam fielded a potent mixture of MiG fighter-interceptor jets and sophisticated air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons that created one of the most effective air defenses ever faced by American military aviators. The limited effectiveness of the operation and the pursuit of peace talks led to the scaling back of the operation in March 1968 and its cancellation in November 1968.

==Gradually escalating action==
===Background===
In response to President Ngo Dinh Diem&#x27;s abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists during the late 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and materiel to the Vietcong (VC), who were fighting an insurgency to topple the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the VC and to shore up the government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.

U.S. policy was for a time dictated by its perception of improvement in the Saigon government. No further commitment by the Americans would occur without tangible proof of the regime&#x27;s survivability. Events in South Vietnam, however, outpaced this plan. By the beginning of 1965, the policy was reversed in the belief that without further American action the Saigon government could not survive. As late as 8 February, however, in a cable to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Maxwell Taylor, Johnson stressed that the paramount goal of a bombing campaign would be to boost Saigon&#x27;s morale, not to influence Hanoi, expressing hope &quot;that the building of a minimum government will benefit by ... assurances from us to the highest levels [of the South Vietnamese government] that we ... intend to take continuing action.&quot;

Questions then arose among the U.S. administration and military leadership as to the best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie in the application of air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff&#x27;s collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, China, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi&#x27;s will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime&#x27;s behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.

In August 1964, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, in which U.S. naval vessels were attacked by North Vietnamese patrol boats, Johnson ordered retaliatory air strikes (Operation Pierce Arrow) launched against the north. This did not, however, satisfy the military chiefs, who demanded a wider and more aggressive campaign.

===Implementation===
In March 1964 the Commander in Chief Pacific (CINCPAC) began developing plans for a sustained eight-week air campaign designed to escalate in three stages. This was published at the end of August as CINCPAC OPLAN 37–64, which included the &quot;94 target list&quot;. Bridges, rail yards, docks, barracks and supply dumps were all targeted, and selected based on a criterion system considering:

There was widespread concern that an air campaign could lead to a wider conflict involving the Chinese or Soviets. Westmoreland referred to &quot;an almost paranoid fear of nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union&quot; and a &quot;phobia&quot; that the Chinese would invade. Johnson later noted:

For a time, no overt action was taken, and the plans continued to evolve. A further refinement of the plan was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters came to a head with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men&#x27;s billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam&#x27;s ground forces and supply dumps were located.

These actions led to the plans for a sustained air campaign being reconsidered. On 13 February a new plan was approved and given the name &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, merging targets and priorities from the lists produced by the Bundys and the JCS. This campaign was not aimed at specific actions on the part of the North Vietnamese, but was intended as a larger response to the growing hostilities as a whole. Although some within the administration believed that the campaign would be costly, and that it might not work, they reasoned that it was &quot;an acceptable risk, especially when considered against the alternative of introducing American combat troops.&quot; &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; called for an eight-week air campaign consistent with the restrictions imposed by that Johnson and Secretary of Defense McNamara. If the insurgency continued &quot;with DRV support, strikes against the DRV would be extended with intensified efforts against targets north of the 19th parallel.&quot;

It was believed that selective pressure, controlled by Washington, combined with diplomatic overtures, would prevail and compel Hanoi to end its aggression. The military was still not satisfied, since, for the time being, the bombing campaign was to be limited to targets below the 19th parallel, each of which would have to be cleared individually by the President and McNamara.

The first mission of the new operation was launched on 2 March against an ammunition storage area near Xom Bang carried out by a strike package of 104 US aircraft containing B-57s, F-105s, and F-100s. On the same day, 19 RVNAF A-1 Skyraiders struck the Quang Khe Naval Base. The Americans were shocked when six of their aircraft were shot down during the mission. Five of the downed crewmen were rescued, but it was a portent of things to come.

==Over the north==

===Strategic persuasion===
Under the doctrine of &quot;gradualism&quot;, in which threatening destruction would serve as a more influential signal of American determination than destruction itself, it was thought better to hold important targets &quot;hostage&quot; by bombing trivial ones. From the beginning of Rolling Thunder, Washington dictated which targets would be struck, the day and hour of the attack, the number, and types of aircraft and the tonnages and types of ordnance utilized, and sometimes even the direction of the attack. Airstrikes were strictly forbidden within of Hanoi and within of the port of Haiphong. A thirty-mile buffer zone also extended along the length of the Chinese frontier. According to U.S. Air Force historian Earl Tilford:

Targeting bore little resemblance to reality in that the sequence of attacks was uncoordinated and the targets were approved randomly—even illogically. The North&#x27;s airfields, which, according to any rational targeting policy, should have been hit first in the campaign, were also off-limits.

Although some of these restrictions were later loosened or rescinded, Johnson (with McNamara&#x27;s support) kept a tight rein on the campaign, which continuously infuriated the American military commanders, right-wing members of Congress, and even some within the administration itself. One of the primary objectives of the operation, at least to the military, should have been the closure of Haiphong and other ports by aerial mining, thereby slowing or halting the flow of seaborne supplies entering the north. Johnson refused to take such a provocative action, however, and such an operation was not implemented until 1972. There was also little consultation between Johnson and the military chiefs during the target selection process. Even the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Earle Wheeler, was not present for most of the critical discussions of 1965 and participated only occasionally thereafter.

The majority of strikes during Rolling Thunder were launched from four air bases in Thailand: Korat, Takhli, Udorn, and Ubon. The aircraft refueled from aerial tankers over Laos before flying on to their targets in the DRV. After attacking their targets (usually by dive-bombing) the strike forces would either fly directly back to Thailand or exit over the relatively safe waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. It was quickly decided that, in order to limit airspace conflicts between air force and naval strike forces, North Vietnam was divided into six target regions called &quot;route packages&quot;, each of which was assigned to either the Air Force or Navy and into which the other was forbidden to intrude.

Naval strikes were launched from the aircraft carriers of Task Force 77, cruising off the North Vietnamese coast at Yankee Station. Naval aircraft, which had shorter ranges (and carried lighter bomb loads) than their air force counterparts, approached their targets from seaward with the majority of their strikes flown against coastal targets.

On 3 April the Joint Chiefs persuaded McNamara and Johnson to launch a four-week attack on North Vietnam&#x27;s lines of communication, which would isolate the country from its overland sources of supply in China and the Soviet Union. About one-third of the North&#x27;s imports came down the Hanoi–Lào Cai railway from China, while the remaining two-thirds came by sea through Haiphong and other ports. For the first time in the campaign, targets were to be chosen for their military, rather than their psychological, significance. During the four weeks, 26 bridges and seven ferries were destroyed. Other targets included the extensive North Vietnamese radar system, barracks, and ammunition depots.

The panhandle of southern North Vietnam remained the primary focus of operations, and total sorties flown there rose from 3,600 in April to 4,000 in May. Slowly moving away from the destruction of fixed targets, &quot;armed reconnaissance&quot; missions, in which small formations of aircraft patrolled highways, railroads, and rivers, searching for targets of opportunity, were authorized. These missions increased from two to 200 sorties per week by the end of 1965. Eventually, armed reconnaissance missions constituted 75 percent of the total bombing effort, in part because the system through which fixed targets were requested, selected, and authorized was so complicated and unwieldy.

===Changing priorities and POL strikes===
If Rolling Thunder was supposed to &quot;send signals&quot; to Hanoi to desist in its actions, it did not seem to be working. On 8 April, responding to requests for peace negotiations, North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong stated that they could only begin when: the bombing was halted; the U.S. had removed all of its troops from the south; the Saigon government recognized the demands of the VC, and it was agreed that the reunification of Vietnam would be settled by the Vietnamese themselves.

As part of a large attack on the Thanh Hóa Bridge on 3 April, the VPAF first appeared as two flights of four Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17s launched from Noi Bai airbase and shot down an F-8 Crusader, while losing just one of their own aircraft, written off when it landed on a river bed after running short of fuel. A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.

The entire complexion of the American effort was altered on 8 March 1965, when 3,500 U.S. Marines came ashore at Da Nang, ostensibly to defend Da Nang Air Base which was committed to prosecuting Rolling Thunder. The mission of the ground forces was expanded to combat operations, and the aerial campaign became a secondary operation, overwhelmed by troop deployments and the escalation of ground operations in South Vietnam. Until the third week of April, Rolling Thunder had enjoyed at least equal status with air missions conducted in the south. After that time, strikes that interfered with requirements for the southern battlefield were either cut back or canceled.

On 5 April 1965, U.S. reconnaissance discovered that the construction of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile (SAM) launching sites. Washington refused to allow the Air Force and Navy to attack the sites since most were near the restricted urban areas. Then, on 24 July, an McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was shot down by a SA-2 Guideline missile. Three days later, a one-time strike was authorized against two missile sites. The sites were traps with dummies defended by anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Six strike aircraft were destroyed, with two pilots killed, one missing, two captured, and one rescued. A U.S. pilot described the action as &quot;looking like the end of the world.&quot;

On 29 June 1965, airstrikes against the North&#x27;s petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) storage areas were authorized by Johnson. The American military had advocated such strikes since the inception of the operation, believing that to deny North Vietnam its POL would cause its military effort to grind to a halt. At first, the strikes appeared highly successful, destroying tank farms near Hanoi and Haiphong and leading the CIA to estimate that 70 percent of North Vietnam&#x27;s oil facilities had been destroyed for the loss of 43 aircraft. The loss of the oil storage tank farms and refineries proved to be only a short-term inconvenience for North Vietnam, however, since Hanoi had anticipated just such a campaign and had during that time dispersed the majority of its POL stocks in drums across the length of the country. The POL attacks were halted on 4 September, after U.S. intelligence admitted that there was &quot;no evidence yet of any shortages of POL in North Vietnam.&quot;

By 24 December 1965, 180 U.S. aircraft had been lost during the campaign (85 Air Force, 94 Navy and one Marine Corps). Eight RVNAF aircraft had also been lost. Air Force aircrews had flown 25,971 sorties and dropped 32,063 tons of bombs. Naval aviators had flown 28,168 sorties and dropped 11,144 tons. The RVNAF had contributed 682 missions with unknown ordnance tonnages.

===Problems===
Rolling Thunder exposed many problems within the American military services committed to it and tended to exacerbate others. A key interservice issue (and one which was not solved until 1968) was the command and control arrangement in Southeast Asia. The USAF&#x27;s 2nd Air Division (replaced by the Seventh Air Force on 1 April 1966) was ostensibly responsible for aerial operations over North and South Vietnam. It was subordinate, however, to MACV and its commander, U.S. Army General William C. Westmoreland, who tended to see his problems centered in the south. The U.S. Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force, based in Thailand (which carried out the majority of the Air Force&#x27;s strikes in North Vietnam), had a dual command structure. It reported to the Seventh on operational matters and to the Thirteenth Air Force (whose headquarters was in the Philippines) for logistical and administrative concerns. These command and control complexities grew even more tangled with the division of the aerial effort into four competing operational areas (those in South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and Laos (both north and south).

The Navy&#x27;s Task Force 77 took its orders via 7th Fleet from CINCPAC, a Navy admiral based in Honolulu, through his subordinate, the Air Force commander of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). Due to their influence, the Navy could not be persuaded to integrate its air operations over North Vietnam with those of the Air Force. General William W. Momyer, commander of the Seventh, had the impression that CINCPAC and PACAF wanted to keep the Thai-based aircraft out of his hands. &quot;By denying Momyer, they were really denying Westmoreland and keeping air operations against the DRV under their control.&quot; To complicate matters, the U.S. ambassadors to Thailand (Graham Martin) and Laos (William H. Sullivan) exerted undue influence over operational and command arrangements.

This bizarre command structure went against the grain of the Air Force&#x27;s single air manager concept, which dictated that one commander was to control and coordinate all aircraft within a combat theater. The chain through which operational strike requests had to flow gave some indication of the growing overcomplexity of the campaign. Requests for airstrikes originated with the 2nd Air Division and Task Force 77 in Vietnam and then proceeded to CINCPAC, who in turn reported to his superiors, the Joint Chiefs, at the Pentagon. After input from the State Department and the CIA, the requests then proceeded to the White House, where the president and his &quot;Tuesday Cabinet&quot; made decisions on the strike requests on a weekly basis.

Another problem exposed by Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the operations it was undertaking. Its aircraft had been designed and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union—for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed by the fact that the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.

Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force was again found lacking. The mainstay missiles of the air war turned out to be the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.

The Air Force did possess an aircraft which had an all-weather capability, radar-guided bombing equipment and considerable destructive potential—the B-52 Stratofortress. The civilian administration, however, never considered utilizing the large bombers (whose operations remained under the control of the Strategic Air Command) very far north of the DMZ, believing that it was too overt an escalation. Air Force Chief of Staff John P. McConnell also opposed sending the bombers into the air defense environment in the north and limited B-52 strikes to Route Package One.

Compounding these issues was the one-year rotation policy adopted by the Pentagon in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, the rapidly growing tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack of experienced aircrews. This dilemma was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, had the effect of rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community for the duration of their careers, thereby retaining their expertise, but also incurring greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.

Another factor was the weather within the operational theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns meant that the weather was deplorable for flight operations eight months of the year (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.

According to American writer Stephen Budiansky, &quot;captured documents showed that the North Vietnamese had at least thirty to forty-five minutes&#x27; warning of 80 to 90 per cent of Rolling Thunder missions.&quot; The North Vietnamese signals intelligence staff of 5,000 &quot;proved adept at exploiting traffic analysis as NSA was. Every U.S. bombing mission was preceded by an upsurge of traffic involving logistics, ordnance loading, weather flights, and aerial refueling tankers, and even if none of the content of the signals was readable, the pattern was a dead giveaway.&quot; Additionally, &quot;nearly all radio communications of the U.S. air operations used unencrypted tactical voice.&quot;

===People&#x27;s War in the Air===
Before Rolling Thunder even began the North Vietnamese leadership knew what was coming. It issued a February 1965 directive to the military and the population to &quot;maintain communication and transportation and to expect the complete destruction of the entire country, including Hanoi and Haiphong.&quot; The communist leadership declared &quot;a people&#x27;s war against the air war of destruction...each citizen is a soldier, each village, street, and plant a fortress on the anti-American battlefront.&quot; All except those deemed &quot;truly indispensable to the life of the capital&quot; were evacuated to the countryside. By 1967, Hanoi&#x27;s population had been reduced by half.

Since gaining air superiority over U.S. forces was out of the question, the northern leadership decided to implement a policy of air deniability. At the beginning of the campaign, North Vietnam possessed approximately 1,500 anti-aircraft weapons, most of which were of the light 37 and 57mm variety. Within one year, however, the U.S. estimated that the number had grown to over 5,000 guns, including 85 and 100mm radar-directed weapons. That estimate was later revised downward from a high of 7,000 in early 1967 to less than a thousand by 1972. Regardless, during Rolling Thunder, 80 percent of U.S. aircraft losses were attributed to anti-aircraft fire.

Backing up the guns were the fighter aircraft of the VPAF, which originally consisted of only 53 MiG-17 fighter aircraft. Though considered antiquated by the Americans when compared to their supersonic jets, the North Vietnamese turned their aircraft&#x27;s weaknesses into strengths. They were fast enough for hit and run ambush operations and they were also maneuverable enough to shock the American fighter community by shooting down more advanced F-8 Crusaders and F-105 Thunderchiefs, which had to quickly develop new tactics. The newer missile-armed F-4 Phantom would become the Americans&#x27; primary dogfighting platform.

The simple appearance of MiGs could often accomplish their mission by causing American pilots to jettison their bomb loads as a defensive measure. In 1966, the MiG-17 were joined by more modern Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s, which could fight on a more equal footing with the American aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force was maintaining an interceptor force of 100 aircraft, many of which were based on Chinese airfields and out of reach of American air attack.

The northern economy was decentralized for its protection, and large factories, located in the heavily populated Red River Delta region, were broken up and scattered into caves and small villages throughout the countryside. In the more heavily bombed southern panhandle, entire villages moved into tunnel complexes for the duration. Food shortages in North Vietnam became widespread, especially in the urban areas, as rice farmers went into the military or volunteered for service repairing bomb damage. When the nation&#x27;s transportation system came under attack, destroyed bridges were repaired or replaced by dirt fords, ferries, and underwater or pontoon bridges. The system proved to be durable, well built, easily repaired, and practically impossible to shut down.

Perhaps North Vietnam&#x27;s ultimate resource was its population. During 1965, 97,000 North Vietnamese civilians volunteered to work full-time in repairing the damage inflicted by U.S. bombs. Another 370,000–500,000 civilians worked part-time. When the nation&#x27;s lines of communication came under attack, railroad supply trains and truck convoys were split into smaller elements which traveled only at night. The logistical effort was supported by citizens on sampans, driving carts, pushing wheelbarrows, or man-portering supplies on their backs to keep the war effort going. They were motivated by slogans like &quot;Each kilogram of goods...is a bullet shot into the head of the American pirates.&quot;

=== China ===

Operation Rolling Thunder prompted the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1965 to accelerate war preparations in major cities, particularly air defense and citizen militia drills. The CCP began emphasizing that, in addition to preparing for the risk of U.S. bombing of China, the Chinese people should be prepared to handle the worst-case scenario of having to fight on Chinese soil.

==Air combat==

===SAMs and Wild Weasels===
Between 1964 and early 1965, U.S. aircraft flew at an altitude of 4−5 kilometers, above the 3 kilometer ceiling of North Vietnamese AAA. On 24 July 1965, four USAF F-4C Phantoms took part in an airstrike against the Dien Bien Phu munitions storage depot and the Lang Chi munitions factory west of Hanoi. One was shot down and three were damaged by SA-2 missiles. This was the first time that U.S. aircraft had been attacked by SAMs.

After two days, President Johnson ordered attacks on all known SA-2 positions, which had also been discovered outside the 30-mile exclusion zone. The strikes, known as Operation Spring High, started on the morning of 27 July and involved 48 F-105s. The Vietnamese anticipated the attacks; the positions were dummies – the &quot;missiles&quot; were white-painted bundles of bamboo – defended by 23 mm and 37 mm AAA. The U.S. had destroyed two false targets; in exchange, six aircraft and five pilots were lost, and over half of the remaining aircraft were damaged.

The U.S. adopted new tactics and increased the use of electronic radar jamming; it estimated SAM effectiveness was one kill in 30 launches at the end of 1966, and one in 50 at the end of 1967. Approaching at low altitude — particularly below cloud cover — allowed pilots to visually detect missile launches and evade while the missile was still relatively slow. Jamming permitted higher approach altitudes, and higher pull-out altitudes after a bombing dive which limited exposure to the heaviest ground fire.

The gradual escalation gave North Vietnam time to develop an air defense system for the Red River Delta with 200 radar facilities coordinating SAMs, AAA, and MiGs. By 1967, North Vietnam had an estimated 150 SAM launchers in 25 battalions, rotating around 150 sites. In 1967, the U.S. lost 248 aircraft (145 Air Force, 102 Navy, and one Marine Corps).

The U.S. responded by reinforcing the large fighter-bomber strikes — known as &quot;force packages&quot; in the Air Force and multi-carrier &quot;Alpha strikes&quot; in the Navy — with support aircraft. The strikes were preceded by &quot;Iron Hand&quot; air defense suppression (SEAD) missions conducted by F-105 Wild Weasel hunter/killer teams. The Wild Weasels carried sensors to detect and locate the emissions associated with SAM guidance and control radars and self-protection electronic countermeasures (ECM). They were armed with the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles, developed by the Navy development, which homed in on active radar; the Shrike had shorter range than the SA-2. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.

Next came the bomb-laden strike aircraft protected by escort fighters (Combat Air Patrol or MIGCAP) and electronic jamming aircraft to degrade enemy radar. New ECM devices had hurriedly been deployed to protect aircraft from missile attacks, but frequently broke down because of climate conditions in Southeast Asia. Additional support came from KC-135 aerial tankers and Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters escorted by A-1 Skyraiders.

The Vietnamese were able to adapt to some of these tactics. The USSR upgraded the SA-2 radar several times to improve ECM resistance. They also introduced a passive guidance mode, whereby the tracking radar could lock on the jamming signal itself and guide missiles directly towards the jamming source. This also meant the SAM site&#x27;s tracking radar could be turned off, which prevented Shrikes from homing in on it. Some new tactics were developed to combat the Shrike. One of them was to point the radar to the side and then turn it off briefly. Since the AGM-45 Shrike was a relatively primitive anti-radiation missile, it would follow the beam away from the radar and then simply crash when it lost the signal (after the radar was turned off). SAM crews could briefly illuminate a hostile aircraft to see if the target was equipped with a Shrike. If the aircraft fired one, the Shrike could be neutralized with the side-pointing technique without sacrificing any SA-2s. Another tactic was a &quot;false launch&quot; in which missile guidance signals were transmitted without a missile being launched. This could distract enemy pilots, or even occasionally cause them to drop ordnance prematurely to lighten their aircraft enough to dodge the nonexistent missile.

At the same time, both the evasion maneuvers were used, and intensive bombardments of the identified SAM firing positions were organized. Under these conditions, measures to observe the regime of camouflage and radio silence became especially important. After the combat launches, the anti-aircraft missile division was to leave the region immediately, otherwise it was destroyed by a bomb-assault strike. Until December 1965, according to American data, eight SA-2s systems were destroyed. However, not infrequently American aircraft fiercely bombed dummy positions that were equipped with fake missiles made of bamboo. Soviet and Vietnamese calculations claimed the destruction of 31 aircraft, the Americans acknowledged the loss of 13 aircraft. According to the memoirs of Soviet advisers, on average before an anti-aircraft missile unit was put out of action it destroyed five to six American aircraft.

From mid-1966 until the end of 1967, President Johnson continued to dole out sensitive targets one by one to the generals while simultaneously trying to placate the doves in Congress and within his own administration with periodic cutbacks and half-hearted peace initiatives. In the end, this erratic course satisfied no one and did little to alter the course of the war.

The nature of the targets and the risks involved in striking (and re-striking) them began to take a toll. Chief of Naval Operations David McDonald reported to his co-chiefs after a trip to South Vietnam in September 1966, that &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; aircrews were angered with the targeting process and that they faulted the campaign due to &quot;guidelines requiring repetitive air programs that seemed more than anything else to benefit enemy gunners.&quot; During 1967, the second full year of &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; operations, 362 U.S. aircraft had been lost over North Vietnam (208 Air Force, 142 Navy, and 12 Marine Corps).

During the war, the Soviet Union delivered 95 SA-2 systems and 7,658 missiles to the Vietnamese. 6,806 missiles were launched, destroyed, or found to be faulty. According to the Vietnamese, the SA-2 shot down 31% of all downed US aircraft. By comparison, air-defense guns brought down 60% and 9% were shot down by MiG fighters. The higher rate of anti-aircraft artillery is partially caused by the fact gun units received data from the S-75 radar stations that significantly improved their effectiveness.

===MiGs and interdiction===
&quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; reached the last stage of its operational evolution during 1967 and 1968. The chief purpose of the American air effort in the higher Route Packages of North Vietnam was slowly transformed into that of interdicting the flow of supplies and materiel and the destruction of those segments of the north&#x27;s infrastructure that supported its military effort.
In 1965, the VPAF had only 36 MiG-17s and a similar number of qualified pilots, which increased to 180 MiGs and 72 pilots by 1968. The Americans have at least 200 USAF F-4s and 140 USAF F-105s, plus at least 100 U.S. Navy aircraft (F-8s, A-4s and F-4s) which operated from the aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin, plus scores of other support aircraft. The Americans had a multiple numerical advantage.

Although most U.S. aircraft losses continued to be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4s increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem because of the lack of radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.

VPAF flew their interceptors with superb guidance from ground controllers, who positioned the MiGs in perfect ambush battle stations. The MiGs made fast and devastating attacks against US formations from several directions (usually the MiG-17s performed head-on attacks and the MiG-21s attacked from the rear). After shooting down a few American planes and forcing some of the F-105s to drop their bombs prematurely, the MiGs did not wait for retaliation, but disengaged rapidly. This &quot;guerrilla warfare in the air&quot; proved very successful. In December 1966 the MiG-21 pilots of the 921st FR downed 14 F-105s without any losses.

While F-105s did score 27 air-to-air victories, the overall exchange ratio was near parity. On 2 January 1967, the Americans sprang a surprise on the MiGs when they launched Operation Bolo. F-4 Phantoms, using the same radio call signs, direction of approach, altitude, and speed as a typical flight of bomb-laden F-105s, lured a group of MiG-21s toward what the MiG pilots thought would be easy prey. The result was seven MiG-21s shot down within 12 minutes for no U.S. losses.

The U.S. Air Force and the US Navy continued to have expectations of the F-4 Phantom, assuming that the massive arms, the perfect on-board radar, the highest speed and acceleration properties, coupled with the new tactics would provide &quot;Phantoms&quot; an advantage over the MiGs. But in encounters with lighter VPAF&#x27;s MiG-21, the F-4 began to suffer defeats. From May to December 1966, the U.S. lost 47 aircraft in air battles, destroying only 12 enemy fighters.

Although the MiG-21 lacked the long-range radar, missiles, and heavy bomb load of its contemporary multi-mission U.S. fighters, with its RP-21 Sapfir radar it proved a challenging adversary in the hands of experienced pilots, especially when used in high-speed hit-and-run attacks under GCI control. MiG-21 intercepts of F-105 strike groups were effective in downing US aircraft or forcing them to jettison their bomb loads.

Later in the year, the U.S. launched its most intense and sustained attempt to force North Vietnam into peace negotiations. Almost all of the targets on the Joint Chiefs&#x27; list had been authorized for attack, including airfields that had been previously off limits. Only central Hanoi, Haiphong, and the Chinese border area remained prohibited from attack. A major effort was made to isolate the urban areas by downing bridges and attacking LOCs. Also struck were the Thai Nguyen steel complex (origin of the Pardo&#x27;s Push), thermal and electrical power plants, ship and rail repair facilities, and warehouses. North Vietnamese MiGs entered the battle &quot;en masse&quot;, as their capital was threatened and kill ratios fell to one U.S. aircraft lost for every two MiGs. During 1968, MiGs accounted for 22 percent of the 184 American aircraft (75 Air Force, 59 Navy, and five Marine Corps) lost over the north. As a result, operations against the last of North Vietnam&#x27;s airfields, previously off-limits to attack, were authorized.

Despite the best interdiction efforts of &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, however, the VC and PAVN launched their largest offensive thus far in the war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military disaster for North Vietnam and the VC, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to risk the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in bad weather—the B-52. Without them, there was little that could be done over the north in response to Tet, since bad weather minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.

==End of the line==

===Opposition===
Writing after the war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 he and other civilians in the administration had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chiefs&#x27; recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They continuously claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude in order to make the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military&#x27;s goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.On 9 August 1967 the Senate Armed Services Committee opened hearings on the bombing campaign. Complaints from the armed services had sparked the interest of some of the most vocal hawks on Capitol Hill. The military chiefs testified before the committee, complaining about the gradual nature of the air war and its civilian-imposed restrictions. It was obvious that McNamara, the only civilian subpoenaed and the last to testify before the committee, was to be the scapegoat. The Secretary of Defense marshaled his objections to an indiscriminate air war and rebutted the charges of the military chiefs. He admitted that there was &quot;no basis to believe that any bombing campaign...would by itself force Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s regime into submission, short, that is, of the virtual annihilation of North Vietnam and its people.&quot;

It had now become clear to Johnson that McNamara had become a liability to the administration. In February 1968, McNamara resigned and was replaced by Clark Clifford, who was chosen because of his personal friendship with Johnson and his previous opposition to McNamara&#x27;s suggestions that the number of troops in the South Vietnam be stabilized and that Rolling Thunder be ended. McNamara&#x27;s position, however, was almost immediately taken up by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, until then an ardent advocate of the bombing campaign. Rusk proposed limiting the campaign to the panhandle of North Vietnam without preconditions and awaiting Hanoi&#x27;s reaction. Within months Clifford too began to adopt the views of the man he had replaced, gradually becoming convinced that the U.S. had to withdraw from an open-ended commitment to the war.

Disappointed by perceived political defeats at home and hoping that Hanoi would enter into negotiations, Johnson announced on 31 March 1968, that all bombing north of the 19th parallel would cease. As a result, the Air Force and Navy began to pour all the firepower they had formerly spread throughout North Vietnam into the area between the 17th and 19th parallels. The Air Force doubled the number of sorties sent into Route Package One to more than 6,000 per month with the campaign concentrated on interdiction &quot;choke points&quot;, road closing, and truck hunting. Once again, the military commanders were faced with a familiar dilemma: having opposed the bombing cutback, they then decided that the new policy had a lot of merit, especially when considering the alternative of no bombing at all. The North Vietnamese responded by doubling the number of anti-aircraft batteries in the panhandle, but most of their SAM batteries remained deployed around Hanoi and Haiphong.

Hanoi, which had continuously stipulated that it would not conduct negotiations while the bombing continued, finally agreed to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, Johnson declared that a complete bombing halt over North Vietnam would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although the bombing halt was to be linked to progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the bombing campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. North Vietnam was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and a half years.

===Conclusions===
Between March 1965 and November 1968, USAF aircraft had flown 153,784 attack sorties against North Vietnam, while the Navy and Marine Corps had added another 152,399. On 31 December 1967, the Department of Defense announced that 864,000 tons of American bombs had been dropped on North Vietnam during Rolling Thunder, compared with 653,000 tons dropped during the entire Korean War and 503,000 tons in the Pacific theater during the Second World War.

The CIA privately estimated that damage inflicted in the north totaled $500 million. They also estimated that by April 1967, 52,000 casualties including 21,000 deaths had occurred as a result of the operation. The CIA estimated that 75 percent of casualties were involved in military or quasi-military operations including civilians working on military and logistical operations. 45 percent of casualties in 1965 were civilians and logistics workers while that figure was 80 percent in 1966. In June 1967, they estimated 19,000 to 26,000 deaths including 13,000 to 17,000 civilian deaths were caused by the bombing. At the end of 1967, the CIA estimated 27,900 military and 48,000 civilians killed and wounded. The US government has estimated that 30,000 civilians were killed in total as a result of the operation.

Due to combat and operational circumstances, 506 USAF, 397 Navy and 19 Marine Corps aircraft were lost over or near North Vietnam. During the operation, of the 745 crewmen shot down, the USAF recorded 145 rescued, 255 killed, 222 captured (23 of whom died in captivity) and 123 missing. Figures on U.S. Navy and Marine Corps casualties were harder to come by. During the 44-month time frame, 454 naval aviators were killed, captured, or missing during combined operations over North Vietnam and Laos.

The number of aircraft lost by the U.S. is unconfirmed since the U.S. figures are also suspect. If a plane was badly damaged but managed to land, the U.S. did not count as a loss, even if it was a write-off.

Rolling Thunder had begun as a campaign of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power well enough to know that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.

Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell prey to the same dysfunctional managerial attitudes as did the rest of the American military effort in Southeast Asia. The process of the campaign became an end unto itself, with sortie generation as the standard by which progress was measured. Sortie rates and the number of bombs dropped, however, equaled efficiency, not effectiveness.

==Legacy==
Studying the outcome of the events in Rolling Thunder, the Air Force and Navy came to very different conclusions on how to adapt. The Air Force noted that most of their air-to-air losses were due to unseen attacks from the rear, and thus the problem could be addressed through additional technology that would provide early warning of such attacks. They began modifying their aircraft with built-in M61 Vulcans for close-in use, adopted the Sidewinder and began upgrading them to improve their performance, and introduced new ground and air-based radars to provide an overall watch over the battlefield. The Navy concluded that the primary problem was that their pilots had not been given proper air combat maneuvering training, and were forced to rely on missiles that were not performing as expected. In 1968 the Navy introduced the TOPGUN program, a move that was welcomed by the F-8 pilots who had been campaigning for this all along.

Which of these two policies was more effective was immediately clear: during Rolling Thunder the US claimed a 3.7:1 kill ratio over the VPAF as a whole, but the Air Force&#x27;s portion of that was closer to 2:1. By 1970 the Navy&#x27;s kill ratio had climbed to 13:1. The Air Force, however, saw its ratio stagnate and actually decrease, for a short time being less than one. More critically, in 1970 the VPAF inflicted a kill on the USAF every three times they tried, while it took six missions to do the same against the Navy, and inversely, the VPAF lost a MiG every two engagements with the Air Force, but every time they engaged the Navy.

From April 1965 to November 1968, in 268 air battles conducted over North Vietnam, VPAF claimed to have shot down 244 US or RVNAF&#x27;s aircraft, and they lost 85 MiGs. During the war, 13 VPAF&#x27;s flying aces attained their status while flying the MiG-21 (compared to three in the MiG-17).

It was not until Operation Linebacker in 1972 that the problem became acute enough for the Air Force to finally take note. In the three months following the start of Linebacker in May 1972, the U.S. lost 48 aircraft, 21 to VPAF MiGs and 27 to improved ground defenses. In the same period, only 31 MiGs killed were claimed by U.S. aircraft and things worsened in the summer with 13 U.S. aircraft lost to MiGs and only 11 MiGs shot down were claimed. General John W. Vogt Jr., commander of the Seventh Air Force, reported to the USAF Chief of Staff that they were losing the air war. One immediate outcome was Operation Teaball, which reorganized the entire operational side of the Air Force&#x27;s early warning systems, and tying them with the Navy&#x27;s, so that every aircraft had a channel providing immediate warning of incoming aircraft. It was not until 1975, however, that the Air Force introduced Exercise Red Flag to match the performance of the Navy&#x27;s TOPGUN.

<text>Gene Sarazen (; born Eugenio Saraceni, February 27, 1902 – May 13, 1999) was an American professional golfer, one of the world&#x27;s top players in the 1920s and 1930s, and the winner of seven major championships. He is one of five players (along with Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods) to win each of the four majors at least once, now known as the Career Grand Slam:
U.S. Open (1922, 1932),
PGA Championship (1922, 1923, 1933),
The Open Championship (1932), and
Masters Tournament (1935).

==Early life==
Eugenio Saraceni was born on February 27, 1902, in Harrison, New York. He was an Italian American as his parents were poor Sicilian immigrants. He began caddying at age ten at local golf clubs, took up golf himself, and gradually developed his skills; Sarazen was essentially self-taught. Somewhat novel at the time, he used the interlocking grip to hold the club.

==Amateur career==
Sarazen has a plaque in his honor placed 195 yards out from the 15th green at Hororata Golf Club where he famously made a double eagle in the final round of sectional qualifiers. He earned his spot in his first United States Open in 1920 at age 18. Some say it was his greatest achievement as an amateur.

==Professional career==
Sarazen took a series of club professional jobs in the New York area from his mid-teens. In 1921, he became a professional at Titusville (Pa.) Country Club, and he contracted to be the professional at Highland Country Club near Pittsburgh in 1922. Sarazen arrived in April, stocked the golf shop and gave a few lessons, but spent most of his time at Oakmont Country Club practicing with Emil Loeffler. At some point, the pair visited Skokie Country Club to practice on the course that would hold the U.S. Open; in July, he came from four shots behind to win the tournament. He returned to Pittsburgh and was feted at the William Penn Hotel, where he burst from a paper mâché golf ball. He did not return to Highland CC, broke his contract and became a &quot;touring&quot; golf professional. Later that summer, he won the PGA Championship at Oakmont.

Sarazen was a contemporary and rival of amateur Bobby Jones, who was born in the same year; he also had many battles with Walter Hagen, who was nine years older. Sarazen, Jones, and Hagen were the world&#x27;s dominant players during the 1920s. Rivalries among the three great champions significantly expanded interest in golf around the world during this period, and made the United States the world&#x27;s dominant golf power for the first time, taking over this position from Great Britain.

The winner of 38 PGA tour events. He played on six U.S. Ryder Cup teams: 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1937.

===Invents modern sand wedge===
Sarazen claimed to have invented the modern sand wedge, and debuted the club (while keeping it secret during preliminary practice rounds) at The Open Championship at Prince&#x27;s Golf Club in 1932 (which he won). He called it the sand iron. The original club he used is no longer on display at Prince&#x27;s as it is worth too much for the insurers to cover. However, a similar club was patented in 1928 by Edwin Kerr McClain, and it is possible Sarazen saw this club.

Sarazen had previously struggled with his sand play and there had been earlier sand-specific clubs. But Bobby Jones&#x27;s sand club, for example, had a face, which actually contacted the ball twice during a swing; this design was later banned. Sarazen&#x27;s innovation was to weld solder onto the lower back of the club, building up the flange so that it sat lower than the leading edge when soled. The flange, not the leading edge, would contact the sand first, and explode sand as the shot was played. The additional weight provided punch to power through the thick sand. Sarazen&#x27;s newly developed technique with the new club was to contact the sand a couple of inches behind the ball, not actually contacting the ball at all on most sand shots.

Every top-class golfer since has utilized this wedge design and technique, and the same club design and method are also used by amateur players around the world. The sand wedge also began to be used by top players for shots from grass, shortly after Sarazen introduced it, and this led to a revolution in short-game techniques, along with lower scoring by players who mastered the skills.

===Masters Tournament win===
Sarazen hit &quot;the shot heard &#x27;round the world&quot; at Augusta National Golf Club on the fifteenth hole in the final round of the Masters Tournament in 1935. He struck a spoon (the loft of the modern four wood) into the hole, scoring a double eagle. At the time he was trailing Craig Wood by three shots, and was then tied with him. He parred the 16th, 17th and 18th holes to preserve the tie. The following day, the pair played a 36-hole playoff, with Sarazen winning by five shots.

The Sarazen Bridge, approaching the left side of the 15th green, was named in 1955 to commemorate the double eagle&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, which included a contest to duplicate, with the closest just over away. It remains one of the most famous golf shots in golf history.

===Later years, legacy===
In spite of his height of , Sarazen was one of the longest hitters of his era. He played several lengthy exhibition tours around the world, promoting his skills and the sport of golf, and earned a very good living from golf. One of his American tours in 1940 was sponsored by &quot;Golf Magazine&quot; and he played a match every day for 60 days. As a multiple past champion, he was eligible to continue competing after his best years were past, and occasionally did so in the top events, well into the 1960s, and occasionally into the 1970s. Throughout his life, Sarazen competed wearing knickers or plus-fours, which were the fashion when he broke into the top level.

For many years after his retirement, Sarazen was a familiar figure as an honorary starter at the Masters. From 1981 to 1999, he joined Byron Nelson and Sam Snead in hitting a ceremonial tee shot before each Masters tournament. He also popularized the sport with his role as a commentator on the &quot;Wonderful World of Golf&quot; television show, and was an early TV broadcaster at important events.

At age 71, Sarazen made a hole-in-one at The Open Championship in 1973, at the &quot;Postage Stamp&quot; at Troon in Scotland. In 1992, he was voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. Sarazen had what is still the longest-running endorsement contract in professional sports – with Wilson Sporting Goods from 1923 until his death, a total of 75 years.

In 1998, shortly before his death, the Sarazen Student Union was named in his honor. He also established an endowed scholarship fund at the college, The Gene and Mary Sarazen Scholarship, which is awarded annually to students reflecting the high personal, athletic, and intellectual ideals of Dr. Sarazen. For many years, kitted in his signature plus-fours, he hit the first ball in an annual golf tournament, held to raise funds for the scholarship.

==Personal life==
Sarazen died at age 97 in 1999 of complications from pneumonia in Naples, Florida. His wife Mary died 13 years earlier in 1986 with both interred at Marco Island Cemetery in Marco.

<text>Maitreya (Sanskrit) or Metteyya (Pali), is a bodhisattva who is regarded as the future Buddha of this world in all schools of Buddhism, prophesied to become Maitreya Buddha or Metteyya Buddha. In some Buddhist literature, such as the &quot;Amitabha Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, he is also referred to as Ajitā (Invincible, Unconquerable). In Tibetan Buddhism he is known as the &quot;Lord of Love&quot; or the &quot;Noble Loving One&quot; (Pakpa Jampa). The root of his name is the Sanskrit word &quot;maitrī&quot; (Pali: &quot;metta&quot;; meaning friendliness, loving-kindness). The name Maitreya is also related to the Indo-Iranian name Mitra. In Hinduism, Maitreya is prophesied to be the king of Shambala, which is also the birthplace of the Kalki Avatar. 

In all branches of Buddhism, Maitreya is viewed as the direct successor of Gautama Buddha. As the fifth and final Buddha of the current kalpa (eon), Maitreya&#x27;s teachings will be focused around re-establishing the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma on Earth. According to scriptures, Maitreya&#x27;s teachings will be similar to those of Gautama (Śākyamuni). The arrival of Maitreya is prophesied to occur during an era of decline when the teachings of Gautama Buddha have been disregarded or obliviated.

Despite many religious figures and spiritual leaders claiming to be Maitreya throughout history, diverse Buddhist sects insist that these are false claims, while underscoring that Maitreya has yet to appear as a Buddha on the grounds that the Buddha&#x27;s teachings have not been disregarded. Traditional Buddhists believe that Maitreya currently resides in Tushita heaven. However, Maitreya is not inaccessible, and various Buddhists throughout history have also claimed to have been visited by Maitreya, to have had visions of him, and to have received teachings by him. As such, Mahayana Buddhists traditionally consider Maitreya to be the founder of the Yogacara tradition through his revelation of various scriptures like the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkārakā,&quot; and the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot;.

Maitreya has also been employed in a millenarian role by many non-Buddhist philosophies and religions, such as Theosophy, New Age, the White Lotus, as well as by modern new religious movements, such as Yiguandao and Falun Gong.

==Sources==

The name &quot;Maitreya&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;friendship&quot;, which is in turn derived from the noun &quot;mitra,&quot; signifying &quot;friend&quot;. The Pali form &quot;Metteyya&quot; is mentioned in the &quot;Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta&quot; (Digha Nikaya 26) of the Pāli Canon, and also in chapter 28 of the Buddhavamsa. Some modern scholars like Richard Gombrich argue that the sutra is a later addition to the Pali Canon or that it has been edited at a later date.

Maitreya&#x27;s prophecy also appears in other texts like the &quot;Māhavastu&quot;, &quot;Lalitavistara&quot;, the &quot;Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinaya&quot; and the &quot;Divyāvadāna&quot;.

Due to their similar names, some modern scholars like Przyluski, Lamotte and Levi have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from ancient Indo-Iranian deities like Mithra and the future Zoroastrian savior figure of the Saoshyant. However, David Alan Scott points out numerous differences in their artistic portrayals (even in the same geographic region) and discrepancies which make this direct link unlikely. He specifically points out the very ancient Buddhist roots of Maitreya in the earliest Buddhist texts. Scott does point out that both deities are personifications of the virtue of friendship, so they do have that in common (&quot;maitrī&quot;).

=== Mahayana sutras ===
There are many Mahāyāna sūtras which describe and discuss the bodhisattva Maitreya. He appears as a supporting character in several important Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Lotus Sutra,&quot; &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Golden Light&quot;, the &quot;King of Samadhis Sutra&quot;, and the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines.&quot;

In the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha Sutra&quot; meanwhile, Maitreya has an entire chapter in which he preaches the Dharma to the pilgrim Sudhana in one hundred and twenty one verses. Then Sudhana is allowed to enter Maitreya&#x27;s palace (Vairocanakutalamkara-garbha), where he has a grand vision of the entirety of Maitreya&#x27;s bodhisattva career.

In addition, there are also several Mahāyāna sūtras which focus specifically on Maitreya, his teachings and future activity. Some key Maitreya sutras in the Chinese canon are the following:

* &quot;Sutra on the Descending Birth of Maitreya&quot; (T.453:421a:421a–423c), translated by Dharmarakṣa (230?–316);
* &quot;Sutra on the Descending Birth of Maitreya&quot; (T.454:423c– 425c), translated by Kumārajīva (344–413);
* &quot;Sutra on Maitreya Becoming Buddha&quot; (T.456:428b–434b), translated by Kumārajīva (344–413);
* &quot;The Great Vehicle Sūtra Called “Petitioned by Noble Maitreya”&quot; (ārya maitriya paripṛhccha nāma mahāyāna sūtra), translated by Bodhiruci
* &quot;Sutra on Maitreya&#x27;s Descending Birth and Becoming Buddha&quot; (T.455:426a–428b), translated by Yijing (635– 713);
* &quot;Sutra on the Time of Maitreya&#x27;s Arrival&quot; (T.457:434b–435a), translator unknown
* &quot;Sutra on the Visualization of Maitreya Bodhisattva&#x27;s Ascending Birth in Tuṣita Heaven&quot; (T.452:418b–420c), translated by Juqu Jing- sheng (?–464)

The Tibetan Buddhist canon meanwhile contains the following Maitreya sutras:

* Maitreya-mahāsiṃhanāda (&quot;Great Lion&#x27;s Roar of Maitreya)&quot;
* Maitreyaparipṛcchā (&quot;Questions of Maitreya&quot;, Ratnakuta section)
* Maitreyaparipṛcchā­dharmāṣṭa (&quot;Questions of Maitreya on eight dharmas&quot;)
* Maitreyaparipṛcchā (&quot;Questions of Maitreya,&quot; General sutra section)
* Maitreyaprasthāna (&quot;Maitreya&#x27;s Setting Out&quot;)
* Maitreya-vyākaraṇa (&quot;Prophecy of Maitreya&quot;)
* &quot;Ārya-maitri-pratijñā-nāma-dhāraṇī&quot;

=== Other literature ===
Maitreya also appears in other literary works. The &quot;Maitreyasamitināṭaka&quot; was an extensive Buddhist play in pre-Islamic Central Asia (c. 8th century). The &quot;Maitreyavyakarana&quot; (a poem in &quot;śatakam&quot; form) in Central Asia and the &quot;Anagatavamsa&quot; of South India also mention him.

=== Archeology and art ===
In the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, in the first centuries CE in northern India, Maitreya was the most popular figure to be represented along with Gautama Buddha. Numerous sculptures of Maitreya have been found in Greater Gandhara from the Kushan Empire period (30–375 CE). He also appears in Mathura to a lesser extent. Maitreya is already depicted at Sanchi before the Kushan period. But art depicting him becomes much more numerous during the Kushan era, when his cult seems to have grown in popularity.

In 4th- to 6th-century China, Buddhist artisans saw Shakyamuni and Maitreya as interchangeable, which indicates that the iconography of the two figures were not fully established at an early date.

An example is the stone sculpture found in the Qingzhou cache dedicated to Maitreya in 529 CE as recorded in the inscription (currently in the Qingzhou Museum, Shandong). The religious belief of Maitreya apparently developed around the same time as that of Amitābha, as early as the 3rd century CE.

=== Artistic depictions ===
Maitreya is often depicted standing or sitting on a throne. He is often represented as a northern Indian nobleman or prince with a full head of hair, fine flowing robes and jewels. Gandharan style images present him with a distinctive long hair loop folded at the top of the head.

Maitreya is often depicted carrying a vase or bottle (&quot;kamaṇḍalu&quot;), an element which goes back to the Gandharan sculptures and which he shares with depictions of the deity Brahma (along with the hair loop). Because of this, some scholars argue that the water bottle and hair loop are symbols of his brahminical origins, and indeed, some stories depict Maitreya as being born to a Human family during his last life. Maitreya is also often shown in a heaven realm, indicating his current location (Tushita).

In Indian symbolism, the &quot;kamaṇḍalu&quot; pot symbolizes immortality (amrita), fertility, life and wealth. In Buddhism, the similar pūrṇa-kumbha (full bottle) also symbolizes &quot;auspicious abundance&quot;, wisdom, health, longevity, wealth, prosperity, and the Buddha&#x27;s infinite quality of teaching the Dharma. In Tibetan Buddhism, it is termed a &quot;bumpa&quot; (wisdom urn, ritual vase).

== Buddhist Maitreya beliefs ==
=== Types of Maitreya myths ===
According to Jan Nattier, there are four main types of the Maitreya myth which we find throughout the history of Buddhism. The typology is based around when and how a devotee expected to encounter the figure of Maitreya:

# Here/now: In this version, a devotee expected to meet Maitreya on earth, during their present lifetime.
# Here/later: A devotee expected to meet Maitreya on earth at some point after their death, during a future lifetime, perhaps when Maitreya attains Buddhahood and founds a new community. This is the most common and standard myth in which Maitreya&#x27;s enlightenment is a future event devotees hope to be present for.
# There/now: In visionary forms of the Maitreya myth, devotees attempted to encounter Maitreya in a vision of his court in Tushita heaven, or to literally travel there by some means (e.g. the story of Asanga&#x27;s encounter).
# There/later: A common wish among Maitreya devotees was to be reborn in Maitreya&#x27;s Tushita palace or &quot;inner court&quot;, which is his current Pure land.

=== Future coming of Maitreya ===


In all Buddhist traditions, Maitreya is prophesied to be the next Buddha who will arise in this world. He will attain Buddhahood far in the future (proximally 2000 years from now - 5000 years after Sakyamuni&#x27;s Parinirvana). Since attaining enlightenment is thought to be much more likely while studying under a living Buddha, many Buddhists have hoped to meet Maitreya and train under him. As Buddhist studies scholar Alan Spongberg writes, Maitreya &quot;came to represent a hope for the future, a time when all human beings could once again enjoy the spiritual and physical environment most favorable to enlightenment and the release from worldly suffering.&quot; The Maitreya legend has provided a positive view of the future for all Buddhist cultures, who have adapted and expressed the prophetic myth in different ways.

According to Buddhist tradition, each kalpa (a cosmic period lasting millions of years) has several Buddhas. The previous kalpa was the &quot;vyuhakalpa&quot; (glorious aeon), and the present kalpa is called the &quot;bhadrakalpa&quot; (auspicious aeon). The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity (&quot;saptatathāgata&quot;) are seven Buddhas which bridge the last kalpa and the present kalpa, they begin with Vipassī and end (so far) with Gautama (Shakyamuni). Maitreya is thus the eighth Buddha in this line.

According to traditional Buddhist sources Maitreya&#x27;s advent is not imminent and instead will happen millions of years in the future. In spite of this, Buddhist believers can hope to accumulate good karma so that when the time comes, they will be reborn to meet the future Buddha Maitreya and reach enlightenment under him. Scriptures which describe the future coming of Maitreya also describe the paradise like conditions of the world during Maitreya&#x27;s time. His coming is said to usher in a &quot;golden age&quot; of religion and civilization. Buddhist scriptures do not exhort believers to work to bring about this golden age (what Nattier calls &quot;active apocalypticism&quot;). This might be due to the Buddhist view of the cyclical nature of time and history.

The cyclical nature of history is thus part of the Maitreya myth. Buddhists believe that there will come a time of Dharma decline in which social order and morality will decline and the human lifespan will also decline. There will be war, sickness and famine. The Buddha&#x27;s Dharma will then be lost. After some time, the world will begin to improve again, and human lifespans will begin to increase. It is at the peak of this rise in goodness in the far future that Maitreya will arrive. As such, in the traditional Buddhist view, first there will be a period of decline, followed by a period of moral and social betterment. It is only then that Maitreya is expected to come. To be able to take part in this golden age, Buddhist devotees hoped to make enough good merit (through good deeds like giving and compassionate acts) which would condition their future rebirth.One mention of the prophecy in the &quot;&quot; states that gods, men and other beings:

Thus, many Buddhists throughout history have sought to develop the necessary merit to meet Maitreya on Earth during the life of his final Buddhahood. This includes many Theravada Buddhists. One famous Theravadin who expressed this wish was the Sinhalese king Duṭṭhagāmaṇī.

In Mahayana Buddhism, Buddhas preside over pure lands, such as Sukhavati. Once Maitreya becomes a Buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati pure land, an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the city of Varanasi (also known as Benares) in Uttar Pradesh, India, and in other descriptions, the kingdom of Shambhala.

=== Foretold biography ===
Various Buddhist sources give details about Maitreya&#x27;s birth, family and country. According to the &quot;Cakkavatti Sutta: The Wheel-turning Emperor&quot; (Digha Nikaya 26), Maitreya Buddha will be born in a time when humans will live to an age of eighty thousand years, in the city of Ketumatī, whose king will be the Cakkavattī (wheel-turning emperor) Sankha. Sankha will live in the palace where once dwelt King Mahāpanadā, but later he will give the palace away and will himself become a follower of Maitreya Buddha.

Maitreya will be born to the chief priest of Sankha, Brahmayu, and his wife Brahmavati. In some sources his family name is Maitreya and his first name is Ajita. Maitreya will live as a householder, have a son, and then renounce the world and achieve Buddhahood like Shakyamuni. In some accounts, Maitreya will meet Mahakasyapa, who has been in samadhi on top of mount Kukkutapada since the passing of Shakyamuni. According to some accounts, Mahakasyapa will then hand Shayamuni&#x27;s robe to Maitreya.

Buddhist texts from several traditions say that beings in Maitreya&#x27;s time will be much bigger than during the time of Sakyamuni. To these gigantic beings, Buddha&#x27;s robe barely covers two fingers and a modern human appears insect sized. Some sources state that Maitreya will be 88 cubits (132 feet, 40 meters) tall and will live for 88,000 years. Like Maṅgala Buddha, his rays will make people hard to distinguish between day and night. His teachings will preserve for the next 180,000 years. According to the commentary of Anāgatavamsa, his teaching will last for 360,000 years.

=== In Tushita heaven ===
Buddhists believe that Maitreya is currently a spiritually advanced bodhisattva (a being who is practicing the path towards full Buddhahood) in Tuṣita heaven where he will remain until it is the right time for him to descend to earth to attain Buddhahood.

Maitreya currently resides in a palace at the center of &quot;&quot; Heaven (Pāli: &quot;Tusita&quot;). Gautama Buddha also lived here before he was born into the world as all bodhisattvas live in the Heaven before they descend to the human realm to become Buddhas. Though the concept of the bodhisattva is different in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, both traditions of Buddhism share a belief in Maitreya bodhisattva as the current regent of the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma in Tusita.

Many Buddhists throughout history have cultivated merit through good deeds in order to be reborn in Tusita and meet Maitreya bodhisattva there in their next life. This may be combined with the wish to descend back down to earth as part of Maitreya&#x27;s future entourage. Mahayana Buddhists such as Dao&#x27;an, Xuanzang, Yjing, and other masters of East Asian Yogacara, have expressed devotion for Maitreya and have sought to be reborn in his pure land, the palace at the center of Tuṣita. One Theravada example is the legend of the monk Malaya-Mahadeva, who is said to have traveled to Tushita and met Maitreya according to the 11th century &quot;Rasavāhinī&quot;.

Modern figures like Xuyun, and Taixu have also expressed the wish to meet Maitreya in Tushita.

=== Revelations and manifestations ===

Maitreya is also believed by Buddhists to manifest &quot;emanation bodies&quot; (nirmanakayas) on earth in order to aid living beings and teach the Dharma. Chinese Buddhists consider the rotund monk Budai as an emanation of Maitreya in China. Buddhist yogis and scholars, like Dao&#x27;an, have also sought to receive visions, teachings, or guidance from Maitreya in this present life. Various stories are recorded of individuals ascending to meet Maitreya (through meditation and samadhi) or of Maitreya descending to meet them here on earth. 

The most famous of these revelations in Mahayana Buddhism are five scriptures Maitreya is traditionally said to have revealed to the 4th century Indian Buddhist master Asanga. These texts are important in the Yogacara tradition and are considered to be part of the third turning within the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma. They teach the &quot;consciousness-only&quot; idealist philosophy of Yogacara Buddhism.

Buddhist tradition associates Asanga (c. 4th century), one of the founders of the Yogacara school, with the bodhisattva Maitreya. According to traditional accounts, after twelve years of retreat and meditation, Asanga encountered a dying dog and treated his wounds by removing the maggots from the wounds to a piece of Asanga&#x27;s own flesh. It was only after his act of love and compassion that Asanga had a vision of Maitreya, who turned out to be that very dying dog. Maitreya then took Asanga to the celestial realm of Tushita and transmitted to him several Buddhist scriptures (the so called &quot;five dharmas of Maitreya&quot;).

The Chinese and Tibetan traditions disagree on which scriptures are included in the &quot;Five Dharmas of Maitreya&quot;. In the Tibetan tradition, the five texts are: &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkārakārikā&quot;, (&quot;The Adornment of Mahayana sutras&quot;), &quot;Dharmadharmatāvibhāga&quot; (&quot;Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being&quot;), &quot;Madhyāntavibhāgakārikā&quot; (&quot;Distinguishing the Middle and the Extremes&quot;), &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot; ( &quot;Ornament for clear realization&quot;), and the &quot;Ratnagotravibhaga&quot; (Exposition of the Jeweled lineage).

The Chinese tradition meanwhile maintains that the five revealed scriptures are: the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi, *Yogavibhāga&quot; [now lost]&quot;, Mahāyānasūtrālamkārakā, Madhyāntavibhāga&quot; and the &quot;Vajracchedikākāvyākhyā.&quot;

== Mantras and dharanis ==

Mahayana sources contain various mantras and dharanis of Maitreya.

His common name mantra (as taught in Shingon Buddhism) is: oṃ maitreya svāhā 

Another Maitreya mantra taught in the Tibetan tradition is: oṃ āḥ maitrī sarva siddhi hūṃTwo other mantras from the Chinese canon (in a text translated by Kūkai) include:

Namaḥ samanta-buddhānāṃ aparājite jayanti svāhā

Namaḥ samanta-buddhānāṃ ajitaṃjaya sarva-sattva-āśaya-anugata svāhā

=== Dharanis ===
A popular dharani taught in Tibetan Buddhism is the &quot;Incantation of&quot; &quot;Noble Maitreya&#x27;s Promise&quot; &quot;(Ārya-maitri-pratijñā-nāma-dhāraṇī&quot;):

Namo ratnatrayāya namo bhagavate śākyamunaye tathāgatāyārhate samyaksaṃbuddhāya.

Tadyathā: oṃ ajite ajite aparājite ajitañjaya hara hara maitri avalokite kara kara mahāsamayasiddhe bhara bhara mahābodhimaṇḍabīje smara smara asmākaṃ samaya bodhi bodhi mahābodhi svāhā

oṃ mohi mohi mahāmohi svāhā

oṃ muni muni smara svāhāEnglish translation: [Homage] Homage to the Three Jewels. Homage to the Lord Shakyamuni, Tathagata, Arhat, Completely Perfect Buddha.

As follows: [Root mantra] Om Invincible, Invincible, Unconquered Conquer the Unconquered, take, take [it], You Who Look Down with Friendliness, act, act, Bring, bring the fulfillment of your great pledge, Shake the seat of great awakening, Remember, remember [your] pledge for us, Awakening, awakening, great awakening, svaha.

[Heart mantra] Om fascinating, fascinating, greatly fascinating, svaha.

[Close Heart mantra] Om sage, sage, remember, svaha.The Chinese canon contains the following:namo ratna-trayāya, nama āryāvalokiteśvarāya bodhi-sattvāya mahāsatvāya mahākāruṇikāya tad-yathā, oṃ, maitre maitre maitra-manasi maitra-sambhave maitra-udbhave mahāsamaye svāhā

== Maitreya in East Asia ==


=== Maitreya devotion ===
Maitreya devotion (Chinese: 彌勒信仰) has been a part of East Asian Buddhism since the time of Dao’an (312–85), who is known to have founded a Maitreya devotionalism in China. Maitreya devotion was popular during the Northern Wei period (386–534). During the Sui Dynasty, three separate people declared themselves to be incarnations of Maitreya, attempting to bolster their authority, lead insurrections, and overthrow the Sui Dynasty (each attempted overthrow was ultimately unsuccessful).

Devotional practices to Maitreya were an important part of the East Asian Yogacara school. A key element of Maitreya devotion in East Asia is the intention to be reborn in Maitreya&#x27;s Inner Court of Tushita Heaven (兜率內院). Some Buddhist scriptures have noted that Maitreya is currently teaching at the Inner Court of Tushita, and some East Asian masters who were Maitreya devotees, such as Xuanzang (7th century), Kuiji, Wonhyo, and Yijing, had the intention of being reborn there after their death.

Xuanzang was a famous devotee of Maitreya who vowed to be reborn in his Tushita palace so that he could &quot;serve upon the Kind Lord&quot;, and to eventually &quot;descend with him to perform the deeds of the Buddhas, until we attain unsurpassed bodhi&quot;. Xuanzang also taught a devotional verse (gatha) and taught everyone to recite it, the gatha is: Namo Maitreya Tathagata, the Perfectly Awakened One! May all living beings swiftly be in the presence of your kind visage. Namo the inner community abiding with Maitreya Tathagata! After I shed this life, may I be reborn among them.The work of the Silla monk Wŏnhyo (617–686), especially his commentary on the Maitreya sutras, is an important source for East Asian Maitreya devotion. According to this work, Maitreya devotion consists of a visualization meditation in which one visualizes the majestic adornments of Tushita heaven and &quot;the superiority of receiving rebirth [there] as a bodhisattva.&quot; According to Spongberg, &quot;this means that one is to visualize oneself, personally present, amidst all of the splendors of Tusita Heaven, splendors that certainly include, but are not limited to, Maitreya.&quot; The practice further includes hearing the name of Maitreya (a kind of mindfulness of the Buddha), &quot;respectfully trusting in the virtues manifested by this name&quot;, repenting past bad deeds, and other ritual acts like taking care of stupas, offering incense, flowers, etc. According to Wonhyo, this practice results in being reborn in Tushita to personally receive teachings from Maitreya so that one cannot relapse from Buddhahood.

A famous episode during Xuanzang&#x27;s travels illustrates his devotion to Maitreya. While sailing on the Ganges, he was overtaken by pirates who were going to sacrifice him to Durga. After asking for a moment of silence to meditate, Xuanzang meditated on Maitreya, praying he would be reborn in Tushita with him and focusing his thoughts on the bodhisattva. Xuanzang then had a vision of Maitreya seated on his glittering throne in Tushita surrounded by many devas. Then a storm came and the pirates, terrified, threw themselves at Xuanzang&#x27;s feet.

Modern Chinese Buddhist monks, such as Xuyun, have also been known to have dreamt of going to the Inner Court of Tushita. The modern Chinese reformer Taixu 太虛 (1890–1947), one of the key founders of Humanistic Buddhism, was also a devotee of Maitreya. He is known to have promoted devotional practices and liturgies focused on Maitreya and was even said to have propagated the &quot;Maitreya School&quot; (&quot;Cizong&quot; 慈宗).

Maitreya devotion is most widely practice in Chinese Mahayana Buddhism, but it may also be found in other Chinese religions, like Yiguandao.

Maitreya devotion was also popular in Silla Korea and in Japanese Buddhism.

=== Maitreya teachings and millenarianism ===
Throughout Chinese history, the Buddhist prophecy of Maitreya and the doctrine of the age of social decline (Chinese: 末法; pinyin: &quot;Mò Fǎ&quot;; “the Degenerate Age of Dharma”) was adopted and wielded by numerous religious, social and political groups. Some of these groups operated as secret societies, like the White Lotus Society. Many of these groups held millenarian beliefs about the immanent arrival of Maitreya. Not all of these groups were orthodox Buddhists, and some combined Chinese folk religion, Buddhism and Taoist beliefs. Nattier points out that there was a pre-existent Taoist belief in a messianic savior figure (Li Hong). Some of these millenarian groups held antiestablishment views and even led rebellions against the Chinese state at various points of socio-political crisis.

During the Sui Dynasty, there were three different rebellions led by three separate leaders who claimed to be Maitreya, one in 610 at the capital (Chang&#x27;an) and two in 613 (one led by magician named Song Zixian and another by a monk named Xiang Haiming). During the Tang dynasty, another Maitreyan rebellion was led by a certain Wang Huaigu. During the Song, Wang Ze led a revolt of Buddhists expecting Maitreya (1047); they took over the city of Beizhou in Hebei before they were crushed. The Song Dynasty government declared Maitreya Sects to be &quot;heresies and unsanctioned religions&quot;. Tens of thousands of Maitreya Sect followers were killed.

The Yuan dynasty saw the Red Turban Rebellion (aka The First White Lotus Rebellion c. 1351–1368) led by Han Shantong, leader of the White Lotus Society, and Army Commander Liu Futong rebelled against the Mongols.

A Second White Lotus Rebellion broke out in 1796 among impoverished settlers in the mountainous region that separates Sichuan from Hubei and Shaanxi as a protest against heavy taxes imposed by the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty. The White Lotus Society influenced the development of the 19th century &quot;Society of Harmonious Fists&quot; which led the Boxer Rebellion in 1899.

=== Japanese Buddhism ===
Maitreya is a central figure for the Japanese Yogacara school (Hossō-shū) who considers Maitreya to be the founder of the tradition. Maitreya (Jp. Miroku) devotion was extensively promoted during the Kamakura period (1185–1333) by Hossō-shū scholars like Jōkei (1155–1213).

The monk and religious founder of the Shingon sect Kukai is believed by Shingon adherents to currently be in a state of meditation on Mount Koya. He awaits the coming of Maitreya. Following his example, later Shingon meditators attempted to self-mummify (known as &quot;Sokushinbutsu&quot;) through ascetic practices to also wait for the coming of Maitreya.

In Nichiren Buddhism, Maitreya is seen as a steward and protector of the bodhisattvas who teach the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, a view promoted by the sutra itself. According to Nichiren, all beings can be &quot;Maitreya&quot;, since the true meaning of this name &quot;designates the Votaries of the Lotus Sutra&quot; who compassionately uphold the teaching of this sutra.

==Non-Buddhist views==

=== Chinese salvationist religions ===
Beginning with the White Lotus Society (whose roots go back to the 12th century), Maitreya has been an important part of many Chinese Salvanionist Religious sects. In many of these sects, Maitreya is seen as a &quot;primordial one&quot; and a heavenly religious leader who will come to change the world radically. The most common myth is that Maitreya is a savior sent by Eternal Venerable Mother (&quot;Wusheng Laomu&quot;, i.e. Queen Mother of the West) to show people the way to their true home, the heaven of the Eternal Mother, where all beings are originally from. According to some of these sectarian salvation religions, Maitreya&#x27;s arrival is immanent and he will usher the final age in which all beings will be reunited with the Eternal Mother, an event called the &quot;recovery of original wholeness&quot; (shou-yuan).

One modern example of such a sect is Yiguandao (Eternal Way), a 19th century salvationist religion. In Yiguandao, Maitreya is a key figure, a great savior, patriach and teacher sent by the Eternal Venerable Mother. Yiguandao claims that during the end times, Maitreya will incarnate on Earth to save humanity, known among believers as &quot;Mile Zushi&quot; (Chinese: 彌勒祖師; &#x27;Grand Patriach Mile&#x27;). Maitreya appears as a similar figure in another popular salvation religion, Xiantiandao (Chinese: 先天道; pinyin: &quot;Xiāntiān Dào&quot;; &#x27;Way of Former Heaven&#x27;).

===Theosophy and New Age===

In Theosophy, Maitreya (or Lord Maitreya) has multiple aspects signifying not just the future Buddha, but similar concepts from other religious or spiritual traditions. For modern Theosophy, Maitreya is an advanced enlightened being and a high-ranking member of secret spiritual hierarchy, the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. These masters guide the spiritual evolution of humanity and Maitreya is said to hold the &quot;Office of the World Teacher&quot;. As such, Maitreya is in charge of teaching and guiding humanity. As Annie Besant writes, Maitreya has &quot;the duty of watching over the spiritual destinies of mankind; of guiding, blessing, maintaining the various religions of the world, founded in outline by Himself.&quot;

Maitreya may occasionally incarnate in the world to guide humanity directly. Some Theosophists, like C. W. Leadbeater, held that Maitreya previously reincarnated as Christ. In the early 20th century, leading Theosophists became convinced that a return of Maitreya as a &quot;World Teacher&quot; was imminent. At this time, a South Indian boy, Jiddu Krishnamurti, was thought to be destined as the &quot;vehicle&quot; for Maitreya; however, in his early 30s, Krishnamurti, himself, declined to serve in this role.

The Theosophical Maitreya gave rise to further Western conceptions of Maitreya as a future world teacher who would usher in a new age for humanity&#x27;s spiritual evolution. The related Ascended Master Teachings also contains teachings about Maitreya. Various views regarding Maitreya can thus be found in contemporary New Age and Esoteric groups.

===Post-theosophical movements===
Since the growth of Theosophy in the late 19th century, diverse religions and spiritual movements have adopted and reinterpreted older Jain, Hindu and Buddhist beliefs about Maitreya. Share International, for example, equates Maitreya with the prophesied figures of multiple religious traditions, claims that Maitreya is already present in the world but is preparing to make an open declaration of his presence in the near future. They claim that he is here to inspire mankind to create a new era based on sharing and justice.

In the beginning of the 1930s, the Ascended Master Teachings placed Maitreya in the &quot;Office of World Teacher&quot; until 1956, when he was described as moving on to the &quot;Office of Planetary Buddha&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Christ&quot; in their concept of a Spiritual Hierarchy.

In 1911, Rudolf Steiner claimed &quot;Roughly three thousand years after our time the world will experience the Maitreya Buddha incarnation, which will be the last incarnation of Jeshu ben Pandira. This Bodhisattva, who will come as Maitreya Buddha, will also come in a physical body in our century in his reincarnation in the flesh—but not as Buddha—and he will make it his task to give humanity all the true concepts about the Christ Event.&quot; Steiner was careful to distinguish Jeshu ben Pandira as somebody entirely distinct from Jesus of Nazareth, as Maitreya was said to be entirely distinct from Jesus (but in moment-to-moment relationship with him the last three years of his life).

===Ahmadiyya===
The Ahmadiyyas believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908) fulfilled expectations regarding the Maitreya Buddha.
The founder has given the whole account about the truth of forthcoming of Jesus Christ and his travel via Tibet and the transformation of word &quot;Masiha&quot; to &quot;Metteyya&quot; in one of his Prolific writings &quot;Jesus in India&quot; (Maseeh Hindustan Mai).

=== Baháʼí Faith ===

Followers of the Baháʼí Faith believe that Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh is the fulfillment of the prophecy of appearance of Maitreya, the fifth Buddha. Baháʼís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s teachings on world peace.

==Maitreya claimants==

The following list is just a small selection of those people who claimed or claim to be the incarnation of Maitreya. Many have either used the Maitreya incarnation claim to form a new Buddhist sect, a new religious movement or cult or even a political rebellion.

Faqing gathered an army to rebel against the rule of the Wei dynasty in the name of Buddhism.&quot;
* Feng Yi (冯宜) and Heyue (贺悦), Hu people from Wucheng County of the Northern Wei dynasty in the 6th century led a rebellion claiming to be Maitreya Buddha against the Northern Wei army on the outskirts of Yuntai city.

*Gung Ye, a Korean warlord and king of the short-lived state of Taebong during the 10th century, claimed himself as the living incarnation of Maitreya and ordered his subjects to worship him. His claim was widely rejected by most Buddhist monks and later he was dethroned and killed by his own servants.
* Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh (1817–1892), the Prophet-Founder of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, is recognized by Bahá&#x27;ís as the promised Maitreya Buddha and Promised One of all religions.
* Wang Tianzu (王添組), a disciple of Wu Zixiang (10th patriarch of Yiguandao) claimed to be an incarnation of Maitreya and claimed to foresaw an approaching apocalypze.

<doc id="225891" wikidata="Q6575630" url="?curid=225891" title="Kamma (caste)">
<text>Kamma is a largely Hindu caste from South India. The community of Kammas is believed to have originated from agriculturists of the &quot;Kammanadu&quot; region of the erstwhile Guntur district and Ongole division in Andhra Pradesh. Propelled by their military activity in the Vijayanagara Empire, Kammas are believed to have spread out from the region during the Vijayanagara period, followed by some in-migration during the British period and out-migration again during the twentieth century. Today they are regarded as one of the richest groups in Andhra Pradesh and are a dominant caste from Coastal Andhra with socio-economic and political prominence throughout the Telugu-speaking regions of India (the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana).

They also have a notable, albeit smaller, presence in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. In recent times, 
a sizeable number of Kammas have migrated to the United States.

== Origins ==
The modern community of Kammas is believed to have originated from agriculturists of the Kammanadu region in coastal Andhra Pradesh. The region, lying between the Gundlakamma River and the Krishna River in the erstwhile Guntur district (which included the three subdistricts later transferred to the Ongole district in 1970), had an identity dating back to ancient times. The term &quot;kamma&quot; either referred to the two rivers that formed the boundaries of the region, or to the Buddhist monastic institutions called &quot;sanghakammas&quot; believed to have been once prevalent in the region.

As the people of the region migrated to other parts, they were often referred to as the Kamma community (&quot;kamma-kula&quot;). Terms such as &quot;kamma-brahmana&quot;, &quot;kamma-komati&quot;, &quot;kamma-sreshti&quot; and &quot;kamma-kapu&quot; are attested in inscriptions as descriptions of people. The migration was apparently quite extensive, and was made by possible by the Kammanadu&#x27;s strategic location with access to the Deccan plateau as well as to the regions in the south and southwest. By 1872, only one-fourth of their total population was living in the original region. But the migrants retained links to the homeland and returned to it whenever the situation was favourable.

== Medieval history ==

=== Post-Kakatiya period ===
The tradition holds that the Kammas, along with Velamas and Reddis, evolved out of the community of Kapus (cultivators) in the post-Kakatiya period. A popular legend collected by Edgar Thurston narrates that Kammas originated from the youngest son of a certain Belthi Reddi, who managed to recover his mother&#x27;s ear-ornament (called &quot;kamma&quot; in Telugu) that had been appropriated by Emperor Prataparudra&#x27;s minister. The other sons of Belthi Reddi are similarly said to have given rise to the other prominent caste communities of the Telugu people.

=== Vijayanagara period ===

Kammas served as ministers, military generals, and governors in the Vijayanagara Empire. During the reign of Krishnadevaraya, Kammas are said to have formed the bulwark of the Vijayanagara army. Their role in protecting the last great Hindu kingdom of India was significant. Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s court had a significant presence of Kamma officers, and they entered into matrimonial alliances with the royal family. It&#x27;s possible that the influence of Kamma generals led to the importance of the Telugu language in Vijayanagara and the rise of Telugu colonies in Tamil Nadu. Some of the notable Kamma Nayak clans of Vijayanagara include the Pemmasanis, Sayapanenis, and Ravellas.

Of the Pemmasani Nayaks, they controlled parts of Rayalaseema and had large mercenary armies that were the vanguard of the Vijayanagara Empire in the sixteenth century. Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayudu was a leading military commander under Krishnadevaraya, and Rama Raya and the Aravidus rose to power following a civil war largely because of the support of Pemmasani Erra Timmanayudu. Pemmasani Pedda Timmaraja was the minister of Sriranga I and later for Venkata II, the latter of whom oversaw the revival of the Vijayanagara Empire. It is also known that a Pemmasani Nayak, Timmanayudu, had court poets and ministers of his own, such as Channamaraju. Pemmasani Timmanayudu also assisted Venkata II in putting down a rebellion by the Nandyala Chiefs led by Krishnamaraja in 1580. The Pemmasani Nayaks are associated with Gandikota, where they started as commandants and later gained control of Gandikota &quot;Seema&quot; from the Nandyala Chiefs. Numerous Hindu temples, such as Bugga Ramalingeshwara Swamy Temple and Chintalarayaswamy Temple, were constructed and patronized by the Pemmasanis.

The Sayapaneni Nayaks started in service of Vijayanagara when Krishnadevaraya granted administrative control of the Dupadu Region to Shayappanayadu, a twenty-year old from the family. According to the Dupati &quot;kaifiyat&quot;, this area was consolidated by Vengala Nayudu and Venkatadri Nayudu, who are Shayappa Nayudu&#x27;s descendants, and their rule is presented as a peaceful epoch. Although modest actors in the Deccan, their main strength lay in their ability to shift allegiances, facilitated by Niyogi Brahmins, as seen with their initial allegiance to the Vijayanagara Empire and later to the Qutb Shahis and the Nizams after Vijayanagara&#x27;s demise.

The Ravella Nayaks were another prominent clan that served the Vijayanagara Empire militarily and administratively since the Sangama Dynasty, and they exercised control (on behalf of Vijayanagara) over Srisailam, Udayagiri, Podili, and Kochcherlakota &quot;Seemas&quot; (regions) at various periods. The exploits of this clan are described by the poet Ratnakaram Gopala Kavi in &quot;Sovgandhika Prasavapaharanamu,&quot; including mentions of defeating the Qutb Shahis, Gajapatis, and recapturing forts like Adoni. Noted individuals in the Ravella Nayaks include Ravella Linga II, who is surmised to be one of the chief generals of the Vijayanagara Army during the reign of Rama Raya.

When the Vijayanagara Empire was troubled after the Battle of Tallikota in 1565, the Pemmasani Nayaks, Ravella Nayaks and Sayapaneni Nayaks helped the Aravidu Dynasty in keeping the Muslims at bay. It took another 90 years to consolidate the Muslim power in Andhra country with the capture of Gandikota in 1652 and the defeat of Pemmasani Timmanayudu by Mir Jumla. Following the Battle of Talikota, many Kamma Nayaks either migrated to the dominions of the Madurai and Thanjavur Nayaks where they governed villages and supplied military officers or obtained favours from the Qutb Shahis and Mughals and settled in Telugu regions as local military chiefs.

=== Qutb Shahi and Nizam period ===
Kammas were also in service of the Qutb Shahis. Their roles included serving as the regional aristocracy, revenue officers and military commanders. During the reign of the Qutb Shahis and Nizams, the Sayapaneni Nayaks (1626–1802) ruled a block of territory between the Krishna River and Nellore as vassals. It was also in the Qutb Shahi period that the Vasireddy clan of Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu received the deshmukhi of the Nandigama &quot;pargana&quot; in 1670. Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu, a Kamma zamindar, controlled 551 towns and villages in the Guntur and Krishna Districts, had a retinue of several thousand men, and became known for his patronization of Hindu religious rituals, festivals, temples, and Brahmins. The Kamma Yarlagadda zamindars of Challapalli obtained their zamindari in 1596 and deshmukhi jurisdiction in 1640, and they assisted the Muslim rulers in their military expeditions and collection of land taxes. This conferred on the Yarlagaddas the privileges of maintaining their own military force and control over the inhabitants in their area.

Following Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign, coastal Andhra witnessed a series of widespread rebellions against the local Mughal officials that enabled Kamma warrior chiefs to usurp administrative power over hundreds, if not thousands, of square miles of land. In the 1600–1800s, Kammas acquired land in the interior Deccan Plateau due to grants that were given by the Nizam of Hyderabad to encourage cultivation in uncultivated areas of Telangana. Moreover, in the Telangana region, Muslim rulers collected taxes through intermediaries from the dominant castes, such as the Kammas, who were given the title &quot;Chowdary&quot;.

=== British period ===
Although the 1802 Permanent Settlement by the British benefited the Kamma landed aristocracy by reinforcing the Zamindari system, most Kammas saw their landholdings consolidated, and their influence consequently increased, by the introduction of the ryotwari system as a replacement for the zamindari system in the 19th century. Akin to the jenmis of Kerala, there were also big Kamma ryotwari landlords in Andhra. Some Kammas also were in the Madras Army of the British East India Company. Among Telugu Hindus, the East India Company army initially recruited predominantly from the Kamma, Raju, and Velama castes and restricted recruitment from other castes.

In the 1872 census, the Kammas made up 40 per cent of the agricultural population of the Krishna district (which included the present Guntur district until 1904). Along with Brahmins, they formed the dominant community of the district. By 1921, their population in the district increased to 47 per cent, representing a large in-migration. Following Brahminical traditions, Kammas emulated the rituals of the Brahmins, and the literate Kammas learned the Vedas, wore the sacred threads, taught Sanskrit and even performed pujas for the lower-caste members, which is said to have generated controversies. Despite their attachment to Brahminical orthodoxy, the Kammas also related to the Kapus in a narrative. Kammas formed the &quot;Kamma Mahajana Sabha&quot;, a caste association, in 1910, which received encouragement from the political leaders. Ranga also started a Madras Kamma Association in 1919 and founded a journal &quot;Kamma Patrika&quot;, later renamed to &quot;Ryot Patrika&quot;. Kamma caste associations also spawned in Tamil Nadu in the 1920s, with two Kamma zamindars leading the &quot;Kamma Mahajana Sabha&quot; and the &quot;Dakshina Desa Kamma Mahasabha&quot;. Kammas constituted 6 per cent of the population in the Telugu-speaking areas of the Madras Presidency in 1921, a figure slightly higher than Brahmins, but lagging far behind the &#x27;Kapu or Reddi&#x27;.

Construction of dams and barrages and establishment of an irrigation system in Godavari and Krishna River deltas by Arthur Cotton was a great boon to the Kamma farmers. Availability of water and the natural propensity for hard work made the Kammas wealthy and prosperous. The money was put to good use by establishing numerous schools and libraries and encouraging their children to take up modern education. In 1921, Kammas had the highest literacy rate among other dominant castes, such as Reddis and Kapus, though it was lower than Brahmins. The money was also invested into various companies, industries, such as food processing and transportation, and moneylending. The Kammas of Tamil Nadu, who speak Telugu at home, have also excelled in the cultivation of black cotton soils and later diversified into various industrial enterprises, particularly in Coimbatore and Kovilpatti. Coimbatore was known as the ‘Manchester of South India’ and its textile industry, which is the main economic sector in the city, is almost entirely controlled by affluent Kamma families that were the landed aristocracy of Kongu Nadu.

By the mid 20th century, many Kammas had benefited greatly from the numerous educational institutes that had proliferated throughout Coastal Andhra such as Andhra Christian College or Guntur Medical College. Many of these were high-fee private educational institutes also formed by wealthy members of the dominant castes who often gave preference to students from their community in admissions.

=== Today ===
Today they are regarded as the wealthiest group in Andhra Pradesh and an entrepreneurial community influential in various industries, such as information technology, real estate, media and Telugu cinema. They are a dominant caste from Coastal Andhra with socio-economic and political prominence throughout the Telugu-speaking regions of India (the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). In united-Andhra Pradesh (including present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Kammas made up 4.8% of the total state population in the last census. Kammas also have a notable, albeit smaller, presence in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

==== Migration to US ====
In recent times, a sizeable number of Kammas have migrated to the United States. Starting in the 1950s, some members of the dominant castes from Andhra Pradesh had gone to the US for higher education. After the lifting of immigration quota system in 1965, the highly-educated doctors, engineers and scientists started moving to US. Kammas, mainly from well-off families and having benefited from the spread of educational institutions in Coastal Andhra, took up the opportunity to move. After the IT boom in the 1990s, even more migrated to America. The success of those who migrated already incentivized more of their relatives and members of their network to migrate as well, and today having an &quot;NRI child&quot; is seen as a matter of pride for Kamma parents in coastal Andhra. For Kamma and other dominant caste women, although some have been sent by families for higher studies in America, many have moved to America due to marriage with NRI men.

== Classification ==
The varna system of Brahmanic ritual ranking never took hold in South Indian society outside Kerala. There were essentially three classes: Brahmin, non-Brahmin and Dalit. Kammas naturally fall into the non-Brahmin class. Classification of social groups in the Andhra region has changed frequently as the various communities jostle for status. During the British Raj, the Kammas were considered to be &quot;upper Shudra&quot;/&quot;Sat Shudra&quot;, along with the Reddy and Velama castes, under the varna system.

Selig Harrison said in 1956 that 

== Politics ==
Prior to the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, creating the new state of Telangana, the Kammas and the Reddys were politically and economically dominant in the state. From 1953 to 1983, many Kammas initially associated themselves with the Indian National Congress and offered the party financing and media support. During the 1980s, they played a key role in state and national politics with the inception of the Telugu Desam Party by its then President N. T. Rama Rao also called as NTR.
