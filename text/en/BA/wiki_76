==History==
Tak was a historical kingdom built over 2,000 years ago, even before the Sukhothai period. The ancient kingdom had its peak around the 1st century. By the 5th century the capital of this kingdom was moved south to Lavo (present day Lopburi province). A city named Ban Tak was established by Jamadevi (พระนางจามเทวี), princess of the Lavo kingdom, around 663 CE. It became part of the Sukhothai kingdom through battles led by Ramkhamhaeng the Great and formed the main fortress on the western front. The city was moved further west and renamed &quot;Mueang Rahang&quot; when the Ayuthaya kingdom was lost to Burma during King Maha Thammaracha&#x27;s reign. The city was moved back to the east side of the Ping River during the early Bangkok period.

King Taksin was vice-governor of Tak before the Ayutthaya kingdom fell during the war with Burma. As his name was &quot;Sin&quot;, he became called &quot;Tak-Sin&quot; during his time in Tak.

==Demographics==
About a quarter of the population belongs to one of Thailand&#x27;s tribe hill tribes: Yao, Karen (Thai &quot;Kariang&quot;), Akha (Thai &quot;Akha&quot;), Lahu (Thai &quot;Musoe&quot;), Hmong (Thai &quot;Mong&quot;), and Lisu (Thai &quot;Lisaw&quot;). The largest tribe in Tak is Karen.

==Refugees==
According to the UNHCR data of 2008, nearly 95,000 of Thailand&#x27;s 121,000 registered refugees from Burma are housed in several refugee camps in Tak province of which Mae La camp is the largest with around 45,000 Karen refugees.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into nine districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 63 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 493 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===

Mae Sot has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Tak has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 17 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 49 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows King Naresuan on the royal elephant. Sometimes below the elephant a garuda is depicted, as the garuda is the state symbol of Thailand. King Naresuan is shown pouring consecrated water on the ground, a symbolic act to declare independence. This refers to the war of 1584 with Burma, when Tak was the first border town to be liberated from Burmese control.

The provincial slogan is, &quot;A town of wonderful nature, huge Bhumiphol Dam, King Taksin The Great and beautiful forests&quot;.

The provincial tree is the Asian Jatoba (&quot;Xylia xylocarpa&quot; var. &quot;kerrii&quot;), and the provincial flower is the Orchid tree (&quot;Bauhinia&quot; sp.). The cyprinid fish &quot;Hypsibarbus malcolmi&quot; is the provincial aquatic life.

<text>Georges Charles Guillain () (3 March 1876 – 29 June 1961) was a French neurologist born in Rouen.
He studied medicine in Rouen and Paris, where he learned clinical education at several hospitals. He developed an interest in neurology, and his first important scientific work involved lesions of the plexus brachialis. He earned his medical doctorate at Paris in 1898.

He later became &quot;chef de clinique&quot; for nervous disease, and in 1910 acquired his agrégation. After the end of World War I, he worked at Charité Hospital in Paris, followed by a professorship of neurology at the Salpêtrière (1923).

Guillain was a prolific writer. In 1920 with his friend Jean Barré (1880-1967), he published a major work titled &quot;Travaux neurologiques de guerre&quot;, a book that described the two doctors&#x27; clinical experiences during wartime. He was a member of French, American and Japanese academies of science, and in 1949 was appointed commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. He died in Paris at age 85. 

His daughter, Andrée, married the aircraft manufacturer Claude de Cambronne.

During World War I, he worked in a neurological unit of the 6th army, directed by Georges Guillain (1876-1961), with whom he began a longtime collaboration. In 1919 he was appointed professor of neurology in Strasbourg.

He was especially interested in vestibular function and disorders associated with the vestibular system. He was founder of the journal &quot;Revue d’oto-neuro-ophtalmologie&quot;.

== Barré test ==
Barré is also credited with the &quot;Barré Test&quot; which may identify pronator drift or pyramidal drift, although the test was earlier described by Giovanni Mingazzini. This test is performed by making the patient stretch out their hands with the palms facing upwards, and then having the patient close their eyes. If one hand drops involuntarily (or drops after the physician taps on the patient&#x27;s palms), the test indicates damage to the pyramidal tract. A maneuver that is sometimes used for examining the legs for latent pyramidal paresis is referred to as the &quot;Mingazzini test&quot; (named after Italian neurologist Giovanni Mingazzini 1859-1929).

== Written works ==
Barré was the author of over 800 scientific papers. With Guillain, he was co-author of &quot;Travaux neurologiques de guerre&quot; (1920), a book that was published in three editions. His doctoral thesis, &quot;Les osteo-arthropathies du tabès&quot;, was a continuation of Jean Charcot&#x27;s research of the disorder. Barré died in 1967 at age 86.

<text>Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey (7 April 1781 – 25 November 1841) was an English sculptor. He became the leading portrait sculptor in Regency era Britain, producing busts and statues of many notable figures of the time. Chantrey&#x27;s most notable works include the statues of King George IV (Trafalgar Square); King George III (Guildhall), and George Washington (Massachusetts State House). He also executed four monuments to military heroes for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. He left the &quot;Chantrey Bequest&quot; (or &quot;Chantrey Fund&quot;) for the purchase of works of art for the nation, which was available from 1878 after the death of his widow.

==Life==

Chantrey was born at Jordanthorpe near Norton (then a Derbyshire village, now a suburb of Sheffield), where his family had a small farm.
His father, who also dabbled in carpentry and wood-carving, died when Francis was twelve; and his mother remarried, leaving him without a clear career to follow. At fifteen, he was working for a grocer in Sheffield, when, having seen some wood-carving in a shop-window, he asked to be apprenticed as a carver instead, and was placed with a woodcarver and gilder called Ramsay in Sheffield. 

At Ramsay&#x27;s house he met the draughtsman and engraver John Raphael Smith who recognised his artistic potential and gave him lessons in painting, and was later to help advance his career by introducing him to potential patrons. 

In 1802, Chantrey paid £50 to buy himself out of his apprenticeship with Ramsay and immediately set up a studio as a portrait artist in Sheffield, which allowed him a reasonable income.

For several years he divided his time between Sheffield and London, studying intermittently at the Royal Academy Schools. In the summer of 1802, he travelled to Dublin, where he fell very ill, losing all his hair. He exhibited pictures at the Royal Academy for a few years from 1804, but from 1807 onwards devoted himself mainly to sculpture. 

Asked later in life, as a witness in a court case, whether he had ever worked for any other sculptors, he replied: &quot;No, and what is more, I never had an hour&#x27;s instruction from any sculptor in my life&quot;.

His first recorded marble bust was one of the Rev. James Wilkinson (1805–06), for Sheffield parish church. His first imaginative sculpture, a head of Satan was shown at the Royal Academy in 1808. 

In 1809, the architect Daniel Asher Alexander commissioned him to make four monumental plaster busts of the admirals Duncan, Howe, Vincent and Nelson for the Royal Naval Asylum at Greenwich, for which he received £10 each. Three of them were shown at the Royal Academy that year.

On 23 November 1809, he married his cousin, Mary Ann Wale at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Twickenham. By this time he was settled permanently in London, His wife brought £10,000 into the marriage, which allowed Chantrey to pay off his debts, and for the couple to move into a house at 13 Eccleston Street, Pimlico, (recorded as Chantrey&#x27;s address in the Royal Academy catalogues from 1810). He also bought land to build two more houses, a studio and offices. In 1811, he showed six busts in the Royal Academy. 

The subjects included Horne Tooke and Sir Francis Burdett, two political figures he greatly admired; his early mentor John Raphael Smith, and Benjamin West. Joseph Nollekens placed the bust of Tooke between two of his own, and the prominence given to it is said to have had a significant influence on Chantrey&#x27;s career. In the wake of the exhibition he received commissions amounting to £12,000. In 1813 he was able to raise his price for a bust to a hundred and fifty guineas, and in 1822 to two hundred.

He visited Paris in 1814, and again in 1815, this time with his wife, Thomas Stothard, and D. A. Alexander, visiting the Louvre where he especially admired the works of Raphael and Titian. In 1819 he went to Italy, accompanied by the painter John Jackson, and an old friend named Read. In Rome he met Thorvaldsen and Canova, getting to know the latter especially well.

In 1828 Chantrey set up his own foundry in Eccleston Place, not far from his house and studio, where large-scale works in bronze, including equestrian statues, could be cast.

==Working practices==

Chantrey developed a procedure of making a portrait sculpture in which he would begin by making two life-sized drawings of his sitter&#x27;s head, one full-face and one in profile, with the aid of a &quot;camera lucida&quot;. His assistants would then make a clay model based on the drawings, to which Chantrey would add the finishing touches in front of the sitter. A plaster cast would be made of the clay model, and then a marble replica made of that. Allan Cunningham and Henry Weekes were his chief assistants, and made many of the works produced under Chantrey&#x27;s name. The debilitating effects of heart disease made him even more reliant on assistants in the last few years of his life.

==Style==
Chantrey was rare among the leading sculptors of his time in not having visited Italy at a formative stage in his career. A writer in Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Magazine&quot; in 1820 saw him as liberating English sculpture from foreign influence:Those who wish to trace the return of English sculpture from the foreign artificial and allegorical style, to its natural and original character—from cold and conceited fiction to tender and elevated truth, will find it chiefly in the history of Francis Chantrey and his productions. 

More recently, Margaret Whinney wrote that Chantrey &quot;had a great gift for characterisation, his ability to render the softness of flesh was much admired&quot; and that &quot;though compelled by the fashion of the day to produce, on occasions, classicizing works, his robust common sense and his enormous talent is better displayed in works which combine an almost classical simplicity of form with naturalism in presentation&quot;.

==Works==
Chantrey was a prolific sculptor. According to an article published in 1842, he produced, besides his busts and reliefs, three equestrian statues, 18 standing ones, 18 seated ones and 14 recumbent figures. His most notable works include the statues of George III in The Guildhall, London; of George Washington in the State-house at Boston, Massachusetts; of George IV at Brighton (in bronze); of William Pitt the Younger in Hanover Square, London (in bronze); of James Watt in Westminster Abbey and in Greenock (also a bust, plus one of William Murdoch, at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth); of William Roscoe and George Canning in Liverpool; of John Dalton in Manchester Town Hall; of Lord President Blair and Lord Melville in Edinburgh.

He made a bronze equestrian statue of Sir Thomas Munro for Madras (now Chennai) and another of King George IV, originally commissioned, on the instructions of the king himself, to stand on top of the Marble Arch, in front of Buckingham Palace, but eventually placed in Trafalgar Square. The horses in these two works are identical. A third, of the Duke of Wellington for a site in front of the Royal Exchange in London, was completed after Chantrey&#x27;s death.
He executed four monuments to military heroes for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral: they commemorate Major-General Daniel Hoghton, Major-General Barnard Foord Bowes, and Colonel Henry Cadogan, and (in a single monument) Major-Generals Arthur Gore and John Byne Skerrett. He was also responsible for the memorials to Sir James Brisbane in St James&#x27; Church, Sydney and to Reginald Heber in Calcutta, a replica of which was made for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Other good examples of his church monuments are those to the Earl of Farnham (1826) in Urney Parish Church, Cavan and Mary Anne Boulton (1834) in Great Tew In Snaith church there is a notable monument to Viscount Downe by Chantrey.

One of his most famous works was &quot;The Sleeping Children&quot;, a monument to two girls of the Robinson family, depicting them asleep in one another&#x27;s arms, the younger holding a bunch of snowdrops. It attracted a great deal of attention when shown at the Royal Academy in 1817, before its installation in Lichfield Cathedral. The design of the monument was widely rumoured to be by Thomas Stothard; Chantrey&#x27;s biographer, James Holland, however gave more credence to another account of its history, according to which Stothard had merely made a drawing from Chantrey&#x27;s preliminary model. Another popular work, much reproduced, was a small statue, made for Woburn Abbey of the young Louisa, Lady Russell, depicted cradling a dove.

The Derby Museum has an unusual bust of William Strutt.

==Honours==
Chantrey was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1816 and a full Academician in 1818. In 1822 Henry Wolsey Bayfield named Chantry Island in Ontario after him. He received the degree of MA from Cambridge, and that of DCL from Oxford, and was knighted in 1835.

==Death==
He died suddenly at his home in Eccleston Street, Pimlico, London, on 25 November 1841, having suffered from heart disease for some years. He was buried in a tomb constructed by his assistant James Heffernan in the churchyard of his native village, Norton in Derbyshire (now a suburb of Sheffield).

==Bequest==

By his will, dated 31 December 1840, Chantrey (who had no children) left his whole residuary personal estate after the decease or on the second marriage of his widow (less certain specified annuities and bequests) in trust for the president and trustees of the Royal Academy (or in the event of its dissolution to such society as might take its place), the income to be devoted to the encouragement of British painting and sculpture, by &quot;the purchase of works of fine art of the highest merit ... that can be obtained.&quot; The funds might be allowed to accumulate for not more than five years; works by British or foreign artists, dead or living, might be acquired, so long as such works were entirely executed within Great Britain, the artists having been in residence there during the execution and completion. The prices to be paid were to be &quot;liberal,&quot; and no sympathy for an artist or his family was to influence the selection or the purchase of works, which were to be acquired solely on the ground of intrinsic merit. No commission or orders might be given: the works must be finished before purchase. Conditions were made as to the exhibition of the works, in the confident expectation that the government or the country would provide a suitable gallery for their display; and an annual sum of £300 and £50 was to be paid to the president and the secretary of the Royal Academy respectively, for the discharge of their duties in carrying out the provisions of the will.
Lady Chantrey died in 1875 and was buried with George Jones in Highgate Cemetery, and two years later the fund became available for the purchase of paintings and sculptures. The capital sum available amounted to £105,000 in 3% Consols (reduced to 2½% in 1903), which was producing an available annual income varying between £2,100 and £2,500 by around 1910. Initially the works acquired were shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum, but in 1898 the Royal Academy arranged with the treasury, on behalf of the government, for the transfer of the collection to the National Gallery of British Art, which had been erected by Sir Henry Tate at Millbank. It was agreed that the Tate Gallery should be its future home, but that the trustees and director of the National Gallery should have no power over what works were to be transferred there, or added to the collection at a later date.

By the end of 1905, 203 works had been bought—all but two from living artists—at a cost of nearly £68,000. Of these, 175 were oil paintings, 12 were watercolours, and 16 were sculptures. The bequest remained the main source of funding for expanding the collection of what is now Tate Britain until the 1920s, and it remains active today.

<doc id="223063" wikidata="Q816754" url="?curid=223063" title="Benchmarking">
<text>Benchmarking is the practice of comparing business processes and performance metrics to industry bests and best practices from other companies. Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost.

Benchmarking is used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.

Also referred to as &quot;best practice benchmarking&quot; or &quot;process benchmarking&quot;, this process is used in management in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their processes in relation to best-practice companies&#x27; processes, usually within a peer group defined for the purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.

In project management benchmarking can also support the selection, planning and delivery of projects.

In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied (the &quot;targets&quot;) to one&#x27;s own results and processes. In this way, they learn how well the targets perform and, more importantly, the business processes that explain why these firms are successful. According to National Council on Measurement in Education, benchmark assessments are short assessments used by teachers at various times throughout the school year to monitor student progress in some area of the school curriculum. These also are known as interim government.

In 1994, one of the first technical journals named &quot;Benchmarking&quot; was published.

== History ==
The term benchmark, originates from the history of guns and ammunition, in regards to the same aim as for the business term: comparison and improved performance. The introduction of gunpowder arms replaced the bow and arrow from the archer, who now had to learn to handle a gun. The new weapon left only a mark on the target, where the arrow used to be visible, and with the bow gone, the soldiers title changed to marksman, the man who put the mark. The gun improved in the early beginning with rifled barrels. With the industrialization of the weapon industry in the mid-1800s, the mass production of ammunition as a cartridge replaced the manual loading. Now, with standardized production of both the high-precision rifle and its cartridge, the marksman&#x27;s accuracy became the bottleneck. With different qualities and specifications on rifles and ammunition, there grew a need to test both. The rifled weapon was fixed in a bench, making it possible to fire several identical shots at a target to measure the spread. 

In 2008, a comprehensive survey on benchmarking was commissioned by The Global Benchmarking Network, a network of benchmarking centres representing 22 countries.

# Mission and Vision Statements and Customer (Client) Surveys are the most used (by 77% of organizations) of 20 improvement tools, followed by SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) (72%), and Informal Benchmarking (68%). Performance Benchmarking was used by 49% and Best Practice Benchmarking by 39%.
# The tools that are likely to increase in popularity the most over the next three years are Performance Benchmarking, Informal Benchmarking, SWOT, and Best Practice Benchmarking. Over 60% of organizations that are not currently using these tools indicated they are likely to use them in the next three years. Benchmarking mainly depends on SWOT analysis and will also be using in future for almost 4–5 years.

== Procedure ==
There is no single benchmarking process that has been universally adopted. The wide appeal and acceptance of benchmarking has led to the emergence of benchmarking methodologies. One seminal book is Boxwell&#x27;s &quot;Benchmarking for Competitive Advantage&quot; (1994). The first book on benchmarking, written and published by Kaiser Associates, is a practical guide and offers a seven-step approach. Robert Camp (who wrote one of the earliest books on benchmarking in 1989) developed a 12-stage approach to benchmarking.

The 12 stage methodology consists of:
# Select subject
# Define the process
# Identify potential partners
# Identify data sources
# Collect data and select all partners
# Determine the gap
# Establish process differences
# Target future performance
# Communicate
# Adjust goal
# Implement
# Review and recalibrate

The following is an example of a typical benchmarking methodology:

* Identify problem areas: Because benchmarking can be applied to any business process or function, a range of research techniques may be required. They include informal conversations with customers, employees, or suppliers; exploratory research techniques such as focus groups; or in-depth marketing research, quantitative research, surveys, questionnaires, re-engineering analysis, process mapping, quality control variance reports, financial ratio analysis, or simply reviewing cycle times or other performance indicators. Before embarking on comparison with other organizations it is essential to know the organization&#x27;s function and processes; base lining performance provides a point against which improvement effort can be measured.
* Identify other industries that have similar processes: For instance, if one were interested in improving hand-offs in addiction treatment one would identify other fields that also have hand-off challenges. These could include air traffic control, cell phone switching between towers, transfer of patients from surgery to recovery rooms.
* Identify organizations that are leaders in these areas: Look for the very best in any industry and in any country. Consult customers, suppliers, financial analysts, trade associations, and magazines to determine which companies are worthy of study.
* Survey companies for measures and practices: Companies target specific business processes using detailed surveys of measures and practices used to identify business process alternatives and leading companies. Surveys are typically masked to protect confidential data by neutral associations and consultants.
* Visit the &quot;best practice&quot; companies to identify leading edge practices: Companies typically agree to mutually exchange information beneficial to all parties in a benchmarking group and share the results within the group.
* Implement new and improved business practices: Take the leading edge practices and develop implementation plans which include identification of specific opportunities, funding the project and selling the ideas to the organization for the purpose of gaining demonstrated value from the process.

==Cost==
The three main types of costs in benchmarking are:
* Visit Costs - This includes hotel rooms, travel costs, meals, a token gift, and lost labor time.
* Time Costs - Members of the benchmarking team will be investing time in researching problems, finding exceptional companies to study, visits, and implementation. This will take them away from their regular tasks for part of each day so additional staff might be required.
* Benchmarking Database Costs - Organizations that institutionalize benchmarking into their daily procedures find it is useful to create and maintain a database of best practices and the companies associated with each best practice now.

The cost of benchmarking can substantially be reduced through utilizing the many internet resources that have sprung up over the last few years. These aim to capture benchmarks and best practices from organizations, business sectors and countries to make the benchmarking process much quicker and cheaper.

== Technical/product benchmarking ==
The technique initially used to compare existing corporate strategies with a view to achieving the best possible performance in new situations (see above), has recently been extended to the comparison of technical products. This process is usually referred to as &quot;technical benchmarking&quot; or &quot;product benchmarking&quot;. Its use is well-developed within the automotive industry (&quot;automotive benchmarking&quot;), where it is vital to design products that match precise user expectations, at minimal cost, by applying the best technologies available worldwide. Data is obtained by fully disassembling existing cars and their systems. Such analyses were initially carried out in-house by car makers and their suppliers. However, as these analyses are expensive, they are increasingly being outsourced to companies who specialize in this area. Outsourcing has enabled a drastic decrease in costs for each company (by cost sharing) and the development of efficient tools (standards, software).

== Types ==
Benchmarking can be internal (comparing performance between different groups or teams within an organization) or external (comparing performance with companies in a specific industry or across industries). Within these broader categories, there are three specific types of benchmarking: 1) Process benchmarking, 2) Performance benchmarking and 3) Strategic benchmarking. These can be further detailed as follows:
* - the initiating firm focuses its observation and investigation of business processes with a goal of identifying and observing the best practices from one or more benchmark firms. Activity analysis will be required where the objective is to benchmark cost and efficiency; increasingly applied to back-office processes where outsourcing may be a consideration. Benchmarking is appropriate in nearly every case where process redesign or improvement is to be undertaking so long as the cost of the study does not exceed the expected benefit.
* - performing a financial analysis and comparing the results in an effort to assess your overall competitiveness and productivity.
*Benchmarking from an investor perspective- extending the benchmarking universe to also compare to peer companies that can be considered alternative investment opportunities from the perspective of an investor.
*Benchmarking in the public sector - functions as a tool for improvement and innovation in public administration, where state organizations invest efforts and resources to achieve quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the services they provide.
*Performance benchmarking - allows the initiator firm to assess their competitive position by comparing products and services with those of target firms.
* - the process of designing new products or upgrades to current ones. This process can sometimes involve reverse engineering which is taking apart competitors products to find strengths and weaknesses.
* Strategic benchmarking- involves observing how others compete. This type is usually not industry specific, meaning it is best to look at other industries, i.e. Strategic Benchmarking with the help of (Profit impact of marketing strategy).
* Functional benchmarking - a company will focus its benchmarking on a single function to improve the operation of that particular function. Complex functions such as Human Resources, Finance and Accounting and Information and Communication Technology are unlikely to be directly comparable in cost and efficiency terms and may need to be disaggregated into processes to make valid comparison.
*Best-in-class benchmarking - involves studying the leading competitor or the company that best carries out a specific function.
*Operational benchmarking embraces everything from staffing and productivity to office flow and analysis of procedures performed.
*Energy benchmarking - process of collecting, analysing and relating energy performance data of comparable activities with the purpose of evaluating and comparing performance between or within entities. Entities can include processes, buildings or companies. Benchmarking may be internal between entities within a single organization, or - subject to confidentiality restrictions - external between competing entities.
* Internal benchmarking
* Collaborative benchmarking
* Competitive benchmarking

== Tools ==

Benchmarking software can be used to organize large and complex amounts of information. Software packages can extend the concept of benchmarking and competitive analysis by allowing individuals to handle such large and complex amounts or strategies. Such tools support different types of benchmarking (see above) and can reduce the above costs significantly.

The emerging technology of benchmarking engines automates the stage of going from data to noteworthy comparative insights, sometimes even expressing the insights in English sentences.

== Metric benchmarking ==
Another approach to making comparisons involves using more aggregative cost or production information to identify strong and weak performing units. The two most common forms of quantitative analysis used in metric benchmarking are data envelopment analysis (DEA) and regression analysis. DEA estimates the cost level an efficient firm should be able to achieve in a particular market. In infrastructure regulation, DEA сan be used to reward companies/operators whose costs are near the efficient frontier with additional profits. Regression analysis estimates what the average firm should be able to achieve. With regression analysis, firms that performed better than average can be rewarded while firms that performed worse than average can be penalized. Such benchmarking studies are used to create yardstick comparisons, allowing outsiders to evaluate the performance of operators in an industry. Advanced statistical techniques, including stochastic frontier analysis, have been used to identify high and weak performers in industries, including applications to schools, hospitals, water utilities, and electric utilities.

One of the biggest challenges for metric benchmarking is the variety of metric definitions used among companies or divisions. Definitions may change over time within the same organization due to changes in leadership and priorities. The most useful comparisons can be made when metrics definitions are common between compared units and do not change so improvements can be changed.

== Social media and benchmarking ==

Social media is beginning to penetrate more and more into existing business processes. In this sense, benchmarking is no exception. Because of their inherent characteristics, it can even be argued that social media will have a significant impact on benchmarking. Here are some of the benefits associated with this.

* Joint benchmarking is, in fact, a social activity, and social media provide many new and effective ways for social interaction.
* Social media opens the way to new additional sources of information and data collection channels.
* Benchmarking is becoming increasingly business-oriented, and social media is supporting this type of continuous engagement, different from working on individual projects.

<text>Emmanuel Pahud (born 27 January 1970) is a Franco-Swiss flautist.

He was born in Geneva, Switzerland. His father is of French and Swiss background and his mother is French. The Berlin-based flutist is most known for his baroque and classical flute repertoire.

Pahud was born into a nonmusical family.
As a young boy living in Italy, Pahud was captivated by the sounds of the flute.
From the age of four to the age of 22, he studied with flutists such as François Binet, Carlos Bruneel and Aurèle Nicolet.
Classically trained at the Conservatoire de Paris, he leapt into the international orchestral and solo music scene when he joined the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1992.
His versatility in music styles over the years has &quot;signalled the arrival of a new master flautist&quot; (The Guardian). He plays in diverse music genres, whether baroque, jazz, contemporary, classical, orchestral, or chamber music.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Travelling has been a big part of Emmanuel Pahud&#x27;s life from birth. His father worked for a US company, and the family moved repeatedly during his childhood. However, this would only shape Pahud&#x27;s international outlook for his future. Only six weeks after Pahud was born, his parents moved to Baghdad for one year. They moved again when he was one to Paris, where Emmanuel&#x27;s younger brother was born. In 1972, they then moved to Madrid for two years, and in 1974, finally settled in Rome for four years. The Swiss-French Binet family, whose four children played musical instruments, lived in the same apartment building in Rome. The father (François) was a flautist who studied in Zürich and Paris but stopped performing in later years. At the age of four, Pahud first heard the flute. As the eldest son Philippe played Mozart&#x27;s Flute Concerto No. 1, it set the course to a remarkable chapter of Pahud&#x27;s life. He recalls: 
I could hear the flute, the violin, the cello, the piano. I don&#x27;t know why I chose the flute but maybe it was because the eldest son was playing it, so he was the one playing at the best level at that time – or because the father was also a flute player, so there was a kind of authority there. Anyhow, I said to my parents, &quot;I want to play the flute, I want to play the Mozart concerto that guy next door is practicing.&quot; That Christmas, after receiving his first flute, Pahud began his first year of lessons with Philippe (who was only 15 years old) and the next three years with Phillipe&#x27;s father, François.
In 1978, at the age of eight, the Pahud family moved to Brussels, Belgium. Emmanuel then began studying at the &quot;Music Academy of Uccle&quot; in Southern Brussels. There he studied with Michel Moinil from 1979 to 1985. As he became more determined and focused on playing the flute at a higher level, Pahud began to study from 1984 to 1987 with Carlos Bruneel, the then and current principal flautist of the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie opera house in Brussels. In 1985, Pahud won the National Competition of Belgium (&quot;le concours National de Belgique&quot;) and in the same year, he played his first concert with the National Orchestra of Belgium, performing the piece that inspired him 11 years earlier: Mozart Concerto K.313 in G Major. Pahud remained in Brussels until receiving his A-Level at the age of 17 and went off to finish his schooling in Paris. With the strong support of his family, he also received lessons with other of Europe&#x27;s finest players, including Peter-Lukas Graf in Basel.

===Studies and early accomplishments===
Pahud attended the Conservatoire de Paris (&quot;Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris&quot;) in France, studying with Michel Debost, Alain Marion, Pierre-Yves Artaud, and Christian Lardé. Whilst studying, he won two major competitions, one in Duino 1988 and the other in Kobe in 1989. In 1988, Emmanuel also won the 2nd Prize at the International Scheveningen Music Competition in Scheveningen, Netherlands. Winning these competitions put Pahud in the forefront to become principal flautist in the Basel Radio Symphony, under the direction of Nello Santi which he obtained the position in 1989 whilst finishing his studies in Paris. He resigned from the orchestra in 1992. Pahud also held the principal flautist position at the Munich Philharmonic under Sergiu Celibidache.
Pahud graduated at the age of 20 from the Conservatoire in 1990, obtaining the First Prize (Premier Prix). He then continued to advance his studies for the next two years in style and interpretation with one of France&#x27;s greatest flautists, Swiss-born Aurèle Nicolet, who turned out to be his neighbour. In 1992, Nicolet prepared Pahud in an extensive 10-day rehearsal for both the Geneva International Music Competition, or le Concours International de Genève in September of that year and the audition for principal flautist of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) in October. He attributes achieving both the first prize at le Concours International de Genève and being appointed for the position at the age of 22 by BPO&#x27;s conductor, Claudio Abbado, to his experience with Nicolet.

==Career==

===Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra===
Being appointed as principal flutist at the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) signalled Pahud&#x27;s entrance into the international spotlight. He entered the orchestra during its rejuvenation period as the post-war generation of players began to retire. Over 40 per cent, including Pahud&#x27;s position was up for audition, or on trial. His predecessor was Karlheinz Zöller (1960–69, 1976–93). Apart from Pahud, other previous international flutists held the same principal flutist position such as Aurèle Nicolet (1950–59) and Sir James Galway (1969–75). Pahud wrote of his experience playing with the orchestra:
There was a way of phrasing and wave that goes throughout the orchestra, coming from the bass and shaping the phrase with amazing beauty and intensity. The dynamic range of the orchestra was phenomenal. The art of playing with the Berlin Phil is very different compared to other Orchestras, where we work as equals with our individual voice. Pahud at 22 was the youngest player in the Berlin Philharmonic, a position to which he returned in 2002 under Sir Simon Rattle after taking an 18-month sabbatical in 2000 in order to teach the Virtuosity Class at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève for one year and to perform in concerts worldwide. He was surprised on how emotional it was to leave the BPO. He recalls his emotions beginning a couple of hours before playing his last concert and only leaving him once he rejoined BPO in 2002. The versatility and authority of current conductor Sir Simon Rattle, says Pahud, gives the orchestra a unique working partnership and a capacity to be more adventurous in its exploration of repertoire. He also sees Rattle as an intellect; &quot;he knows the orchestra and he achieves what he wants by taking into account the &quot;vision&quot; of the musicians. In addition, Pahud also observed that whilst the former conductor Herbert von Karajan &quot;produced a big string sound with a great legato. The &quot;Rattle sound&quot; is a very transparent and constructed sound, with much more articulation to achieve definition in the sound.&quot; In baroque and classical music, this represents the influence of period performance.
The Berlin Philharmonic these days considers themselves a very individualist and soloistic &quot;large ensemble.&quot; In 2007, Pahud was voted onto the Media Vorstand (or the Member of the Media Board) of the BPO. He shared the principal flute position with Mathieu Dufour until 2022, when Dufour was replaced by Sébastian Jacot.

===International appearances===
Pahud&#x27;s workload has more than tripled since the early days of his international career in 1992. At that time he was doing about 50 concerts a year – but with the success of his solo career and continued involvement with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, that number has spiralled to around 160: 90 solo or chamber music and 75 orchestral concerts in an average year – roughly twice the number of performances that most musicians would consider a heavy work-load. Pahud says that it&#x27;s a balance he has had all his life and what prevents him from being isolated in one genre or repertoire of music, or what he calls &quot;a musical corner&quot;.

In 1993, Pahud began accepting international concert performances soon after settling into his position in Berlin. He has appeared as soloist with internationally renowned orchestras in addition to the Berlin Philharmonic: the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, the Geneva Camerata the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Danish Radio Symphony also known as the Danish National Symphony Orchestra. He also appears regularly at leading festivals throughout Europe, the United States and the Far East. His more famous international concerto appearances and collaborations of the past few seasons (2005–2008) included the Berlin Philharmonic, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the NHK Symphony Orchestra, the Berliner Barock-Solisten, the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre National de Belgique, the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France and a US tour with the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (including a Carnegie Hall debut). Another famous concerto collaboration took place in 2005–2006 with the Australian Chamber Orchestra in reviving the Vivaldi Flute Concertos.

Pahud is also a dedicated chamber musician and has recently made international appearances throughout Europe, North America and Japan in recital with pianists Éric Le Sage and Stephen Kovacevich as well as in a flute and string quartet formation with Christoph Poppen (violin), Hariolf Schichtig (viola) and Jean-Guihen Queyras (cello) with whom he recorded his 1999 record &quot;Mozart Flute Quartets&quot;. In 1993, he co-founded &quot;Le festival de l&#x27;Empéri&quot; in Salon-de-Provence, France, along with his regular chamber music partners pianist Éric Le Sage (close friend and confidant) and Paul Meyer. In a French interview, Pahud describes the success of the festival as a project &quot;filled with enthusiasm and fun&quot; where the public has &quot;recognised our work, our fellow artists, musicians and actors and have the desire to come back regularly.&quot; He also describes the festival as a &quot;musical laboratory&quot; which avoids the programming of works that the public are used to hearing in concert halls. It is about &quot;daring to combine performers, works (music), create new collaborations and by taking risks. Pahud has made several recordings and performed internationally with pianist Éric Le Sage throughout his career. In 2008 he performed for the first time at the Jerusalem International Chamber Music Festival, where he played in the world premier of Elliott Carter&#x27;s Flute Concerto, conducted by Daniel Barenboim. He returned to the Festival on 2009 to play in a series of concerts.

===Musical styles and recordings===
Pahud describes his versatility over the years in music, as transforming himself into a chameleon who tries to match the colour of the music, or the idea he has of it, to what the composer had in mind. But his discography and career have also been built on encounters—both professionally and in human relationships. He expresses in playing like a chameleon, &quot;I try to change style, colour and phrasing, the way I breathe and articulate to suit the piece I am playing. I do not represent any particular national style.&quot; Pahud seems himself as a performer/actor rather than a composer/creator. For the Dalbavie Record (2008) Pahud dedicated himself to commissioning new works and to new flute concertos, performing them for the first time on stage. Three composers were selected: Marc-André Dalbavie (French), Michael Jarrell (Swiss), and Matthias Pintscher (German) reflecting Pahud as a French and Swiss citizen living in Germany for over 15 years. Whilst working with German Composer, Matthias Pintscher, Pahud sought to explore a new level and style of playing the flute. He recalls:
We spent some time talking about the effects and about the special way of using the instrument. The most interesting thing is how you interconnect these various effects [from an instrument] that is one of the oldest on earth. Whether you blow on it, in it, or you use it as a trumpet or a recorder, you can have a lot of different sounds on such an instrument. But that&#x27;s nothing new about it, the new thing is how you can combine them and how you can get them to interconnect so that it becomes one musical statement, one phrase. In March 2008 Pahud performed the world première of another work commissioned by Frank Michael Beyer, who composed &quot;Meridian&quot;, a Concerto for Flute &amp; String Ensemble. Other world premières include music composed by Elliott Carter: Concerto for Flute &amp; Ensemble, which Pahud premièred in September 2008 in Jerusalem. It was joint commissioned by the BPO, Jerusalem International Chamber Music Festival and Boston Symphony Orchestra. Pahud will world première the Flute Concerto by Luca Lombardi in 2010, commissioned by the Kansas City Symphony.

Though he is an enthusiastic consumer and commissioner of new music, Pahud sounds most excited when relishing the old repertoire. &quot;Mastery of an instrument helps you to sense new barriers. This is where you keep music moving,&quot; and he acknowledges his various experiences with newer flute compositions as benefiting the way he performs his traditional repertoire. Pahud sees the future of interpretation (of music) will always be a blend of &quot;tradition and novelty.&quot; But to him, this concept is not a novelty in itself. Many composers have evolved from traditions such as Bach for Fortepiano and Beethoven for the Hammerklavier. Pahud sees the term &quot;tradition&quot; as often being used to disguise the past, a lack of evolution or in denial of progress. But to him, the meaning of tradition is something &quot;evolving&quot;. He adds, &quot;Artists such as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Herbert von Karajan, Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle (conductors of BPO) were or are in line with tradition and make it evolve. In complete unconsciousness they feed from the past to define the future. That is one of the secrets of these great artists.&quot;

In most interviews, Pahud describes music/musical styles in terms of &quot;phrasing&quot; or a Phrase. In musical terms, this refers to &quot;a musical unit, often a component of a melody. The phrase may be regarded as a dependent division of music, such as a single line of poetry; it does not have a sense of completion in itself. Usually two or more phrases balance each other.&quot; It is like a grammatical construction with words to stress. Musical phrasing is also expressed in terms of how the music is executed. In terms of style of the Dalbavie concerto itself, Pahud reflects how the flute finds a resonance within the orchestra whilst maintaining its virtuosic, colourful and sensual phrasing. In interpreting the poetic style of Jarrell, where the imagination of both the composer and of the audience are &quot;immensely present,&quot; Pahud describes, &quot;This is something to me I like a lot in music is exactly what you cannot express with words but that it&#x27;s all there in the essence of the music.&quot; On reflecting the style of the famous flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal, &quot;[Rampal] brought something new and unusual in terms of sound, class and grandeur of the expressive aspect of the flute. He was able to perform admirable phrases that never seemed to end, or how the breathing faded into the musical flow; and his ability to make the sound of the flute seem to extend endlessly, infinitely.&quot;

Pahud&#x27;s debut into the world of jazz came through meeting and collaborating with jazz pianist Jacky Terrasson. He admires and derives inspiration from jazz flutists such as James Newton, James Moody, Herbie Mann, and Jeremy Steig. He has explored jazz further through performing big band music with friends and colleagues from the Berlin Philharmonic and local jazz musicians. Pahud&#x27;s collaboration with Jacky Terrasson resulted in a duo CD titled &quot;Into the Blue,&quot; with performances including original takes on Bolero, Apres un Reve, and the Bolling Suite among others. Other personnel on the project included Sean Smith and Ali Jackson (drums). Other examples of his vast interests in innovative musical genres include so-called &quot;one-time projects&quot; (as Pahud calls them); most recently in 2006, it included a collaboration project with the NHK Symphony Orchestra of a recorded original soundtrack for the NHK Taiga series &quot;Komyo ga Tsuji&quot; (Jp: 功名が辻).

For the many that come to see Pahud perform, either jazz or classical, it is not only about entertaining. Pahud reflects on his audiences being able to learn about music at his performances; it is about reacting at different levels and ranges of emotions. To Pahud, it is about interacting, connecting and enabling the audience to think about what is happening as the music is being played. He wants to open opportunities in developing curiosity to discover more about music as a way of &quot;giving back&quot; to the audience.

In 1996 he signed an exclusive contract with EMI Classics, the only flutist in the world to have a solo recording contract with a major record company. Pahud promises to be one of the most significant contributors to the catalogue of recorded flute music today. Nowadays much of his time is taken up with recording. He extended his contract with EMI for a further six years. Recording adds a welcome diversity to Pahud&#x27;s schedule:
I like to work for the mic – it brings a certain close-up on your playing. You have to take care of lots of things that you do not necessarily have to take care of when you are performing in a live concert hall. You don&#x27;t have the emotional or the visual support, and you have to be exciting nevertheless. So at the same time you have to take greater care of the detail and bring a greater intensity to the music. Pahud has recorded and/or collaborated a total of 24 discs for EMI.

===Instrument===

Pahud&#x27;s first flute was a silver-plated Yamaha. His parents later bought him two Muramatsu Flutes, one half hand-made and the other fully hand-made. Pahud previously played on a 14-karat golden flute which he bought from Brannen Brothers in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1989 with money he won from competitions. Two weeks later he bought a head joint (the part into which the player blows) from Dana Sheridan, another Boston flute manufacturer. Pahud chose the Brannen flute body because it is one of the only flute makers that produce a decent Cooper scale, based on the scales developed by Albert Cooper. He describes his instrument:
This is the most flexible instrument I have tried so far. It enables me to transpose into music what I&#x27;m thinking and what I&#x27;m feeling. But, although the instrument is important, the player is the most important. All the work must be done before the mouth even makes contact with the instrument. It all happens by the way you hold your muscles, control your lungs, use the different cavities in the head and the upper body to let the sound resonate more or less. 
Pahud now plays a solid 14-karat Haynes flute with a pinless mechanism, having previously played a solid 14-karat Brannen-Cooper flute with a Sheridan head joint from 1989 to 2012.
===Personal life===
Pahud has two sons, Grégoire and Tristan, from a former marriage.

<text>James Moffat (27 January 1922 – 8 November 1993) was a Canadian-born British writer who wrote at least 290 novels in several genres under at least 45 pseudonyms&quot;.

Moffat produced many pot-boiler paperbacks novels for the United Kingdom publishing house New English Library during the 1970s. Moffat&#x27;s pen names included Richard Allen, Etienne Aubin (&quot;The Terror of the Seven Crypts&quot;) and Trudi Maxwell (&quot;Diary of A Female Wrestler&quot;). Moffat&#x27;s pulp novels mostly focused on youth subcultures of the late 1960s and 1970s, such as skinheads, hippies and bikers. In particular, Moffat wrote a series of popular and commercially successful books featuring what came to be known as his most famous protagonist, the skinhead antihero Joe Hawkins. Moffat often expressed admiration for his subject matter and commented on social issues, mostly from a right-wing perspective.

The collected works of Richard Allen were reissued in a six-volume set by ST Publishing in the 1990s. A BBC TV documentary about his life, entitled &quot;Skinhead Farewell&quot;, aired in 1996. Mark Sargeant wrote a feature in &quot;Scootering Magazine&quot; titled &quot;The Richard Allen Legacy&quot;. An interview titled &quot;The Return of Joe Hawkins&quot; with publisher George Marshall was in issue seven of &quot;Skinhead Times&quot; (1992).

Under his own name, Moffat wrote at least two science fiction novels: &quot;The Sleeping Bomb&quot; (New English Library, 1970; US edition 1973, &quot;The Cambri Plot&quot;) and a &quot;Queen Kong&quot; (1977) a movie tie-in to the low-budget 1976 movie of that name.

<doc id="223093" wikidata="Q1756264" url="?curid=223093" title="Euphoria Morning">
<text>Euphoria Mourning (originally titled Euphoria Morning) is the first solo studio album by American musician Chris Cornell. It was released through A&amp;M Records on September 21, 1999, and Cornell embarked on a tour in support of the album in 2000. Cornell&#x27;s only album from between the dissolution of Soundgarden and the formation of Audioslave, it did not sell as well as much of his work with those groups, though it did sell over 75,000 copies in its first week of release and has gone on to sell over 393,000 copies in the U.S. The album was well-received critically, and its lead single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot;, was nominated for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.

On August 14, 2015, &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; was re-released on CD and vinyl with the modified title &quot;Euphoria Mourning&quot;, which Cornell stated in a press release is what he had originally intended to call the album.

==Production==

===Recording===
In 1998, Cornell began working on material for a solo album in collaboration with Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider of the band Eleven, and the album was recorded in Johannes and Schneider&#x27;s Los Angeles home studio.

===Track information===
Cornell said the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot;, is &quot;kind of a sad discovery that this singer is involved with this person that has amazing powers to help people and change things positively, and he&#x27;s realizing that none of it is really rubbing off on him.&quot; He told MTV News that the genesis of the song can be found in some of Soundgarden&#x27;s hits, such as &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot; and &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;. An alternate recording of the song featuring Cornell singing in French can be found on various international editions of the album. The lyrics were translated into French by Alexis Lemoine.

&quot;Flutter Girl&quot; was an outtake from &quot;Superunknown&quot;, the 1994 Soundgarden album. The title was created by Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament as part of a joke tracklist for the character Poncier&#x27;s demo tape in the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles, but Cornell surprised Crowe by writing and recording songs with the joke names. The five-track &quot;Poncier EP&quot;, which includes the 1992 version of &quot;Flutter Girl&quot;, was released as a promotional CD in 2015 for Record Store Day.

A reworked version of &quot;Mission&quot;, retitled &quot;Mission 2000&quot;, was included on of the 2000 film &quot;&quot;.

Cornell stated that &quot;Wave Goodbye&quot; was written as a tribute to his friend Jeff Buckley, who died in 1997.

&quot;Moonchild&quot; is about Cornell&#x27;s then-wife Susan Silver. In the song, he affectionately describes how she &quot;gets really freaked out during the full moon&quot;.

===Musical style===
The album has been described as &quot;psychedelic folk-rock&quot; that &quot;delves back into &#x27;60s psychedelic melodies and acoustic ditties&quot;, and &quot;a shaded, textured rock album, lacking the grinding sludge and furious rock&quot; of much of Soundgarden&#x27;s music, yet &quot;undeniably of a piece with &quot;Superunknown&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==

While the album was not a particularly big seller for Cornell, the single &quot;Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot; was nominated for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 42nd Grammy Awards.

The song &quot;Preaching the End of the World&quot; inspired the title of Lorene Scafaria&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&quot;.

==Re-release and title change==
The album was re-released on CD and vinyl on August 14, 2015, with the modified title &quot;Euphoria Mourning&quot;. Cornell said that is the title he had originally wanted for the album, but his manager at the time of the original release, Jim Guerinot, suggested that &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; (without the &quot;u&quot;) would be a better title:
It was a pretty dark album lyrically and pretty depressing, and I was going through a really difficult time in my life – my band wasn’t together anymore, my marriage was falling apart and I was dealing with it by drinking way too much, and that has its own problems, particularly with depression. So I titled the album &quot;Euphoria Mourning&quot;, but right before the record came out and I was doing interviews over the radio for example, if you say &quot;“Euphoria Mourning”&quot;, the listener doesn’t know if it’s mourning with a “u” or morning without a “u”. And that started to bother me. So I had a conversation with my manager at the time, and said I really love the title but do you think it’s confusing? And he suggested that &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; would probably be a better title. I thought, in contrast to the lyrics maybe that works. And it wasn’t my manager’s fault, I was a grown man and could say I don’t think that’s a good idea, and in the back of my mind I didn’t think it was a good idea. But mentally I wasn’t together enough to really know what was right. So I went with “Morning”, and it’s bothered me ever since. It even showed up in an early review where someone reviewing the record said that the title sounded like a potpourri scent, and when I read that I was just like [with disdain], “Fuck! Fuckin’ bullshit!” The title was so beautifully poetic to begin with, just the concept of euphoria in mourning; it was a moment I felt inspired and I let all the air out of it. So when we decided to do its first vinyl release I thought, I want to change the fuckin’ title! [Laughs] It’s time to change it.

<doc id="223102" wikidata="Q1652977" url="?curid=223102" title="I Corps (United States)">
<text>The I Corps is a corps of the United States Army headquartered in Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. It is a major formation of United States Army Pacific (USARPAC) and its current mission involves administrative oversight of army units in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Pacific Pathways program.

Activated in World War I in France, the I Corps oversaw US Army divisions as they repelled several major German offensives and advanced into Germany. The corps was deactivated following the end of the war. Reactivated for service in World War II, the corps took command of divisions in the south Pacific, leading US and Australian Army forces as they pushed the Japanese Army out of New Guinea. It went on to be one of the principal leading elements in the Battle of Luzon, liberating the Philippines. It then took charge as one of the administrative headquarters in the occupation of Japan.

Deployed to Korea at the start of the Korean War, the corps was one of three corps that remained in the country for the entire US participation in the conflict, commanding US, British, and South Korean forces through three years of back-and-forth campaigns against North Korean and Chinese forces. Following the end of the war, it remained in Korea for almost 20 years guarding the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Active today, the corps acts as a subordinate headquarters of United States Army Pacific, and has also seen deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

==History==
===World War I===
Following the American declaration of war on Germany, on 6 April 1917, the I Corps was organized and activated on 15–20 January 1918, in the National Army in Neufchâteau, France, the first of several corps-sized formations intended to command divisions of the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War I. Assisted by the French XXXII Corps, the headquarters was organized and trained; on 20 January, Major General Hunter Liggett took command.

In February, the corps consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 26th, 32nd, 41st, and 42nd Infantry Divisions. From February to July, 1918, the German Army launched four major offensives, attempting to secure victory before the full American forces could be mobilized. The final offensive, started in July 1918, was an attempt to cross the Marne, in the area of Château-Thierry, but the I Corps and other formations on the American lines held, and the attack was rebuffed.

With the defeat of these German drives, the I Corps conducted its first offensive mission, participating in the Second Battle of the Marne from 18 July until 6 August, which resulted in the reduction of the more important salients driven into Allied lines by the German offensives. After a brief period in the defensive sectors of Champagne and Lorraine between 7 August and 11 September, the corps took part in the St. Mihiel attack on 12 September, which reduced the German salient there during the next four days. Then followed another period on the defense in Lorraine as preparations advanced for what was to be the final Allied offensive of the war. On 26 September, I Corps troops began the attack northward that opened the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. From that day until 11 November 1918 when the war ended, the I Corps was constantly moving forward.

The I Corps shoulder sleeve insignia was first worn by members of I Corps after approval from the AEF on 3 December 1918, but it was not officially approved until 1922. The I Corps continued to train in France, until it was demobilized on 25 March 1919.

During its time in World War I, the I Corps commanded the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 26th, 28th, 32nd, 35th, 36th, 41st, 43rd, 77th, 78th, 80th, 82nd, 90th, 91st, 92nd Infantry Divisions at one point or another. Also assigned to the corps were the French 62nd, 167th and 5th Cavalry Divisions.

===Interwar period===

====I Corps (I)====

The I Corps was constituted in the Organized Reserve on 29 July 1921, allotted to the First Corps Area and assigned to the First Army. The headquarters and headquarters company (HHC) were initiated by September 1922 at the Army Base, Boston, Massachusetts. HHC, I Corps was withdrawn from the Organized Reserve on 15 August 1927 and demobilized.

====Army reorganization and I Corps (II)====

As part of an Army reorganization beginning in August 1927 that grouped the new XX, XXI, and XXII Corps, organized in the Regular Army, under the new Seventh Army (also a Regular formation and a redesignation of the First Army) as a contingency force staffed by professional soldiers rather than reservists that could immediately take control of forces and respond to any emergency, the I Corps HHC were withdrawn from the Organized Reserve and demobilized on 15 August 1927. Concurrently, all Reserve personnel were relieved from assignment.

The second iteration of the I Corps was constituted in the Regular Army as HHC, XX Corps on 15 August 1927, allotted to the First Corps Area, and assigned to the Seventh Army. Redesignated HHC, I Corps on 13 October 1927 and concurrently assigned to the First Army. On 1 October 1933, the corps headquarters was partially activated at Boston with Regular Army personnel from Headquarters, First Corps Area and Reserve personnel from the corps area at large. As a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; unit from 1933 to 1940, the corps headquarters was occasionally organized provisionally for short periods using its assigned Reserve officers and staff officers from Headquarters, First Corps Area. These periods included several First Corps Area and First Army CPXs in the 1930s and the First Army maneuvers in New York in 1935, 1939, and 1940. Headquarters, I Corps was fully activated 1 November 1940, less Reserve personnel, at 1429 Senate Street, Columbia, South Carolina, and assumed command and control of the 8th, 9th, and 30th Divisions. The HHC were transferred to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 20 February 1941, once space for the corps headquarters became available on the post. The I Corps participated in the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941 as part of the First Army. After the maneuver, the I Corps returned to Fort Jackson, where it was located on 7 December 1941.

===World War II===

====New Guinea Campaign====
On 6 July 1942 Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger took command of the corps which he would lead through the majority of its service in the war. In the summer of 1942 the corps was ordered to Australia, closing into the area at Rockhampton on 17 October 1942. This move was to be part of a larger overall offensive in the south Pacific region. The corps at this time comprised the 41st and 32nd Divisions, engaged in the defense of British New Guinea, the beginning of the New Guinea campaign. Though the Japanese advanced rapidly at first, a number of factors slowed their progress against the Allied forces. Stubborn resistance from two Australian brigades bought time for I Corps reinforcements to arrive while the terrain proved more difficult than the Japanese had anticipated. Supplies, which were already insufficient for the Japanese forces, were shortened even more as Japan&#x27;s high command diverted them to the Guadalcanal campaign. The Japanese attack stalled, and once the threat of a Japanese invasion of Australia was abated, the I Corps launched an offensive to push back the Japanese. With the 32nd Division and the 163rd Infantry Regiment of the 41st Division, the offensive was launched across the Owen Stanley Mountains of New Guinea. This force, later augmented by the Australian 7th Division, fought the Battle of Buna-Gona, slowly advancing north against a tenacious enemy under harsh weather and terrain conditions. Overstretched Japanese forces, low on supplies, were eventually overcome by US and Australian forces. Despite being surrounded, trapped, and outnumbered, the Japanese forces continued to fight until they were completely wiped out by Allied forces. Buna, on the north coast of the island, fell on 22 January 1943. The campaign was the first major Allied victory against the Japanese Army, and the I Corps received the Distinguished Unit Citation. This victory marked the turn of the tide in the ground war against Japan.
After this campaign the I Corps returned to Rockhampton, where it was engaged in the training of the Allied forces beginning to arrive in that area for the coming campaigns. From February 1943 until March 1944 the I Corps prepared for its next assignment, Operation Cartwheel. That mission was the capture of Hollandia on the north coast of Dutch New Guinea; the units allocated to the corps for this task were the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions. The Task Force established itself ashore after a successful amphibious assault on 19 April 1944. It then began an offensive in that area to remove Japanese forces, before establishing air bases there. The battle was a vicious one; the jungles and swamps made difficult fighting ground, and it was not until 6 June that the area was secured. The entire Japanese 18th Army was cut off from its bases by the force. Following this campaign the corps directed the seizure of the island of Biak, which was secured by 24 June, to complete the advances necessary for the subsequent invasion of the Philippine Islands. On 20 August Major General Innis P. Swift succeeded General Eichelberger as commander of the corps.

On 27 July 1944, the headquarters of the World War I-era I Corps was concurrently reconstituted in the Regular Army and consolidated with the headquarters of the currently-active I Corps, preserving its Great War lineage and honors.

====Luzon====
The corps was assigned to the Sixth United States Army in preparation for the offensive in the Philippines from the assets of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrilla units. On 9 January 1945, the I Corps successfully landed on the coast of Lingayen Gulf in northern Luzon with the mission of establishing a base for future operations to the north and of denying the enemy northern access to the South China Sea. As a part of the Sixth Army with an overall force of 175,000 men, the American forces faced over 260,000 Japanese in Luzon. In a sustained drive of thirty-four days which covered over 100 miles, the I Corps crossed central Luzon and thus separated the Japanese forces in the north from those in southern Luzon, destroying Japanese armored units along the way. Additional landings at Samar and Palawan were conducted in February, reducing the pressure on the forces of the I Corps. Following this accomplishment, the corps turned northward and began the systematic reduction of the enemy positions on the approach to the Cagayan Valley. The breakthrough into the valley was followed by a swift exploitation that took the corps to the north coast. This advance covered two hundred miles in little over 100 days; eliminating effective enemy resistance in northern Luzon. Manila was recaptured by the Allies after heavy fighting that ravaged the city. The intense fighting that ensued cost 8,000 killed and 30,000 wounded in the Sixth Army, compared to 190,000 dead for Japan. As the Sixth Army finished off the Japanese on Luzon, the Eighth United States Army in the south sent units all throughout the Philippines to eliminate remaining Japanese resistance on the islands. The Tenth United States Army in the north commenced securing Okinawa and Iwo Jima. With the defeat of the Japanese at each of these places, the US forces had locations from which to launch attacks into mainland Japan.

Allied forces then began preparing for the invasion of mainland Japan, Operation Downfall. The I Corps was assigned as one of four Corps under the command of the Sixth Army, with a strength of 14 divisions. The I Corps was to lead the assault on Miyazaki, in southern Kyūshū, with the 25th, 33rd, and 41st Infantry Divisions. Opposing them would be the Japanese 57th Army, with the 154th, 156th, and 212th Japanese Infantry Divisions. But the assault was not required. Japan surrendered following the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

During World War II, the 6th, 8th, 9th, 24th, 25th, 30th (during training in U.S. only?), 32nd, 33rd, 37th, 41st, 43rd, 77th and 98th Infantry Divisions were assigned to the I Corps at one time or another, along with the 2nd Marine Division, 7th Australian Division, and elements of the 11th Airborne Division.

====Occupation of Japan====

After the end of hostilities, the I Corps was assigned to occupation duty in Japan. On 19 September 1945 the corps, with the assigned 33rd Infantry Division, sailed from Lingayen Gulf for Japan, landing on the island of Honshū on 25 September, three weeks after Japan&#x27;s formal surrender. The next few years were a period during which the terms of the surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons of warfare disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, repatriation of foreign nationals, and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.

By 1948, as the purely occupational mission was accomplished, troops of the corps focused more military training and field exercises designed to prepare them for combat. Its force was eventually downsized to the 24th Infantry Division on Kyūshū and 25th Infantry Division on mid-Honshū. The US Army continued a slow and steady process of post-war drawdown and demobilization on its own, and on 28 March 1950, the corps was formally inactivated in Japan, and its command consolidated with other units.

===Korean War===
Only a few months later, the Korean War began, and units from Japan began streaming into South Korea. The Eighth United States Army, taking charge of the conflict, requested the activation of three corps headquarters for its growing command of United Nations Command (UN) forces. The I Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 2 August 1950.

====Pusan Perimeter====

Advance elements of the headquarters took their place in the Pusan perimeter on 27 August. The headquarters, designated &quot;Task Force Jackson&quot;, assumed control of the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) I Corps, the 21st Regimental Combat Team and the 3rd Battalion Combat Team of the 9th Infantry Regiment. On 12 September, under command of Lieutenant General Frank W. Milburn, the corps became operational. It took command of the 1st Cavalry Division, 24th Infantry Division and the ROK 1st Infantry Division, along with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, defending the Naktong River area against attacking North Korean units.

Amphibious landings at Inchon by the X Corps hit Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) forces from behind, allowing the I Corps to breakout from the Pusan perimeter starting on 16 September. Four days later I Corps troops began a general offensive northward against crumbling KPA opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the KPA were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel into North Korea on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the ROK 1st Infantry Division and the US 1st Cavalry Division both captured the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening resistance. The Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their first attacks in late October. By the end of October the city of Chongju, from the Yalu River border of North Korea, had been captured.

====Chinese intervention====
The UN forces renewed their offensive on 24 November before being stopped by the PVA Second Phase Offensive starting on 25 November. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdrawal to the Imjin River, south of the 38th Parallel, having been destabilised by the overwhelming PVA forces. In the wake of the retreat, the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re-formed in late December. The I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division and the 27th British Brigade, taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place. On 1 January 1951, 500,000 PVA troops attacked the Eighth Army&#x27;s line at the Imjin River, forcing them back and allowing the PVA to capture Seoul. The PVA eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, battered by the PVA assault, began to prepare counteroffensives to retake lost ground.

Following the establishment of defenses south of the capital city, General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered the I, IX and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive against the PVA/KPA, Operation Thunderbolt. Between February and March, the corps participated in Operation Killer, pushing PVA forces north of the Han River. This operation was quickly followed up with Operation Ripper, which retook Seoul in March. After this Operation Rugged and Operation Dauntless in April saw Eighth Army forces advance north of the 38th Parallel and reestablish themselves along the Kansas Line and Utah Line, respectively.

As I Corps troops approached the Iron Triangle formed by the cities of Cheorwon, Kumhwa and Pyonggang, PVA/KPA resistance increased. By that time, the ROK 1st Infantry Division was relieved from the corps and assigned to one of the Korean corps. The 1st Cavalry Division was returned to the corps in its place.

In late April, the PVA launched a major counterattack. Though the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions were able to hold their ground against the PVA 9th Army Corps, the ROK 6th Infantry Division, to the east, was destroyed by the PVA 13th Army Corps, which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the American divisions. The 1st Marine Division and the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the PVA 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on 25 April. The line was pushed back to Seoul but managed to hold. In May–June the UN launched another counteroffensive erasing most of the PVA gains.

====Stalemate====

In September, the UN Forces launched another counteroffensive with the 24th Infantry Division at the center of the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Flanked by the ROK 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the PVA 20th and 27th Armies. In November, the PVA attempted to counter this attack, but were unsuccessful. It was at this point, after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations. In late 1951, the 1st Cavalry Division, depleted after having suffered 16,000 casualties so far in the conflict, was relegated to the Far East reserve to rebuild. It was replaced by the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, which was newly arrived in the theater.

In March 1952, the corps grew in size as the 25th Infantry Division was relieved from its command and it gained command of 1st British Commonwealth Division and the ROK 1st, 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions. In June 1952, a ten-day attack against 45th Infantry Division outposts was repulsed. September 1952 began with renewed enemy attacks against the outposts that protected the main line. PVA/KPA attacks up to regimental size against garrisons of platoon and company strength were turned back by Corps troops. Outposts at Bunker Hill, The Hook, Kelly, Old Baldy Hill, Noris and Pork Chop Hill were defended in heavy fighting within the I Corps&#x27; area of responsibility. All along the front, the PVA/KPA were driven back with thousands of casualties.

In January 1953, the corps underwent its last major reorganization of the war, losing command of the US 3rd, 24th and 45th Infantry Divisions, the ROK 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions and the British 1st Commonwealth Division, while taking command of the US 2nd, 7th, and 25th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Marine Division. On 23 January 1953, the first major action of the year was initiated with a raid by the ROK 1st Infantry Division against the PVA/KPA&#x27;s Big Nori positions. The next months saw many such raids which harassed the PVA/KPA, captured prisoners, and destroyed defensive works. Beginning in March, the PVA/KPA continually attacked the corps outposts. In that month, troops on Old Baldy were withdrawn, on orders from the I Corps, after suffering heavy casualties from the PVA. On 10 April 1953 Lieutenant General Bruce C. Clarke, who was to see the corps through the remainder of its combat, assumed command.

The fighting on the outposts continued; the 7th Infantry Division stopped wave after wave of troops that the PVA threw against Pork Chop Hill. In late May troops of the Turkish Brigade, attached to the 25th Infantry Division, defended the Nevada Complex in fierce hand-to-hand combat. They were ordered to evacuate all but the Berlin position at the end of May. The 1st British Commonwealth Division ejected the PVA after their assault on the Hook. The ROK 1st Division troops were ordered off the positions on Queen, Bak and Hill 179 when heavy PVA/KPA assaults deprived them of their tactical value. The closing days of the fighting saw the 7th Infantry Division withdrawn from Pork Chop and the 1st Marine Division ordered to evacuate the Berlin positions for the same reason.

===Cold War===

After the 1953 armistice, the defense of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the ROK and US armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the ROK while the I Corps took charge in the west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only occasional incidents with the KPA. In 1971, under Nixon&#x27;s détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. The I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).

In 1980, Fort Lewis was notified of a major change of structure. A corps headquarters was to be activated in March 1982. The I Corps was formally activated on 1 October 1981, much earlier than expected. On 1 August 1983, the corps expanded its operational control of active Army units outside Fort Lewis, to include the 7th Infantry Division (Light) at Fort Ord, and the 172nd Infantry Brigade in Alaska, which then was expanded to 6th Infantry Division (Light). In 1988, the distinctive unit insignia was approved for the corps. This was the fourth design held by the corps, with previous versions being approved then retracted in 1942, 1970, and 1982.

===Gulf War===
Following the end of the Cold War in 1989, the US government conducted careful restructuring of national priorities and of the defense establishment. Fort Lewis, ideally located to act as a base for mobilization and power projection into the Pacific region, was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall. Thus, while most of the Army was downsizing, Fort Lewis began to grow, however, several tenant units such as the 9th Infantry Division were downsized.

The 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division became the 199th Infantry Brigade, attached to the I Corps, remaining under the corps until its redesignation as the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, and its departure for Fort Polk, Louisiana in 1993.

Also in 1990, the U.S. intervened in the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis deployed 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. The I Corps also contributed to the command structure, with the I Corps Commander, LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I Corps Commander, MG Paul R. Schwartz, assisting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander of the American Forces. The I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response corps. For several months, the I Corps was the nation&#x27;s worldwide contingency corps, while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged in the Gulf War. This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps&#x27; new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command. This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units.

In preparation for these new requirements, Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which were coming out of Europe. One of these was the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on 16 January 1992 and immediately reactivated as the 555th Engineer Group. On 16 February 1992 the 210th Field Artillery Brigade, also from Europe, was activated. In 1997, the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to Fort Bliss, Texas, to join other air defense brigades. The corps and Fort Lewis would see a reshuffling of units in and out of the area through 2000. Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for the I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region. Plans exist for the I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of Japan or South Korea.

===War on Terrorism===
With the events of 11 September 2001, the I Corps began providing support for Army units deploying in support of the War on Terrorism. Its assets were active in providing combat support and combat service support missions, including Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and the domestic Operation Noble Eagle.
On 4 February 2004, the I Corps forward headquarters deployed to Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to Mosul, Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division to form a headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq. It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces, eventually numbering more than 12,000. The Iraqi security forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion. After more than a year in Iraq, the corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for northern Iraq to the soldiers of Task Force Freedom and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in February 2005.

In 2008, it was announced that the I Corps was to deploy to Iraq in 2009, to replace XVIII Airborne Corps in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Soldiers of the corps trained for a year in preparation for the deployment, which began on 9 April 2009. The I Corps filled the role of Multi-National Corps - Iraq at Al-Faw Palace. In January 2010, Multi-National Corps - Iraq integrated with Multi-National Forces - Iraq (MNF-I) and Multi-National Security Transition Command – Iraq (MNSTC-I) to form United States Forces - Iraq (USF-I). Over its one-year deployment, the corps oversaw the responsible drawdown of major components of US Forces in Iraq. I Corps returned from Iraq in March 2010 following their RIP/TOA with the III Corps.

The I Corps headquarters deployed to Afghanistan to serve as the headquarters of the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command (IJC) for a period of one year. The commander of the I Corps, Lieutenant General Curtis Scaparrotti, served concurrently as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command and Deputy Commander, U.S. Forces – Afghanistan from 11 July 2011 to 11 July 2012.

===Asia-Pacific Shift===
The I Corps shifted its mission to the Asia-Pacific region in mid-2012. The I Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Robert Brown announced this Pacific Rim rebalance during his Change-of-Command Ceremony at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. In late 2011, President Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta signaled the Asia-Pacific pivot and made several trips to the region. The Pacific Rim Rebalance will involve several combined and joint military exercises in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Philippines, and Australia. Part of the I Corps&#x27; objectives for these exercises will be Joint Task Force certification in support of United States Pacific Command missions.

==Corps organization==
The I Corps is unique among the active US Army corps in that it is composed of a mixture of active duty and US Army Reserve units in 47 of the 50 U.S. states, for a total of around 45,000 Soldiers stationed in Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington State.

<text>Amphetamine Reptile Records (or AmRep Industries) is a record label founded in 1986 by Tom Hazelmyer in Washington state. The label specializes in noise rock and also released &quot;Strap It On&quot;, the debut album by alternative metal band Helmet which sold more than 40,000 records. According to Hazelmyer, the success of the album was vital to keeping AmRep going throughout the 1990s, as it &quot;helped support the other things that sold less.&quot; The label was the subject of the 2015 documentary &quot;The Color of Noise&quot;.

==History==
Hazelmyer originally started the label to release records by his band, Halo of Flies. Eventually the label&#x27;s roster expanded to include releases by Helmet, Melvins, Cows, Helios Creed, Chokebore, Servotron and others. Hazelmyer later moved the label to Minneapolis. Today the label is used by the Melvins, H•O•F and other legacy AmRep acts to release limited edition vinyl. These releases are generally noted for their Linocut artwork, hand carved by Hazelmyer, their limited availability and their highly sought after nature as collector&#x27;s items.

Much of the AmRep back catalog is now out of print, although many of the releases are available in digital download format and streaming.

On May 13, 2020 Tom Hazelmyer participated in an in-depth interview about the label on Conan Neutron&#x27;s Protonic Reversal.

<text>The Hejaz railway (also spelled Hedjaz or Hijaz; or , , ) was a narrow-gauge railway ( track gauge) that ran from Damascus to Medina, through the Hejaz region of modern-day Saudi Arabia, with a branch line to Haifa on the Mediterranean Sea. The project was ordered by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in March 1900.

It was a part of the Ottoman railway network and the original goal was to extend the line from the Haydarpaşa Terminal in Kadıköy, Istanbul beyond Damascus to the Islamic holy city of Mecca. However, construction was interrupted due to the outbreak of World War I, and it reached only to Medina, short of Mecca. The completed Damascus to Medina section was . It was the only railway completely built and operated by the Ottoman Empire.

The main purpose of the railway was to establish a connection between Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Islamic Caliphate, and Hejaz in Arabia, the site of the holiest shrines of Islam and Mecca, the destination of the Hajj annual pilgrimage. Other objectives were to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military forces.

== History ==
Prior to the construction of the line, it took 40 days from Damascus to Medina. The railway shortened the time to 5 days. The railway is the only railway which was operated and built by the Ottoman Empire. At first, German engineers were employed as technical support, however over time they were replaced by Ottoman technicians. According to Özyüksel, the Ottomans built the project in order to weaken the Arab nationalist movements and strengthen the empire&#x27;s Islamist positioning.

===Construction===
====Project; survey====
Railways were experiencing a building boom in the late 1860s, and the Hejaz region was one of the many areas up for speculation. The first such proposal involved a railway stretching from Damascus to the Red Sea. This plan was soon dashed however, as the Amir of Mecca raised objections regarding the sustainability of his own camel transportation project should the line be constructed.

Ottoman involvement in the creation of a railway began with Colonel Ahmed Reshid Pasha, who, after surveying the region on an expedition to Yemen in 1871–1873, concluded that the only feasible means of transport for Ottoman soldiers traveling there was by rail. Other Ottoman officers, such as Osman Nuri Pasha, also offered up proposals for a railway in the Hejaz, arguing its necessity if security in the Arabian region were to be maintained.

====Funding and symbolism====
Many around the world did not believe that the Ottoman Empire would be able to fund such a project: it was estimated the railway would cost around 4 million Turkish lira, a sizeable portion of the budget. The Ziraat Bankasi, a state bank which served agricultural interests in the Ottoman Empire, provided an initial loan of 100,000 lira in 1900. This initial loan allowed the project to commence later the same year. Abdul Hamid II called on all Muslims in the world to make donations to the construction of the Hejaz Railway. The project had taken on a new significance. Not only was the railway to be considered an important military feature for the region, it was also a religious symbol. Hajis, pilgrims on their way to the holy city of Mecca, often didn&#x27;t reach their destination when travelling along the Hejaz route. Unable to contend with the tough, mountainous conditions, up to 20% of hajis died on the way.

Abdul Hamid was adamant that the railway stand as a symbol for Muslim power and solidarity: this rail line would make the religious pilgrimage easier not only for Ottomans, but all Muslims. As a result, no foreign investment in the project was to be accepted. The Donation Commission was established to organize the funds effectively, and medallions were given out to donors. Despite propaganda efforts such as railway greeting cards, only about 1 in 10 donations came from Muslims outside of the Ottoman Empire. One of these donors, however, was Muhammad Inshaullah, a wealthy Punjabi newspaper editor. He helped to establish the Hejaz Railway Central Committee. The BBC said the project was funded completely by donations.

====Resources; construction work====
Access to resources was a significant stumbling block during construction of the Hejaz Railway. Water, fuel, and labor were particularly difficult to find in the more remote reaches of the Hejaz. In the uninhabited areas, camel transportation was employed not only for water, but also food and building materials. Fuel, mostly in the form of coal, was brought in from surrounding countries and stored in Haifa and Damascus.

Labor was certainly the largest obstacle in the construction of the railway. In the more populated areas, much of the labor was fulfilled by local settlers as well as Muslims in the area, who were legally obliged to lend their hands to the construction. This labor was largely employed in the treacherous excavation efforts involved in railway construction. In the more remote areas the railway would be reaching, a more novel solution was put to use. Much of this work was completed by railway troops of soldiers, who in exchange for their railway work, were exempt from one third of their military service.

As the rail line traversed treacherous terrain, many bridges and overpasses had to be built. Since access to concrete was limited, many of these overpasses were made of carved stone and stand to this day.

====Arab opposition====
The Emir Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca viewed the railway as a threat to Arab suzerainty, since it provided the Ottomans with easy access to their garrisons in Hejaz, Asir, and Yemen. From its outset, the railway was the target of attacks by local Arab tribes. These were never particularly successful, but neither were the Turks able to control areas more than a mile or so either side of the line. Due to the locals&#x27; habit of pulling up wooden sleepers to fuel their camp-fires, some sections of the track were laid on iron sleepers.
In September 1907, as crowds celebrated the rail reaching Al-&#x27;Ula station, a rebellion organized by the tribe of Harb threatened to halt progress. The rebels objected to the railway stretching all the way to Mecca; they feared they would lose their livelihood as camel transport was made obsolete. It was later decided by Abdul Hamid that the railway would only go so far as Medina.

==== British opposition ====
Due to a British ultimatum, Özyüksel says the Ottomans were not able to build the Aqaba exit from the Hejaz network.

==== French opposition ====
The French opposed the Afula - Jerusalem track, which prevented the Ottomans from completing that segment of the Hejaz Network.

====Completion (1908-13)====
Under the supervision of chief engineer Mouktar Bey, the railway reached Medina on 1 September 1908, the anniversary of the Sultan&#x27;s accession. However, many compromises had to be made in order to finish by this date, with some sections of track being laid on temporary embankments across &quot;wadis&quot;. In 1913 the Hejaz Railway Station was opened in central Damascus as the starting point of the line.

===World War I===
To fuel locomotives operating on the railway during World War I, the German Army produced shale oil from the Yarmouk oil shale deposit. The Turks constructed a military railway from the Hejaz line to Beersheba, opening on 30 October 1915.

The Hejaz line was repeatedly attacked and damaged, particularly during the Arab Revolt, when Ottoman trains were ambushed by the guerrilla force led by T. E. Lawrence. 
* On 26 March 1917, T. E. Lawrence (known as Lawrence of Arabia) led an attack on the Aba el Naam Station, taking 30 prisoners and inflicting 70 casualties on the garrison. He went on to say, &quot;Traffic was held up for three days of repair and investigation. So we did not wholly fail.&quot;
* In May 1917, British bombers dropped bombs on Al-&#x27;Ula Station. In July 1917, Stewart Newcombe, a British engineer and associate of Lawrence, conspired with forces from the Egyptian and Indian armies to sabotage the railway. The Al-Akhdhar station was attacked and 20 Turkish soldiers were captured.
* In October 1917, the Ottoman stronghold of Tabuk fell to Arab rebels. The Abu-Anna’em station was also captured.
* In November 1917, Sharif Abdullah and the tribe of Harb attacked Al-Bwair station and destroyed two locomotives.
* In December 1917, a group of men led by Ibn Ghusiab derailed a train on the line south of Tabuk.
With the Arab Revolt and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, it was unclear to whom the railway should belong. The area was divided between the British and the French, both eager to assume control. However, following years of neglected maintenance, many sections of track fell into disrepair; the railway was effectively abandoned by 1920. In 1924, when Ibn Saud took control of the peninsula, plans to revive the railway were no longer on the agenda.

===World War II===
In the Second World War, the Samakh Line (from Haifa to Deraa at the Syrian border and to Damascus) was operated for the Allied forces by the New Zealand Railway Group 17th ROC, from Afula (with workshops at Deraa and Haifa). The locomotives were 1914 Borsig and 1917 Hartmann models from Germany. The line, which had been operated by the Vichy French, was in disrepair. Trains over the steep section between Samakh (now Ma&#x27;agan) and Deraa were 230 tons maximum, with 1,000 tons moved in 24 hours. The group also ran 60 miles (95 km) of branch line, including Afula to Tulkarm.

===1960s===
The railway south of the modern Jordanian–Saudi Arabian border remained closed after 1920 and the fall of the Ottoman Empire. An attempt was made to rebuild it in the mid-1960s, but then abandoned due to the Six-Day War in 1967.

==Current status, development==
Two connected sections of the main line are in service:

* from Amman in Jordan to Damascus in Syria, as the Hedjaz Jordan Railway, and 
* from phosphate mines near Ma&#x27;an to the Gulf of Aqaba, as the Chemin de Fer de Hedjaz Syrie, or the Aqaba Railway Corporation.

Israel Railways partially rebuilt the long-defunct Haifa extension, the Jezreel Valley railway, using standard gauge, with the possibility of someday extending it to Irbid in Jordan. The rebuilt line opened from Haifa to Beit She&#x27;an in October 2016.

Saudi Arabia completed the construction of the Medina-Mecca line (via Jeddah) with the Haramain high-speed railway in 2018.

Azmi Nalshik the head of Jordan Hejaz Railways said that the railways is considered a waqf, meaning it belongs to all Muslims and therefore cannot be sold.

===Plans for the future===
On 4 February 2009 the Turkish Transport Minister Binali Yıldırım said in Riyadh that Turkey planned to rebuild its section, and called on Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria to come together and complete the restoration.

Also in 2009, Jordan&#x27;s transport ministry proposed a 990-mile (1590-km) US$5 billion rail network, construction of which could begin in the first quarter of 2012. The planned network would provide freight rail links from Jordan to Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Passenger rail connections could be extended to Lebanon, Turkey and beyond. The government, which will fund part of the project, is inviting tenders from private firms to raise the rest of the project cost.

In November 2018, Middle East Monitor revealed Saudi-Israel&#x27;s joint plans to revive the railway from Haifa to Riyadh. The Turkish minister of transport, Abdulkadir Uraloğlu, announced in December 2024 that Turkey intends to help restore the railway in partnership with the new Syrian government.

===Preservation and tourist trains===
Railway mechanics have restored many of the original steam-powered locomotives: there are nine in working order in Syria and seven in Jordan.

Since the accession of Abdullah II in 1999, relations between Jordan and Syria have improved, causing a revival of interest in the railway. The train runs from Qadam station in the outskirts of Damascus, not from the Hejaz Station, which closed in 2004 due to a major commercial development project.
Trains run from Khadam station on demand (usually from German, British or Swiss groups). The northern part of the Zabadani track is no longer accessible.

===Museums and sightseeing===
In 2008, the &quot;museum of the rolling stock of Al-Hejaz railway&quot; opened in Damascus&#x27; Khadam station after major renovations for an exhibition of the locomotives.

An exhibit on the railway&#x27;s cultural heritage opened in 2019 at Darat al-Funun in Amman.

As of 2006, there is a small railway museum at the station in Mada&#x27;in Saleh in Saudi Arabia and a larger project in the &quot;Hejaz Railway Museum&quot; in Medina, which opened in 2006. The museum, which is dedicated to the history and archeology of Medina is 90,000 square meters. The Medina Terminus was restored in 2005 with railway tracks and locomotive shed.

Small non-operating sections of the railway track, buildings and rolling stock are still preserved as tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia. The old railway bridge over the Aqeeq Valley at Medina though was demolished in 2005 due to damage from heavy rain the year before.

Trains destroyed by local Arab, French, and British troops during WWI and the Arab Revolt of 1916–1918 can still be seen where they were attacked.

==Stations==
Some of the stations were located near the traditional Hajj caravan stations, where the Ottomans had built fortified inns (see Ottoman Hajj route).

The Arabic word for station is &quot;Mahaṭat&quot;. The Ottoman- and interwar-period spelling tends to be simpler than the current official ones.

Pre-WWI, the Ottomans used French spelling.

<text>Tipperary Hill, sometimes known as Tipp Hill, is a district in the city of Syracuse, New York. The area is named after County Tipperary in Ireland. It is largely settled by immigrants from Ireland, especially from County Tipperary. It makes up half of Syracuse&#x27;s Far Westside neighborhood.

==History==
In the 1820s, when the Erie Canal first was built from Albany, New York to Buffalo, New York, the Irish were the chief laborers. Syracuse is about the middle of the route, the &quot;hub&quot; of the system. When the canal was finished many of the Irish settled west of Syracuse on a hill overlooking the canal. This area became known as Tipperary Hill.

===The Green on Top Traffic Light===
Tipperary Hill is the home of the only upside-down traffic light in the United States. When the city first started to install traffic signal lights in the 1920s they put one at a major intersection on Tipperary Hill, on the corner of Tompkins Street and Milton Avenue. Some Irish youths, incensed that anyone would dare to put the &quot;British&quot; red above the &quot;Irish&quot; green, broke the light. The city replaced it but the Irish broke the replacement. After a few rounds of this the city decided that if they wanted a light at that intersection, they had better put the signal up inverted, and so they did.

==Modern Tipperary Hill ==
In recent years some long time neighborhood residents of Irish ancestry and local business owners gathered resources and encouraged the city first to demolish an old run-down commercial building and then in 1997 to build a small park, the Tipperary Hill Memorial Park, and erect a statue, the Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial. The memorial is dedicated to those who, in their opinions, were brave sons of Ireland who had stood up to City Hall and won. The statue was created by Dexter Benedict. The park and statue are still there, as is the traffic light. On the eve of every Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, someone (or ones) goes out and paints a green shamrock underneath the light.

Although most people in Syracuse know about the Tipp Hill neighborhood there is little agreement as to the exact boundaries of the neighborhood. Before 1886, the entire far west side of what is now Syracuse from Burnet Park north to Milton Avenue in Solvay was known as the Village of Geddes. When the village of Geddes joined the city, there were only two churches in the neighborhood: St. Patrick&#x27;s Church and The Geddes Methodist Church. Many Irish immigrants were attracted to the neighborhood nearest to St. Patrick&#x27;s Church and area factories.

<text>Harald Cramér (; 25 September 1893 – 5 October 1985) was a Swedish mathematician, actuary, and statistician, specializing in mathematical statistics and probabilistic number theory. John Kingman described him as &quot;one of the giants of statistical theory&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Harald Cramér was born in Stockholm, Sweden on 25 September 1893. Cramér remained close to Stockholm for most of his life. He entered the University of Stockholm as an undergraduate in 1912, where he studied mathematics and chemistry. During this period, he was a research assistant under the famous chemist, Hans von Euler-Chelpin, with whom he published his first five articles from 1913 to 1914. Following his lab experience, he began to focus solely on mathematics. He eventually began his work on his doctoral studies in mathematics which were supervised by Marcel Riesz at the University of Stockholm. Also influenced by G. H. Hardy, Cramér&#x27;s research led to a PhD in 1917 for his thesis &quot;On a class of Dirichlet series&quot;.

===Academic professional career===
Following his PhD, he served as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Stockholm University from 1917 to 1929. Early on, Cramér was highly involved in analytic number theory. He also made some important statistical contributions to the distribution of primes and twin primes. His most famous paper on this subject is entitled &quot;On the order of magnitude of the difference between consecutive prime numbers&quot;, which provided a rigorous account of the constructive role in which probability applied to number theory and included an estimate for prime gaps that became known as Cramér&#x27;s conjecture.

In the late 1920s, Cramér became interested in the field of probability, which at the time was not an accepted branch of mathematics. Cramér knew that a radical change was needed in this field, and in a paper in 1926 said, &quot;The probability concept should be introduced by a purely mathematical definition, from which its fundamental properties and the classical theorems are deduced by purely mathematical operations.&quot; Cramér took an interest in the rigorous mathematical formulation of probability in the work of French and Russian mathematicians such as Kolmogorov, Lévy, Bernstein, and Khinchin in the early 1930s. Cramér also made significant development to the revolution in probability theory.
Cramér later wrote his careful study of the field in his Cambridge publication &quot;Random variables and probability distributions&quot; which appeared in 1937 (with a 2nd edition in 1962 and a 3rd edition in 1970). Shortly after World War II, Cramér went on to publish the influential &quot;Mathematical Methods of Statistics&quot; in 1946. This text was one that &quot;showed the way in which statistical practice depended on a body of rigorous mathematical analysis as well as Fisherian intuition.&quot; His 1955 book &quot;Elements of Probability Theory and Some of its Applications&quot; introduces probability theory at a more elementary level than &quot;Mathematical Methods of Statistics&quot;.

In 1929, Cramér was appointed to a newly created chair in Stockholm University, becoming the first Swedish professor of Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics. Cramér retained this position up until 1958. During his tenure at Stockholm University, Cramér was a PhD advisor for 10 students, most notably Herman Wold and Kai Lai Chung. In 1950 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. Starting in 1950, Cramér took on the additional responsibility of becoming the President of Stockholm University. In 1958, he was also appointed to be Chancellor of the entire Swedish university system. Cramér retired from the Swedish university system in 1961.

===Actuarial career===
A large portion of Cramér&#x27;s work concerned the field of actuarial science and insurance mathematics. During the period from 1920 to 1929, he was an actuary for the life insurance company Svenska livförsäkringsbolaget. His actuarial work during this time led him to study probability and statistics which became the main area of his research. In 1927 he published an elementary text in Swedish &quot;Probability theory and some of its applications&quot;. Following his work for Svenska livförsäkringsbolaget, he went on to work for Återförsäkringsaktiebolaget Sverige, a reinsurance company, up until 1948. He was also known for his pioneering efforts in insurance risk theory. After this period, he remained as a consultant actuary to Sverige from 1949 to 1961. Later in his life, he was elected to be the Honorary President of the Swedish Actuarial Society.

===Later years===
Cramér remained an active contributor to his professional career for an additional 20 years. Following his retirement in 1961, he became extremely active in research, which had been slowed due to his Chancellorship. During the years from 1961 to 1983, Cramér traveled throughout the United States and Europe to continue his research, making significant stops at Berkeley, Princeton, and at the Research Triangle Institute of North Carolina.

Cramér received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1972.

His academic career spanned over seven decades, from 1913 to 1982.

Harald Cramér married Marta Hansson in 1918, and they remained together up until her death in 1973. He had often referred to her as his &quot;Beloved Marta&quot;. Together they had one daughter, Marie-Louise, and two sons, Tomas and Kim.

<doc id="223130" wikidata="Q1752197" url="?curid=223130" title="Cork taint">
<text>Cork taint is a broad term referring to an off-odor and off-flavor wine fault arising from the presence of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), a chemical compound that represents one of the strongest off-flavors, and one &quot;generated naturally in foods/beverages&quot;, in particular wines, that considerably reduces the quality of these products.

Cork taint is characterized by a set of undesirable smells or tastes found in a bottle of wine, especially spoilage that can only be detected after bottling, aging and opening. Though modern studies have shown that other factors can also be responsible for taint—including wooden barrels, storage conditions and the transport of corks and wine—the cork stopper is normally considered to be responsible, and a wine found to be tainted on opening is said to be corked or &quot;corky&quot;. Cork taint can affect wines irrespective of price and quality level.

The chief cause of cork taint is the presence of the chemical compounds 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA) or 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) in the wine, which in many cases will have been transferred from the cork, but which also can have been transferred through the cork rather than from it. TCA is a compound which does not occur naturally; It is created when some fungi are treated with chlorinated phenolic compounds, which are types of antimicrobial agents used in the processing of wood. This class of compounds is a chief factor responsible for the problem associated with mold liable to be found in corks; very small amounts of this compound, on the order of nanograms, can be responsible for this defect.

Corked wine containing TCA has a characteristic odor, variously described as resembling a moldy newspaper, wet dog, damp cloth, or damp basement; in almost all cases of corked wine, the wine&#x27;s native aromas are reduced significantly, and a very tainted wine is quite unpalatable, although harmless. While the human threshold for detecting TCA is measured in the single-digit parts per trillion, this can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on an individual&#x27;s sensitivity, where the detection limit is also complicated by the olfactory system&#x27;s particularly quick habituation to TCA, making the smell less obvious on each subsequent sniff.

==Precursor==

The primary chemical precursor to TCA is TCP (2,4,6-trichlorophenol), a solvent used for industrial cleaning. Bacteria are able to de-toxify TCP, notably Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas, but both strains cannot de-toxify the TCP without the other. Chlorinated phenols can form chemically when hypochlorous acid (HOCl, one of the active forms of chlorine) or chlorine radicals come in contact with wood (untreated, such as barrels or pallets). The use of chlorine or other halogen-based sanitizing agents is being phased out of the wine industry in favor of peroxide or peracetic acid preparations. Chlorine dioxide has not been shown to produce these spontaneous chlorophenols. Chlorine dioxide is a relatively new agent being used in the wine industry due to its obvious advantages, having shown no evidence of the possibility of TCA formation.

==Production==

The production of TCA in cork or its transfer by other means into wine is complex, but most results when naturally occurring airborne fungi are presented with chlorophenol compounds, which they then convert into chlorinated anisole derivatives. Chlorophenols taken up by cork trees are an industrial pollutant found in many pesticides and wood preservatives, which may mean that the incidence of cork taint has risen in modern times. Chlorophenols can also be a product of the chlorine bleaching process used to sterilize corks (not in use anymore); this has led to the increasing adoption of methods such as peroxide bleaching.

TCA and TBA are responsible for the vast majority of cases of cork taint, but other less common and less known compounds that can cause different varieties of cork taint include guaiacol, geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), octen-3-ol and also octen-3-one, each with its own particular aroma, but all considered objectionable in wine.

==Estimated occurrence and industry response==

The cork-industry group APCOR cites a study showing a 0.7–1.2% taint rate. In a 2005 study of 2800 bottles tasted at the &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; blind-tasting facilities in Napa, California, 7% of the bottles were found to be tainted.

In 2013, the Cork Quality Council ran over 25 thousand tests. The results, compared with data from eight years ago, show a sharp reduction in TCA levels, of around 81 percent. In the last test, 90 percent of samples of natural cork stopper shipments showed values of under 1.0 ppt and only 7 percent had showed results of 1.0–2.0 ppt.

Improvements in cork and winemaking methodology continue to strive to lower the incidence, but the media attention given to cork taint has created a controversy in the winemaking community, with traditional cork growers on one side and the makers of newer synthetic closures and screw caps on the other. Screw caps and synthetic corks, however, are thought to be prone to another aroma taint: sulphidisation. This may arise from the reduced oxygen supply which concentrates sulphurous smells arising from wines with universal preservatives, however it is more likely that these wines contain excessive/imbalanced amounts of sulphite based preservatives to begin with.

===Systemic TCA===

Systemic TCA tainting occurs when TCA has infiltrated a winery via means other than cork and can affect the entire production of wine instead of just a few bottles. This occurs when wine barrels, drain pipes, wooden beams in the cellars, or rubber hoses are tainted by TCA. Sometimes entire cellars have to be rebuilt in order to eliminate all potential systemic TCA culprits.

Rubber hoses or gaskets have a high affinity for TCA and therefore concentrate TCA from the atmosphere; wine or water that subsequently passes through infected hoses can become tainted with TCA. Another possible means of TCA contamination is through the use of bentonite, a swelling clay preparation (smectite) used in treating wine for heat stability; bentonite has a high affinity for TCA and will absorb TCA and related chemicals in the atmosphere, so if an open bag of bentonite is stored in an environment with a high (1–2 ng/g or ppb) TCA concentration, TCA will be absorbed in the bentonite and transferred to the wine lot to which the bentonite is added.

It is notable that this systemic TCA will often impart a trace (1–2 ng/L or ppt) to the wine, which itself is not detected by most consumers. However, with this high baseline level of TCA in bottled wine, even the additional contribution of a relatively clean cork can elevate the TCA level in the wine above threshold levels (4–6 ng/L or ppt), rendering the wine &quot;corked&quot;.

&quot;Wine Spectator&quot; has reported that such California wineries as Pillar Rock Vineyard, Beaulieu Vineyard, and E &amp; J Gallo Winery have had trouble with systemic TCA.

== Treatment ==
Filtration and purification systems now exist that attempt to remove the TCA from corked wine to make it drinkable again, though there are few means of reducing the level of TCA in tainted wine that are approved by the TTB (formerly BATF).

One method of removing TCA from tainted wine is to soak polyethylene (a plastic used for applications such as milk containers and plastic food wrap) in the affected wine; the non-polar TCA molecule has a high affinity for the polyethylene molecule, thereby removing the taint from the wine. The surface area of polyethylene needed to reduce the taint to sub-threshold levels is based on the TCA level in the affected wine, temperature, and the alcohol level of the wine.

Some vintners have used the so-called &quot;half and half&quot; mix of milk and cream to remove TCA from wine (the TCA in the wine is sequestered by the butterfat in &quot;half and half&quot;). The French company Embag markets a product called &quot;Dream Taste&quot;, which uses a copolymer shaped like a cluster of grapes that is designed to remove the TCA taint from wine.

As advocated by Andrew Waterhouse, professor of wine chemistry at University of California, Davis, this can be done at home by pouring the wine into a bowl with a sheet of polyethylene plastic wrap; for ease of pouring, a pitcher, measuring cup, or decanter can be used instead, and the 2,4,6-trichloroanisole will stick to the plastic in a process effective within a few minutes.

<text>Table grapes are grapes intended for consumption as fresh fruit as opposed to grapes grown for wine production, juice production, jelly and jam making or for drying into raisins.

&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; table grapes can be in the form of either seeded or non-seeded varietals and range widely in terms of colour, size, sweetness and adaptability to local growing conditions.

Common commercially available table grape varieties such as Thompson Seedless and Flame Seedless are favoured by growers for their high yield and relative resistance to damage during shipment. Other less common varietals such as Cotton Candy, Kyoho or Pione are custom hybrids bred for size, appearance and specific flavour characteristics.

==Market characteristics==
Chile, Peru, the United States, China, Turkey, Spain, South Africa and Australia are all major producers and exporters of table grapes. World table grape production in 2016 is estimated by the USDA to be in the region of 21.0 million metric tons per annum, China alone accounting for an estimated 9.7 million metric tons of this global total. Chile remains the world&#x27;s single largest table grape exporter, exporting over 800,000 metric tons to mainly North American and European markets. China, by way of contrast, exports only 247,000 metric tons per annum mainly to South East Asian markets; a small percentage of overall production.

The global trade in table grapes has enjoyed strong growth since the 1950s. Since the turn of the century table grape export growth has primarily come from the Southern Hemisphere and developing economies such as Chile, India, Peru and Turkey.

The international trade in table grapes has significantly benefitted from the increased availability of cold storage and refrigerated container technology. Table grapes are a labour-intensive agricultural product that require harvesting by hand at peak ripeness. In order to maintain product quality at point of sale, harvested grapes must be sorted, packaged and cooled to near 0 °C as quickly as possible. Transportation in ventilated and temperature controlled environments requires significant investment in processing facilities, shipping and logistics. As the production cycle for table grapes is relatively long compared with other fruit, with new plantations taking 2–3 years to become productive, export production and promotion is often concentrated in the hands of large vertically integrated commercial enterprises or producer-exporter associations such as the Fruit Exporters Association of Chile (ASOEX).

===North America and Europe===
Table grapes commonly sold in North American and European markets include Sultana (Thompson Seedless), Flame, Muscat, Almeria, Niagara and Concord.

In the United States, California remains the largest single producer of table grapes with over 85,000 acres under cultivation. According to the USDA over 70 varietals are grown in the state, but the bulk of shipments are limited to a dozen mainly seedless varieties often sold domestically under generic green, red, or black descriptors.

===Japan, Korea and East Asia===
In Japan, Korea and other East Asian markets, as well as supporting a market for imported grapes commonly produced in Australia and Chile, domestically produced table grapes are often grown and sold as premium gift products.

In Japan, Kyoho, Delaware and Pione grapes rank as the first, second and third most popular table grapes in terms of production volume. In July 2015, setting new pricing records for Japanese premium table grapes, a single bunch of Ruby Roman grapes, containing 26 grapes at a weight of about 700 grams, sold for 1 million yen (around US$8400).

In the Philippines, most table grapes in the country are imported, although grapes can be cultivated in the islands. In the Ilocos region, the red cardinal is the most commonly grown variety.

<text>Earnie Dee Shaver (August 31, 1944 – September 1, 2022), best known as Earnie Shavers, was an American professional boxer who competed between 1969 and 1995. A two-time world heavyweight championship challenger, he is known as one of the hardest punchers in boxing history. He scored 70 knockout wins, including 23 in the first round, for a 76.7% overall knockout rate.

Shavers twice unsuccessfully challenged for the heavyweight championship, losing to Muhammad Ali in 1977 by a 15-round unanimous decision and to Larry Holmes in 1979 by a TKO in round 11. He hurt Ali in the second round and knocked down Holmes in the seventh round. Shavers defeated former world champions Vicente Rondón, Jimmy Ellis, and Ken Norton, as well as three-time European heavyweight champion Joe Bugner and top heavyweight contender Jimmy Young.

In 2001, Shavers released an autobiography, &quot;Welcome to the Big Time&quot;. After retiring from boxing, he continued to attend boxing events as a special guest, autograph signer, and motivational speaker.

==Early life==
Earnie Dee Shaver was born on August 31, 1944, in Garland, Alabama. He was one of nine children born to Curtis and Willie Belle Shaver, and worked on a cotton farm with his family. Shavers credited the strenuous labor on the farm for helping to build his muscular physique and formidable strength. While still a boy, his family was forced to flee their home after his father was threatened by the Ku Klux Klan, over money owed for a mule.

The family moved to Youngstown, Ohio. Shavers attended Newton Falls High School, where he excelled in track and football. He worked at the nearby General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown.

==Amateur career==
Shavers started boxing at the late age of 22. Before turning professional, he had a short but notable amateur career, winning the 1969 National AAU heavyweight title.

In March 1969, National Golden Gloves director Tony Mange said Shavers &quot;carries a hefty punch&quot;. He had nine straight knockout wins before he was himself knocked out by the 230-pound (104 kg) West German Horst Koschemann.

Shavers posted a 20–6 amateur record as a heavyweight and recorded 14 knockouts (with half of those losses also by knockout.)

==Professional career==
===Early bouts===
Known as the &quot;Black Destroyer&quot;, Shavers won 44 of his first 47 fights by knockout; mostly against unremarkable opposition. This included 27 consecutive knockouts, of which 20 were in the first round. He suffered setbacks with a unanimous decision loss in his 3rd bout to Stan Johnson, who was a replacement opponent for Wayne West, and a 5th-round KO loss to then undefeated Ron Stander.

He began to rise to the upper ranks of the heavyweight division after he hired Cleveland-based promoter Don King to be his manager. His wins included one over a novice Jimmy Young who later became a world championship contender. Stepping up the class of his opposition, he came to public prominence with a first-round KO of one time WBA heavyweight champion Jimmy Ellis. His progress was halted when he was KO&#x27;d in the first round by Jerry Quarry, which was followed by another loss to a journeyman Bob Stallings. Shavers then had a thunderous match with hard hitting Ron Lyle but was stopped after 6 brutal rounds. He then knocked out hard hitter Howard Smith and beat powerful prospect Roy Williams in a brutal back and forward battle in which Shavers was nearly knocked out, a match Shavers maintained was one of the toughest of his career.

===Fighting champions===
====Shavers vs Ali====

Shavers fought Muhammad Ali at Madison Square Garden on September 29, 1977. Coming into the bout, Shavers had a record of 54–5–1, with 52 knockouts. Ali nicknamed Shavers &quot;The Acorn&quot; because of his shaved bald head. The fight was shown in prime time broadcast television by NBC, which rarely did prime time fights (ABC tended to get the Ali fights) and had the judges&#x27; scoring announced after each round to help avoid any controversial decision. Ali&#x27;s cornerman Angelo Dundee asked Baltimore matchmaker Eddie Hrica to watch the broadcast in the dressing room and signal on the scoring. In the second round, Shavers hurt Ali with an overhand right. Ali play-acted that he was seriously hurt, and Shavers hesitated. On the scorecard they exchanged rounds. Ali won the fifth decisively. 
By the 12th round, the almost 36 year old Ali, just had to survive the last three rounds to win. Shavers, whose stamina was suspect before the fight, came alive in the 13th round. In the 14th, he battered Ali about the ring. Before the 15th, according to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; boxing writer Pat Putnam, &quot;Ali was on very wobbly legs.&quot;
Realizing Ali needed to last three more minutes, Dundee told him, &quot;You don&#x27;t look so good. You better go out and take this round.&quot; In a furious final round, the two men tagged each other, but Ali closed strongly, nearly dropping Shavers in the last 20 seconds. He won a unanimous decision. 
The next day, Garden matchmaker Teddy Brenner encouraged Ali to retire by stating the Garden would never make another offer to host an Ali fight. Brenner also thought that Shavers deserved the nod against Ali. The fight made the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, with &quot;ALI&#x27;S DESPERATE HOUR&quot; featuring a photograph of Shavers scoring with an overhand right. Ali&#x27;s fight doctor Ferdie Pacheco also urged Ali to retire after noting the punishment Ali had absorbed against Shavers. Ali later said Shavers was the hardest puncher he ever faced, comparing him favorably to Joe Frazier and George Foreman. Ali also stated that &quot;Earnie hit me so hard, it shook my kinfolk back in Africa&quot; - a quip Ali had previously used to describe other hard-hitting opponents.

====Shavers vs Holmes====
Shavers, being the No.3 WBC contender, then fought No. 4 WBC contender Larry Holmes at Caesars Palace for an elimination bout for the WBC world heavyweight title, the winner to face WBC heavyweight champion Ken Norton. The fight happened at Paradise, Nevada on March 25, 1978. Holmes won by a 12-round unanimous decision.

====Shavers vs Norton====
In a mandatory title challenge eliminator Earnie Shavers knocked out former champion Ken Norton in the first round. The victory is widely regarded as the best win of his career and earned him a bout with WBC champion Larry Holmes.

====Shavers vs Holmes II====
Shavers and Holmes fought once again on September 29, 1979, again at Caesars Palace, this time for the WBC title. Shavers knocked Holmes down in round seven and apparently in round nine (the referee ruled it a slip). After Shavers took a series of punches in the eleventh round and seemed defenseless, the referee stopped the fight, awarding a TKO win for Larry Holmes. Holmes, known for his ability to take a punch, later said that Shavers&#x27;s knockdown blow in the seventh round was the hardest he had ever taken in his career.

===Later career===
The Holmes rematch was the last big fight for Shavers. In 1980, in a wild slugfest he was stopped in the eighth round by durable prospect Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb. Prior to the Cobb fight, Shavers had undergone eye surgery for a detached retina. (Since eye surgery was not nearly as refined then as it is today, the majority of boxers retired for good after that kind of injury. In the words of Duane Ford of the Nevada Athletic Commission, a detached retina for a boxer was like an AIDS diagnosis). Shavers had not fully recovered from the surgery when he came back for the Cobb fight. He never again fought for the world title. In 1982 he fought Joe Bugner, also on the comeback trail. Bugner was knocked down in the first, and was stopped by cuts in the second round.

Shavers continued to fight professionally for several years, retiring in 1995 after losing to Brian Yates. Many thought he should have retired after his upset loss to lower contender Bernardo Mercado. Shavers had a similar retinal eye injury as Sugar Ray Leonard.

===Comeback===
Shavers attempted two abbreviated comebacks–—a fight in 1987, and two in 1995, in the second of which he was KO&#x27;d by Brian Yates in round 2. After this loss, Shavers retired for good.

Shavers has been named among the top-10 punchers in boxing history by &quot;The Ring&quot; and others.

Shavers finished his career in 1995 with a record of 76 wins (70 by knockout, 23 inside the first round, with 52 in the first 3 rounds), 14 losses (7 by knockout), and 1 draw.

==Fighting style==

Shavers was an exceptionally heavy puncher who stalked his opponents, setting them up for his thunderous right, which was responsible for many of his knockouts, although Angelo Dundee in a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; mid-1970s article said &quot;He can get you out of there with any kind of shot&quot;, referring to Shavers&#x27;s ability to inflict damage with a left hook, right cross or right uppercut. Several boxers famous for their tough chins had fallen to Shavers&#x27;s punches, including Bugner and Ellis who were felled by his uppercut.

Shavers would throw punches against any legal area he could reach, exposed or covered, relying on his tremendous power to wear down his opponents and exploiting any opening. His fighting stance produced a short and powerful image. His chin was his weakness. He could however &quot;box&quot; as well as slug. Notably, he injured his right hand early in a 10-round match against rated craftsman Henry Clark and responded with a strong jabbing performance to beat Clark, himself noted for his jabbing ability, on points.

===Video and book===
Shavers published a video of highlights of his career in 1992 titled &quot;Earnie D. Shavers, The hardest one-punch hitter&quot;, and later an autobiography.

==Life after boxing==
Shavers retired in 1983 after retinal problems were discovered. After retirement, he became an ordained Christian minister and moved to Phoenix, where he preached for many years. He moved to England to pastor a church there in the early 2000s. He was on the Benny Hinn TV show several times.

During the early 1980s while preparing for the feature film &quot;Rocky III&quot;, Sylvester Stallone explored the possibility of using a real heavyweight boxer in the role of James &quot;Clubber&quot; Lang by inviting Earnie Shavers to spar with him. Shavers initially refused to hit Stallone with anything other than a soft jab. This frustrated Stallone, who asked Shavers, &quot;C&#x27;mon Earnie, show me something real.&quot; Earnie responded by punching him once near the liver, forcing an immediate retirement; Stallone later said: &quot;that nearly killed me. I went straight to the men&#x27;s room and threw up&quot;. However, according to Rhonda Young, the film&#x27;s casting director, the reason why he was eventually not chosen for the part is that his voice was too high-pitched and not menacing enough (Joe Frazier was also considered).

Shavers visited Ali several times and he said that he, Ali, and George Foreman became very good friends over the years. Foreman, when asked about toughest and hardest punching opponent he ever met in the ring, said:
Shavers accepted the invitation of the Full Gospel Business Men&#x27;s Fellowship International to preach at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.

He also worked in Liverpool in the UK, as head of security at Hannah&#x27;s bar, where he was very much respected. Until 2009, he worked at Yates&#x27; Wine Lodge in Liverpool &quot;meeting and greeting&quot;. On occasion Shavers was a troubleshooting referee in professional wrestling after his retirement.

He was also a Patron of The Shannon Bradshaw Trust, a children&#x27;s charity based in Warrington, Cheshire, helping children with life-threatening conditions, and their families.

Shavers spoke to pupils at Barr Beacon Language College in Walsall. He also gave a speech on 26 February 2008 at The Streetly School in Walsall, which was based upon helping kids make the right decisions in life.

==Personal life==

Shavers was married to his high school sweetheart, Laverne Payne. They had five daughters, Tamara Shavers, Cynthia Shavers, Catherine Shavers-Long, Carla Shavers, and Amy Shavers-Perkins. He also has four daughters and one son from other relationships. He had 24 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Shavers made a guest appearance on the Irish TV program &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; hosted by Ron Lyle where the two fighters discussed their previous bout that had happened a month earlier. Shavers was a frequent visitor to the pub Roddy Bolands in Dublin. There is a signed picture of Shavers drinking a pint of Guinness on the wall there.

==Death==
Shavers died at age 78 on September 1, 2022, from a short illness at his daughter&#x27;s home in Virginia.

<doc id="223138" wikidata="Q1970683" url="?curid=223138" title="Ron Lyle">
<text>Ronald David Lyle (February 12, 1941 – November 26, 2011) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1971 to 1980, and in 1995. He challenged unsuccessfully for the world heavyweight championship, losing to Muhammad Ali in 1975. Known for his punching power, crowd-pleasing fighting style, and his courage and determination in the ring, Lyle defeated Buster Mathis, Oscar Bonavena, Jimmy Ellis, Vicente Rondón, Earnie Shavers, Joe Bugner, Gregorio Peralta and Scott LeDoux, but is best known for his fight against George Foreman in 1976, which was voted Fight of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
Lyle was born the third of 19 children to William and Nellie Lyle of Dayton, Ohio. In 1954, they moved to Denver, Colorado, where his father got a job as a sandblaster at Buckley Air Force Base. Growing up in the housing projects on the city&#x27;s northeast side, Lyle associated with street gangs and at 19, after dropping out of Manual High School, Lyle was involved in the shooting death of a 21-year-old gang rival. Lyle argued he was being attacked with a lead pipe and was not the one who pulled the trigger, but he was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15-to-25 years in the Colorado State Penitentiary. He nearly died on an operating table there after being stabbed by another inmate, but survived after 36 blood transfusions. In solitary confinement for 90 days afterward, he began doing push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and other exercises, and he trained regularly from then on.

While in prison, Lyle, then age 26, enlisted the African-American self-help group named Black Cultural Development Society (BCDS) and coached the group&#x27;s football team, &quot;The Wildcats&quot;, leading them to a championship among the inter-prison teams. He also played with the &quot;Canon City Rockbusters&quot;.

He first attended a prison boxing event on July 4, 1962, as a spectator, where he decided he could compete as well. His prison boxing debut came in 1964. Lyle credited Lt. Cliff Mattax, the athletic director at the prison, for developing his interest in boxing. When Mattax first approached Lyle and tried to befriend him, he wasn&#x27;t welcomed, &quot;Man, you&#x27;re a screw and I&#x27;m a convict. I came here by myself and I&#x27;ll leave the same way.&quot; After recovering from the stab-wound, he changed his mind. &quot;It was the turning point of my life. Mattax was white, and he wore a badge, but he really cared. He believed in me and my ability. Right then I decided to be a success,&quot; Lyle said later. Mattax in turn said: &quot;I don&#x27;t like to take any credit for what happened, but Ron turned into a real gentleman.&quot;

He watched boxing on TV and said, &quot;I can do better than that,&quot; and soon the prison was bringing in boxers for him to fight. &quot;They had fight cards in prison. I sat around watching them for a while and finally said to myself, &#x27;I can do that,&#x27;&quot; Lyle said. In his first match for the prison boxing team, Lyle was said to be defeated by Texas Johnson. He never lost a prison boxing match again. According to Colorado State&#x27;s Warden Wayne K. Patterson, Lyle was a &quot;natural born athlete.&quot;

==Amateur career==
During the remainder of his sentence, he had around twenty-five unaccounted amateur fights, losing only once, and winning six heavyweight titles for inmates.
By 1969 Lyle was eligible for parole, but twice he was turned down. He was told that a professional boxing career was not a suitable parole plan. Fortunately, his fame had spread to Denver, where the Denver Rocks boxing team had just joined the short-lived International Boxing League. Bill Daniels, a cable television executive, president of American Basketball Association and owner of the Denver Rocks boxing team and the Utah Stars basketball team, offered Lyle an official job as a welder with a firm he owned, and on Sunday, November 9, 1969, Lyle was released from prison on parole. He was released after serving 7½ years. The next morning he showed up at the Rocks&#x27; Gym in Denver (later known as Elks Gym,) and was trying out with the Rocks. He made the team, and in the succeeding fifteen months, before turning pro, he won a number of tournaments. He was paroled on November 22, 1969, and later he was given a full pardon by the Governor John Arthur Love.

&quot;I asked around about the Rocks. They told me they already had a heavyweight (Richard Archuletta and Dan Hermosillo). I figured I could whip him so I stuck around.&quot; They were trained by the well-known boxing veteran Bobby Lewis. Less than a month later, Lyle made his amateur debut with the team, avenged an earlier Rocks&#x27; heavyweight loss and became the team&#x27;s heavyweight at 215 pounds. Lyle&#x27;s first amateur victory was a third-round knockout over Fred Houpe (who would later be Leon Spinks&#x27;s final opponent). He was the 1970 National AAU Heavyweight Champion (outpointed previously unbeaten Mike Montgomery of Philadelphia), the 1970 North American Amateur Heavyweight Champion, and the 1970 International Boxing League Heavyweight Champion. After capturing the NAA title, Lyle became a member of the United States National Boxing Team, as he was still on parole he was given permission to leave the U.S., and dispatched on a boxing journey across Europe, visiting Italy, Yugoslavia, and Romania and meeting top local heavyweights in the process. He lost by decision to Romanian Ion Alexe, but pounded Soviet Armenian heavyweight Kamo Saroyan (89–9) against the ropes (referee interrupted and saved Saroyan from further pounding) in a match broadcast by ABC television&#x27;s Wide World of Sports, preparing for which he quit his regular job, and dispatched of Duane Bobick, which took the latter&#x27;s corner five minutes to bring him back into consciousness. No American before Lyle knocked out a Soviet heavyweight. Fighting Bobick to make it to the national team, Lyle was behind on judges&#x27; scorecards, and when he fought Saroyan, he again was behind on points, which nonetheless didn&#x27;t stop him from knocking out both. On January 25, 1971, Lyle fought his last fight as an amateur, knocking out the Pacific Northwest Golden Gloves heavyweight champion Jim Wahlberg. Meanwhile, two world&#x27;s top-ranked heavyweights, Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, were preparing themselves for the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;. In February, Lyle visited both rival camps. First he went to Miami Beach, Florida, where the Ali&#x27;s training camp was based, to spar several rounds with Ali. Then he went to Catskill, New York, to the Frazier&#x27;s camp, but Yancey Durham, Frazier&#x27;s manager, did not approve Lyle as a sparring partner, instead he went against one of Frazier&#x27;s previously selected sparring partners, a professional boxer from Chicago (Frazier reportedly has invited Lyle for a two-round exhibition at Kiamesha Lake, New York, on January 19, but Lyle was busy qualifying to fight the Soviet.)

His amateur career outside of prison lasted only 14 months, during which he compiled a record of 25–4 (no stoppages,) with 17 knockouts at national and international contests. (plus unaccounted record of 23–1, 15 KOs, and also without a stoppage, while serving seven-and-a-half-years prison term, bringing his overall amateur record to around 47–5.) During his amateur days he was never knocked down or cut. Lyle was an obvious choice for the 1971 Pan American Games and the 1972 Olympics, but as he stepped into the pro ranks, Duane Bobick, whom he knocked out twice, was set to represent the United States.

On February 24, 1971, Lyle, age 30, signed a professional boxing contract with Bill Daniels. &quot;Daniels told me ‘You fight this Russian in January and we&#x27;ll turn you pro.’ This was the door that had to be opened, whuppin&#x27; the Russian. So I quit my job and trained for six months. I wasn&#x27;t going to get beat because I wasn&#x27;t in shape,&quot; Lyle recalled. Daniels, in turn, said of Lyle that, &quot;The reason Ron has adjusted is that he&#x27;s got a talent, something he knows he&#x27;s good at and can dedicate himself to.&quot;

After he turned pro, Lyle visited his fellow inmates in prison the day before or after each and every professional fight.

==Professional career==
Lyle had a very late start in professional boxing. He turned professional under Bill Daniels, with trainer Bobby Lewis. His first fight was at the age of 30 in Denver, Colorado, against A. J. Staples, which he won by knockout in the second round. Lyle went on to post a 19–0 record with 17 knockouts, and became the 5th rated heavyweight contender. He scored impressive knockouts over notables Vicente Rondon, a light heavyweight champion; hulking Buster Mathis; and won by unanimous decision over former WBA Heavyweight Champion, Jimmy Ellis. After dispatching of Buster Mathis, Lyle stated that he is looking for a match-up versus current undisputed champion Joe Frazier, saying &quot;When I&#x27;m ready. I&#x27;m not taking any shortcuts.&quot; Yancey Durham, Frazier&#x27;s manager and an interested observer, did compliment Lyle on his punching power. He was ranked #4 heavyweight in the world by WBA and the Ring Magazine. Lyle&#x27;s undefeated streak ended on a one-sided decision to veteran Jerry Quarry: the latter gave one of his career best performances using a boxer/puncher style to create openings first, gaining the initiative using his greater experience. Lyle then lost to Jimmy Young in 1975. In a later rematch, Young again edged Lyle and went on to outpoint George Foreman in 1977.

===Lyle vs. Ali===
On May 16, 1975, he was given an opportunity to face heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, during Ali&#x27;s second title defense in his second reign as champion. Lyle had Bobby Lewis and Chico Ferrara in his corner. Lyle was the more aggressive fighter in the early rounds, with Ali conserving his energy and covering up in the center of the ring allowing Lyle to score. Lyle also showed restraint and did not respond to Ali&#x27;s attempts at the rope-a-dope ploy. Though in danger of falling too far behind on points, Ali appeared to be in control of the pace of the fight, and picked his moments to score. The fight was close going into the 11th round, with Lyle winning on all three of the judges&#x27; score cards. Ali then hit Lyle with a strong right hand and followed with several flurrying punches, scoring. The referee stopped the fight, seeing that Lyle was unable to defend himself and Ali was punching him in the head at will. Lyle&#x27;s corner was not happy with the referee&#x27;s decision.

===Lyle vs. Foreman===
Lyle is perhaps best known for a brawling fight in 1976 with Hall of Famer George Foreman. Foreman was making a comeback after suffering his first loss to Ali in the Rumble in the Jungle.

The fight is looked upon to this day as one of the most exciting and brutal in heavyweight history. Lyle took the offensive against the former champion and won the opening round. At one point he hit Foreman with a thunderous right hand followed by a staggering body punch. After nearly being knocked out in Round Two, Lyle was able to recover due to a timing error resulting in the round being only two minutes instead of the scheduled three. Later in the fight, Lyle amazed the crowd by flooring Foreman twice in the fourth round while being knocked down once himself. Lyle, Muhammad Ali and Jimmy Young are the only boxers to have ever knocked down Foreman during a professional boxing match. Foreman later said that Lyle was the toughest man he ever fought, and the hardest hitter he ever took up. The former champion recovered and scored a knockout in the fifth round. Foreman later said he won the fight due to Lyle&#x27;s exhaustion.

Lyle scored impressive victories over rated José Luis García, and big names Oscar Bonavena and Earnie Shavers during his career. He also won a split decision over Joe Bugner, boring in with a thudding body attack in a fine contest.

While Lyle was working as a security guard in Las Vegas, he was accused of another murder. He shot a man in his apartment who had spent time with him in the Colorado State Penitentiary. On December 16, 1978, Lyle was acquitted. His attorney Walter Gerash said Lyle shot Clark in self defense.

According to George Foreman, Ron Lyle was one of the three hardest punchers he had faced in his career along with Gerry Cooney and Cleveland Williams.

===Later career===
The year 1979 marked a decline in Lyle&#x27;s abilities. Draws with fringe contenders Stan Ward and Scott LeDoux were followed by a stunning one-punch loss to unheard-of Lynn Ball. Ball went on to match other names but never achieved similar success. &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine quoted Lyle as saying afterwards &quot;No one does that to me.&quot;

He would return to the ring, however, but not for long. Ron retired again after a first-round knockout loss to then-rising star and undefeated power-hitting Gerry Cooney. By then, Lyle was 39 years old and his best years had gone.

===Comeback===
In 1995, after George Foreman made his comeback into the ring to capture the world heavyweight title again, Lyle, at the age of 54, also decided on a brief comeback. After scoring four quick knockouts over second-rate opponents, Lyle tried to get a rematch with Foreman. The match was never made, however, and Lyle retired from boxing.

==Retirement==
Lyle ran the boxing gym Denver Red Shield in Denver, Colorado. He was the former trainer of light welterweight contender Victor Ortíz, who fought out of Denver during some of his amateur career.

In 1992 Lyle trained a young promising talent from Las Vegas, Arash Hashemi, and under his mentorship Hashemi won two Golden Gloves championships.

==Death==

Lyle died at the age of 70, on Saturday November 26, 2011 from complications from a sudden stomach ailment.

==Lyle in the media and popular culture==
A biography titled &quot;Off the Ropes: the Ron Lyle Story&quot; was written by Candace Toft and released in the United Kingdom by Scratching Shed Publishing in May 2010. It was republished in the United States by Hamilcar Publications in October 2018.

Ron Lyle appeared in the film &quot;Facing Ali&quot;, a 2009 documentary, where he discusses his life and career. About his fight against Ali, when referee Fredy Nunez stopped the fight, he said &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it, you know. I&#x27;m ahead on all scorecards. [...] Am I bitter? Forget about it. I never took it personal. If there don&#x27;t be no Ali, you think you&#x27;d be sitting here talking to Ron Lyle? About what?&quot;

During this documentary he revealed that, during his stint in prison, where he received one meal a day consisting of a bowl of spinach, he passed time by doing up to 1,000 push-ups in an hour each day.

<doc id="223140" wikidata="Q393047" url="?curid=223140" title="Concord grape">
<text>The Concord grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; (also known as fox grape) that are used as table grapes, wine grapes and juice grapes. They are often used to make grape jelly, grape juice, grape pies, grape-flavored soft drinks, and candy. The grape is sometimes used to make wine, particularly sacramental and kosher wine. Traditionally, most commercially produced Concord wines have been finished sweet, but dry versions are possible if adequate fruit ripeness is achieved. A notable dry version comes from Penn Shore Winery &amp; Vineyards in Lake Erie AVA in Pennsylvania. This region is known for the highest Concord quality and over 10,000 acres planted. The grape is named after the town in Massachusetts where it was developed. The grapes are cultivated in many different parts of the world now.

The skin of a Concord grape is typically dark blue or purple and often is covered with a glaucous epicuticular wax &quot;bloom&quot; that can be rubbed off. It is a slip-skin variety, meaning the skin is easily separated from the fruit. Concord grapes have large seeds and are highly aromatic. The Concord grape is particularly prone to the physiological disorder black spot.

In the United States, 417,800 tons were produced in 2011. The major growing areas are the Finger Lakes District of New York, Lake Erie Pennsylvania/NY, Lake Ontario, Southwestern Michigan, and the Yakima Valley in Washington. They are sometimes found growing wild.

==Usage==
Concord grapes are often used to make grape jelly and are only occasionally available as table grapes, especially in New England. They are the usual grapes used in the jelly for the traditional peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and Concord grape jelly is a staple product in U.S. supermarkets. Concord grapes are used for grape juice, and their distinctive purple color has led to grape-flavored soft drinks and candy being artificially colored purple. Methyl anthranilate, a chemical present in Concord grapes, is used to give &quot;grape&quot; flavor. The dark-colored Concord juice is used in some churches as a non-alcoholic alternative to wine in the service of communion. Concord grapes have been used to make kosher wine and sacramental wine. The oldest sacramental winery in America, O-Neh-Da Vineyard, still produces a Concord wine for the altar.

==History==

The Concord grape was developed in 1849 by Ephraim Wales Bull in Concord, Massachusetts. Bull planted seeds from wild &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; and evaluated over 22,000 seedlings before finding what he considered the ideal Concord grape. Genetic testing confirmed that Concord grape has roughly one-third &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; parentage. The selected Concord vine was planted next to other cultivars, including Catawba, which was later confirmed to be a parent of Concord using systematic SSR analysis.

In 1853, Bull&#x27;s grape won first place at the Boston Horticultural Society Exhibition. It was then introduced to the market in 1854. Dr. Thomas Bramwell Welch developed the first Concord grape juice in his house in 1869. Through the process of pasteurization, the juice did not ferment. Welch transferred the juice operations to Westfield, New York, processing 300 tons of grapes into juice in 1897.

<doc id="223141" wikidata="Q1055934" url="?curid=223141" title="Marcus Daly">
<text>Marcus Daly (December 5, – November 12, 1900) was an Irish-born American businessman known as one of the four &quot;Copper Kings&quot; of Butte, Montana, United States.

==Early life==
Daly emigrated from County Cavan, Ireland, to the United States as a young boy, arriving in New York City. He sold newspapers and worked his way to California in time to join the gold rush on what was to become Virginia City, Nevada, and the fabulously rich silver diggings now known as the Comstock Lode, in 1860.

==Career==
Daly gained experience in the mines of the Comstock under the direction of John William Mackay and James G. Fair. While working in the mines of Virginia City, Daly met and befriended George Hearst and partners James Ben Ali Haggin and Lloyd Tevis, co-owners of the Ophir Mining Company. (Hearst&#x27;s son was William Randolph Hearst). In 1872, Daly would recommend purchase by the Hearst group the Ontario mine, near Park City, Utah. In ten years, the Ontario produced $17 million and paid $6,250,000 in dividends, and made many millions for Hearst, Tevis and Haggin.

Their business friendship was to extend for many years and help establish the Anaconda Copper Mine in Butte, Montana. Daly originally came to Butte in August 1876 to look at a mine, the Alice, as an agent for the Walker brothers of Salt Lake City. The Walkers purchased the mine, installed Daly as superintendent and awarded him a fractional share of the mine. The Walkers became the namesakes of Walkerville, which formed around the Alice.

Always an energetic engineer and geologist with a keen eye for paying ore, Daly noticed while working underground in the Alice, that there were significant deposits of copper ore. He gained access into several other mines in the area and concluded that the hill was full of copper ore. He envisioned an ore body several thousand feet deep, some veins of almost pure copper that would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He urged his employers, the Walker Bros. to purchase the Anaconda and when they refrained, Daly bought it. Daly founded his fortune on the Anaconda Copper Mine in Butte, after selling his small share of the Alice Mine, for $30,000. 

In 1886, Daly bought property in Hamilton, Montana, building a summer residence and creating the Bitterroot Stock Farm, a 22,000 acre ranch and horse breeding facility. The ranch included a stable called Tammany Castle, built for his prize-winning thoroughbred Tammany, a racetrack, and veterinary clinic, amongst other operations like apple orchards and cattle. These were built around the family&#x27;s residence, the Daly Mansion. In order to bring water to the agricultural fields, Daly invested in several ditch companies to build irrigation canals throughout the valley. Shortly thereafter he became involved in the timber industry in the Bitterroot Valley, purchasing acres of timberland and building sawmills to provide fuel for the smelters in Anaconda. Daly continued to invest in the area, developing infrastructure for the growing workforce. Daly opened the Bitterroot Development Company Store in 1890, which became the Valley Mercantile 18 years later. 

==The Anaconda==
The Anaconda began as a silver mine, but Daly&#x27;s purchase was for the copper, found to be one of the largest deposits known at the time. However, he lacked the money to develop it, so he turned to Hearst, Haggin and Tevis. Backed with many millions of dollars, he set out upon developing &quot;The Richest Hill on Earth&quot;. The first couple hundred feet within the mine were rich in silver, and took a few years to exhaust. By that time, Butte&#x27;s other silver mines were also playing out, so Daly closed the Anaconda, St Lawrence and Neversweat mines. Prices on surrounding properties dropped and Daly quietly purchased them. Then he re-opened the Anaconda as a copper mine and announced to the world that Butte was &quot;The Richest Hill on Earth&quot;. Shortly before this time, Thomas Edison had developed the light bulb and built a city block in New York to show off what electricity could do. The world would need copper as it was an excellent conductor of electricity. Butte had copper. In 1882, nine million tons of copper were mined from a five-square-mile region. Just 14 years later the area was producing 210 million pounds of copper.

He built a smelter to handle the ore, and by the late 1880s, had become a millionaire several times over, and owner of the Anaconda Mining and Reduction Company. Daly owned a railroad, the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railroad to haul ore from his mines to his smelter in Anaconda, a city he founded for his employees to work the smelters. Anaconda&#x27;s smelters quickly became the world&#x27;s largest metallurgical plant. Daly&#x27;s lumber and investment interests in the Bitterroot Valley spurred the creation of a rail line by the Northern Pacific Railway in Hamilton. This railway transported massive amounts of lumber to Anaconda for the smelters.

In 1894, Daly spearheaded an energetic but unsuccessful campaign to have Anaconda designated as Montana&#x27;s state capital, but lost out to Helena, which was supported by William Andrews Clark. Daly was active in Montana politics throughout the 1890s, because of his opposition and intense rivalry with fellow copper king, and future U.S. Senator, William Clark. Daly tried to keep Clark out of office by lavishly supporting Clark&#x27;s opponents.

In 1898, Daly went looking for a buyer of his company. He entered into negotiations with William Rockefeller and Henry H. Rogers of John D Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil of Ohio. The Anaconda Mining Company (and associated interests) were purchased in 1899 for $39 million and became Amalgamated Copper Mining Company. Daly was made president of the company in 1899 and died the following year in 1900.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Daly invested some of his money in horse breeding at his Bitterroot Stock Farm located near Hamilton. A number of his horses were successful, which some speculators attributed to the elevation and climate of Hamilton, and others to the rich feed produced by the valley. 

In 1891, Daly became the owner of Tammany, identified as Horse of the Year in 1893. He owned and stood Inverness, sire of Scottish Chieftain, as well as Hamburg, Ogden, and The Pepper. Scottish Chieftain is the only horse born in Montana that has won the Belmont Stakes. He also arranged the breeding of the great Sysonby, ranked number 30 in the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century by Blood-Horse magazine, though Daly died before the horse was born. In 1956, Sysonby was made a member of the Racing Horse Hall of Fame.

Following his death, New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden hosted a dispersal sale for the Bitterroot thoroughbred stud, beginning on January 31, 1901; 185 horses were sold the first day for $405,525.

== Legacy==

Daly&#x27;s legacy was a mixed one for Anaconda. From 1885 to 1980, the smelter was one of the town&#x27;s largest employers and provided well-paid jobs for generations. When the smelter closed in 1980, during a labor strike, 25% of the town&#x27;s workforce was put out of work and the town has not recovered. The smelter itself was torn down as part of environmental cleanup efforts in the 1990s, although the smokestack is still in place, visible for many miles across the valley, above the town.

Daly&#x27;s legacy was equally mixed for Butte. The Anaconda Company was bought out by the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company in 1899, and by the 1920s it controlled mining in the city. It continued to be one of the state&#x27;s largest employers and a mainstay of the state and local economies until the 1970s. In the 1950s, the ACM began open-pit mining in Butte, creating a steadily growing pit, known as the Berkeley Pit, east of the main business district. In the mid-1970s, copper prices collapsed and the ACM was bought out by the Atlantic Richfield Company, (ARCO). ARCO ceased mining in Butte in 1980 and shut off the deep pumps in 1982, ending what Daly had begun almost exactly 100 years before. Montana Resources, owned by the Washington Group, as of 2007, operates an open pit copper and molybdenum mine in Butte, and also recovers copper from the water in the Berkeley Pit. In 1980 the Berkeley Pit, the Clark Fork River and the smelter outside the town of Anaconda, MT were declared federal Superfund sites by the US EPA.

A statue of Daly by Augustus Saint-Gaudens stands at the main entrance to Montana Tech of the University of Montana (formerly the Montana School of Mines), at the west end of Park Street in Butte.

A drawing of Daly by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) was acquired in 2009 by the American National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C.

Riverside, the summer home of the Daly Family, is located in Hamilton, Montana and open to visitors. Margaret Daly, Marcus&#x27; wife, had the home remodeled after his death into a Georgian-Revival Style Colonial.

The Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital, located in Hamilton, Montana, now called Bitterroot Health-Daly Hospital, was incorporated on December 18, 1929.

Hamilton also hosts the Daly Days celebration to honor Marcus Daly.

During WWII, the US Navy honored Marcus Daly with a liberty ship in honor of his accomplishments, the SS Marcus Daly. The ship served honorably during the war, from 1943 to the end of hostilities, earning several service medals in the process.

<text>Peter Kosler or Kozler (16 February 1824 – 16 April 1879) was an Austrian-Slovene lawyer, geographer, cartographer, activist, and businessman. He was of ethnic German origin, but also identified with Slovene culture and advocated the peaceful coexistence of the Slovene and German cultures in Carniola.

Kosler was born in Koče, a village south of Kočevje in Gottschee County, in what was then the Austrian Kingdom of Illyria, and is now Slovenia. He is best known for creating the first map of the Slovene Lands, called &quot;Zemljovid Slovenske dežele in pokrajin&quot; (Map of the Slovene Land and Provinces). Made already from 1848 until the end of 1852, it was published only in 1861. Despite this, it had a significant impact in the time of the Slovene national awakening.

Born in a relatively well-to-do family, Kosler made a fortune with beer brewing and was the founder of the Union Brewery. He gave large amounts of money to support Slovenian cultural associations and institutions. He was close to the conservative Old Slovene political movement.

Kosler bought Cekin Mansion just outside the center of Ljubljana and renovated it in a neoclassical style. Today, the mansion houses the National Museum of Contemporary History. The Koslers also owned a mansion () in the center of Ljubljana, close to Congress Square () and Čop Street (), which was regarded as one of the finest Baroque buildings in the city. The building was slated for demolition in 1956 and torn down by the Communist authorities in 1961 in order to widen the nearby street, which caused a public outcry and marked a milestone in the development of postwar urban development in Ljubljana. According to an interview with art historian Damjan Prelovšek in October 2006, trees now grow at the site of the former building, demonstrating that its demolition was a political decision and unnecessary in order to widen the street. 

Kosler also owned a plot of land in the Ljubljana Marsh known as Kosler&#x27;s Thicket (). During World War II, the plot was used as a mass grave for victims of the Slovenian Home Guard torturer and killer Franc Frakelj.

Kosler died in Ljubljana and is buried at Žale cemetery in Ljubljana.

In 1999, a Slovenian postal stamp was dedicated to Kosler.

<doc id="223149" wikidata="Q42053" url="?curid=223149" title="Isfahan">
<text>Isfahan or Esfahan/Espahan (; ) is a major city in the Central District of Isfahan County, Isfahan province, Iran. It is the capital of the province, the county, and the district. It is located south of Tehran. The city has a population of approximately 2,220,000, making it the third-most populous city in Iran, after Tehran and Mashhad, and the second-largest metropolitan area.

Isfahan is located at the intersection of the two principal routes that traverse Iran, north–south and east–west. Isfahan flourished between the 9th and 18th centuries. Under the Safavid Empire, Isfahan became the capital of Iran, for the second time in its history, under Abbas the Great. The city retains much of its history. It is famous for its Persian–Muslim architecture, grand boulevards, covered bridges, palaces, tiled mosques, and minarets. Isfahan also has many historical buildings, monuments, paintings, and artifacts. The fame of Isfahan led to the Persian proverb &quot;Esfahān nesf-e-jahān ast&quot; (Isfahan is half (of) the world). Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan is one of the largest city squares in the world, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
The name Isfahan is derived from Middle Persian , which is attested by various Middle Persian seals and inscriptions, including that of the Zoroastrian magi Kartir. The present-day name is the Arabicized form of &quot;Ispahan&quot; (unlike Middle Persian, but New Persian does not allow initial consonant clusters such as &quot;sp&quot;). 

The region is denoted by the abbreviation &quot;GD&quot; (Southern Media) on Sasanian coins. In Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;, it appears as (), which translates to &quot;place of gathering for the army&quot;. It is believed that is derived from &quot;the armies&quot;, the Old Persian plural of , from which is derived () &#x27;army&#x27; and (, &#x27;soldier&#x27;, literally &#x27;of the army&#x27;) in Central Persian. Some of the other ancient names include Gey, Jey (old form Zi), Park, and Judea.

==History==
Human habitation in the Isfahan region can be traced back to the Palaeolithic period. Archaeologists have recently found artifacts dating back to the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron ages. During the Median rule, Isfahan became a regional centre especially from the benefits from the Zayandehrud River. It was a religiously and ethnically diverse city during the reign of Cyrus the Great and exhibited religious tolerance.

The Arabs captured Isfahan in 642 CE and made it the capital of al-Jibal province. The city further grew prosperous under the Buyid dynasty, and further under the Seljuk dynasty. With the fall of the Seljuks in 1200 CE, the city temporarily declined but regained its importance during the Safavid era (1501-1736) with the city&#x27;s golden age under the rule of Abbas the Great who also moved his capital from Qazvin to Isfahan. During his reign, Turkish, Armenian, and Persian craftsmen were forcefully resettled in the city to ensure its prosperity. Later, the city also had enclaves for people of Georgian, Circassian, and Daghistani descent. The city once again declined after the Siege of Isfahan by Afghan invaders in 1722. 

In the 20th century, Isfahan was resettled by many people from southern Iran: especially during the population migrations at the start of the century, and in the 1980s, following the Iran–Iraq War.

===Zoroastrian era===
Under Median rule, a commercial entrepôt began to show signs of more sedentary urbanism, steadily growing into a noteworthy regional centre that benefited from the exceptionally fertile soil on the banks of the Zayandehrud River, in a region called Aspandana or Ispandana.

When Cyrus the Great unified Persian and Median lands into the Achaemenid Empire, the religiously and ethnically diverse city of Isfahan became an early example of the king&#x27;s fabled religious tolerance. It was Cyrus who, having just taken Babylon, made an edict in 538 BCE declaring that Jews in Babylon could return to Jerusalem. Later, some of the Jewish immigrants settled in Isfahan instead of returning to their homeland. The 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih wrote:

The Parthians (247 BCE – 224 CE), continued the tradition of tolerance after the fall of the Achaemenids, fostering a Hellenistic dimension within Iranian culture and the political organization introduced by Alexander the Great&#x27;s invading armies. Under the Parthians, Arsacid governors administered the provinces of the nation from Isfahan, and the city&#x27;s urban development accelerated to accommodate the needs of a capital city.

The next empire to rule, the Sassanids (224–651 CE), presided over massive changes in their realm, instituting sweeping agricultural reforms and reviving Iranian culture and the Zoroastrian religion. Both the city and region were then called by the name Aspahan or Spahan. The city was governed by a group called the Espoohrans, who descended from seven noble Iranian families. Extant foundations of some Sassanid-era bridges in Isfahan suggest that the Sasanian kings were fond of ambitious urban-planning projects. While Isfahan&#x27;s political importance declined during this period, many Sassanid princes would study statecraft in the city, and its military role increased. Its strategic location at the intersection of the ancient roads to Susa and Persepolis made it an ideal candidate to house a standing army, which would be ready to march against Constantinople at any moment. The words &quot;Aspahan&quot; and &quot;Spahan&quot; are derived from the Pahlavi or Middle Persian meaning &#x27;the place of the army&#x27;.

Although many theories have mentioned the origins of Isfahan, little is known of it before the rule of the Sasanian dynasty. The historical facts suggest that, in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, Queen Shushandukht, the Jewish consort of Yazdegerd I (reigned 399–420), settled a colony of Jewish immigrants in Yahudiyyeh (also spelled Yahudiya), a settlement northwest of the Zoroastrian city of Gabae (its Achaemid and Parthian name; Gabai was its Sasanic name, which was shortened to Gay (Arabic &#x27;Jay&#x27;) that was located on the northern bank of the Zayanderud River (the colony&#x27;s establishment was also attributed to Nebuchadrezzar, though that&#x27;s less likely). The gradual population decrease of Gay (Jay) and the simultaneous population increase of Yahudiyyeh and its suburbs, after the Arab conquest of Iran, resulted in the formation of the nucleus of what was to become the city of Isfahan. The words &quot;Aspadana&quot;, &quot;Ispadana&quot;, &quot;Spahan&quot;, and &quot;Sepahan&quot;, all from which the word Isfahan is derived, referred to the region in which the city was located.

Isfahan and Gay were supposedly both circular in design, which was characteristic of Parthian and Sasanian cities. However, this reported Sasanian circular city of Isfahan has not yet been uncovered.

===Muslim era===
When the Arabs captured Isfahan in 642 CE, they made it the capital of al-Jibal (&quot;the Mountains&quot;) province, an area that covered much of ancient Media. Isfahan grew prosperous under the Persian Buyid (Buwayhid) dynasty, which rose to power and ruled much of Iran when the temporal authority of the Abbasid leaders waned in the 10th century. The city walls of Isfahan are thought to have been constructed during the tenth century. The Turkish conqueror and founder of the Seljuq dynasty, Toghril Beg, made Isfahan the capital of his domains in the mid-11th century; but it was under his grandson Malik-Shah I (r. 1073–92) that the city grew in size and splendour.

After the fall of the Seljuqs (), Isfahan temporarily declined and was eclipsed by other Iranian cities, such as Tabriz and Qazvin. During his visit in 1327, Ibn Battuta noted that &quot;The city of Isfahan is one of the largest and fairest of cities, but it is now in ruins for the greater part.&quot;

In 1387, Isfahan surrendered to the warlord Timur. Initially treated with relative mercy, the city revolted against Timur&#x27;s punitive taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur&#x27;s soldiers. In retribution, Timur ordered the massacre of the city residents, his soldiers killing a reported 70,000 citizens. An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers, each constructed of about 1,500 heads.

Isfahan regained its importance during the Safavid period (1501–1736). The city&#x27;s golden age began in 1598 when the Safavid ruler Abbas the Great (reigned 1588–1629) made it his capital and rebuilt it into one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the 17th-century world. In 1598, he moved his capital from Qazvin to the more central Isfahan. He introduced policies increasing Iranian involvement in the Silk Road trade. Turkish, Armenian, and Persian craftsmen were forcefully resettled in the city to ensure its prosperity. Their contributions to the economic vitality of the revitalized city supported the recovery of Safavid glory and prestige, after earlier losses to the Ottomans and Qizilbash tribes, ushering in a golden age for the city, when architecture and Persian culture flourished.

As part of Abbas&#x27;s forced resettlement of peoples from within his empire, as many as 300,000 Armenians (primarily from Jugha) were resettled in Isfahan during Abbas&#x27; reign.) In Isfahan, he ordered the establishment of a new quarter for these resettled Armenians from Old Julfa, and thus the Armenian Quarter of Isfahan was named New Julfa (today one of the largest Armenian quarters in the world).

Shah Abbas would also oversee a transformation of the urban pattern of Isfahan. The plans included the new, rectangular Shah Square and the linear Chahar Bagh Boulevard. Between these two focal points of Isfahan’s urban revitalization was a large garden, what is today the Hasht Behesht Gardens. The new, geometric, planned portions of Isfahan would stand out against the old city’s complex street layouts, attracting foreign emissaries and wealthy residents along the Chahar Bagh. Shah Square would be adorned by 4 grand monuments on each side. Importantly to the north, a turquoise gate connected the new square to Isfahan’s Grand Bazaar and old square, while to the south, the Shah Mosque would become the new primary place of worship for city residents.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of deportees and migrants from the Caucasus settled in the city. Following an agreement between Abbas the Great and his Georgian subject Teimuraz I of Kakheti (&quot;Tahmuras Khan&quot;), whereby the latter became Muslim and accepted Safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region&#x27;s &quot;wāli&quot; (governor), with his son serving as &quot;dāruḡa&quot; (prefect) of Isfahan. He was accompanied by a troop of soldiers, some of whom were Georgian Orthodox Christians. The royal court in Isfahan had a great number of Georgian &quot;ḡolāms&quot; (military servants), as well as Georgian women. Although they spoke both Persian and Turkic, their mother tongue was Georgian. Now the city had enclaves of those of Georgian, Circassian, and Daghistani descent. Engelbert Kaempfer, who dwelt in Safavid Iran in 1684–85, estimated their number at 20,000.

During Abbas&#x27;s reign, Isfahan became famous in Europe, and many European travellers, such as Jean Chardin, gave accounts of their visits to the city. The city&#x27;s prosperity lasted until it was sacked by Afghan invaders in 1722, during a marked decline in Safavid influence. Thereafter, Isfahan experienced a decline in importance, culminating in moving the capital to Mashhad and Shiraz during the Afsharid and Zand periods, respectively, until it was finally moved to Tehran, in 1775, by Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty.

In the early years of the 19th century, efforts were made to preserve some of Isfahan&#x27;s archeologically important buildings. The work was started by Mohammad Hossein Khan, during the reign of Fath Ali Shah.

===Modern age===
The city has had four master development programs. The first one was created in 1971 by German engineering firm that included checkered streets&#x27; design. In the 20th century, Isfahan was resettled by many people from southern Iran. Many of these migrants came during the population migrations at the start of the century and in the 1980s following the Iran–Iraq War. During the war, 23,000 from Isfahan were killed; and there were 43,000 veterans. In 1921 Telephone office were first created in Shams Abadi street.

Isfahan has one of the largest steel-producing facilities in the region, as well as facilities for producing special alloys. The Mobarakeh Steel Company is the biggest steel producer in the whole of the Middle East and Northern Africa, and it is the biggest DRI producer in the world.

Designed by Sheikh Bahaï, an engineer of Shah Abbas, this network has 77 madis in the northern course, and 71 in the southern course of the Zayandeh Rud. In 1993, this centuries-old network provided 91% of agricultural water, 4% of industrial needs, and 5% of city needs. 70 emergency wells were dug in 2018 to avoid water shortages.

===Ecological issues===

<doc id="223155" wikidata="Q1388497" url="?curid=223155" title="Jerry Quarry">
<text>Jerry Quarry (May 15, 1945 – January 3, 1999), nicknamed &quot;Irish&quot; or &quot;The Bellflower Bomber&quot;, was an American professional boxer. During the peak of his career from 1968 to 1971, Quarry was rated by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine as the most popular fighter in the sport. His most famous bouts were against Muhammad Ali. He is regarded as being one of the best heavyweight boxers never to win a title. He beat former world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson and top contenders Ron Lyle, Earnie Shavers, Brian London, Thad Spencer, Buster Mathis, Randy Neumann, Jack Bodell, Mac Foster and Eduardo Corletti. The damage he accumulated from lack of attention to defense against larger men at the top level, no head guard sparring, and attempted comebacks in 1977, 1983, and 1992 resulted in Quarry developing an unusually severe case of dementia pugilistica.

==Boxing career==
===Early life===
Quarry&#x27;s family includes three other pro boxers (his father and two brothers). Jerry&#x27;s father first put gloves on his son when Jerry was five years. Jerry fought first as a Junior Amateur, winning his first trophies at the age of eight. Later, he contracted nephritis, a debilitating illness which sidelined him for years.

Quarry came to notice by winning the 1965 National Golden Gloves championship in Kansas City at age 19. Weighing just 183 pounds, Quarry knocked out each of his five opponents in the tournament, a feat unmatched. Quarry had over 200 fights in his amateur career. He turned professional in 1965.

===In 1960s===
Despite starting in May, Quarry had 14 matches in 1965 at the start of his pro career. Many of his early career fights took place at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, where he became established as a draw. Quarry supplemented meager boxing pay by working as a tire changer at a Greyhound bus terminal. He had three draws on his record by the time of his first loss, which came in his 21st bout in July 1966 against crafty spoiler Eddie Machen, known for his feat of breaking Sonny Liston&#x27;s run of knockouts.

Quarry had various television roles in series TV of the period. One notable role was as himself, in the episode &quot;The Strongest Man In The World&quot; of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, which aired on November 18, 1968.

==== Championship Tournament ====
In mid-1967, the World Boxing Association (W.B.A.) held a tournament to replace Muhammad Ali, who had been stripped of his title for refusing induction into the military after being drafted. The tournament was expanded to include eight heavyweights, and did not include Joe Frazier, who had accepted a title belt outside the WBA.

When the tournament was expanded, Quarry was included. Quarry&#x27;s first tournament bout was a rematch of his fourth draw fight earlier that year against former world champion Floyd Patterson.

In both matches, Quarry dominated the early rounds with multiple knockdowns of Patterson, but faded in the latter stages. He hung on better in the second bout, and was given a split-decision victory. His second tournament match was a KO win against fellow Californian Thad Spencer, who was highly lauded and ranked coming into the match. In the final against crafty ex-middleweight Jimmy Ellis, Quarry prior to the bout sustained a broken back from an injury on the diving board at a pool that later developed into gangrene.

Ellis was wary of Quarry&#x27;s unorthodox tactic (displayed to great effect against Patterson) of retreating into the ropes then catching his opponent with a sudden two-fisted attack and Quarry lost a majority decision. After a layoff of six months, Quarry returned after the Ellis loss to post another streak of wins. Notable among these was a lopsided 12-round decision win over 1964 U.S. Olympian Buster Mathis. The win over the ranked (and much bigger) Mathis positioned Quarry for his second title shot.

==== Frazier and Chuvalo ====
Joe Frazier had not yet KO&#x27;d Ellis, but was considered by many to be the most legitimate heavyweight champion. Quarry met Frazier June, 23rd, 1969 at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, where Quarry could count on fan support. Back in Quarry&#x27;s home state of California, &quot;The San Bernardino County Sun&quot; proclaimed him the latest &quot;Great White Hope&quot;.

Frazier&#x27;s high-tempo pressure came to dominate the fight. In the 7th round, Quarry was bleeding from his nose and had a very large cut under his eye when he took a series of hard punches without moving away or hitting back. The fight was stopped with a Frazier TKO. Ring Magazine named it the fight of the year.

Returning quickly after the loss to Frazier, Quarry won two bouts before meeting Canadian George Chuvalo in December 1969. The bout against Chuvalo, then unranked, would be the subject of controversy. Quarry was well ahead, when in the seventh round, Chuvalo knocked Quarry down. Quarry rose at the count of four, then took a knee but on rising exactly at the count of ten, he found referee Zach Clayton ruled a KO.

===In 1970s===
Quarry returned quickly after the controversial loss to Chuvalo to post another streak of wins.
Noteworthy among them was a 6th-round KO win over fellow Californian Mac Foster. Foster came into the bout ranked #1 with a record of 24–0, with all 24 wins by KO. Quarry was ranked #6, and weighed 195 for the bout. Foster weighed 215. It was a very impressive, dominating win by Quarry which figured to put him back in line for another title shot.

At this time, exiled former champion Muhammad Ali had successfully sued to win the right to return as a professional boxer. Ali approached every one of the ten ranked heavyweights for a match. Quarry was the only one willing to face him, and so got the nod for the first bout against Ali in his return. The bout received tremendous publicity and arguably remains today as Quarry&#x27;s most famous bout.

The bout took place at the City Auditorium in Atlanta, Georgia on October 26, 1970. Ali dominated the first two rounds, moving well and scoring with his left jab and combinations. Quarry was able to land only a handful of punches, most of them glancing blows. In the third round, Quarry was badly cut by a right hand over his left eye following an exchange with Ali. Trainer Teddy Bentham, a veteran cutman, realized the cut was too severe for Quarry to continue, even though he argued to continue. Referee Tony Perez waved the bout over before the start of the 4th round, which was ruled a 3rd round technical KO. Quarry disputed the decision and demanded a rematch against Ali, which he would later receive.

Following the loss to Ali, Quarry had his second six-month layoff. He focused on television roles during this period, appearing on a number of television shows. In June 1971, he returned to start another streak of wins. Noteworthy among them was a revenge of his earlier draw against tall Tony Doyle at the Playboy Club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with a lopsided decision. He then KO&#x27;d British and European champion Jack Bodell in the first round. That fight was held in London. His second fight there during this streak was against Larry Middleton. Middleton was the kind of tall, quick boxer with long reach who often gave Quarry trouble in bouts. Quarry won a very narrow, controversial decision against Middleton.

By then, Quarry had lobbied long and hard for a rematch against Ali. He finally was allowed that rematch a month after the Middleton bout. The second bout against Ali took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center on June 27, 1972. Their match was the headlining bout of a fight card that Ali called &quot;The Soul Brothers Versus The Quarry Brothers.&quot; Bob Arum promoted the fight, with Ali playing up the obvious racial differences between his black fighters and the white Quarrys. In an earlier bout, Jerry&#x27;s brother Mike, a high-ranked light heavyweight contender was KO&#x27;d by Light heavyweight champion and devastating puncher Bob Foster, and seriously injured.

Ali weighed 216 for their bout, Quarry 198. The bout was eventful. At the opening bell, Quarry rushed Ali, got under his shoulders and lifted him briefly off the canvas before referee Mike Kaplan separated the fighters. Ali dominated most of the fight, using his jab. Visibly tired at the end of the 6th round, Quarry came out for the seventh and was hit by a half-dozen shots by Ali, who waved the referee in to stop the fight, which Quarry protested. Nevertheless, the fight was stopped in favor of Ali.

==== Bouncing Back ====
After Ali, Quarry, now managed by Gil Clancy, bounced back to post another streak of wins. He seemed to mature as a fighter here, and 1973 was perhaps his greatest year as a heavyweight.

Despite deterioration in his movement and reflexes, and now having very scarred facial tissue, Quarry gave possibly the two best performances of his career next. After defeating Randy Neumann (21–2) in January, Quarry was placed into a bout similar to his previous Mac Foster match, as a ranked tune-up for a higher ranked contender. Ron Lyle was 19–0 with 17 knockouts, and the tough ex-convict was in line for a title shot when he met Quarry in February. The 6&#x27;3&quot; Lyle weighed 219 for the bout, Quarry 200. Despite trailing early on, Quarry took control of the fight in the middle rounds and thoroughly outboxed Lyle for a lopsided 12-round decision win in an action packed fight.

During this time, Quarry got a chance to show off his athletic ability. On the ABC television show &quot;The Superstars&quot;, he competed against other heavyweight boxers in a series of athletic contests. Winning that competition, he qualified for the Superstars final that year, and finished fourth to three NFL football players, an impressive showing. Noteworthy in those performances was his ability to hit a baseball.
Two wins later, Don King brought Quarry in to meet hard-punching Earnie Shavers in December. Shavers was 46–2 with 44 KOs. In another bout filled with the same racial overtones as the second Ali bout, Quarry surprised Shavers. After receiving a few hard shots, he landed a big punch in the 1st round and followed that up to win a stunning first-round KO win. King reportedly left Shavers in the ring and tore up his contract to manage him. Heavyweight champion George Foreman was in attendance, and negotiations for a title bout were already in motion for mid-1974. After the Shavers bout, Foreman reportedly backed away from that proposed bout. He later claimed to have dodged Quarry, whom he never formally met in the ring. 
Quarry later claimed to be &#x27;locked out&#x27; of big-opportunity fights in 1974 by King, and found himself desperately looking for quality opponents that might get him a title shot. In June 1974, he agreed to rematch Joe Frazier. Quarry was the same size as at their first bout, but Frazier, now 212 pounds, was bigger. Quarry attempted to box Frazier this time, but due to the years of punishment, even in the recent wins against hard hitters Lyle and Shavers, he was more open to Frazier&#x27;s shots and less mobile than he used to be. 
Straight away, a determined Frazier began to connect hard punches at the physically diminished Quarry who couldn&#x27;t muster the movement to evade Frazier. Staggering him with a trademark left hook at the end of the first round, Frazier then began landing solidly with both hands to Quarry&#x27;s head and body, beginning a sickening beat down. Quarry was already on wobbly legs when Frazier dropped with a hard left hook to the stomach just before the bell ending the 4th round. Quarry was visibly injured by the blow, but tried unsuccessfully to continue. The fight continued, with Frazier backing away from Quarry after opening up bad cuts over both eyes. Joe Louis, however, waved Frazier back on. After landing a few more clean head shots, Louis finally stopped the fight early in the 5th round, a one-sided thrashing. Louis never refereed another fight.
Quarry could still attract crowds. He had made millions in the ring without ever being champion at a time when few had ever made that much money in boxing. He continued his television acting work, and had by now briefly helped road-manage the rock band Three Dog Night.

After a win in February 1975, Quarry begged to be put in line for a fight with contender Ken Norton. When first choices Oscar Bonavena and Jimmy Young bowed out with injuries, Quarry was placed into the Norton bout on 18 days notice. Norton had been training for five months.
The Norton fight was Quarry&#x27;s 62nd pro fight. Norton, who was about the same age as Quarry, was 32–3. The 6&#x27;3&quot; Norton weighed 218 for the bout, Quarry 207 with little training beforehand. Clancy was once again in Quarry&#x27;s corner. The fight took place March 24, 1975. The fight was a war of hard punches, with Norton connecting well early against Quarry with shot reflexes, a sitting duck for Norton&#x27;s attacks. He was cut badly in the 3rd round, and attacked Norton so he would have a chance to win before the fight was stopped. Norton survived a tough Quarry attack and continued his assault. The fight was stopped in the 5th round after Quarry came under a barrage of clean shots to the head.

==Retirement==

Quarry retired for over two and a half years after the Norton fight. His career record was at 50–8–4 at this time, with 32 wins by KO. He had two losses each to Frazier and Ali plus one apiece to Norton, Chuvalo, Ellis and Eddie Machen to this point. He had been ranked as high as the No. 1 contender three times. At around this time, Quarry signed a contract with the ABC to be a boxing commentator.

In mid-1977, a return match was being put together which would put Quarry in against a ranked heavyweight. The ranked heavyweight would be Italian Lorenzo Zanon. The match was to be televised on ABC, where Quarry was contracted. But both fighters signed to have the bout televised on CBS. When Quarry, who often negotiated his own fight contracts, signed the bout to CBS, he lost his ABC contract.

The comeback match took place in November 1977, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Quarry, weighing 209, looked slow and a shell of his former self, was clearly outboxed over seven rounds by Zanon. But Quarry caught him with a hard right in the 8th round, and won the fight by KO in the 9th. 
Despite winning, it was a poor performance, and Quarry retired again afterward, this time for almost six years.

During those years, Quarry was married and divorced twice. He also lost a great deal of his fortune in failed business investments. No longer doing television work, he decided to return to the ring. With the Cruiserweight division now created, Quarry returned in that weight class. When he returned in August 1983, he was 38 years old.

Quarry was already beginning to show the effects of his lengthy boxing career. A &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reporter was researching an article about health problems among retired boxers, especially among those who started as child boxers. The reporter met Quarry, and although he appeared to be in good health, Quarry&#x27;s performance on several simple cognitive tests was shockingly poor.

He suffered from dementia pugilistica, atrophy of the brain from repeated blows to the head. A 1983 CT scan of Quarry&#x27;s brain done for the article showed evidence of brain atrophy, including the characteristic cavum septi pellucidi found in many boxers with long careers.

Despite these developing facts, Quarry had two wins in 1983, but the fights accelerated his mental decline. He retired again and was inactive as a boxer from 1984 to 1992, but Quarry continued to decline physically and mentally. His entire boxing fortune completely gone by 1990, Quarry filed for Social Security at age 45. 
Denied a boxing license in many states because of his condition, Quarry found a loophole in Colorado which allowed him to schedule an October 30, 1992, bout with Ron Cramner, a cruiserweight 16 years Quarry&#x27;s junior. At age 47 years and 6 months old, Quarry provided nothing more than a 6-round punching bag for the younger fighter, losing all six rounds and the decision.

==Last years==
Within a few years of his final bout Quarry was unable to feed or dress himself and had to be cared for around the clock by relatives, mainly his brother James, who was the only one of the four brothers not to box professionally.

Jerry&#x27;s brother, Mike, who had contended for the light-heavyweight championship, was himself beginning to show signs of dementia pugilistica in his later years, and died as a result on June 11, 2006. Another brother, Bobby, was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Jerry Quarry was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Death==

Quarry was hospitalized with pneumonia on December 28, 1998, and then suffered cardiac arrest. He never regained consciousness and died on January 3, 1999, at the age of 53. His body was interred at Shafter Cemetery in Shafter, California.

==Legacy==
A foundation was established in his honor to battle boxing-related dementia, a condition that has afflicted many boxers and brought Quarry&#x27;s life to an early end.

Quarry&#x27;s overall professional record was 53–9–4 with 32 KOs. Frazier, in his autobiography, said of Quarry: &quot;A very tough man. He could have been a world champion, but he cut too easily.&quot; Foreman similarly lauded Quarry.

<text>&#x27; or &#x27; is Latin for &quot;common law&quot; in certain jurisdictions. It is often used by civil law jurists to refer to those aspects of the civil law system&#x27;s invariant legal principles, sometimes called &quot;the law of the land&quot; in English law. While the was a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all. ( is distinct from the term &quot;common law&quot; meaning the Anglo-American family of law as opposed to the civil law family.) The phrase &quot;the common law of the civil law systems&quot; means those underlying laws that create a distinct legal system and are common to all its elements.

==Etymology==
The &quot;&quot;, in its historical meaning, is commonly thought of as a combination of canon law and Roman law which formed the basis of a common system of legal thought in Western Europe from the rediscovery and reception of Justinian&#x27;s Digest in the 12th and 13th centuries. In addition to this definition, the term also possibly had a narrower meaning depending upon the context in which it was used. Some scholars believe that the term, when used in the context of the ecclesiastical courts of England in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, also &quot;meant the law that is common to the universal church, as opposed to the constitutions or special customs or privileges of any provincial church.&quot;

==Contents and history==
The &quot;&quot; had a double basis: the Ancient Roman laws, as collected in Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;, and the canon law of the Catholic Church, as initially collected in the 12th century in the &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot;. While Justinian&#x27;s collection remained unchanged throughout the medieval epoch, the canon law continued to be expanded and revised by various popes, reaching its final form, the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;, in the 16th century. That &quot;there were two highest laws, the canon and the civil&quot; (Roman) law, remained a source of tension throughout the period in which the was influential.

While Justinian&#x27;s laws themselves did not change, their understanding and interpretation developed throughout this period. From the 13th century on, the gloss of Accursius became especially relevant. Extended commentaries on Gratian&#x27;s &quot;Decretum&quot;, known as summae, were similarly influential in regard to the interpretation of the canon law. The summa of Hostiensis became especially famous for &quot;its concision, its completeness, and its &#x27;golden&#x27; eloquence&quot;, which earned it the honorary name &quot;Summa aurea&quot; (Golden Summa).

The &#x27; was an actual part of the law in most areas, although in any one jurisdiction local laws (statutes and customs) could take precedence over the &#x27;. This was the case up until the codification movement in the late 18th and 19th centuries, which explicitly removed the direct applicability of Roman and canon law in most countries, although there continued to be argument about whether the &quot; was banished completely or survived where the national codes were silent.

The latter view prevailed, so it can still be said that there is, in theory at least, a common basis in substantive law throughout Western Europe (except England, which never had a reception as such) although it has of course fragmented greatly from its heyday in the 15th and 16th centuries. More important, however, is the civilian tradition of ways of thinking that the &quot; encouraged and the procedures it used, which have been more persistent than the actual substance.

==Influence in common law legal systems==

In England, the law developed its own tradition separate from most of continental Europe based on its own common law. Scotland has a mixed civil and common law system. Scotland had a reception of Roman law and partial codification through the works of the Institutional Writers, such as Viscount Stair and Baron Hume, among others. Influence from England has meant that today Scotland&#x27;s current system is considered more common law than &quot;civilian&quot;, but besides terminological questions there are areas which are still heavily based on medieval Roman law, such as Scots property law.

<text>A Gantt chart is a bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. It was designed and popularized by Henry Gantt around the years 1910–1915. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency relationships between activities and the current schedule status.

== Definition ==
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity. Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements constitute the work breakdown structure of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical &quot;TODAY&quot; line.

Gantt charts are sometimes equated with bar charts.

Gantt charts are usually created initially using an &quot;early start time approach&quot;, where each task is scheduled to start immediately when its prerequisites are complete. This method maximizes the float time available for all tasks.

== History ==
Widely used in project planning in the present day, Gantt charts were considered revolutionary when introduced. The first known tool of this type was developed in 1896 by Karol Adamiecki, who called it a &quot;harmonogram&quot;. Adamiecki, however, published his chart only in Russian and Polish which limited both its adoption and recognition of his authorship.

In 1912, published what could be considered Gantt charts while discussing a construction project. Charts of the type published by Schürch appear to have been in common use in Germany at the time; however, the prior development leading to Schürch&#x27;s work is unclear. Unlike later Gantt charts, Schürch&#x27;s charts did not display interdependencies, leaving them to be inferred by the reader. These were also static representations of a planned schedule.

The chart is named after Henry Gantt (1861–1919), who designed his chart around the years 1910–1915. Gantt originally created his tool for systematic, routine operations. He designed this visualization tool to more easily measure productivity levels of employees and gauge which employees were under- or over-performing. Gantt also frequently included graphics and other visual indicators in his charts to track performance. 

One of the first major applications of Gantt charts was by the United States during World War I, at the instigation of General William Crozier.

The earliest Gantt charts were drawn on paper and therefore had to be redrawn entirely in order to adjust to schedule changes. For many years, project managers used pieces of paper or blocks for Gantt chart bars so they could be adjusted as needed. Gantt&#x27;s collaborator Walter Polakov introduced Gantt charts to the Soviet Union in 1929 when he was working for the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy. They were used in developing the First Five Year Plan, supplying Russian translations to explain their use.

In the 1980s, personal computers allowed widespread creation of complex and elaborate Gantt charts. The first desktop applications were intended mainly for project managers and project schedulers. With the advent of the Internet and increased collaboration over networks at the end of the 1990s, Gantt charts became a common feature of web-based applications, including collaborative groupware. By 2012, almost all Gantt charts were made by software which can easily adjust to schedule changes.

In 1999, Gantt charts were identified as &quot;one of the most widely used management tools for project scheduling and control&quot;.

== Example ==

In the following tables there are seven tasks, labeled &quot;a&quot; through &quot;g&quot;. Some tasks can be done concurrently (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;) while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (&quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; cannot begin until &quot;a&quot; is complete). Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (&quot;O&quot;), the most likely or normal time estimate (&quot;M&quot;), and the pessimistic time estimate (&quot;P&quot;). The expected time (&quot;TE&quot;) is estimated using the beta probability distribution for the time estimates, using the formula (&quot;O&quot; + 4&quot;M&quot; + &quot;P&quot;) ÷ 6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a Gantt chart or a network diagram.

== Progress Gantt charts ==
In a progress Gantt chart, tasks are shaded in proportion to the degree of their completion: a task that is 60% complete would be 60% shaded, starting from the left. A vertical line is drawn at the time index when the progress Gantt chart is created, and this line can then be compared with shaded tasks. If everything is on schedule, all task portions left of the line will be shaded, and all task portions right of the line will not be shaded. This provides a visual representation of how the project and its tasks are ahead or behind schedule.

== Linked Gantt charts ==
Linked Gantt charts contain lines indicating the dependencies between tasks. However, linked Gantt charts quickly become cluttered in all but the simplest cases. Critical path network diagrams are superior to visually communicate the relationships between tasks. Nevertheless, Gantt charts are often preferred over network diagrams because Gantt charts are easily interpreted without training, whereas critical path diagrams require training to interpret. Gantt chart software typically provides mechanisms to link task dependencies, although this data may or may not be visually represented. Gantt charts and network diagrams are often used for the same project, both being generated from the same data by a software application.

<text>ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are three-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest. They allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the two-letter alpha-2 codes (the third set of codes is numeric and hence offers no visual association). They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.

==Uses and applications==
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are used most prominently in ISO/IEC 7501-1 for machine-readable passports, as standardized by the International Civil Aviation Organization, with a number of additional codes for special passports; some of these codes are currently reserved and not used at the present stage in ISO 3166-1.

The United Nations uses a combination of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, along with codes that pre-date the creation of ISO 3166, for international vehicle registration codes, which are codes used to identify the issuing country of a vehicle registration plate; some of these codes are currently indeterminately reserved in ISO 3166-1.

===User-assigned code elements===
User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-3 codes can be user-assigned: to , to , to , and to .

==== Examples ====
The following codes are used in ISO/IEC 7501-1 for special machine-readable passports:

* is used for the European Union laissez-passer
* is used to represent the Sovereign Military Order of Malta
* , a single character, is used for Germany.
* is used for Interpol travel documents
* is used to represent a stateless person, as defined in Article 1 of the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons
* is used to represent a refugee, as defined in Article 1 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol
* is used to represent a refugee, other than as defined above
* is used to represent a person of unspecified nationality

NATO STANAG 1059 INT is built upon ISO alpha-3 codes, but also defines alpha-2 codes incompatible with ISO 3166-1. It introduces several private use codes for fictional countries and organizational entities:

NATO also continues to use reserved codes for continents:
 is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 equivalent user-assigned code element for Kosovo in the European Union, and is used in the Unicode standard.
===Reserved code elements===
Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time.

The reserved alpha-3 codes are divided into the following three categories: exceptional reservations, transitional reservations, and indeterminate reservations.

====Exceptional reservations====
Exceptionally reserved code elements are codes reserved at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and international organizations, which are required in order to support a particular application, as specified by the requesting body and limited to such use; any further use of such code elements is subject to approval by the ISO 3166/MA. The following alpha-3 codes are currently exceptionally reserved:

* Ascension Island Reserved on request of Universal Postal Union (UPU), also used by International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
* Clipperton Island Reserved on request of ITU
* Sark Reserved on request of the United Kingdom
* Diego Garcia Reserved on request of ITU
* France, Metropolitan Reserved on request of France; Officially assigned before being deleted from ISO 3166-1
* USSR From June 2008; Transitionally reserved from September 1992; Officially assigned before being deleted from ISO 3166-1
* Tristan da Cunha Reserved on request of UPU

The following alpha-3 codes were previously exceptionally reserved, but are now officially assigned:

* Guernsey Reserved on request of UPU
* Isle of Man Reserved on request of UPU
* Jersey Reserved on request of UPU

====Transitional reservations====
Transitional reserved code elements are codes reserved after their deletion from ISO 3166-1. These codes may be used only during a transitional period of at least five years while new code elements that may have replaced them are taken into use. These codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA after the expiration of the transitional period. The following alpha-3 codes are currently transitionally reserved:

* Netherlands Antilles From December 2010
* Burma From December 1989
* Byelorussian SSR From June 1992
* Czechoslovakia From June 1993
* Neutral Zone From July 1993
* Romania From February 2002; Code changed to 
* Serbia and Montenegro From September 2006
* East Timor From May 2002
* Yugoslavia From July 2003
* Zaire From July 1997

====Indeterminate reservations====
Indeterminately reserved code elements are reserved for use in a particular way, usually due to their presence in other coding systems. For example, several codes are reserved because they are used for international intellectual property organizations in WIPO Standard ST.3.

The following codes used to designate road vehicles are indeterminately reserved under the 1949 and 1968 United Nations Conventions on Road Traffic:

* Aden
* Barbados (current code )
* Brunei (current code )
* Canada (current code )
* Kenya (current code )
* Tanganyika [Part of Tanzania, United Republic of]
* Uganda (current code )
* Zanzibar [Part of Tanzania, United Republic of]
* Alderney
* Guernsey (current code )
* Jersey (current code )
* Isle of Man (current code )
* Gibraltar (current code )
* Guatemala (current code )
* Jordan (current code )
* Malaysia (current code )
* Central African Republic (current code )
* Congo, People&#x27;s Republic of (current code )
* Chile (current code )
* Mali (current code )
* Zambia (current code )
* Korea, Republic of (current code )
* San Marino (current code )
* Southern Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]
* Slovenia (current code )
* Suriname (current code )
* Turkmenistan (current code )
* Gambia (current code )
* Sierra Leone (current code )
* Nigeria (current code )
* Zaire (current code )

The following alpha-3 code was previously indeterminately reserved, but has been reassigned to another country as its official code:

* Uruguay (current code ) Code reassigned to Romania

The following are used in ISO/IEC 7501-1 for special machine-readable passports:

* identifies a British Passport holder who is a British Overseas Territories citizen
* identifies a British Passport holder who is a British National (Overseas)
* identifies a British Passport holder who is a British Overseas citizen
* identifies a British Passport holder who is a British protected person
* identifies a British Passport holder who is a British subject
* is used as a substitute for nationality where the holder is an Official of a Specialized Agency of the UN Organization
* identifies Kosovo residents to whom travel documents were issued by the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK)
* is used to designate the UN Organization as the issuer and used as a substitute for nationality where the holder is an Official of the UN Organization

<doc id="223170" wikidata="Q57302" url="?curid=223170" title="Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg">
<text>Adolphe (Adolf Wilhelm August Karl Friedrich; 24 July 1817 – 17 November 1905) was Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 23 November 1890 to his death on 17 November 1905. The first grand duke from the House of Nassau-Weilburg, he succeeded King William III of the Netherlands, ending the personal union between the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Adolphe was Duke of Nassau from 20 August 1839 to 20 September 1866, when the Duchy was annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia.

Adolphe became Duke of Nassau in August 1839, following the death of his father William. The Duchy was annexed to Prussia after Austria&#x27;s defeat in the Austro-Prussian War. From 1815 to 1839, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was ruled by the kings of the Netherlands as a province of the Netherlands. Following the Treaty of London (1839), the Grand Duchy became independent but remained in personal union with the Netherlands. Following the death of his sons, the Dutch king William III had no male heirs to succeed him. In the Netherlands, females were allowed to succeed to the throne. Luxembourg, however, followed Salic law which barred females from succession. Thus, upon King William III&#x27;s death, the crown of the Netherlands passed to his only daughter, Wilhelmina, while that of Luxembourg passed to Adolphe in accordance with the Nassau Family Pact. Adolphe died in 1905 and was succeeded by his son, William IV.

==Biography==
He was a son of William, Duke of Nassau (1792–1839), and his first wife, Princess Louise of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Adolphe&#x27;s half-sister, Sophia of Nassau, was the wife of Oscar II of Sweden.

===Duke of Nassau===

Adolphe became Duke of Nassau in August 1839 at the age of 22, after the death of his father. Wiesbaden had by this time become the capital of the Duchy, and Adolphe took up residence in the newly constructed Stadtschloss in 1841. On 4 March 1848 he consented to the population of Nassau&#x27;s nine &quot;Demands of the Nassauers&quot;. A few years later, however, he revoked his liberal views and took a strongly conservative and reactionary course. In general, though, he was seen as a popular ruler. He supported the Austrian Empire in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. After Austria&#x27;s defeat, Nassau was annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia and he lost his throne on 20 September 1866.

===Grand Duke of Luxembourg===
In 1879, Adolphe&#x27;s niece Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, the daughter of another of his half-sisters, married William III, King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg. In 1890, upon William&#x27;s death without surviving male issue, their only daughter Wilhelmina succeeded to the Dutch throne, but was excluded from the succession to Luxembourg by Salic law. The Grand Duchy, which had been linked to the Netherlands in personal union since 1815, passed to Adolphe in accordance with the Nassau Family Pact. Adolphe was King-Grand Duke William III&#x27;s 17th cousin once removed through a male-only line, but was also his 3rd cousin as they both descended from William IV, Prince of Orange (he being the paternal great-grandson of William IV&#x27;s eldest daughter Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau). He had, in fact, taken over the regency of Luxembourg for a short time during William III&#x27;s illness.

Adolphe was already 73 years old by this time and knew little of Luxembourgish politics. He mostly abstained from day-to-day governing; Prime Minister Paul Eyschen, in office since 1888, took care of the affairs of state. This established a convention that the monarch would remain absent from the politics of the day, despite being vested with considerable reserve powers on paper. In 1902 Adolphe appointed his son William as Lieutenant-Representative. He died in 1905 at his summer home, Schloss Hohenburg in Lenggries, and in 1953 was buried in the crypt of the church of Schloss Weilburg.

===Personal life===
On 31 January 1844, Adolphe married firstly in St. Petersburg Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mikhailovna of Russia, niece of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. She died less than a year afterwards giving birth to a stillborn daughter. Adolphe built the Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Elizabeth 1847 to 1855 as her funeral church.

On 23 April 1851, he remarried in Princess Adelheid-Marie of Anhalt-Dessau. They had five children, of whom only two lived to the age of eighteen and became prince and princess of Luxembourg:

* William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (1852–1912)
* Prince Friedrich Paul Wilhelm of Nassau (Biebrich, 23 September 1854 – Biebrich, 23 October 1855)
* Princess Marie Bathildis Wilhelmine Charlotte of Nassau (Biebrich, 14 November 1857 – Biebrich, 28 December 1857)
* Prince Franz Joseph Wilhelm of Nassau (Biebrich, 30 January 1859 – Vienna, 2 April 1875)
* Princess Hilda Charlotte Wilhelmine (1864–1952), married Friedrich II, Grand Duke of Baden.

In 1892, Grand Duke Adolphe conferred the personal title of Prince Bernadotte in the nobility of Luxembourg as well as the hereditary title of Count of Wisborg on his Swedish nephew, Oscar, who had lost his Swedish titles after marrying without his father&#x27;s approval. Wisborg (also spelled Visborg) is the ruins of an old castle in the city of Visby within Oscar&#x27;s former Dukedom of Gotland, but the title itself was created in the nobility of Luxembourg.

==Adelsverein==
On April 20, 1842, the Adelsverein, &quot;Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas&quot;, was organised in the Grand Duke&#x27;s castle at Biebrich on the Rhine. He was named the Protector of the organisation. The Verein was responsible for the large emigration of Germans to Texas in the 19th century, and on January 9, 1843, established the 4,428 acre Nassau Plantation in Fayette County, Texas and named it after the Grand Duke.

<text>The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a &quot;software tools&quot; movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software; these norms became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself, and have been termed the &quot;Unix philosophy.&quot;

The Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, compact, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.

== Origin ==
The Unix philosophy is documented by Doug McIlroy in the Bell System Technical Journal from 1978:

# Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new &quot;features&quot;.
# Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don&#x27;t clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don&#x27;t insist on interactive input.
# Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don&#x27;t hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
# Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you&#x27;ve finished using them.

It was later summarized by Peter H. Salus in A Quarter-Century of Unix (1994):
* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

In their Unix paper of 1974, Ritchie and Thompson quote the following design considerations:

* Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
* Interactive use instead of batch processing.
* Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints (&quot;salvation through suffering&quot;).
* Self-supporting system: all Unix software is maintained under Unix.

== Parts ==
=== &quot;The UNIX Programming Environment&quot; ===

In their preface to the 1984 book, &quot;The UNIX Programming Environment&quot;, Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike, both from Bell Labs, give a brief description of the Unix design and the Unix philosophy:

The authors further write that their goal for this book is &quot;to communicate the UNIX programming philosophy.&quot;

=== &quot;Program Design in the UNIX Environment&quot; ===
In October 1984, Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike published a paper called &quot;Program Design in the UNIX Environment&quot;. In this paper, they criticize the accretion of program options and features found in some newer Unix systems such as 4.2BSD and System V, and explain the Unix philosophy of software tools, each performing one general function:

The authors contrast Unix tools such as with larger program suites used by other systems.

=== Doug McIlroy on Unix programming ===
McIlroy, then head of the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and inventor of the Unix pipe, summarized the Unix philosophy as follows:

Beyond these statements, he has also emphasized simplicity and minimalism in Unix programming:

Conversely, McIlroy has criticized modern Linux as having software bloat, remarking that, &quot;adoring admirers have fed Linux goodies to a disheartening state of obesity.&quot; He contrasts this with the earlier approach taken at Bell Labs when developing and revising Research Unix:

=== Do One Thing and Do It Well ===

As stated by McIlroy, and generally accepted throughout the Unix community, Unix programs have always been expected to follow the concept of DOTADIW, or &quot;Do One Thing And Do It Well.&quot; There are limited sources for the acronym DOTADIW on the Internet, but it is discussed at length during the development and packaging of new operating systems, especially in the Linux community.

Patrick Volkerding, the project lead of Slackware Linux, invoked this design principle in a criticism of the systemd architecture, stating that, &quot;attempting to control services, sockets, devices, mounts, etc., all within one daemon flies in the face of the Unix concept of doing one thing and doing it well.&quot;

=== Eric Raymond&#x27;s 17 Unix Rules ===
In his book &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot; that was first published in 2003, Eric S. Raymond (open source advocate and programmer) summarizes the Unix philosophy as KISS Principle of &quot;Keep it Simple, Stupid.&quot; He provides a series of design rules:

* Build modular programs
* Write readable programs
* Use composition
* Separate mechanisms from policy
* Write simple programs
* Write small programs
* Write transparent programs
* Write robust programs
* Make data complicated when required, not the program
* Build on potential users&#x27; expected knowledge
* Avoid unnecessary output
* Write programs which fail in a way that is easy to diagnose
* Value developer time over machine time
* Write abstract programs that generate code instead of writing code by hand
* Prototype software before polishing it
* Write flexible and open programs
* Make the program and protocols extensible.

=== Mike Gancarz: The UNIX Philosophy ===
In 1994, Mike Gancarz, a member of Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Unix Engineering Group (UEG), published &quot;The UNIX Philosophy&quot; based on his own Unix (Ultrix) port development at DEC in the 1980s and discussions with colleagues. He is also a member of the X Window System development team and author of Ultrix Window Manager (uwm). 

The book focuses on porting UNIX to different computers during the Unix wars of the 1980s and describes his philosophy that portability should be more important than the efficiency of using non-standard interfaces for hardware and graphics devices.

The nine basic &quot;tenets&quot; he claims to be important are

# Small is beautiful.
# Make each program do one thing well.
# Build a prototype as soon as possible.
# Choose portability over efficiency.
# Store data in flat text files.
# Use software leverage to your advantage.
# Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
# Avoid captive user interfaces.
# Make every program a filter.

=== &quot;Worse is better&quot; ===
Richard P. Gabriel suggests that a key advantage of Unix was that it embodied a design philosophy he termed &quot;worse is better&quot;, in which simplicity of both the interface and the implementation are more important than any other attributes of the system—including correctness, consistency, and completeness. Gabriel argues that this design style has key evolutionary advantages, though he questions the quality of some results.

For example, in the early days Unix used a monolithic kernel (which means that user processes carried out kernel system calls all on the user stack). If a signal was delivered to a process while it was blocked on a long-term I/O in the kernel, the handling of the situation was unclear. The signal handler could not be executed when the process was in kernel mode, with sensitive kernel data on the stack.

== Criticism ==

In a 1981 article entitled &quot;The truth about Unix: &quot;The user interface is horrid&quot;&quot; published in &quot;Datamation&quot;, Don Norman criticized the design philosophy of Unix for its lack of concern for the user interface. Writing from his background in cognitive science and from the perspective of the then-current philosophy of cognitive engineering, he focused on how end-users comprehend and form a personal cognitive model of systems—or, in the case of Unix, fail to understand, with the result that disastrous mistakes (such as losing an hour&#x27;s worth of work) are all too easy.

In the podcast On the Metal, game developer Jonathan Blow criticised UNIX philosophy as being outdated. He argued that tying together modular tools results in very inefficient programs. He says that UNIX philosophy suffers from similar problems to microservices: without overall supervision, big architectures end up ineffective and inefficient.

<doc id="223178" wikidata="Q1978842" url="?curid=223178" title="Kwik-E-Mart">
<text>The Kwik-E-Mart (spelled &quot;Quick-E-Mart&quot; in &quot;Bart the General&quot;) is a convenience store in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It is a parody depicting many of the stereotypes of American convenience stores such as 7-Eleven, Circle K, and all the lesser known convenience stores which are the cornerstone, or rather the Corner Store, of the American Experience.

It is notorious for its high prices and the poor quality of its merchandise. It is run by an Indian-American named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. It first appeared in the 1990 episode &quot;The Telltale Head&quot; and has since become a common setting in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The Simpsons family are regular customers.

In July 2007, eleven 7-Eleven locations in the United States and one in Canada were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts as part of a special promotion for &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. Also in 2007, gift shops modeled after the &quot;Kwik-E-Marts&quot; were opened in Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood, where they are a companion to &quot;The Simpsons Ride&quot;.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the Kwik-E-Mart is a convenience store that sells the usual fare at extraordinarily high prices, including the always popular Squishee. The backstory is that the Kwik-E-Mart chain was started somewhere in the North Pole. The Springfield Kwik-E-Mart is operated by an Indian American character named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, who runs the store with his brother Sanjay and is a caricature of the stereotypical &quot;foreign born&quot; convenience store clerk. Apu proudly gouges customers and sells tainted merchandise, such as rotten meat, expired milk, or tins with the label missing. The Kwik-E-Mart rarely closes; at one point Apu shuts the store for five minutes to attend a party and inadvertently locks Hans Moleman inside. The Kwik-E-Mart is quite often the target of robbers, leading to Apu having been shot on several occasions and as a result having almost missed work. On one occasion, Marge Simpson mentioned that because of the frequency of shootings, it is only a $100 fine. In the fifth season episode &quot;Homer and Apu&quot;, Apu loses his job at the Kwik-E-Mart and the two characters visit the corporate CEO (voiced by Harry Shearer) in the Indian Himalayan mountains.

==Real-world versions==
===7-Eleven promotion===

In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted 11 of its stores in the United States and one in Canada (Coquitlam) into Kwik-E-Marts to promote &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. The concept was first visualized in 2006 by Fox&#x27;s advertising agency, and the approximately 10 million dollar (US) cost of the promotion was borne by 7-Eleven. Another part of the promotion was a contest where customers who purchased a slurpee or sandwich also received a coded game piece that could be entered into a website. The grand prize of the contest was to be animated into an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Prior to July, the promotion had long been known but the locations were kept a secret until the morning of July 1, when the 12 stores were made over with industrial foam, vinyl and Kwik-E-Mart signs.

These 12 locations, as well as the majority of other North American 7-Elevens, sold products found in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, such as &quot;Buzz Cola&quot;, &quot;Krusty-O&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Squishees&quot;, pink frosted &quot;Sprinklicious doughnuts&quot; and other &quot;Simpsons&quot;-themed merchandise. The Squishees were Slurpees that are sold in special collector cups and the Krusty-O&#x27;s were made by Malt-O-Meal. Several other 7-Eleven items, such as sandwiches, were sold in &quot;Simpsons&quot;-themed packaging. It was decided that Duff Beer would not be sold due to the movie being rated PG-13, and the promoters wanted to have &quot;good, responsible fun,&quot; though it was noted that it was a tough decision. However, a Duff Energy Drink was released in place of the Duff Beer.

The promotion resulted in a 30% increase in profits for the changed 7-Eleven stores. Many of the stores sold out of their special &quot;Simpsons&quot; products within a few days of the start of the promotion. The conversions lasted through early August, when the stores were converted back to 7-Elevens.

There was a mild controversy when the promotion offended members of the Indian-American community who felt that Apu is a caricature that plays on too many negative stereotypes. Despite this, 7-Eleven reported that many of its Indian employees have reacted positively to the idea, although it was noted that it was &quot;not a 100 percent endorsement.&quot;

===Universal Studios===

On October 17, 2007, a gift shop that was modeled after a Kwik-E-Mart was opened at Universal Studios Florida. One also opened at Universal Studios Hollywood at a later time. They replaced the old &quot;Back to the Future&quot; gift shop and supplement The Simpsons Ride, which opened in Spring 2008. The stores sell &quot;Simpsons&quot;-related merchandise like Flaming Moe&#x27;s Energy Drinks and Squishees.

=== Broadway At The Beach ===
On August 17, 2018, a gift shop modeled after a Kwik-E-Mart opened at Broadway at the Beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The gift shop is placed at the exit of a 4D ride based on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and is housed in a replica of The Aztec theatre from the series, which opened in 2019. The store sells Buzz Cola, Lard Lad Donuts, and Squishees along with merchandise from the show.

While no official statement has been made to date, as of late April/early May, 2024, the store, as well as the attached 4-D theater have been permanently closed. The attractions no longer appear on the Broadway at the Beach website, and an online petition has been created to reopen the attractions. Google also lists the attraction as permanently closed, and there a couple Reddit posts indicating the closure as well.

<doc id="223179" wikidata="Q1140221" url="?curid=223179" title="ISO 3166-1 alpha-2">
<text>ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are two-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest. They are the most widely used of the country codes published by ISO (the others being alpha-3 and numeric), and are used most prominently for the Internet&#x27;s country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions). They are also used as country identifiers extending the postal code when appropriate within the international postal system for paper mail, and have replaced the previous one consisting one-letter codes. They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.

==Uses and applications==
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used in different environments and are also part of other standards. In some cases they are not perfectly implemented.

===Perfect implementations===
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used in the following standards:
===Imperfect implementations===
Starting in 1985, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes have been used in the Domain Name System as country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority currently assigns the ccTLDs mostly following the alpha-2 codes, but with a few exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom, whose alpha-2 code is , uses .uk instead of .gb as its ccTLD, as is currently exceptionally reserved in ISO 3166-1 on the request of the United Kingdom.

The WIPO coding standard ST.3 is based on ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, but includes a number of additional codes for international intellectual property organizations, which are currently reserved and not used at the present stage in ISO 3166-1.

The European Commission generally uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes with two exceptions: (not ) is used to represent Greece, and (not ) is used to represent the United Kingdom. This notwithstanding, the &quot;Official Journal of the European Communities&quot; specified that and be used to represent Greece and United Kingdom respectively. For VAT administration purposes, the European Commission uses and for Greece and the United Kingdom respectively.

The United Nations uses a combination of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, along with codes that pre-date the creation of ISO 3166, for international vehicle registration codes, which are codes used to identify the issuing country of a vehicle registration plate; some of these codes are currently indeterminately reserved in ISO 3166-1.

IETF language tags (conforming to the BCP 47 standard track and maintained in an IANA registry) are also partially derived from ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (for the region subtags). The full list of ISO 3166-1 codes assigned to countries and territories are usable as region subtags. Also, the &quot;exceptionally reserved&quot; alpha-2 codes defined in ISO 3166-1 (with the exception of ) are also usable as region subtags for language tags. However, newer stability policies (agreed with ISO) have been implemented to avoid deleting subtags that have been withdrawn in ISO 3166-1; instead they are kept and aliased to the new preferred subtags, or kept as subtags grouping several countries. Some other region grouping subtags are derived from other standards. Under the newer stability policies, old assigned codes that have been withdrawn from ISO 3166-1 should no longer be reassigned to another country or territory (as has occurred in the past for &quot;CS&quot;).

==Current codes==

===Decoding table===
The following is a colour-coded decoding table of all ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.

===Officially assigned code elements===

The following is a complete list of the 249 current officially assigned ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, with the following columns:

* Code: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, pointing to its ISO 3166-2 article
* Country name: English short name officially used by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA)
* Year: Year when alpha-2 code was first officially assigned (1974, first edition of ISO 3166)
* ccTLD: Corresponding country code top-level domain (some are unassigned or inactive); exceptions where another ccTLD is assigned for the country are shown in parentheses
* Notes: Any unofficial notes


===User-assigned code elements===

User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-2 codes can be user-assigned: , to , to , and . For example:
* The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) uses as a second country code for the United States, as it ran out of three-character registrant codes within the prefix. It also uses for some registrants assigned directly.
* The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) assigns to represent Outlying Oceania (a multi-territory region containing Antarctica, Bouvet Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, the British Indian Ocean Territory, the French Southern Territories, and the United States Minor Outlying Islands), and to represent &quot;Unknown or Invalid Territory&quot;. Before the adoption of the macroregion code by ISO, CLDR also used to represent the European Union.
* The code is being used by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) as an indicator for the Community Plant Variety Office.
* The code is being used by Switzerland as a country code for the Canary Islands, although is already reserved for that purpose.
* The codes and are being used by Russia to represent Abkhazia and South Ossetia respectively.
* The code is being used by the UK Government, as an EORI number country code prefix for Northern Ireland, and the members of European Union for European Union value added tax reports with trade with Northern Ireland.
* The code is being used by the European Commission, the IMF, the SWIFT, the CLDR, and other organizations as a temporary country code for Kosovo.
* The code is being used by WIPO as an indicator for the Nordic Patent Institute, an international organization common to Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.
* The code is being used by WIPO as an indicator for the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.
* The code is being used by WIPO as an indicator for the Visegrad Patent Institute.
* The code is being used by WIPO as an indicator for unknown states, other entities or organizations.
* UN/LOCODE assigns to represent installations in international waters.
Furthermore, the code element is designated as an escape code if the number of regular user-assigned code elements is not sufficient.

===Reserved code elements===
Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time.

The reserved alpha-2 codes are divided into the following three categories: exceptional reservations, transitional reservations, and indeterminate reservations.

====Exceptional reservations====
Exceptionally reserved code elements are codes reserved at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and international organizations, which are required in order to support a particular application, as specified by the requesting body and limited to such use; any further use of such code elements is subject to approval by the ISO 3166/MA. The following alpha-2 codes are currently exceptionally reserved:

The following alpha-2 codes were previously exceptionally reserved, but are now officially assigned:

====Transitional reservations====
Transitional reserved code elements are codes reserved after their deletion from ISO 3166-1. These codes may be used only during a transitional period of at least five years while new code elements that may have replaced them are taken into use. These codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA after the expiration of the transitional period. The following alpha-2 codes are currently transitionally reserved:

The following alpha-2 code was previously transitionally reserved, but was later reassigned to another country as its official code:

For each deleted alpha-2 code, an entry for the corresponding former country name is included in ISO 3166-3. Each entry is assigned a four-letter alphabetic code, where the first two letters are the deleted alpha-2 code.

====Indeterminate reservations====
Indeterminately reserved code elements are reserved for use in a particular way, usually due to their presence in other coding systems. For example, several codes are reserved because they are used for international intellectual property organizations in WIPO Standard ST.3. The following alpha-2 codes are currently indeterminately reserved:

The following alpha-2 codes were previously indeterminately reserved, but have been reassigned to another country as its official code:

; Notes
==Deleted codes==
Besides the codes currently transitionally reserved and two other codes currently exceptionally reserved ( for France, Metropolitan and for USSR), the following alpha-2 codes have also been deleted from ISO 3166-1:

For each deleted alpha-2 code, an entry for the corresponding former country name is included in ISO 3166-3. Each entry is assigned a four-letter alphabetic code, where the first two letters are the deleted alpha-2 code.

<doc id="223180" wikidata="Q7144536" url="?curid=223180" title="Patently unreasonable">
<text>In Canadian law, patently unreasonable or the &quot;patent unreasonableness test&quot; was a standard of review used by a court when performing judicial review of administrative decisions. It was the highest of three standards of review: correctness, unreasonableness, and patent unreasonableness. Although the term &quot;patent unreasonableness&quot; lacked a precise definition in the common law, it was somewhere above unreasonableness, and consequently it was relatively difficult to show that a decision was patently unreasonable. A simple example of a patently unreasonable decision may be one that does not accord at all with the facts or law before it, or one that completely misstates a legal test.

By a decision issued on March 7, 2008, this test was removed from the law by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Dunsmuir v New Brunswick as represented by Board of Management&quot; .

In &quot;Toronto (City) Board of Education v. O.S.S.T.F., District 15&quot;, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 487, at paras. 41–48, the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the test for whether a decision under review is patently unreasonable is articulated differently for findings of fact and findings of law. For interpreting a legislative provision, the test was whether the decision under review &quot;cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review&quot;. In the context of a decision interpreting a collective labour agreement, the patently-unreasonable test was held to mean that the court will not intervene unless the words of the collective agreement have been given an interpretation they cannot reasonably bear.

When the reviewing court reviews the evidence that was before the original decision maker, on a question where the standard of review is patent unreasonableness, the reviewing court must determine whether &quot;the evidence reasonably viewed is incapable of supporting the tribunal&#x27;s findings&quot; (para. 48).

In a recent decision &quot;The Owners, Strata Plan VR320 v Day, 2023 BCSC 364&quot; at paras. 70-71 the Supreme Court of British Columbia clarified:

&quot;To find the CRT’s interpretation patently unreasonable, there must be an immediately obvious defect – suggesting that there can only be one reasonable interpretation of the Second Resolution. This is not the case. Another reasonable interpretation could be that the special levy is due and payable on May 1, 2021, per the underlined phrase. It is also necessary to consider the context in which the Second Resolution was made. Even if the words were clear, a resolution cannot have an unlawful effect. It would be unlawful to allow for the Second Resolution to retroactively apply to Mr. Day – a former owner who did not have an opportunity to participate in discussions relating to the special levy purportedly established by the First Resolution – because such an interpretation contravenes the Ministerial Order.&quot;

&quot;Even if the court considers parts of the tribunal’s rationale to be flawed or unreasonable, so long as the decision as a whole is reasonable, no patent unreasonableness can be found.&quot;

<doc id="223183" wikidata="Q191370" url="?curid=223183" title="Zephyr (protocol)">
<text>Created at MIT as part of Project Athena, Zephyr was designed as an instant messaging protocol and application-suite with a heavy Unix background. Using the &quot;do one thing, do it well&quot; philosophy of Unix, it was made up of several separate programs working together to make a complete messaging system. Zephyr and IRC were the first widely used IP-based instant-messaging systems.

==Creation==
Zephyr is the invention of Ciarán Anthony DellaFera who was, at that time, an employee of Digital Equipment Corporation and a Visiting Research Scientist at Project Athena. The design originated as a solution to the &quot;reverse Remote Procedure Call (RPC)&quot; problem: how can service providers (servers in a client–server system) locate and communicate with service users. The initial concept emerged from conversations between Ciarán and Michael R. Gretzinger, another systems engineer at Project Athena, in early 1986. By mid to late 1986 Ciarán had distilled the problem to two specific issues: the ability to locate users in a distributed computing environment (known today as &quot;presence detection&quot;), and the ability to deliver scalable, light-weight, and authentic messages in a distributed computing environment. The Zephyr Development Team (Mark W. Eichin, Robert S. French, David C. Jedlinsky, John T. Kohl, William E. Sommerfeld) was responsible for the creation of the initial code-base and the subsequent releases that were issued throughout the late 1980s.

==Application==
Zephyr is still in use today at a few university environments such as Carnegie Mellon, Iowa State, University of Maryland, College Park, Brown University and MIT. It has been largely replaced by modern and more popular instant messenger systems such as XMPP. MIT currently operates both Zephyr and XMPP.

==Points of interest==
Zephyr uses UDP datagrams sent between ports 2102, 2103, and 2104. It is incompatible with most routers doing NAT because it reports the internal IP address and so returning datagrams are incorrectly routed. Most sites have deployed Zephyr using Kerberos 4 authentication exclusively, though in late 2007, some sites, including Iowa State, deployed Zephyr using Kerberos 5.

==Client support==
* BarnOwl has always had Zephyr protocol support.
* Pidgin supports the Zephyr protocol since version 0.11.0-pre10 (April 13, 2001).
* Adium added support for Zephyr in Version 0.70 (October 18, 2004), but dropped in version 1.4b6 (June 3, 2009).

<text>Parkour () is an athletic training discipline or sport in which practitioners (called &quot;traceurs&quot;) attempt to get from one point to another in the fastest and most efficient way possible, without assisting equipment and often while performing feats of acrobatics. With roots in military obstacle course training and martial arts, parkour includes flipping, running, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, and quadrupedal movement—whatever is suitable for a given situation. Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others, and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere. It involves seeing one&#x27;s environment in a new way, and envisioning the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.

Historically, flips and other acrobatic movements were not considered essential to the discipline of parkour, and the term freerunning was applied to parkour-like movement that emphasized artistry rather than efficiency. However, as the parkour culture evolved, its distinction from freerunning became increasingly blurred. Parkour athletes now broadly agree that flips are unambiguously part of parkour.

Parkour was established by David Belle in the 1980s, and it was initially called ; however the name &quot;le parcours&quot; had already been given to the activity by 1989. The discipline was popularised in the 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, video games, and advertisements. Similar techniques were known from French military obstacle courses, and some authors see influence from Hong Kong cinema and Asian martial arts in Parkour.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;parkour&quot; derives from (Obstacle course), the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by Georges Hébert. Raymond Belle used the term &quot;&quot; to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement. His son, David, further developed his father&#x27;s methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his &#x27;Speed Air Man&#x27; video to Hubert Koundé. Koundé suggested he change the &quot;c&quot; of &quot;&quot; to a &quot;k&quot; because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent &quot;s&quot; for the same reason, forming &quot;parkour&quot;.

According to Sebastien Foucan, the activity had already been given the name &quot;le parcours&quot; by the year 1989.

A practitioner of parkour is called a &quot;traceur&quot;, with the feminine form being &quot;traceuse&quot; or simply a &quot;Parkourist&quot;. They are nouns derived from the French verb &quot;tracer&quot;, which normally means &quot;to trace&quot;, as in &quot;tracing a path&quot;, in reference to drawing. The verb used familiarly means: &quot;to hurry up&quot;. The term &quot;traceur&quot; was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.

A &quot;jam&quot; refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including Sébastien Foucan and Stéphane Vigroux.

== History ==
===Origins===
The practice of similar techniques existed in French military obstacle courses and Hong Kong cinema. A similar discipline in Chinese culture is &quot;qinggong&quot;, a Chinese martial arts training technique, most famously practiced by Jackie Chan.

===Georges Hébert===

In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was developed by French naval officer Georges Hébert, who before World War I promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa. He noted, &quot;their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature.&quot; His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Saint-Pierre, Martinique reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism. Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of Reims in France. Hébert set up a &quot;méthode naturelle&quot; (&quot;natural method&quot;) session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence, and swimming. These were intended to develop &quot;the three main forces&quot;: energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty), and physical (muscles and breath). During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a &quot;parcours du combattant&quot;—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian fitness trails and confidence courses.

===John Ciampa===
Born in 1922, John Ciampa was acrobatic stuntman and entertainer known by the stage names of the Human Fly, the Flying Phantom and the Brooklyn Tarzan whose acrobatic buildering and freestyle tree climbing bear striking resemblance to late 20th Century parkour. Those feats were featured in two 1942 Paramount Pictures newsreels coincident with the release of the feature film Tarzan&#x27;s New York Adventure.

===Raymond and David Belle===
Born in 1939 in Vietnam, Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the First Indochina War, his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in Da Lat at the age of seven. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order never to be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military obstacle courses in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the Paris Fire Brigade, a French Army unit.
Raymond&#x27;s son, David Belle, was born in 1973. He experimented with gymnastics and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he learned of his father&#x27;s exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.

Through conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called &quot;parcours&quot;. He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.

===Yamakasi===

David initially trained on his own, and after moving to Lisses, found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together. The group eventually included David Belle, Sébastien Foucan, Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N&#x27;Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière. The group began calling themselves the &quot;Yamakasi&quot;, from the Lingala &quot;ya makási&quot;, meaning strong in one&#x27;s person, or &quot;strong man, strong spirit&quot; (see § Name and split below).

Some members of the group drew inspiration from Asian martial arts, notably the acrobatics of Jackie Chan such as &quot;qinggong&quot; displays in his Hong Kong action films, and the training philosophy of Bruce Lee, The group also was influenced by the martial arts films of Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme.

====Discipline====
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket to learn to endure the cold. For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training, no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.

Respecting one&#x27;s health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.

Humility was an important principle. No traceur was allowed to feel superior to someone else, for example, by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.

To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining. Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently—&quot;to create the means to be yourself&quot;—and there was a complete trust within the group. Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour. If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.

====Name and split====
In 1997, David Belle&#x27;s brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris. For the performance, the group named themselves &quot;Yamakasi&quot;, from the Congolese Lingala &quot;ya makási&quot;, meaning strong in one&#x27;s person, or &quot;strong man, strong spirit&quot;. Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: &quot;&quot;l&#x27;art du déplacement&quot; (French for &quot;the art of movement&quot;). The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name &quot;parkour&quot; to describe their activity (see § Etymology above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term &quot;l&#x27;art du déplacement&quot; (see § Derivative terminologies and disciplines below).

==Organizations==
International parkour organizations include the World Freerunning and Parkour Federation, established in 2007, who have worked with MTV to produce parkour-related shows.

== Philosophy ==

According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it &quot;to be alive&quot; and &quot;for people to use it&quot;. Châu Belle explains it is a &quot;type of freedom&quot; or &quot;kind of expression&quot;; that parkour is &quot;only a state of mind&quot; rather than a set of actions, and that it is about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers. Traceur Dylan Baker says, &quot;Parkour also influences one&#x27;s thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles&quot;. A study by &quot;Neuropsychiatrie de l&#x27;Enfance et de l&#x27;Adolescence&quot; (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.

Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.

A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of &quot;human reclamation&quot;. Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as &quot;a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it.&quot; Another traceur writes, &quot;It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements; it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life, as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour.&quot;

===Competition===
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour&#x27;s philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In the words of Erwan Le Corre, &quot;Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won&#x27;t hold its philosophical essence anymore.&quot; Red Bull&#x27;s sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, &quot;Sometimes people ask, &#x27;Who is the best at parkour?&#x27; and it is because they don&#x27;t understand what Parkour is; &#x27;Who is the best?&#x27; is what you would say about a sport, and parkour is not a sport—it is an art, it&#x27;s a discipline. That&#x27;s like saying, &#x27;What&#x27;s the best song in the world? This seems to be the consensus among many professional traceurs who view parkour as a lifestyle more than as a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.

There are competitions that use parkour as the main influence for formatting and judging criteria. Sport Parkour League&#x27;s &quot;North America Parkour Championships&quot; hosts a series of local and regional qualifier events which culminate in a final event in Vancouver, B.C. Red Bull&#x27;s Art of Motion event is the longest running and highest profile professional freerunning competition.

===David Belle===
In his 2009 book &quot;Parkour&quot;, David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner&#x27;s mentality and understanding of its principles. &quot;When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I&#x27;m interested in is what the guy&#x27;s got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can&#x27;t deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better.&quot; Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. &quot;When a young person asks me, &#x27;Can you show me how to do this?&#x27; I simply answer, ‘No, I am going to show you how &quot;I&quot; do it. Then, you&#x27;ll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else along the way.’&quot;

The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts. In an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, David Belle acknowledges the influence, &quot;There&#x27;s a quote by Bruce Lee that&#x27;s my motto: &#x27;There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.&#x27; If you&#x27;re not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what&#x27;s the point?&quot; In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. &quot;So many people try to train easy—&#x27;Come do parkour! It&#x27;s really cool!&#x27; But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That&#x27;s what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before.&quot; In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond, &quot;If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one.&quot;

Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, &quot;Precision is all about being measured,&quot; and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master. &quot;With parkour, I often say, &#x27;Once is never&#x27;. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It&#x27;s an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times.&quot; To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.

== Practice ==
=== Movement ===
While there is no official list of &quot;moves&quot; in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others, and there are a number of named movements that are characteristic, for example:
* &quot;Parkour roll&quot;: Rolling to absorb impacts from larger drops, moving diagonally over a shoulder to convert momentum from vertical to horizontal.
* &quot;Precision jump&quot;: Jumping and landing accurately with the feet on small or narrow obstacles.
* &quot;Arm jump&quot;: Jumping and landing feet-first on a vertical surface, catching the horizontal top with the hands.
* &quot;Wall run&quot;: Running toward a high wall and then jumping and pushing off the wall with a foot to reach the top of the wall.
* &quot;Climb up&quot;: Moving from a position hanging from a wall-top or ledge, to standing on the top or vaulting over to the other side.

Parkour is practiced without traditional equipment, though items such as bars, walls, and boxes found in the environment in which the parkour is being practiced in, are utilised to better navigate the area. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing. Traceurs who wear gloves are rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback. Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged because they allow for more natural and fluid movements. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps. Barefoot training is done by some for movement competency without gear—David Belle noted that &quot;bare feet are the best shoes.&quot; Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and freerunning. Many other companies around the world have started offering clothing targeted at parkour.

=== Risks ===
==== Trespassing ====
Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour&#x27;s values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom. Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures. Concerns have been raised regarding trespassing, damage of property, and use of inappropriate places such as cemeteries. Many parkour organizations around the globe support the &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; initiative, an urban version of the outdoor conservation ethic created by the Seattle nonprofit &quot;Parkour Visions&quot; in 2008, promoting safety, respect for the spaces used and their other users, and sometimes includes picking up rubbish to leave areas in better condition than they were found.

==== Injuries and deaths ====
Concerns have been raised by law enforcement and fire and rescue teams about the risks inherent in jumping off high buildings. They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners to stay off the rooftops. Some practitioners of parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.

Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, many parkour experts consider serious injury evidence of the traceur&#x27;s failure to follow the precepts of the discipline, specifically, knowing one&#x27;s limitations. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said, &quot;Thinking you&#x27;re going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you&#x27;re thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task.&quot; On biomechanical grounds, studies found parkour landing techniques result in lower landing forces in comparison with traditional sport techniques. In a survey of parkour-related emergency department visits in the United States between 2009 and 2015, most injuries were reportedly caused by landing or from striking objects.

American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare &quot;because participants rely not on what they can&#x27;t control—wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing—but their own hands and feet.&quot; Lanier Johnson, executive director of the American Sports Medicine Institute, said that many of the injuries are not reported.

== Impact ==
Initially featured in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One TV channel trailer &quot;Rush Hour&quot; in April 2002. It featured David Belle leaping across London&#x27;s rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme, and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used. This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.

The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is common in the parkour community. &quot;Jump London&quot; is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with Sébastien Foucan, Johann Vigroux, and Jérôme Ben Aoues demonstrating their parkour skills. &quot;Jump London&quot; changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs. It was followed by &quot;Jump Britain&quot; in 2005. Both Jump films were shown in more than 80 countries, thereby introducing the discipline and its philosophy to an unprecedented global audience. Both films have been cited by numerous practitioners as their motivation for taking up the discipline.

The Australian version of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.

Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, a feature which has proven particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation. For example, in 2010 &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community. In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.

=== Entertainment ===

Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as stunt performers. The first director to do so was Luc Besson, for the film &quot;Taxi 2&quot; in 1998, followed by &quot;Yamakasi&quot; in 2001 featuring members of the original Yamakasi group, and its sequel &quot;Les fils du vent&quot; in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote &quot;District 13&quot;, another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli, followed by the sequel &quot;District 13: Ultimatum&quot; in 2009 and remade in English as &quot;Brick Mansions&quot; in 2014.

In 2006, the James Bond film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; featured Sébastien Foucan in a chase taking place early in the movie, sparking renewed media interest in parkour. Along with &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; is credited with starting a new wave of Parkour-inspired stunts in Western film and television. Parkour was prominent in &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; (2007), again with stuntman/actor Cyril Raffaelli, and &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; (2010), choreographed by David Belle. Several films besides &quot;Yamakasi&quot; are about thieves who use parkour, such as &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot; (2006), &quot;Run&quot; (2013), and &quot;Tracers&quot; (2015). The 2011 film &quot;Freerunner&quot; is about eight freerunners racing through a city for survival. The 2019 Netflix film &quot;6 Underground&quot; featured several parkour scenes choreographed and performed by team Storror. Parkour also featured in &quot;Dhoom 3&quot; (2013), Bang Bang! (2014) and &quot;Aadhi&quot; (2018).

Parkour is also featured on TV. MTV&#x27;s show &quot;Ultimate Parkour Challenge&quot; premiered as a one-hour special in October 2009 starring the athletes of the World Freerunning &amp; Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode series of the same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.

Professional wrestler John Hennigan is a long-time practitioner of parkour and often incorporates it into his wrestling style, with the WWE giving him the nickname &quot;The Prince of Parkour&quot;. Actor Stephen Amell learned parkour at Tempest Academy in preparation for his role as Oliver Queen in the television series &quot;Arrow&quot;, and co-star Caity Lotz is also a practitioner.

Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. Since the series&#x27; inception, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series has included increasingly numerous parkour elements. The &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; series also makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game). The &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot; games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles. &quot;Brink&quot; introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first-person shooter. &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; and &quot;Dying Light&quot; include a central parkour mechanic, while &quot;Crackdown&quot; and &quot;Crackdown 2&quot; include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects. &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot; allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard. &quot;Tron Evolution&quot;″s basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.

=== Military training ===
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training, it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Marines trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of introducing some of their techniques to his own students. Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military and one San Diego staff sergeant trained US Marines in parkour.

=== Scientific research and applications ===
Studies have found that in exercises such as the standing long jump, depth jump, and vertical jump, parkour athletes outperform physical educators, gymnasts, and power athletes. Parkour training is especially linked with the development of eccentric load resistance and jumping ability.

A study into the mechanics of the standing long jump showed that experienced traceurs use a lower take off angle than beginners (~25.6° vs ~34°). Wakai and Linthorne had previously estimated the optimal angle to be close to 22.6°.

Studies and experiments have integrated parkour kinaesthetics into robotics.

== Derivative terminologies and disciplines ==
In September 2003, Mike Christie&#x27;s documentary &quot;Jump London&quot;, starring Sébastien Foucan, was released. In the documentary, the term &quot;freerunning&quot; was used as an attempt to translate &quot;parkour&quot;, in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience. Foucan decided to keep using the term &quot;freerunning&quot; to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle&#x27;s methods.

The remaining seven &quot;Yamakasi&quot; members continued to use the term &quot;&quot;l&#x27;art du déplacement&quot;, also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien&#x27;s freerunning, &quot;l&#x27;art du déplacement&quot; is less about the hard discipline of the original &quot;Yamakasi&quot; group; rather, it takes a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term &quot;parkour&quot;, saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation and had verbally communicated this method only to him.

Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression. Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.

<doc id="223202" wikidata="Q1066244" url="?curid=223202" title="Charles Thomson">
<text>Charles Thomson (November 29, 1729 – August 16, 1824) was an Irish-born Founding Father of the United States and secretary of the Continental Congress (1774–1789) throughout its existence. As secretary, Thomson prepared the Journals of the Continental Congress, and his and John Hancock&#x27;s names were the only two to appear on the first printing of the United States Declaration of Independence.
Thomson is also known for co-designing the Great Seal of the United States and adding its Latin mottoes &quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; and &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot;, and for his translation of the Bible&#x27;s Old Testament.

==Early life==
Thomson was born in Maghera, County Londonderry, Ireland, to Scots-Irish migrants, Mr. and Mrs. John Thomson.

After the death of his wife in 1739, John Thomson migrated to the British colonies in North America with his sons (three or four brothers, including Charles). John Thomson died at sea, his possessions stolen, and the penniless boys were separated on arrival at New Castle, Delaware. Charles was first cared for by a blacksmith in New Castle and was educated in New London, Pennsylvania. In 1750 he became a tutor in Latin at the Philadelphia Academy, an ancestor school of the University of Pennsylvania.

==Political career==

During the French and Indian War, Thomson was an opponent of the Pennsylvania proprietors&#x27; American Indian policies. He served as secretary at the 1758 Treaty of Easton and wrote &quot;An Enquiry into the Causes of the Alienation of the Delaware and Shawanese Indians from the British Interest&quot; (1759), which blamed the war on the proprietors. The Delaware Indians adopted him into their tribe calling him, &#x27;The-man-who-speaks-the-truth&#x27;. He was allied with Benjamin Franklin, the leader of the anti-proprietary party, but the two men parted politically during the crisis over the Stamp Act 1765. Thomson became a leader of Philadelphia&#x27;s Sons of Liberty. He was inducted into the American Philosophical Society around 1750.

Thomson was a leader in the revolution of the early 1770s. John Adams called him the &quot;Samuel Adams of Philadelphia&quot;. Thomson served as the secretary of the Continental Congress in its entirety. Through those 15 years, the Congress saw many delegates come and go, but Thomson&#x27;s dedication to recording the debates and decisions provided continuity. Along with John Hancock, the president of the Congress, Thomson&#x27;s name (as secretary) appeared on the first published version of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776.

Thomson&#x27;s role as secretary to Congress was not limited to clerical duties. According to biographer Boyd Schlenther, Thomson &quot;took a direct role in the conduct of foreign affairs.&quot; Fred S. Rolater has suggested that Thomson was essentially the &quot;Prime Minister of the United States.&quot;

Thomson is also noted for designing, with William Barton, the Great Seal of the United States, which played a prominent role in the ratification of the Treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784 (Ratification Day). Britain&#x27;s representatives in Paris initially disputed the placement of the Great Seal and Congressional President Thomas Mifflin&#x27;s signature until they were mollified by Benjamin Franklin. When designing the final version of the Great Seal, Thomson (a former Latin teacher) kept the pyramid and eye for the reverse side but replaced the two mottos, using &quot;Annuit Cœptis&quot; instead of &quot;Deo Favente&quot; (and &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; instead of &quot;Perennis&quot;). When he provided his official explanation of the meaning of this motto, he wrote:

Thomson&#x27;s service was not without its critics. James Searle, a delegate and close friend of John Adams, began a cane fight on the floor of Congress against Thomson over a claim that he was misquoted in the minutes that resulted in both men being slashed in the face. Such brawls on the floor were common, and many of them were prompted by argument over Thomson&#x27;s recordings. Political disagreements prevented Thomson from getting a position in the new government created by the U.S. Constitution.

As Secretary of the Continental Congress, Thomson was also the keeper of the Great Seal of the United States, and he retained the Great Seal in his custody during the transition from the Confederation to the new United States Federal Government under the Constitution. As Secretary of Congress, Thomson understood it to be his duty to attend the meetings of the first U.S. Congress in 1789 pending the appointment of clerks and secretaries by both Houses, and he accordingly staffed the sessions of the United States Senate during the first few months of its existence, still signing papers under the title of Secretary of the Congress. Thomson aspired to be confirmed as Secretary of the newly constituted U.S. Congress or to be appointed Secretary of the Senate, but, having failed to gain that appointment — Samuel Allyne Otis was instead appointed Secretary of the Senate on April 8, 1789 — Thomson relinquished his commission and handed over the Great Seal of the United States and his official papers to the United States Department of Foreign Affairs (the precursor of the United States Department of State) on July 23, 1789.

==George Washington&#x27;s inauguration==
In April, 1789, Thomson was sent by the Senate to the home of George Washington in Virginia to notify him that he had been elected president of the United States. Thomson then accompanied Washington to New York for his inauguration.

==Writings==

As secretary of Congress, Thomson chose what to include in the official journals of the Continental Congress. He also prepared a work of over 1,000 pages that covered the political history of the American Revolution. After leaving office, he chose to destroy the work in an effort to preserve the myths of War of Independence leaders as heroes and stated his desire to avoid &quot;contradict[ing] all the histories of the great events of the Revolution. Let the world admire the supposed wisdom and valor of our great men. Perhaps they may adopt the qualities that have been ascribed to them, and thus good may be done. I shall not undeceive future generations.&quot;

According to the publisher&#x27;s note of the Historical Printing Society edition of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1894), edited by John Leicester Ford, Thomson contributed a 25-page appendix to the original English publication, published by John Stockdale of London in a run of approximately 200 copies. In 1853 JW Randolph and Company republished the work and incorporated various materials from the estate provided by Jefferson&#x27;s literary executor, Thomas Jefferson Randolph. The new publication corrected some errors in the original Stockdale publication, including an error in the original publication which Jefferson made note of in a 1785 missive to Thomson: &quot;Pray ask the favor of Colo Monroe in page 5, line 17, to strike out the words &#x27;above the mouth of the Appomattox,&#x27; which makes none sense of the passage...&quot;. The Historical Printing Society publication removes Thomson&#x27;s notes from the appendix and instead offers them in footnote form throughout the work, according to the original plates to which they refer.

==Personal life==
Thomson married Ruth Mather in 1758. She and their twin infant daughters all died in 1769. On September 1, 1774, he married Hannah Harrison (1728-1807), daughter of Richard Harrison, the owner of Harriton Plantation in what is now Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

Thomson spent his final years at Harriton House, working on a translation of the Septuagint version of the Bible. His was the first English translation of the Septuagint published. The printer was Jane Aitken of Philadelphia. Thomson also published a synopsis of the Four Evangelists in 1815.

In retirement, he pursued his interests in agricultural science and beekeeping. Thomson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.

According to Thomas Jefferson, writing to John Adams in 1822, Thomson became senile in his old age and was unable to recognize members of his own household. &quot;Is this life?&quot; Jefferson asked. &quot;It is at most but the life of a cabbage; surely not worth a wish.&quot;

Thomson died on August 16, 1824. He was initially interred beside his wife in the Harrison Family Cemetery at Harriton. In 1838, a relative had the couple re-interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Portrayals==
Thomson was portrayed by Ralston Hill in both the 1969 Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot; and its 1972 film version.

Thomson is depicted on the 1975 seven-cent postal card (and postal reply card), Scott Nos. UX68 and UY 25.

<text>James Farrell Marrs Jr. (December 5, 1943 – August 2, 2017) was an American newspaper journalist and &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling author of books and articles on a wide range of alleged cover-ups and conspiracies. Marrs was a prominent figure in the JFK assassination conspiracy theories community and his 1989 book &quot;Crossfire&quot; was a source for Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot;. He subsequently wrote books asserting the existence of government conspiracies regarding aliens, 9/11, telepathy, and secret societies. He began his career as a news reporter in the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metroplex and taught a class on the assassination of John F. Kennedy at University of Texas at Arlington for 30 years. Marrs was a member of the Scholars for 9/11 Truth.

== Early life and education ==
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Marrs earned a B.A. in journalism from the University of North Texas in 1966 and completed graduate work at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas from 1967 to 1968.

==Career==
Beginning in college, he worked as a reporter, cartoonist, and photographer for several Texas newspapers, including the &quot;Denton Record-Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot;, and &quot;Lubbock Sentinel&quot;. In 1968, he took a position with the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, where he served as police reporter and general assignment reporter covering stories locally, in Europe, and in the Middle East. From 1969 to 1970, he concurrently served in a stateside United States Army Reserve intelligence unit (under the aegis of the Fourth United States Army) as a translator of French and German periodicals; when the Army offered to remedy a longstanding shoulder ailment prior to his scheduled mobilization or release him from his service obligation, he accepted the latter option. He later became the newspaper&#x27;s military and aerospace writer and an investigative reporter. After leaving the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; to take a position with Jerre R. Todd and Associates (a public relations firm in Arlington, Texas) in 1972, he returned to the newspaper in 1974 before leaving again in 1980.

For the remainder of his career, Marrs was a freelance writer, author, and public relations professional based in exurban Springtown, Texas. From 1983 to 1984, he published a weekly newspaper (the &quot;Springtown Current&quot;) in his hometown along with a monthly tourism tabloid (&quot;Cowtown Trails&quot;). Previously, he produced a cable television show (&quot;Texas Roundup&quot;) from 1982 to 1983. He also served as communications director for the First Bank and Trust of Springtown from 1985 to 1995.

Marrs appeared on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, C-SPAN, The Discovery Channel, TLC, The History Channel, &quot;Alex Jones Show&quot;, &quot;This Morning America&quot;, &quot;Geraldo&quot;, &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;TechTV&quot;, &quot;Larry King&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; (with George Noory and Art Bell) radio programs, as well as numerous national and regional radio and TV shows.

==Opinions==

===Assassination of JFK===
In 1989, Marrs&#x27;s book, &quot;Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy&quot;, was published and reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Paperback Non-Fiction Best Seller list in mid-February 1992. It became a basis for the Oliver Stone film &quot;JFK&quot;, released in 1991.

According to Stephen E. Ambrose in an essay generally critical of conspiracy theorists, Marrs wrote in &quot;Crossfire&quot; that motives for the murder of Kennedy were &quot;Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s attack on organized crime (Mafia motive); President Kennedy&#x27;s failure to support the Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs Invasion (Cuban and C.I.A. motive); the 1963 Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (military–industrial complex, or M.I.C. motive); Kennedy&#x27;s plan to withdraw from Vietnam before the end of 1965 (Joint Chiefs of Staff and M.I.C. motive); Kennedy&#x27;s talk about taking away the oil-depletion allowance (Texas oil men motive); Kennedy&#x27;s monetary policies (international bankers motive); Kennedy&#x27;s decision to drop Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson from the ticket in 1964 (L.B.J. motive) and Kennedy&#x27;s active civil rights policy (Texas racist billionaires motive).&quot;

Sylvia Meagher is a critic of the Warren Commission and author of &quot;Master Index to the JFK Assassination&quot; and &quot;Accessories After the Fact&quot;. In April 1987, Meagher received the manuscript of Marrs&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire.&quot; She was asked to evaluate the book by Simon &amp; Schuster, which was considering publishing it. Meagher concluded, &quot;The accuracy of the manuscript in dealing with a vast body of complex evidence is nearly impeccable ... the manuscript is, in my opinion, a fine and admirable work.&quot; Despite this glowing recommendation, Simon &amp; Schuster became one of about 25 major U.S. publishers to turn down the book. It was finally published in 1989 by Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers.

Beginning in 1976, Marrs taught continuing education classes on the Kennedy assassination as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Arlington. He added a UFO course in 2000 before retiring from teaching in 2007.

===UFOs and other topics===
From 1992 to 1995, Marrs researched and completed a non-fiction book on a top-secret government program called the Stargate Project involving the psychic phenomenon known as remote viewing, only to have the program canceled as the book was going to press in the summer of 1995.

In May 1997, Marrs&#x27;s investigation of UFOs, &quot;Alien Agenda&quot;, was published by HarperCollins Publishers. The paperback edition was released in mid-1998. It has been translated into several foreign languages and has become the top-selling UFO book in the world. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said:

Marrs shows little discrimination, overemphasizing dubious phenomena like remote viewing and crop circles, and giving nearly equal weight to ludicrous pretenders like Billy Meier (who claimed close encounter with Pleiadians) and sophisticated commentators like Jacques Vallée. Marrs even devotes a chapter to theories that the moon may be a UFO, and he refuses to rule out obvious frauds like the alien autopsy tapes. But if rigorous analysis escapes Marrs, little else does; this is the most entertaining and complete overview of flying saucers and their crew in years.

In early 2000, HarperCollins published &quot;Rule by Secrecy&quot;, which claimed to trace a hidden history connecting modern secret societies to ancient and medieval times. This book also reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. In 2003, his book &quot;The War on Freedom&quot; probed the alleged conspiracies of the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It was released in 2006 under the title &quot;The Terror Conspiracy&quot;.

Marrs was a featured speaker at a number of national conferences including the annual International UFO Congress and the annual Gulf Breeze UFO Conference, but he also spoke at local conferences, such as Conspiracy Con and The Bay Area UFO Expo.

==Last years==
In October 2011, Marrs started his own radio program, &quot;The View from Marrs&quot;, on the Jeff Rense Radio network. The program aired on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3 p.m. Central time. Marrs had on his show a wide variety of guests and dedicated the entire month of November to the latest information regarding the JFK assassination. He also explored UFO research, survivalism, and other topics.

With a friend, Michael H. Price, Marrs wrote and illustrated a comic book (&quot;Oswald&#x27;s Confession &amp; Other Tales from the War&quot;) that was published by Cremo Studios, Inc., in 2012. In February 2013, Marrs&#x27;s &quot;Our Occulted History: Do the Global Elite Conceal Ancient Aliens?&quot; was published by HarperCollins. Marrs usually also held a book signing at Brave New Books in Austin, Texas at least once a year.

==Private life, illness, and death==
Marrs&#x27;s avocations included American Civil War reenactment, collecting Civil War memorabilia and researching the history of World War II. However, according to his wife, Carol, who met him on a blind date while they were students at the University of North Texas, &quot;[H]e was almost a pacifist. He didn&#x27;t believe we should be in a war unless you were defending your home.&quot;

In March 2017, an announcement was made on Marrs&#x27; official Facebook page about an unspecified illness that caused him to cancel appearances at two upcoming events, the 5th annual Out of this World UFO Conference in Edinburg, Texas, and the Free Your Mind Conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, both in April.

In June 2017, additional announcements were made about health issues Marrs was experiencing, including being on kidney dialysis at home, and problems with his remaining good eye.

Marrs died on August 2, 2017, from a heart attack at age 73.

<doc id="223204" wikidata="Q161829" url="?curid=223204" title="Emperor penguin">
<text>The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching in length and weighing from . Feathers of the head and back are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches.

Like all species of penguin, the emperor is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. While hunting, the species can remain submerged around 20 minutes, diving to a depth of . It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.

The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, emperor penguins trek over the ice to breeding colonies which can contain up to several thousand individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated for just over two months by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan of an emperor penguin is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live as long as 50 years of age.

==Taxonomy==
Emperor penguins were described in 1844 by English zoologist George Robert Gray, who created the generic name from Ancient Greek word elements, ἀ-πτηνο-δύτης [a-ptēno-dytēs], &quot;without-wings-diver&quot;. Its specific name is in honour of the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster, who accompanied Captain James Cook on his second voyage and officially named five other penguin species. Forster may have been the first person to see emperor penguins in 1773–74, when he recorded a sighting of what he believed was the similar king penguin (&quot;A. patagonicus&quot;) but given the location, may very well have been the emperor penguin (&quot;A. forsteri&quot;).

Together with the king penguin, the emperor penguin is one of two extant species in the genus &quot;Aptenodytes&quot;. Fossil evidence of a third species—Ridgen&#x27;s penguin (&quot;A. ridgeni&quot;)—has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus &quot;Aptenodytes&quot; is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago.

==Description==
Adult emperor penguins are in length, averaging according to Stonehouse (1975). Due to the method of bird measurement that measures length between bill to tail, sometimes body length and standing height are confused, and some reported height even reaching tall. There are still more than a few papers mentioning that they reach a standing height of instead of body length. Although standing height of emperor penguin is rarely provided at scientific reports, Prévost (1961) recorded 86 wild individuals and measured maximum height of . Friedman (1945) recorded measurements from 22 wild individuals and resulted height ranging . Ksepka &quot;et al&quot;. (2012) measured standing height of according to 11 complete skins collected in American Museum of Natural History. The weight ranges from and varies by sex, with males weighing more than females. It is the fifth heaviest living bird species, after only the larger varieties of ratite. The weight also varies by season, as both male and female penguins lose substantial mass while raising hatchlings and incubating their egg. Male emperor penguins must withstand the extreme Antarctic winter cold for more than two months while protecting their eggs; eating nothing during this time, male emperors will lose around while waiting for their eggs to hatch. The mean weight of males at the start of the breeding season is and that of females is . After the breeding season this drops to for both sexes.

Like all penguin species, emperor penguins have streamlined bodies to minimize drag while swimming, and wings that are more like stiff, flat flippers. The tongue is equipped with rear-facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught. Males and females are similar in size and colouration. The adult has deep black dorsal feathers, covering the head, chin, throat, back, dorsal part of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper mandible of the long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be pink, orange or lilac. In juveniles, the auricular patches, chin and throat are white, while its bill is black. Emperor penguin chicks are typically covered with silver-grey down and have black heads and white masks. A chick with all-white plumage was seen in 2001, but was not considered to be an albino as it did not have pink eyes. Chicks weigh around after hatching, and fledge when they reach about 50% of adult weight.

The emperor penguin&#x27;s dark plumage fades to brown from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species compared with other birds, taking only around 34 days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown to a third of their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth.

The average yearly survival rate of an adult emperor penguin has been measured at 95.1%, with an average life expectancy of 19.9 years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach an age of 50 years. In contrast, only 19% of chicks survive their first year of life. Therefore, 80% of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five years and older.

===Vocalisation===
As the species has no fixed nesting sites that individuals can use to locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal sounds alone for identification. They use a complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition between mates, parents and offspring, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguin species. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.

===Adaptations to cold===
The emperor penguin breeds in the coldest environment of any bird species; air temperatures may reach , and wind speeds may reach . Water temperature is a frigid , which is much lower than the emperor penguin&#x27;s average body temperature of . The species has adapted in several ways to counteract heat loss. Dense feathers provide 80–90% of its insulation and it has a layer of sub-dermal fat which may be up to thick before breeding. While the density of contour feathers is approximately 9 per square centimetre (58 per square inch), a combination of dense afterfeathers and down feathers (plumules) likely play a critical role for insulation. Muscles allow the feathers to be held erect on land, reducing heat loss by trapping a layer of air next to the skin. Conversely, the plumage is flattened in water, thus waterproofing the skin and the downy underlayer. Preening is vital in facilitating insulation and in keeping the plumage oily and water-repellent.

The emperor penguin is able to thermoregulate (maintain its core body temperature) without altering its metabolism, over a wide range of temperatures. Known as the thermoneutral range, this extends from . Below this temperature range, its metabolic rate increases significantly, although an individual can maintain its core temperature from down to . Movement by swimming, walking, and shivering are three mechanisms for increasing metabolism; a fourth process involves an increase in the breakdown of fats by enzymes, which is induced by the hormone glucagon. At temperatures above , an emperor penguin may become agitated as its body temperature and metabolic rate rise to increase heat loss. Raising its wings and exposing the undersides increases the exposure of its body surface to the air by 16%, facilitating further heat loss.

===Adaptations to pressure and low oxygen===

In addition to the cold, the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure of up to 40 times that of the surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma. The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.

While diving, the emperor penguin&#x27;s oxygen use is markedly reduced, as its heart rate is reduced to as low as 15–20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.

==Distribution and habitat==
The emperor penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66° and 77° south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to offshore. Breeding colonies are usually in areas where ice cliffs and icebergs provide some protection from the wind. Three land colonies have been reported: one (now disappeared) on a shingle spit at the Dion Islands on the Antarctic Peninsula, one on a headland at Taylor Glacier in Victoria Land, and most recently one at Amundsen Bay. Since 2009, a number of colonies have been reported on shelf ice rather than sea ice, in some cases moving to the shelf in years when sea ice forms late.

The northernmost breeding population is on Snow Hill Island, near the northern tip of the Peninsula. Individual vagrants have been seen on Heard Island, South Georgia, and occasionally in New Zealand. The furthest north a vagrant has been recorded was in Denmark, Western Australia in November 2024. This individual, which is believed to have originated from eastern Antarctica, was encountered by a group of surfers shortly after it arrived in Denmark, and was taken in by conservationists at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions to have its condition evaluated.

In 2009, the total population of emperor penguins was estimated to be at around 595,000 adult birds, in 46 known colonies spread around the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic; around 35% of the known population lives north of the Antarctic Circle. Major breeding colonies were located at Cape Washington, Coulman Island in Victoria Land, Halley Bay, Cape Colbeck, and Dibble Glacier. Colonies are known to fluctuate over time, often breaking into &quot;suburbs&quot; which move apart from the parent group, and some have been known to disappear entirely. The Cape Crozier colony on the Ross Sea shrank drastically between the first visits by the &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition in 1902–03 and the later visits by the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition in 1910–11; it was reduced to a few hundred birds, and may have come close to extinction due to changes in the position of the ice shelf. By the 1960s it had rebounded dramatically, but by 2009 was again reduced to a small population of around 300.

===Conservation status===
In 2012, the emperor penguin was downgraded from a species of least concern to near threatened by the IUCN. Along with nine other species of penguin, it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US Endangered Species Act. The primary causes for an increased risk of species endangerment are declining food availability, due to the effects of climate change and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations. Other reasons for the species&#x27;s placement on the Endangered Species Act&#x27;s list include disease, habitat destruction, and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans. Of particular concern is the impact of tourism. One study concluded that emperor penguin chicks in a crèche become more apprehensive following a helicopter approach to .

Population declines of 50% in the Terre Adélie region have been observed due to an increased death rate among adult birds, especially males, during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice coverage. On the other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased; chick deaths also increased; the species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive to climatic changes. In 2009, the Dion Islands colony, which had been extensively studied since 1948, was reported to have completely disappeared at some point over the previous decade, the fate of the birds unknown. This was the first confirmed loss of an entire colony. Beginning in September 2015, a strong El Niño, strong winds, and record low amounts of sea ice resulted in &quot;almost total breeding failure&quot; with the deaths of thousands of emperor chicks for three consecutive years within the Halley Bay colony, the second largest emperor penguin colony in the world. Researchers have attributed this loss to immigration of breeding penguins to the Dawson-Lambton colony south, in which a tenfold population increase was observed between 2016 and 2018. However, this increase is nowhere near the total number of breeding adults formerly at the Halley Bay colony.

In January 2009, a study from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution concluded that global climate change could push the emperor penguin to the brink of extinction by the year 2100. The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony&#x27;s population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.

Another study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2014 again concluded that emperor penguins are at risk from global warming, which is melting the sea ice. This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 colonies of emperor penguins will be declining in numbers, mostly due to loss of habitat. Loss of ice reduces the supply of krill, which is a primary food for emperor penguins.

In December 2022, a new colony at Verleger Point in West Antarctica was discovered by satellite imaging, bringing the total known colonies to 66.

In 2023, another study found that more than 90% of emperor penguin colonies could face &quot;quasi-extinction&quot; from &quot;catastrophic breeding failure&quot; due to the loss of sea ice caused by climate change.

==Behaviour==

The emperor penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing. Individuals may be active day or night. A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the breeding colony and ocean foraging areas; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March.

The American physiologist Gerry Kooyman revolutionised the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to emperor penguins. He found that the species reaches depths of , with dive periods of up to 18 minutes. Later research revealed a small female had dived to a depth of near McMurdo Sound. It is possible that emperor penguins can dive for even deeper and longer periods, as the accuracy of the recording devices is diminished at greater depths. Further study of one bird&#x27;s diving behaviour revealed regular dives to in water around deep, and shallow dives of less than , interspersed with deep dives of more than in depths of . This was suggestive of feeding near or at the sea bottom. In 1994, a penguin from Auster rookery reached a depth of ; the entire dive took him 21.8 min.

Both male and female emperor penguins forage for food up to from colonies while collecting food to feed chicks, covering per individual per trip. A male returning to the sea after incubation heads directly out to areas of permanent open water, known as polynyas, around from the colony.

An efficient swimmer, the emperor penguin exerts pressure with both its upward and downward strokes while swimming. The upward stroke works against buoyancy and helps maintain depth. Its average swimming speed is . On land, the emperor penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganing—sliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless. The emperor penguin is a very powerful bird. In one case, a crew of six men, trying to capture a single male penguin for a zoo collection, were repeatedly tossed around and knocked over before all of the men had to collectively tackle the bird, which weighs about half as much as a man.

As a defence against the cold, a colony of emperor penguins forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) ranging in size from ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe in the center of the colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.

===Predators===
The emperor penguin&#x27;s predators include birds and aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (&quot;Macronectes giganteus&quot;) are the predominant land predator of chicks, responsible for over one-third of chick deaths in some colonies; they also scavenge dead penguins. The south polar skua (&quot;Stercorarius maccormicki&quot;) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are usually too large to be attacked by the time of its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may attempt to defend its chick from attack, although it may be more passive if the chick is weak or sickly.

The only known predators known to attack healthy adults, and which attack emperor penguins in the ocean, are both mammals. The first is the leopard seal (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;), which takes adult birds and fledglings soon after they enter the water. Orcas (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), mostly take adult birds at sea, although they will attack penguins of any age in or near water.

===Courtship and breeding===
Although Emperor penguins can breed at around three years of age, they generally do not begin breeding for another one to three years. The yearly reproductive cycle begins at the start of the Antarctic winter, in March and April, when all mature emperor penguins travel to colonial nesting areas, often walking inland from the edge of the pack ice. The start of travel appears to be triggered by decreasing day lengths; emperor penguins in captivity have been induced successfully into breeding by using artificial lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic day lengths. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) used satellite imagery to find new Emperor penguin breeding sites in Antarctica, a discovery that increased the estimated population of the Emperor penguins by 5 to 10 percent to around 278,000 breeding pairs. Given their remote locations and harsh weather conditions, penguin populations are found by scanning aerial imagery and locating enormous pages of ice that have been stained with their guano. The new discoveries increased the number of known breeding sites from 50 to 61.
The penguins start courtship in March or April, when the temperature can be as low as . A lone male gives an ecstatic display, where it stands still and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1–2 seconds; it then moves around the colony and repeats the call. A male and female then stand face to face, with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it; they both hold this posture for several minutes. Once in pairs, couples waddle around the colony together, with the female usually following the male. Before copulation, one bird bows deeply to its mate, its bill pointed close to the ground, and its mate then does the same.

Contrary to popular belief, Emperor penguins do not mate for life; they are serially monogamous, having only one mate each year, and remaining faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only around 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating appears to be an influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which usually precludes waiting for the previous year&#x27;s partner to arrive at the colony.
The female penguin lays one egg in May or early June; it is vaguely pear-shaped, pale greenish-white, and measures around . It represents just 2.3% of its mother&#x27;s body weight, making it one of the smallest eggs relative to the maternal weight in any bird species. 15.7% of the weight of an emperor penguin egg is shell; like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick, which helps minimize risk of breakage.

After laying, the mother&#x27;s food reserves are exhausted and she very carefully transfers the egg to the male, and then immediately returns to the sea for two months to feed. The transfer of the egg can be awkward and difficult, especially for first-time parents, and many couples drop or crack the egg in the process. When this happens, the chick inside is quickly lost, as the egg cannot withstand the sub-freezing temperatures on the icy ground for more than one to two minutes. When a couple loses an egg in this manner, their relationship is ended and both walk back to the sea. They will return to the colony next year to try mating again. After a successful transfer of the egg to the male penguin, the female departs for the sea and the male spends the dark, stormy winter incubating the egg against his brood patch, a patch of skin without feathers. There he balances it on the tops of his feet, engulfing it with loose skin and feathers for around 65-75 consecutive days until hatching. The emperor is the only penguin species where this behaviour is observed; in all other penguin species both parents take shifts incubating. By the time the egg hatches, the male will have fasted for around 120 days since arriving at the colony. To survive the cold and savage winds of up to , the males huddle together, taking turns in the middle of the huddle. They have also been observed with their backs to the wind to conserve body heat. In the four months of travel, courtship, and incubation, the male may lose as much as , from a total mass of .

Hatching may take as long as two or three days to complete, as the shell of the egg is thick. Newly hatched chicks are semi-altricial, covered with only a thin layer of down and entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. The chick usually hatches before the mother&#x27;s return, and the father feeds it a curd-like substance composed of 59% protein and 28% lipid, which is produced by a gland in his oesophagus. This ability to produce &quot;crop milk&quot; in birds is only found in pigeons, flamingos and male Emperor penguins. The father is able to produce this crop milk to temporarily sustain the chick for generally 3 to 7 days, until the mother returns from fishing at sea with food to properly feed the chick. If the mother penguin is delayed, the chick will die. Research indicates that between 10-20% of female Emperor penguins do not return to their colony from foraging at sea, most victims of the harsh winter weather conditions or being eaten by predators. The young chick is brooded in what is called the &quot;guard phase&quot;, spending time balanced on its parent&#x27;s feet and kept warm by the brood patch.
The female penguin returns at any time from hatching up to ten days afterwards, from mid-July to early August. She finds her mate among the hundreds of fathers by his vocal call and takes over caring for the chick, feeding it by regurgitating the partially digested fish, squid and krill that she has stored in her stomach. The male is often reluctant to surrender the chick he has been caring for all winter to its mother, but he soon leaves to take his turn at sea, spending 3 to 4 weeks feeding there before returning. The parents then take turns, one brooding while the other forages at sea. If either parent is delayed or fails to return to the colony, the lone parent will return to the sea to feed, leaving the chick to die. Abandoned eggs do not hatch and orphaned chicks never survive.
Female emperors who failed to find a mate to breed with, or have lost their own chick may attempt to adopt a stray chick or steal the chick of another female. The mother of the chick and neighboring females will fight to protect the chick or reclaim it, if it has been successfully stolen. These scuffles involving several birds often result in the chick being smothered or trampled to death. Chicks which have been adopted or stolen are quickly abandoned once again, as it is impossible for the female to feed and care for the chick alone. The orphaned chicks wander around the colony attempting to seek food and protection from other adults. They will even try to shelter themselves in an adult bird&#x27;s brood patch already occupied by their own chick. These stray chicks are brusquely driven away by the adults and their chicks. All orphaned chicks will rapidly become weaker and die of starvation, or freeze to death.

About 45–50 days after hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling together for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically to feed their chicks. A crèche may consist of around a dozen, up to several thousand chicks densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.

From early November, chicks begin moulting into juvenile plumage, which takes up to two months and is usually not completed by the time they leave the colony. Adults cease feeding them during this time. All birds make the considerably shorter trek to the sea in December and January. The birds spend the rest of the summer feeding there.

===Feeding===
The emperor penguin&#x27;s diet consists mainly of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish are usually the most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (&quot;Pleuragramma antarcticum&quot;) makes up the bulk of the bird&#x27;s diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (&quot;Psychroteuthis glacialis&quot;), and the hooked squid species &quot;Kondakovia longimana&quot;, as well as Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (&quot;Pagothenia borchgrevinki&quot;) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up to the bottom of the ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.

==Relationship with humans==

===In zoos and aquariums===
Since the 1930s, there have been several attempts at keeping emperor penguins in captivity. Malcolm Davis of the National Zoological Park made early attempts at keeping penguins, capturing several from Antarctica. He successfully transferred penguins to the National Zoological Park on March 5, 1940, where they lived for up to 6 years.

Until the 1960s, keeping attempts were largely unsuccessful, as knowledge of penguin keeping in general was limited and acquired by trial and error. The first to achieve a level of success was Aalborg Zoo where a chilled house was built especially for this Antarctic species. One individual lived for 20 years at the zoo and a chick was hatched there, but died shortly after.

Today, the species is kept at just a few zoos and public aquariums in North America and Asia. Emperor penguins were first successfully bred at SeaWorld San Diego; more than 20 birds have hatched there since 1980. Considered a flagship species, 55 individuals were counted in captivity in North American zoos and aquaria in 1999. In China, the emperor penguin was first bred at Nanjing Underwater World in 2009, followed by Laohutan Ocean Park in Dalian in 2010. Since then it has been kept and bred at a few other facilities in China, and the only confirmed twin emperor penguins (the species normally lays just one egg) hatched at Sun Asia Ocean World in Dalian in 2017. In Japan, the species is housed at Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium and Wakayama Adventure World, with successful hatching at Adventure World.

===Penguin rescue, rehabilitation and release===
In June 2011, a juvenile emperor penguin was found on the beach at Peka Peka, north of Wellington in New Zealand. He had consumed of sand, which he had apparently mistaken for snow, as well as sticks and stones, and had to undergo a number of operations to remove these to save his life. Following recovery, on 4 September, the juvenile, named &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (after the 2006 film), was fitted with a tracking device and released into the Southern Ocean north of Campbell Island. However, 8 days later scientists lost contact with the bird, suggesting that the transmitter had fallen off (considered likely) or that he had been eaten by a predator (considered less likely).

===Cultural references===
The species&#x27; unique life cycle in such a harsh environment has been described in print and visual media. Apsley Cherry-Garrard, the Antarctic explorer, wrote in 1922: &quot;Take it all in all, I do not believe anybody on Earth has a worse time than an emperor penguin&quot;. Widely distributed in cinemas in 2005, the French documentary &quot;La Marche de l&#x27;empereur&quot;, which was also released with the English title &quot;March of the Penguins&quot;, told the story of the penguins&#x27; reproductive cycle. The subject has been covered for the small screen five times by the BBC and presenter David Attenborough: first in episode five of the 1993 series on the Antarctic &quot;Life in the Freezer&quot;, again in the 2001 series &quot;The Blue Planet&quot;, once again in the 2006 series &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, in &quot;Frozen Planet&quot; in 2011 and a one-hour programme dedicated to the species in the 2018 series &quot;Dynasties&quot;.

The animated movie &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006, followed by a sequel &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot;, 2011) features emperor penguins as its primary characters, with one in particular that loves to dance; although a comedy, it too depicts their life cycle and promotes an underlying serious environmental message of threats from global warming and depletion of food sources by overfishing. The animated movie &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (2007) features a surfing emperor penguin named Zeke &quot;Big-Z&quot; Topanga. More than 30 countries have depicted the bird on their stamps – Australia, Great Britain, Chile and France have each issued several. It has also been depicted on a 1962 10 franc stamp as part of an Antarctic expedition series. Canadian band The Tragically Hip composed the song &quot;Emperor Penguin&quot; for their 1998 album &quot;Phantom Power&quot;. &quot;The Emperor Lays an Egg&quot; is a 2004 non-fiction children&#x27;s picture book by Brenda Z. Guiberson. 

DC Comics&#x27; crime boss character Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot, aka &quot;The Penguin&quot;, styles himself after an emperor penguin, a fact which is often referenced in stories, e.g., in his occasional alias &quot;Forster Aptenodytes.&quot;

<text>Pharyngitis is inflammation of the back of the throat, known as the pharynx. It typically results in a sore throat and fever. Other symptoms may include a runny nose, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, swollen lymph nodes, and a hoarse voice. Symptoms usually last 3–5 days, but can be longer depending on cause. Complications can include sinusitis and acute otitis media. Pharyngitis is a type of upper respiratory tract infection.
Most cases are caused by a viral infection. Strep throat, a bacterial infection, is the cause in about 25% of children and 10% of adults. Uncommon causes include other bacteria such as &quot;gonococcus&quot;, fungi, irritants such as smoke, allergies, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Specific testing is not recommended in people who have clear symptoms of a viral infection, such as a cold. Otherwise, a rapid antigen detection test or throat swab is recommended. PCR testing has become common as it is as good as taking a throat swab but gives a faster result. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include epiglottitis, thyroiditis, retropharyngeal abscess, and occasionally heart disease.
NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, can be used to help with the pain. Numbing medication, such as topical lidocaine, may also help. Strep throat is typically treated with antibiotics, such as either penicillin or amoxicillin. It is unclear whether steroids are useful in acute pharyngitis, other than possibly in severe cases, but a recent (2020) review found that when used in combination with antibiotics they moderately reduced pain and the likelihood of resolution.
About 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any 3-month period. Two or three episodes in a year are not uncommon. This resulted in 15 million physician visits in the United States in 2007. Pharyngitis is the most common cause of a sore throat. The word comes from the Greek word &quot;pharynx&quot; meaning &quot;throat&quot; and the suffix &quot;-itis&quot; meaning &quot;inflammation&quot;.
==Classification==

Pharyngitis is a type of inflammation caused by an upper respiratory tract infection. It may be classified as acute or chronic. Acute pharyngitis may be catarrhal, purulent, or ulcerative, depending on the causative agent and the immune capacity of the affected individual. Chronic pharyngitis may be catarrhal, hypertrophic, or atrophic.

Tonsillitis is a subtype of pharyngitis. If the inflammation includes both the tonsils and other parts of the throat, it may be called pharyngotonsillitis or tonsillopharyngitis. Another subclassification is nasopharyngitis (the common cold).

Clergyman&#x27;s sore throat or clergyman&#x27;s throat is an archaic term formerly used for chronic pharyngitis associated with overuse of the voice as in public speaking. It was sometimes called &quot;dysphonia clericorum&quot; or chronic folliculitis sore throat.

==Cause==
Most cases are due to an infectious organism acquired from close contact with an infected individual.

===Viral===

These comprise about 40–80% of all infectious cases and can be a feature of many different types of viral infections.

*Adenovirus is the most common of the viral causes. Typically, the degree of neck lymph node enlargement is modest and the throat often does not appear red, although it is painful.
*The family &quot;Orthomyxoviridae&quot; which cause influenza are present with rapid onset high temperature, headache, and generalized ache. A sore throat may be associated.
*Infectious mononucleosis (&quot;glandular fever&quot;) is caused by the Epstein–Barr virus. This may cause significant lymph-node swelling and an exudative tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The heterophile test can be used if this is suspected.
*Herpes simplex virus can cause multiple mouth ulcers.
*Measles
*Common cold: rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus can cause infection of the throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often pain.

===Bacterial===
A number of different bacteria can infect the human throat. The most common is group A streptococcus (&quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;), but others include &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Chlamydophila pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae,&quot; and &quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot;.

====Streptococcal pharyngitis====

Streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is caused by a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS). It is the most common bacterial cause of cases of pharyngitis (15–30%). Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, and large lymph nodes. It is a contagious infection, spread by close contact with an infected individual. A definitive diagnosis is made based on the results of a throat culture. Antibiotics are useful to both prevent complications (such as rheumatic fever) and speed recovery.

====Fusobacterium necrophorum====
&quot;Fusobacterium necrophorum&quot; is a normal inhabitant of the oropharyngeal flora and can occasionally create a peritonsillar abscess. In one out of 400 untreated cases, Lemierre&#x27;s syndrome occurs.

====Diphtheria====
Diphtheria is a potentially life-threatening upper respiratory infection caused by &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, which has been largely eradicated in developed nations since the introduction of childhood vaccination programs, but is still reported in the Third World and increasingly in some areas in Eastern Europe. Antibiotics are effective in the early stages, but recovery is generally slow.

====Others====
A few other causes are rare, but possibly fatal, and include parapharyngeal space infections: peritonsillar abscess (&quot;quinsy abscess&quot;), submandibular space infection (Ludwig&#x27;s angina), and epiglottitis.

===Fungal===
Some cases of pharyngitis are caused by fungal infection, such as &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, causing oral thrush.

===Noninfectious===
Pharyngitis may also be caused by mechanical, chemical, or thermal irritation, for example cold air or acid reflux. Some medications may produce pharyngitis, such as pramipexole and antipsychotics.

==Diagnosis==
Differentiating a viral and a bacterial cause of a sore throat based on symptoms alone is difficult. Thus, a throat swab often is done to rule out a bacterial cause.

The modified Centor criteria may be used to determine the management of people with pharyngitis. Based on five clinical criteria, it indicates the probability of a streptococcal infection.

One point is given for each of the criteria:
* Absence of a cough
* Swollen and tender cervical lymph nodes
* Temperature more than 
* Tonsillar exudate or swelling
* Age less than 15 (a point is subtracted if age is more than 44)

The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends against empirical treatment and considers antibiotics only appropriate following positive testing. Testing is not needed in children under three, as both group A strep and rheumatic fever are rare, except if they have a sibling with the disease.

==Management==
The majority of the time, treatment is symptomatic. Specific treatments are effective for bacterial, fungal, and herpes simplex infections.

===Medications===
* Pain medication, such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen (paracetamol), can help reduce the pain associated with a sore throat. Aspirin may be used in adults, but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.
* Steroids (such as dexamethasone) may be useful for severe pharyngitis. Their general use, however, is poorly supported.
* Viscous lidocaine relieves pain by numbing the mucous membranes.
* Antibiotics are useful if a bacterial infection is the cause of the sore throat. For viral infections, antibiotics have no effect. In the United States, they are used in 25% of people before a bacterial infection has been detected.
* Oral analgesic solutions, the active ingredient is usually phenol, but also less commonly benzocaine, cetylpyridinium chloride, and/or menthol. Chloraseptic and Cepacol are two examples of brands of these kinds of analgesics.

===Alternative===

Gargling salt water is often suggested, but there is no evidence to support or discourage this practice. Alternative medicines are promoted and used for the treatment of sore throats. However, they are poorly supported by evidence.
==Epidemiology==
Acute pharyngitis is the most common cause of a sore throat and, together with cough, it is diagnosed in more than 1.9 million people a year in the United States.

<doc id="223210" wikidata="Q2008089" url="?curid=223210" title="OSCAR protocol">
<text>Open System for Communication in Realtime (OSCAR) is AOL&#x27;s proprietary instant messaging and presence information protocol. It was used by AOL&#x27;s AIM instant messaging system and ICQ.

Despite its name, the specifications for the protocol remain proprietary. AOL has gone to great lengths to keep competitors (namely Microsoft, XMPP, and Cerulean Studios) from implementing compatible clients for their proprietary messaging systems. In 2002, AOL signed a contract with Apple, Inc., allowing them to use OSCAR (as well as AOL&#x27;s own code libraries) in their iChat application. This allowed iChat users to interact with ICQ and AIM users directly. The deal also permitted users of Apple&#x27;s .Mac service to log in to the AIM network using their .Mac email addresses. (This has carried over to Apple&#x27;s MobileMe service.)

, large parts of the protocol had been reverse-engineered and implemented by a number of third-party clients.

The OSCAR protocol can be used separately from AOL&#x27;s network. In fact, AOL expands on the general concept of OSCAR, adding systems for service-side buddy lists and icons, as well as features for file transfers using Bonjour.

On March 6, 2006, AOL released the AIM SDK and launched a developer website, allowing developers to build plugins for AIM Triton, and build their own custom clients, which connect over the OSCAR protocol. They had not, at that point, however, released any information about the protocol itself.

On March 5, 2008, AOL released portions of the OSCAR protocol documentation. Google also provided the ability to sign in to AIM network via the Google Talk client built into Gmail.

== Packet structure ==

All packets sent over OSCAR are encapsulated in the same manner. All 16-bit integers sent over the network are unsigned, and big endian (see Endianness.) This is the same for 32-bit integers, and 8-bit integers (or bytes.)

=== FLAP header ===
A special Frame Layer Protocol (FLAP) container encloses every packet. It carries information about packet size, channel, and its number in sequence.
=== SNAC data ===
Within almost every packet sent over channel 2, packets contain a SNAC (Simple Network Atomic Communication). There is always either one or zero of these contained in a packet, and therefore they do not contain (nor do they need to) a length.

<doc id="223211" wikidata="Q570920" url="?curid=223211" title="Tachypnea">
<text>Tachypnea, also spelt tachypnoea, is a respiratory rate greater than normal, resulting in abnormally rapid and shallow breathing. 

In adult humans at rest, any respiratory rate of 1220 per minute is considered clinically normal, with tachypnea being any rate above that. Children have significantly higher resting ventilatory rates, which decline rapidly during the first three years of life and then steadily until around 18 years. Tachypnea can be an early indicator of pneumonia and other lung diseases in children, and is often an outcome of a brain injury.

== Distinction from other breathing terms ==

Different sources produce different classifications for breathing terms.

Some of the public describe tachypnea as any rapid breathing. Hyperventilation is then described as increased ventilation of the alveoli (which can occur through increased rate or depth of breathing, or a mix of both) where there is a smaller rise in metabolic carbon dioxide relative to this increase in ventilation. Hyperpnea, on the other hand, is defined as breathing an increased volume of air, with or without an increase in respiration rate.

Others give another classification: tachypnea is as any rapid breathing, hyperventilation is increased rate of breathing at rest, hyperpnea is an increase in breathing that is appropriately proportional to an increase in metabolic rate.

A third paradigm is: tachypnea is abnormally rapid and shallow respiration (though some may argue this is inaccurate as breathing differs from respiration), hyperventilation is increased rate or depth of respiration to abnormal levels causing decreased levels of blood carbon dioxide and hyperpnea is any increase in breathing rate or depth that is not normal.

=== Threshold definition ===
As normal respiratory rate varies with age, the definition of tachypnea also varies with age.
== Causes ==

Tachypnea may have physiological or pathological causes. Both of these categories would include large lists of individual causes.

=== Physiological causes ===
Physiological causes of tachypnea include exercise. This type is usually not a cause of concern unless it&#x27;s excessive. 

=== Pathological causes ===
Pathological causes of tachypnea include sepsis, compensation for diabetic ketoacidosis or other metabolic acidosis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, carbon monoxide poisoning, pulmonary embolism, asthma, COPD, laryngospasm, allergic reaction causing airway edema, foreign body aspiration, tracheobronchomalacia, congestive heart failure, anxiety states, haemorrhage, or many other medical issues.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;tachypnea&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, yielding &quot;fast breathing&quot;. See pronunciation information at &quot;dyspnea&quot;.

<text>The Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known by its informal name &quot;Jonestown&quot;, was a remote settlement in Guyana established by the Peoples Temple, an American religious movement under the leadership of Jim Jones. Jonestown became internationally infamous when, on November 18, 1978, a total of 918 people died at the settlement; at the nearby airstrip in Port Kaituma; and at a Temple-run building in Georgetown, Guyana&#x27;s capital city. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations.

A total of 909 individuals died in Jonestown itself, all but two from apparent cyanide poisoning, a significant number of whom were injected against their will. Jones and some Peoples Temple members referred to the act as a &quot;revolutionary suicide&quot; on an audio tape of the event, and in prior recorded discussions. The poisonings in Jonestown followed the murder of five others, including U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan, by Temple members at Port Kaituma, an act that Jones ordered. Four other Temple members committed murder-suicide in Georgetown at Jones&#x27; command.

Terms used to describe the deaths in Jonestown and Georgetown have evolved over time. Many contemporary media accounts after the events called the deaths a mass suicide. In contrast, later sources refer to the deaths with terms such as mass murder-suicide, a massacre, or simply mass murder. Seventy or more individuals at Jonestown were injected with poison, a third of the victims were minors, and armed guards had been ordered to shoot anyone who attempted to flee the settlement as Jones lobbied for suicide.

== Origins ==

The Peoples Temple was formed by Jim Jones in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1955. The movement purported to practice what it called &quot;apostolic socialism.&quot; In doing so, the Temple preached that &quot;those who remained drugged with the opiate of religion had to be brought to enlightenmentsocialism.&quot; Jones had held an interest in Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Adolf Hitler from a young age, and would later frequently praise Stalin and Vladimir Lenin as heroes. He was also upset with persecution against the Communist Party USA. In the early 1960s, Jones visited Guyana – then a British colony – while on his way to establishing a short-lived Temple mission in Brazil.

After Jones received considerable criticism in Indiana for his integrationist views, the Temple moved to Redwood Valley, California, in 1965. In the early 1970s, the Temple opened other branches in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and would eventually move its headquarters to San Francisco.

With the move to San Francisco came increasing political involvement by the Temple and the high levels of approval they received from the local government. After the group&#x27;s participation proved instrumental in the mayoral election victory of George Moscone in 1975, Moscone appointed Jones as the Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority. Increasing public support in California gave Jones access to several high-ranking political figures, including vice presidential candidate Walter Mondale and First Lady Rosalynn Carter. Guests at a large 1976 testimonial dinner for Jones included Governor Jerry Brown, Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Dymally and California Assemblyman Willie Brown, among others.

==Jonestown established==
===Selection and establishment of Guyanese land===

In the fall of 1973, after critical newspaper articles by Lester Kinsolving and the defection of eight Temple members, Jones and Temple attorney Timothy Stoen prepared an &quot;immediate action&quot; contingency plan for responding to a police or media crackdown. The plan listed various options, including fleeing to Canada or to a &quot;Caribbean missionary post&quot; such as Barbados or Trinidad. For its Caribbean missionary post, the Temple quickly chose Guyana, conducting research on its economy and extradition treaties with the United States. In October 1973, the directors of the Temple passed a resolution to establish an agricultural mission there.

The Temple chose Guyana, in part, because of the group&#x27;s own socialist politics, which were moving further to the left during the selection process. Former Temple member Tim Carter stated that the reasons for choosing Guyana were the Temple&#x27;s view of a perceived dominance of racism and multinational corporations in the U.S. government. According to Carter, the Temple concluded that Guyana, an English-speaking, socialist country with a government including prominent black leaders, would afford black Temple members a peaceful place to live.

Later, Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham stated that Jones may have &quot;wanted to use cooperatives as the basis for the establishment of socialism, and maybe his idea of setting up a commune meshed with that.&quot; Jones thought that Guyana was small, poor and independent enough for him to easily obtain influence and official protection. He proved skillful in presenting the Guyanese government the benefits of allowing the Temple to establish a settlement in the country. One of the main tactics was to speak of the advantages of their American presence near Guyana&#x27;s disputed border with Venezuela; this idea seemed promising to the Burnham government, who feared a military incursion by Venezuela.

In 1974, after traveling to an area of northwestern Guyana with Guyanese officials, Jones and the Temple negotiated a lease of over of land in the jungle located west of the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. In 1976, Guyana approved the lease (retroactive to April 1974). The site, located near the disputed border with Venezuela, was isolated and had soil of low fertility. The nearest body of water was away by muddy roads.

=== Jonestown before mass migration ===

As five hundred members began the construction of Jonestown, the Temple encouraged more to relocate to the settlement. Jones saw Jonestown as both a &quot;socialist paradise&quot; and a &quot;sanctuary&quot; from media scrutiny. Jones reached an agreement to guarantee that Guyana would permit Temple members&#x27; mass migration. To do so, he stated that they were &quot;skilled and progressive,&quot; showed off an envelope he claimed contained $500,000 and stated that he would invest most of the group&#x27;s assets in Guyana. The relatively large number of immigrants to Guyana overwhelmed the government&#x27;s small but stringent immigration infrastructure in a country where immigrants had outweighed locals. Guyanese immigration procedures were compromised to inhibit the departure of Temple defectors and curtail the visas of Temple opponents.

Jonestown was held up as a benevolent communist community, with Jones stating: &quot;I believe we&#x27;re the purest communists there are.&quot; Jones&#x27; wife, Marceline, described Jonestown as &quot;dedicated to live for socialism, total economic and racial and social equality. We are here living communally.&quot; Jones wanted to construct a model community and claimed that Burnham &quot;couldn&#x27;t rave enough about us, the wonderful things we do, the project, the model of socialism.&quot; He did not permit members to leave Jonestown without his express prior permission.

The Temple established offices in Georgetown and conducted numerous meetings with Burnham and other Guyanese officials. In 1976, Temple member Michael Prokes requested that Burnham receive Jones as a foreign dignitary along with other &quot;high ranking U.S. officials.&quot; Jones traveled to Guyana with Dymally to meet with Burnham and Guyanese Foreign Affairs Minister Fred Willis. In that meeting, Dymally agreed to pass on the message to the U.S. State Department that Guyana wanted to keep an open door to cooperation with the U.S. He followed up that meeting with a letter to Burnham stating that Jones was &quot;one of the finest human beings&quot; and that Dymally was &quot;tremendously impressed&quot; by his visit to Jonestown.

Temple members took pains to stress their loyalty to Burnham&#x27;s People&#x27;s National Congress Party. One Temple member, Paula Adams, became romantically involved with Laurence &quot;Bonny&quot; Mann, Guyana&#x27;s ambassador to the U.S. Jones bragged about other female Temple members he referred to as &quot;public relations women&quot; giving all for the cause in Jonestown. Burnham&#x27;s wife Viola was also a strong advocate of the Temple.

Later, Burnham stated that Guyana allowed the Temple to operate in the manner it did on the references of Moscone, Mondale and Rosalynn Carter. He also said that, when Deputy Minister Ptolemy Reid traveled to Washington, D.C. in September 1977 to sign the Panama Canal Treaties, Mondale, by this point the U.S. Vice President, asked him, &quot;How&#x27;s Jim?&quot;, which indicated to Reid that Mondale had a personal interest in Jones&#x27; well-being.

=== Investigation and mass migration ===
In the summer of 1977, Jones and several hundred Temple members moved to Jonestown to escape building pressure from San Francisco media investigations. Jones left the same night that an editor at &quot;New West&quot; magazine read to him an article to be published by Marshall Kilduff detailing allegations of abuse by former Temple members. After the mass migration, Jonestown became overcrowded. Jonestown&#x27;s population was slightly under 900 at its peak in 1978.

=== Jonestown life after mass migration ===
Many members of the Temple believed that Guyana would be, as Jones promised, a paradise or utopia. After Jones arrived, however, Jonestown life significantly changed. Entertaining movies from Georgetown that the settlers had watched were mostly canceled in favor of Soviet propaganda shorts and documentaries on American social problems.

Bureaucratic requirements after Jones&#x27; arrival sapped labor resources for other needs. Buildings fell into disrepair and weeds encroached on fields. School study and nighttime lectures for adults turned to Jones&#x27; discussions about revolution and enemies, with lessons focusing on Soviet alliances, Jones&#x27; crises and the purported &quot;mercenaries&quot; sent by Stoen, who had defected from the Temple and turned against the group.

For the first several months, Temple members worked six days a week, from approximately 6:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., with an hour for lunch. In mid-1978, after Jones&#x27; health deteriorated and his wife began managing more of Jonestown&#x27;s operations, the work week was reduced to eight hours a day for five days a week. After the day&#x27;s work ended, Temple members would attend several hours of activities in the settlement&#x27;s central pavilion, including classes on socialism.

Jones compared Jonestown&#x27;s work schedule to the North Korean system of eight hours of daily work followed by eight hours of study. This also comported with the Temple&#x27;s practice of gradually subjecting its followers to sophisticated mind control and behavior modification techniques borrowed from Mao Zedong and Kim Il-sung. Jones would often read news and commentary, including items from Radio Moscow and Radio Havana, and was known to side with the Soviets over the Chinese during the Sino-Soviet split.

&quot;Discussion&quot; about current events often took the form of Jones interrogating individual followers about the implications and subtexts of a given news item, or delivering lengthy and often confused monologues on how to &quot;read&quot; certain events. In addition to Soviet documentaries, political thrillers such as &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974), &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), &quot;State of Siege&quot; (1972) and &quot;Z&quot; (1969) were repeatedly screened and minutely analyzed by Jones. Recordings of commune meetings show how livid and frustrated Jones would get when anyone did not find the films interesting or did not understand the message Jones was placing upon them.

Jonestown had a closed-circuit television system, but no one could view anything in the way of film or recorded TV, no matter how innocuous or seemingly politically neutral, without a Temple staffer present to &quot;interpret&quot; the material for the viewers. This invariably meant damning criticisms of perceived capitalist propaganda in Western material, and glowing praise for and highlighting of Marxist–Leninist messages in material from communist nations.

Jones&#x27;s recorded readings of the news were part of the constant broadcasts over Jonestown&#x27;s tower speakers, such that all members could hear them throughout the day and night. His news readings usually portrayed the U.S. as a &quot;capitalist&quot; and &quot;imperialist&quot; villain, while casting &quot;socialist&quot; leaders, such as Kim, Stalin and Robert Mugabe in a positive light.

Jonestown&#x27;s primary means of communication with the outside world was a shortwave radio. All voice communications with San Francisco and Georgetown were transmitted using this radio, from mundane supply orders to confidential Temple business. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) cited the Temple for technical violations and for using amateur frequencies for commercial purposes. Because shortwave radio was Jonestown&#x27;s only effective means of non-postal communication, the Temple felt that the FCC&#x27;s threats to revoke its operators&#x27; licenses threatened Jonestown&#x27;s existence.

Because it stood on poor soil, Jonestown was not self-sufficient and had to import large quantities of commodities such as wheat. Temple members lived in small communal houses, some with walls woven from Troolie palm, and ate meals that reportedly consisted of nothing more on some days than rice, beans, greens and occasionally meat, sauce and eggs. Despite having access to an estimated $26 million by late 1978, Jones also lived in a tiny communal house, though fewer people lived there than in other communal houses. His house reportedly held a small refrigerator containing, at times, eggs, meat, fruit, salads and soft drinks. Medical problems, such as severe diarrhea and high fevers, struck half the community in February 1978.

Although Jonestown contained no dedicated prison and no form of capital punishment, various forms of punishment were used against members considered to have disciplinary problems. Methods included imprisonment in a plywood box and forcing children to spend a night at the bottom of a well, sometimes upside-down. This &quot;torture hole&quot;, along with beatings, became the subject of rumor among local Guyanese. For some members who attempted to escape, drugs such as Thorazine, sodium pentathol, chloral hydrate, Demerol and Valium were administered in an &quot;extended care unit.&quot; Armed guards patrolled the area day and night to enforce Jonestown&#x27;s rules.

Children were generally surrendered to communal care, and at times were only allowed to see their biological parents briefly at night. Jones was called &quot;Father&quot; or &quot;Dad&quot; by both adults and children. The community had a nursery at which thirty-three infants were born.

For a year, it appears the commune was run primarily through Social Security checks received by members. Up to $65,000 in monthly welfare payments from U.S. government agencies to Jonestown residents were signed over to the Temple. In 1978, officials from the U.S. embassy in Georgetown interviewed Social Security recipients on multiple occasions to make sure they were not being held against their will. None of the seventy-five people interviewed by the embassy stated that they were being held captive, were forced to sign over welfare checks or wanted to leave Jonestown.

===Demographics===
African Americans made up approximately 70% of Jonestown&#x27;s population. 45% of Jonestown residents were black women.

==Events in Jonestown before the arrival of Leo Ryan==
===White Night and the Six Day Siege===
Jones&#x27; paranoia and drug abuse increased in Jonestown as he became fearful of a government raid on the commune, citing concerns that the community would not be able to resist an attack. He made frequent addresses to Temple members regarding Jonestown&#x27;s safety, including statements that U.S. intelligence agencies were conspiring with &quot;capitalist pigs&quot; to destroy the settlement and harm its inhabitants. 

Jones was known to regularly study Adolf Hitler and Father Divine to learn how to manipulate members of the cult. Divine told Jones personally to &quot;find an enemy&quot; and &quot;to make sure they know who the enemy is&quot; as it would unify those in the group and make them subservient to him.

After work, when purported emergencies arose, the Temple sometimes conducted what Jones referred to as &quot;White Nights.&quot; During such events, Jones would call, &quot;Alert, Alert, Alert&quot; over Jonestown&#x27;s tower speakers to call the community together in the pavilion, which was then surrounded by guards armed with guns and crossbows. On several occasions, Jones then gave his followers four options: attempt to flee to the Soviet Union, commit &quot;revolutionary suicide&quot;, stay in Jonestown and fight the purported attackers or flee into the jungle.

On at least two occasions during White Nights, after a &quot;revolutionary suicide&quot; vote was reached, a simulated mass suicide was rehearsed. Temple defector Deborah Layton described the event in an affidavit:

Everyone, including the children, was told to line up. As we passed through the line, we were given a small glass of red liquid to drink. We were told that the liquid contained poison and that we would die within 45 minutes. We all did as we were told. When the time came when we should have dropped dead, Rev. Jones explained that the poison was not real and that we had just been through a loyalty test. He warned us that the time was not far off when it would become necessary for us to die by our own hands.

One drill lasted for six days. Known as the &quot;Six Day Siege,&quot; this ordeal was used thereafter by Jones as a symbol of the community&#x27;s indomitable spirit. For days on end, frightened settlers ringed the commune, armed with machetes and whatever crude tools would serve as weapons. Surrounding them, Jones claimed, were mercenaries bent on murder, as well as the abduction of Jones&#x27; son John Victor Stoen and others. Marceline and others outside of the commune engaged in interminable shortwave radio conversations with Jones, seeking to dissuade him from ordering a mass suicide. The panic reached such a point that an &quot;ad hoc&quot; evacuation was ordered by Jones, with dozens of settlers hastily loaded onto boats on the George River for a purported exodus to Cuba. Several people fell into the river, suffering injuries. At last, Jones bowed to pressure, and the drill ended. Veterans of the &quot;Siege&quot; were held in high regard in Jonestown, and in numerous addresses Jones tearfully recalled their stoic courage on the &quot;front line.&quot;

The Temple had received monthly half-pound shipments of cyanide since 1976 after Jones obtained a jeweler&#x27;s license to buy the chemical, purportedly to clean gold. In May 1978, a Temple doctor wrote a memo to Jones asking permission to test cyanide on Jonestown&#x27;s pigs, as their metabolism was close to that of human beings.

===Stoen custody dispute===

In September 1977, former Temple members Tim and Grace Stoen battled in a Georgetown court to produce an order for the Temple to show cause why a final order should not be issued returning their five-year-old son, John. A few days later, a second order was issued for John to be taken into protective custody by authorities. The fear of being held in contempt of the orders caused Jones to set up a false sniper attack upon himself and begin the &quot;Six Day Siege.&quot;

Jonestown rallies began to take an almost surreal tone as black activists Angela Davis and Huey Newton communicated via radio-telephone to the settlers, urging them to hold strong against the &quot;conspiracy.&quot; Jones made radio broadcasts stating &quot;we will die unless we are granted freedom from harassment and asylum.&quot; Reid finally assured Marceline that the Guyana Defence Force would not invade Jonestown.

=== Exploring another potential exodus ===
Following the &quot;Six Day Siege,&quot; despite Reid&#x27;s assurances, Jones no longer believed the Guyanese could be trusted. He directed Temple members to write to over a dozen foreign governments inquiring about immigration policies relevant to another exodus by the Temple. He also wrote to the State Department, inquiring about North Korea and Albania, then enduring the Sino-Albanian split. In Georgetown, the Temple conducted frequent meetings with the embassies of the Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea and Yugoslavia. Negotiations with the Soviet embassy included extensive discussions of possible resettlement there. The Temple produced memoranda discussing potential places within the Soviet Union in which they might settle.

Sharon Amos, Michael Prokes, Matthew Blunt, Timothy Regan and other Temple members took active roles in the &quot;Guyana-Korea Friendship Society,&quot; which sponsored two seminars on the revolutionary concepts of Kim Il-sung. In April 1978, a high-ranking correspondent of the Soviet news agency TASS and his wife visited Jones. On 2 October 1978, Feodor Timofeyev, the Soviet consul in Georgetown, visited Jonestown for two days and gave a speech. Jones stated before the speech, &quot;For many years, we have let our sympathies be quite publicly known, that the United States government was not our mother, but that the Soviet Union was our spiritual motherland.&quot; Timofeyev opened the speech stating that the Soviet Union would like to send &quot;our deepest and the most sincere greetings to the people of this first socialist and communist community of the United States of America, in Guyana and in the world&quot;. Both speeches were met by cheers and applause from the crowd in Jonestown. 

Following the visit, Temple members met almost weekly with Timofeyev to discuss a potential Soviet exodus. However, Jones eventually had a change of heart, stating that he preferred to stay within the Guyanese borders because of the sovereignty it afforded them.

===Concerned Relatives===
Meanwhile, in late 1977 and early 1978, the Stoens participated in meetings with other relatives of Jonestown residents at the home of Jeannie Mills, another Temple defector. Together, they called themselves the &quot;Concerned Relatives.&quot; Tim Stoen engaged in letter-writing campaigns to the U.S. Secretary of State and the Guyanese government, and traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby for an official investigation. In January 1978, Stoen wrote a white paper to Congress detailing his grievances and requesting that congressmen write to Burnham; ninety-one congressmen, including Leo Ryan, wrote such letters.

On 17 February 1978, Jones submitted to an interview with &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; reporter Tim Reiterman. Reiterman&#x27;s subsequent story about the Stoen custody battle prompted the immediate threat of a lawsuit by the Temple. The repercussions were devastating for the Temple&#x27;s reputation, and made most former supporters more suspicious of the Temple&#x27;s claims that it was the victim of a &quot;rightist vendetta.&quot; Still, others remained loyal. On the day after Reiterman&#x27;s article was published, Harvey Milk – a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who was supported by the Temple – wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones &quot;as a man of the highest character&quot; and stating that Temple defectors were trying to &quot;damage Rev. Jones&#x27; reputation&quot; with &quot;apparent bold-faced lies.&quot;

On 11 April 1978, the Concerned Relatives distributed a packet of documents, including letters and affidavits, that they titled an &quot;Accusation of Human Rights Violations by Rev. James Warren Jones&quot; to the Peoples Temple, members of the press and members of Congress. In June 1978, Layton provided the group with a further affidavit detailing alleged crimes by the Temple and substandard living conditions in Jonestown.

Tim Stoen represented three members of the Concerned Relatives in lawsuits filed in May and June 1978 against Jones and other Temple members, seeking in excess of $56 million in damages. The Temple, represented by Charles Garry, filed a suit against Stoen on 10 July 1978, seeking $150 million in damages.

===Conspiracism===
During July and August of 1978, Jones sought the legal services of Mark Lane and Donald Freed, both Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists, to help make the case of a &quot;grand conspiracy&quot; by U.S. intelligence agencies against the Temple. Jones told Lane he wanted to &quot;pull an Eldridge Cleaver&quot; and return to the U.S. after repairing his reputation. In September, Lane spoke to the residents of Jonestown, providing support for Jones&#x27; theories and comparing him to Martin Luther King Jr. Lane then held press conferences stating that &quot;none of the charges&quot; against the Temple &quot;are accurate or true&quot; and that there was a &quot;massive conspiracy&quot; against the Temple by &quot;intelligence organizations,&quot; naming the CIA, the FBI, and even the U.S. Postal Service. Though Lane presented himself as a disinterested party, Jones was actually paying him $6,000 per month to generate such theories.

===Jones&#x27; declining physical and mental health===
Jones&#x27; health significantly declined in Jonestown. In 1978 he was informed of a possible lung infection, upon which he announced to his followers that he in fact had lung cancer – a ploy to foster sympathy and strengthen support within the community. 

Jones was said to be abusing injectable Valium, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. Audio tapes of 1978 meetings exhibit Jones complaining of high blood pressure, small strokes, weight loss of thirty to forty pounds within the span of two weeks, temporary blindness, convulsions and, in his final month, grotesque swelling of the extremities. During meetings and public addresses, Jones&#x27; once-sharp speaking voice often sounded slurred; words ran together or were tripped over. He would occasionally not finish sentences even when reading typed reports over the commune&#x27;s speaker system.

Reiterman was surprised by the severe deterioration of Jones&#x27; health when he saw him in Jonestown on November 17, 1978. After covering Jones for eighteen months for the &quot;Examiner&quot;, he thought it was &quot;shocking to see his glazed eyes and festering paranoia face to face, to realize that nearly a thousand lives, ours included, were in his hands.&quot;

==Leo Ryan visit==
===Initial investigation===

Leo Ryan, who represented California&#x27;s 11th congressional district, was friends with the father of Bob Houston, a Temple member in California whose mutilated body was found near train tracks on October 5, 1976, three days after a taped telephone conversation with Houston&#x27;s ex-wife in which leaving the Temple was discussed. Over the following months, Ryan&#x27;s interest was further aroused by the allegations put forth by Stoen, Layton and the Concerned Relatives.

On November 14, 1978, Ryan flew to Georgetown, along with a delegation that included:
* Jackie Speier, Ryan&#x27;s then-legal adviser;
* Neville Annibourne, representing Guyana&#x27;s Ministry of Information;
* Richard Dwyer, Deputy Chief of Mission of the U.S. embassy to Guyana;
* Tim Reiterman, &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; reporter;
* Greg Robinson, &quot;Examiner&quot; photographer;
* Don Harris, NBC reporter;
* Bob Brown, NBC camera operator;
* Steve Sung, NBC audio technician;
* Bob Flick, NBC producer;
* Charles Krause, &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter;
* Ron Javers, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporter;

and Concerned Relatives representatives, including:
* Tim and Grace Stoen,
* Steve and Anthony Katsaris,
* Beverly Oliver,
* Jim Cobb,
* Sherwin Harris, and
* Carol Houston Boyd.

===Visits to Jonestown===
====November 17, 1978====

When the Ryan delegation arrived in Guyana, Jones&#x27; attorneys Lane and Garry initially refused to allow them access to Jonestown. However, by the morning of November 17, they informed Jones that Ryan would likely leave for Jonestown that afternoon regardless of his willingness. Ryan&#x27;s party, accompanied by Lane and Garry, came to an airstrip at Port Kaituma, six miles (10 km) from Jonestown, some hours later. Because of lack of room on the plane, only four of the Concerned Relatives – Anthony Katsaris, Beverly Oliver, Jim Cobb and Carol Boyd – accompanied Ryan, Speier and the journalists to Port Kaituma and ultimately to Jonestown. It was felt that the presence of the Stoens would unnecessarily antagonize Jones, and Harris wanted to remain in Georgetown because he hoped to spend time with his daughter Liane, who was staying at the Temple&#x27;s headquarters there.

Only Ryan, Speier, Lane and Garry were initially accepted into Jonestown, while the rest of Ryan&#x27;s party was allowed in after sunset. That night, they attended a musical reception in the pavilion. While the party was received warmly, Jones said he felt like a dying man and ranted about government conspiracies and martyrdom as he decried attacks by the press and his enemies. It was later reported – and verified by audio tapes recovered by investigators – that Jones had run rehearsals on how to convince Ryan&#x27;s delegation that everyone was happy and in good spirits.

Two Temple members, Vernon Gosney and Monica Bagby, made the first move for defection that night. In the pavilion, Gosney mistook NBC reporter Don Harris for Ryan and passed him a note, reading, &quot;Dear Congressman, Vernon Gosney and Monica Bagby. Please help us get out of Jonestown.&quot; A child nearby witnessed Gosney&#x27;s act and verbally alerted other Temple members. Harris brought two notes, one of them Gosney&#x27;s, to Ryan and Speier. According to Speier in 2006, reading the notes caused her and the congressman to realize that &quot;something was very, very wrong.&quot;

Ryan, Speier, Dwyer and Annibourne stayed the night in Jonestown while other members of their party, including the press corps and members of Concerned Relatives, were told that they had to find other accommodations. They went back to Port Kaituma and stayed at a small café.

====November 18, 1978====
In the early morning of November 18, eleven Temple members sensed danger enough to walk out of Jonestown and all the way to the town of Matthew&#x27;s Ridge, in the opposite direction from the Port Kaituma airstrip. Those defectors included the wife and son of Joe Wilson, Jonestown&#x27;s head of security. When journalists and members of the Concerned Relatives arrived in Jonestown later that day, Jones&#x27; wife Marceline gave them a tour of the settlement.

That afternoon, the Parks and the Bogue families, along with Christopher O&#x27;Neal (who was the boyfriend of one of the Parks&#x27; daughters) and Harold Cordell (who was living with Mrs. Bogue), stepped forward and asked to be escorted out of Jonestown by the Ryan delegation. When Jones&#x27; adopted son Johnny attempted to talk Jerry Parks out of leaving, Parks told him, &quot;No way, it&#x27;s nothing but a communist prison camp.&quot; Jones gave the two families, along with Gosney and Bagby, permission to leave. Before leaving, Gosney was forced to sign a statement stating that he was leaving his four-year-old son behind of his own free will. When Harris handed Gosney&#x27;s note to Jones during an interview in the pavilion, Jones stated that the defectors were lying and wanted to destroy Jonestown.

After a sudden violent rainstorm started, emotional scenes developed between family members. Al Simon, a Native American Temple member, attempted to take two of his children to Ryan to process the requisite paperwork for transfer back to the U.S. Simon&#x27;s wife, Bonnie, summoned over the speakers by Temple staff, loudly denounced her husband. Simon pleaded with Bonnie to return to the U.S., but Bonnie rejected his suggestions.

=== Port Kaituma airstrip shootings ===
While most of Ryan&#x27;s party began to depart on a large dump truck to the Port Kaituma airstrip, Ryan and Dwyer stayed behind in Jonestown to process any additional defectors. Shortly before the dump truck left, Temple loyalist Larry Layton, the brother of Deborah Layton, demanded to join the group. Several defectors voiced their suspicions about Larry&#x27;s motives.

Shortly after the dump truck initially departed, Temple member Don &quot;Ujara&quot; Sly grabbed Ryan while wielding a knife. While Ryan was unhurt after others wrestled Sly to the ground, Dwyer strongly suggested that the congressman leave Jonestown while he filed a criminal complaint against Sly. Ryan did so, promising to return later to address the dispute. The truck departing to the airstrip had stopped after the passengers heard of the attack on Ryan, and took him as a passenger before continuing its journey towards the airstrip.

The entourage had originally scheduled a nineteen-passenger Twin Otter from Guyana Airways to fly them back to Georgetown. Because of the defectors departing Jonestown, the group grew in number and now an additional aircraft was required. Accordingly, the U.S. embassy arranged for a second plane, a six-passenger Cessna. When the entourage reached the airstrip between 4:30 p.m. and 4:45 p.m., the planes had not appeared as scheduled. The group had to wait until the aircraft landed at approximately 5:10 p.m. Then the boarding process began.

Larry was a passenger on the Cessna, the first aircraft to set up for takeoff. After the Cessna had taxied to the far end of the airstrip, he produced a handgun and started shooting at the passengers. He wounded Bagby and Gosney, and tried to kill Dale Parks, who disarmed him after the gun misfired.

Meanwhile, some passengers had boarded the larger Twin Otter. A tractor with a trailer attached, driven by members of the Temple&#x27;s Red Brigade security squad, arrived at the airstrip and approached the aircraft. When the tractor neared within approximately of Ryan&#x27;s party, at a time roughly concurrent with the shootings on the Cessna, the Red Brigade opened fire with handguns, shotguns and rifles while at least two shooters circled the plane on foot. There were perhaps nine shooters whose identities are not all certainly known, but most sources agree that Wilson, Stanley Gieg, Thomas Kice Sr. and Ronnie Dennis were among them. Jones had instructed Larry Layton, as well as the those aboard the tractor, to ensure that none of the members of Ryan&#x27;s party, nor the defectors, were to leave Jonestown.
The first few seconds of the shooting were captured on U-Matic ENG videotape by NBC cameraman Bob Brown, who was killed along with Robinson, Harris and Temple defector Patricia Parks in the few minutes of shooting. Ryan was killed after being shot more than twenty times. Speier, Reiterman, Katsaris, Steve Sung, Richard Dwyer, Charles Krause, Ron Javers, Carolyn Houston Boyd and Beverly Oliver were the nine injured in and around the Twin Otter. After the shootings, the Cessna&#x27;s pilot, Tom Fernandez, along with the pilot and co-pilot of the Twin Otter, Captain Guy Spence and First officer Astil Rodwell Paul, as well as the injured Bagby, fled in the Cessna to Georgetown. The damaged Twin Otter and the injured Ryan delegation members were left behind on the airstrip.

==Deaths in Jonestown==
Before leaving Jonestown for the airstrip, Ryan had told Garry that he would issue a report that would describe Jonestown &quot;in basically good terms.&quot; Ryan stated that none of the sixty relatives he had targeted for interviews wanted to leave, the fourteen defectors constituted a very small portion of Jonestown&#x27;s residents, that any sense of imprisonment the defectors had was likely because of peer pressure and a lack of physical transportation and even if 200 of the 900+ wanted to leave, &quot;I&#x27;d still say you have a beautiful place here.&quot; Despite Garry&#x27;s report, Jones told him, &quot;I have failed.&quot; Garry reiterated that Ryan would be making a positive report, but Jones maintained that &quot;all is lost.&quot;

After Ryan&#x27;s departure from Jonestown towards Port Kaituma, Marceline made a broadcast on Jonestown&#x27;s speaker system, gives assurances and asking settlers to return to their homes. During this time, aides prepared a large metal tub with grape Flavor Aid, poisoned with diphenhydramine, promethazine, chlorpromazine, chloroquine, diazepam, chloral hydrate and cyanide.

The concoction was prepared with the help of Jonestown’s in-house doctor, Larry Schacht, a former methamphetamine addict who got sober with the help of Jones, who subsequently paid for his college education to become a doctor. Schacht had been researching the best ways for a person to die in advance of the foreseen mass suicide. About thirty minutes after Marceline&#x27;s announcement, Jones made his own, calling all members immediately to the pavilion.
A forty-four-minute cassette tape, known as the &quot;death tape,&quot; records part of the meeting Jones called inside the pavilion in the early evening of November 18. When the assembly gathered, referring to the Ryan delegation&#x27;s journey back to Georgetown, Jones told the gathering:

One of those people on that plane is gonna shoot the pilot, I know that. I didn&#x27;t plan it but I know it&#x27;s gonna happen. They&#x27;re gonna shoot that pilot and down comes the plane into the jungle and we had better not have any of our children left when it&#x27;s over, because they&#x27;ll parachute in here on us.

Jones urged Temple members to commit &quot;revolutionary suicide.&quot; Such an act had been hypothesized by Jones as far back as the Temple&#x27;s existence in San Francisco and, according to Jonestown defectors, its theory was &quot;you can go down in history, saying you chose your own way to go, and it is your commitment to refuse capitalism and in support of socialism.&quot;

Temple member Christine Miller argued that the Temple should alternatively attempt an airlift to the Soviet Union. Jim McElvane, a former therapist who had arrived in Jonestown only two days earlier, assisted Jones by arguing against Miller&#x27;s resistance to suicide, stating, &quot;Let&#x27;s make it a beautiful day&quot; and later citing possible reincarnation. After several exchanges in which Jones argued that a Soviet exodus would not be possible, along with reactions by other Temple members hostile to Miller, she backed down. However, Miller may have ceased dissenting when Jones confirmed at one point that &quot;the congressman has been murdered&quot; after the airstrip shooters returned.

When the Red Brigade members came back to Jonestown after Ryan&#x27;s murder, Tim Carter, a Vietnam War veteran, recalled them having the &quot;thousand-yard stare&quot; of weary soldiers. After Jones confirmed that &quot;the congressman&#x27;s dead,&quot; no dissent is heard on the death tape. By this point, armed guards had taken up positions surrounding the pavilion. Directly after this, Jones stated that &quot;the Red Brigade&#x27;s the only one that made any sense anyway,&quot; and, &quot;the Red Brigade showed them justice.&quot; In addition to McElvane, several other Temple members gave speeches praising Jones and his decision for the community to commit suicide, even after Jones stopped appreciating this praise and begged for the process to go faster.

According to escaped Temple member Odell Rhodes, the first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old infant. A syringe without a needle fitted was used to squirt poison into the infant&#x27;s mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Stanley Clayton also witnessed mothers with their babies first approach the tub containing the poison. Clayton said that Jones approached people to encourage them to drink the poison and that, after adults saw the poison begin to take effect, &quot;they showed a reluctance to die.&quot;

The poison caused death within five minutes for children, less for babies and an estimated twenty to thirty minutes for adults. After consuming the poison, according to Rhodes, people were then escorted away down a wooden walkway leading outside the pavilion. It is not clear if some initially thought the exercise was another White Night rehearsal. Rhodes reported being in close contact with dying children.

In response to reactions of seeing the poison take effect on others, Jones counseled, &quot;Die with a degree of dignity. Lay down your life with dignity; don&#x27;t lay down with tears and agony.&quot; He also said,

I tell you, I don&#x27;t care how many screams you hear, I don&#x27;t care how many anguished cries ... death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of youif you knew what was ahead of you, you&#x27;d be glad to be stepping over tonight.

Rhodes described a scene of both hysteria and confusion as parents watched their children die from the poison. He also stated that most present &quot;quietly waited their own turn to die&quot; and that many of the assembled Temple members &quot;walked around like they were in a trance.&quot; Survivor Tim Carter later suggested that, like a previous practice, that day&#x27;s lunch of grilled cheese sandwiches may have been tainted with sedatives. The crowd was surrounded by armed guards, offering members the basic dilemma of death by poison or death by a guard&#x27;s hand. Cries and screams of children and adults are audibly heard on the death tape. As more Temple members died, eventually the guards themselves were called in to die by poison.

Jones was found dead lying next to his chair in the pavilion between two other bodies, his head cushioned by a pillow. His death was caused by a gunshot wound to his left temple that Guyanese Chief Medical Examiner Leslie Mootoo stated was consistent with being self-inflicted.

===Survivors and eyewitnesses===
Three high-ranking Temple survivors claimed they were given an assignment and thereby escaped death. Carter and his brother Mike, aged 30 and 20 respectively, and Mike Prokes, aged 31, were given luggage containing $550,000 in U.S. currency, $130,000 in Guyanese currency and an envelope, which they were told to deliver to the Soviet embassy in Georgetown. The envelope contained two passports and three instructional letters, the first of which was to Timofeyev, stating:

The letters included listed accounts with balances totaling in excess of $7.3 million to be transferred to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Prokes and the Carter brothers soon ditched most of the money and were apprehended heading for a Temple boat at Port Kaituma. It is unknown how they reached Georgetown, away, since the boat had been sent away earlier that day. The brothers were given the task before the suicides began, and soon abandoned it when they realized what was about to happen; Tim Carter desperately tried to search for his wife and son, discovering his son in time to witness him being poisoned, and his wife killing herself in despair. At this point, Carter had a nervous breakdown and was pulled away from the village by his equally distraught brother.

Jones&#x27; sons, Stephan, Jim Jr. and Tim, were in Georgetown with Jonestown&#x27;s basketball team to play in a tournament with the Guyanese national team. In the moments before the suicide, Jones contacted Stephan with orders to &quot;get revenge&quot; on enemies of the Temple in Georgetown before committing suicide themselves. Stephan not only refused to do so but then contacted the Temple&#x27;s headquarters in San Francisco and told them not to do anything without his permission.

Just before the start of the final meeting in the pavilion, Garry and Lane were told that the community was angry with them and were escorted to a house used to accommodate visitors. According to them, they talked their way past two armed guards and made it to the jungle, before eventually arriving in Port Kaituma. While in the jungle near the settlement, they heard gunshots. This observation concurs with the testimony of Clayton, who, having previously fled into the jungle, heard the same sounds as he was sneaking back into Jonestown to retrieve his passport. Rhodes volunteered to fetch a stethoscope and hid under a building.

Two more people who were intended to be poisoned managed to survive. Grover Davis, aged 79, who was hard-of-hearing, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, laid down in a ditch and pretended to be dead. Hyacinth Thrash, aged 76, realized what was happening and crawled under her bed, only to walk out after the poisonings were completed.

===Medical examinations===
The only medical doctor to initially examine the scene at Jonestown was Mootoo, who visually examined over 200 bodies and later told a Guyanese coroner&#x27;s jury of having seen needle marks on at least seventy. However, no determination was made as to whether those injections initiated the introduction of poison or whether they were so-called &quot;relief&quot; injections to quicken death and reduce suffering from convulsions from those who had previously taken poison orally. Mootoo and U.S. pathologist Lynn Crook determined that cyanide was present in some bodies, while analysis of the contents of the vat revealed several tranquilizers as well as potassium cyanide and potassium chloride.

Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Mootoo concluded that a gunshot wound to Annie Moore could not have been self-inflicted, though Moore had also ingested a lethal dose of cyanide.

Guyanese authorities waived their requirement for autopsies in the case of unnatural death. Doctors in the U.S. performed autopsies on only seven bodies, including those of Jones, Moore, Schacht and Carolyn Layton. Moore and Layton were selected among those autopsied, in part, because of the urging of the Moore family, including Rebecca Moore, the sister of the two victims, who was not a Temple member herself.

===Notes from deceased residents===

Found near Marceline Jones&#x27; body was a typewritten note, dated November 18, 1978, signed by Marceline and witnessed by Moore and Maria Katsaris, stating:

Moore also left a note, which in part stated: &quot;I am at a point right now so embittered against the world that I don&#x27;t know why I am writing this. Someone who finds it will believe I am crazy or believe in the barbed wire that does NOT exist in Jonestown.&quot; The last line, &quot;We died because you would not let us live in peace,&quot; is written in different color ink. No other specific reference is made to the events of the day. Moore also wrote, &quot;JONESTOWNthe most peaceful, loving community that ever existed.&quot;

In addition, she stated, &quot;JIM JONESthe one who made this paradise possiblemuch to the contrary of the lies stated about Jim Jones being a power-hungry sadistic, mean person who thought he was Godof all things.&quot; And &quot;His hatred of racism, sexism, elitism, and mainly classism, is what prompted him to make a new world for the peoplea paradise in the jungle. The children loved it. So did everyone else.&quot;

Found near Carolyn Layton&#x27;s body was a handwritten note signed by Layton, witnessed by Katsaris and Moore, dated November 18, 1978, stating, &quot;This is my last will and testament. I hereby leave all assets in any bank account to which I am a signatory to the Communist Party of the USSR.&quot;

==Deaths in Georgetown==
In the early evening of November 18, at the Temple&#x27;s headquarters in Georgetown, Temple member Sharon Amos received a radio communication from Jonestown instructing the members in Georgetown to take revenge on the Temple&#x27;s enemies and then commit revolutionary suicide. Later, after police arrived at the Georgetown premises, Amos escorted her children, Liane (21), Christa (11) and Martin (10), into a bathroom. Wielding a kitchen knife, Amos first killed Christa and then Martin. Then Liane assisted Amos in cutting her own throat, after which Liane killed herself. Jones&#x27; sons Stephan, Tim and Jim Jr. later found the bodies.

==Aftermath==

At Port Kaituma, Reiterman photographed the aftermath of the airstrip shootings. Dwyer assumed leadership at the scene and, at his recommendation, Larry Layton was arrested by Guyanese police. Dwyer had been grazed by a bullet in his buttock during the shootings. It took several hours before the eleven wounded and others in their party gathered themselves together. Most of them spent the night in the Port Kaituma café. The more seriously wounded slept in a small tent at the airstrip. A Guyanese government plane arrived the following morning to evacuate the wounded.

Five teenage members of the Parks and Bogue families, with one boyfriend, followed the instructions of defector Gerald Parks to hide in the adjacent jungle until help arrived and their safety was assured. Thereafter, that group was lost for three days in the jungle and nearly died. One of them, Thom Bogue, had been wounded in the leg. Guyanese soldiers eventually rescued them.

After escaping Jonestown, Rhodes arrived in Port Kaituma on the night of November 18. That night, Clayton stayed with a local Guyanese family and travelled to Port Kaituma the next morning. Prokes and the Carter brothers were put into protective custody in Port Kaituma; they were later released in Georgetown. Rhodes, Clayton, Garry and Lane were also brought to Georgetown. Prokes died by suicide on March 14, 1979, during a press conference, four months after the Jonestown incident.

914 of the 918 dead, including Jones himself, were collected by the U.S. military in Guyana, then transported by military cargo plane to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, a location that had been used previously for mass processing of the dead from the Tenerife airport disaster. The last shipment of bodies arrived early on the morning of November 27. The base&#x27;s mortuary was tasked with fingerprinting, identifying and processing the bodies. The base&#x27;s resources were overwhelmed, and numerous individuals tasked with moving or identifying the bodies suffered symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. In many cases, responsibility for cremation of the remains was distributed to Dover area funeral homes.

In August 2014, the never-claimed cremated remains of nine people from Jonestown were found in a former funeral home in Dover. As of September 2014, four of their remains had been returned to next-of-kin, and the remaining five had not. Those five were publicly identified in the hope that family would claim their remains; all five remain unclaimed by family and have been interred at the Jonestown Memorial at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California, along with the remains of approximately half of those who perished on November 18, 1978.

Larry Layton, who had fired a gun at several people aboard the Cessna, was initially found not guilty of attempted murder in a Guyanese court, employing the defense that he was &quot;brainwashed.&quot; Acquittal in a Guyanese court did not free Layton, however, who was promptly deported back to the U.S. and arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service upon arrival in San Francisco. Layton could not be tried in the U.S. for the attempted murders of Gosney, Bagby, Dale Parks and the Cessna pilot on Guyanese soil and was, instead, tried under a federal statute against assassinating members of Congress and internationally protected people (Ryan and Dwyer). He was convicted of conspiracy and of aiding and abetting the murder of Ryan and of the attempted murder of Dwyer. Paroled in 2002, Layton is the only person ever to have been held criminally responsible for the events at Jonestown.

The events at Jonestown were covered heavily by the media, and photographs pertaining to it adorned newspaper and magazine covers for months after its occurrence. The Peoples Temple was labeled a &quot;cult of death&quot; by both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines. In February 1979, 98% of Americans polled said that they had heard of the tragedy. George Gallup stated that &quot;few events, in fact, in the entire history of the Gallup Poll have been known to such a high percentage of the U.S. public.&quot;

After the deaths, both the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the State Department itself criticized the latter&#x27;s handling of the Temple. Guyanese political opposition seized the opportunity to embarrass Burnham by establishing an inquest which concluded that the prime minister was responsible for the deaths at Jonestown.

The Cult Awareness Network (CAN), a group aimed at deprogramming members of cults, was formed soon after the deaths at Jonestown. The group, which included Ryan&#x27;s daughter Patricia, was involved in various personal, social and legal battles with a range of religious organizations, from The Family International and Scientology to David Koresh&#x27;s Branch Davidians, where they were found to be influential on law enforcement&#x27;s concerns for children in the eventual Waco siege in 1993. After a slew of legal and fiscal issues, CAN went bankrupt in 1996.

In late February 1980, Al and Jeannie Mills (co-founders of the Concerned Relatives) and their daughter Daphene were shot and killed execution style in their Berkeley, California, home. Eddie Mills, their son, was believed to be involved to the extent that he was arrested in 2005, but charges were not filed against him. The case has not been solved. In 1984, former Temple member Tyrone Mitchell, who had lost both of his parents and five siblings at Jonestown, fired upon students at a Los Angeles elementary school from his second-story window, killing two people and injuring twelve; Mitchell then turned his weapon on himself and committed suicide.

The sheer scale of the event, as well as Jones&#x27; socialism, purported inconsistencies in the reported number of deaths, allegedly poor explanation of events related to said deaths and existence of classified documents led some conspiracy theorists to suggest CIA involvement. including a Soviet-published book a decade later. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigated the event and announced that there was no evidence of CIA involvement at Jonestown. Others suggested KGB involvement, beyond the attested visits of Soviet diplomatic personnel to Jonestown and the overtures made by Jim Jones to the USSR.

The bodies of over 400 of those who died are buried in a mass grave at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California. In 2011, a memorial to them was erected at the cemetery.

Although Jones used poisoned Flavor Aid, the drink mix was also commonly (mistakenly) referred to as Kool-Aid. This has led to the phrase &quot;drinking the Kool-Aid&quot;, referring to a person or group holding an unquestioned belief, argument, or philosophy without critical examination.

===Conspiracy theories===
According to religious studies scholar Rebecca Moore, &quot;In the twenty-three years since the deaths in Jonestown, conspiracy theories have blossomed in number and sophistication.&quot;

In 1979, Joseph Hollinger, a former aide to Ryan, claimed that Jonestown was a &quot;mass mind control experiment&quot; conducted by the CIA. A 1980 newspaper column by Jack Anderson also claimed that the CIA was involved in the massacre, and speculated that Dwyer had ties to the agency. In 1980, an investigation by the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence found no evidence of CIA activity in Jonestown.

In 1987, &quot;The Jonestown Carnage: A CIA Crime (1978)&quot; (Russian: &quot;Гибель Джонстауна - преступление ЦРУ&quot;) was published in the Soviet Union, claiming that group members were assassinated by CIA agents and mercenaries to prevent further political emigration from the U.S. as well as suppress opposition to the U.S. regime. Political scientist Janos Radvanyi cites the book as an example of Soviet active measures during the 1980s that &quot;spread both disinformation stories and enemy propaganda against the United States,&quot; adding, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine that anyone could believe so ridiculous a story.&quot;

==Former site==
Now deserted, the compound at Jonestown was initially tended by the Guyanese government following the deaths. The government then allowed its re-occupation by Hmong refugees from Laos for a few years in the early 1980s. The buildings and grounds were looted by local Guyanese but were not taken over because of their association with the mass killing. The buildings were mostly destroyed by a fire in the mid-1980s, after which the ruins were left to decay and be reclaimed by the jungle.

During a visit to tape a segment for the ABC news show &quot;20/20&quot; in 1998, Jim Jones Jr. discovered the rusting remains of an oil drum near the former entrance to the pavilion. Jones recognized the drum, originally adapted for use during meal times, as the drum used for drink mixtures during the White Night exercises, and which he believed was used to hold the beverage mix of poison and grape-flavored punch during the massacre.

In 2003, with the help of Gerry Gouveia, a pilot involved with the Jonestown cleanup, a television crew recording a special for the 25th anniversary of the event returned to the site to uncover any remaining artifacts. Although the site was covered with dense vegetation, the team uncovered a standing cassava mill (possibly the largest remaining structure), the remains of a tractor (speculated to be the same tractor used by the airstrip shooters), a generator, a filing cabinet, a truck near the site of Jones&#x27; house, a fuel pump, and other smaller miscellaneous items. Gouveia also led the team to the former site of the pavilion, where they found the remains of a steel drum, an organ, and a bed of daisies growing where the bodies once lay.

In December 2024, it was announced that there were plans to open the old site as a tourist attraction, with the first tourists scheduled to arrive in January 2025, paying $650 per person. The scheme is supported by the Guyanese government. The move to open the Jonestown site for tourism was opposed by several Guyanese figures, including University of Guyana lecturer Neville Bissember and former spokesperson of the Government of Guyana during the Jonestown massacre Kit Nascimento.
