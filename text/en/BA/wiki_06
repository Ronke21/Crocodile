<text>James Robert Hope-Scott (15 July 1812 – 29 April 1873) was a British barrister and Tractarian.

==Early life and conversion==
Born at Great Marlow, in the county of Buckinghamshire, and christened James Robert, Hope was the third son of General Sir Alexander Hope and his wife Georgina Alicia (&quot;d&quot;. 1855), third and youngest daughter of George Brown of Ellerton, Roxburghshire. He was a grandson of John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun. After a childhood spent at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, of which his father was Governor, he was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a contemporary and friend of William Ewart Gladstone and John Henry Newman. In 1838 Hope was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. Between 1840 and 1843 he helped to found Trinity College, Glenalmond, now renamed Glenalmond College. In 1840–1841 he spent some eight months in Italy, Rome included, in company with his close friend Edward Badeley.

On his return he became, with Newman, one of the foremost promoters of the Tractarian movement at Oxford and was entirely in Newman&#x27;s confidence. In 1841, he published an attack on the Anglican-German Bishopric in Jerusalem, and further defended the &quot;value of the science of canon law, in a pamphlet. Edward Bouverie Pusey also valued Hope&#x27;s advice and canvassed him in 1842 before publishing the &quot;Letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury on some Circumstances connected with the Present Crisis in the Church&quot;. Hope supported publication.

Along with other Anglo-Catholics, Hope was disturbed by the Gorham judgment, and on 12 March 1850 a meeting was held at his house in Curzon Street, London, which was attended by fourteen leading Tractarians, including Badeley, Henry Edward Manning, and Archdeacon Robert Isaac Wilberforce. They eventually published a series of resolutions which started the process of distancing Hope, Badeley, Manning and Wilberforce from the Anglican Church.

In 1851, Hope was received with Manning into the Roman Catholic Church.

==Legal practice==
On 15 June 1841, Hope wrote to Gladstone:
Ormsby believed that Hope found some distraction from his frustration with the Anglican Church through his secular work.

By 1839, Hope was becoming involved in parliamentary work. He was retained as counsel for the British government on the Foreign Marriages Bill and in 1843, the report on the Consular Jurisdiction Bill. His brother&#x27;s appointment as Under Secretary of State for the Colonies in Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s administration may have opened some doors. In 1843-44 he was engaged again by the government in the matter of the aftermath of the Pastry War, whose settlement Britain had arbitrated, to prepare a report on some points in dispute between France and Mexico.

As an established ecclesiastical lawyer, he was much involved in the Ecclesiastical Courts Bill in 1843 and the same year he took the DCL degree at Oxford. In 1844 an English Criminal Code was under serious consideration and Bishop of London Charles James Blomfield recommended Hope to the Lord Chancellor John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst as a commissioner to consider offences
against religion and the Church. By the end of 1845 he stood at the head of the parliamentary bar but his objections to taking the Oath of Supremacy deterred him from accepting the professional honour of Queen&#x27;s Counsel. In 1849, he therefore asked Lord Chancellor Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham for, and was granted, a patent of precedence conferring equal status.

In 1852 he gave Newman the disastrously misleading legal advice that he was unlikely to be sued for libel by Giacinto Achilli, advice which ultimately led to Newman&#x27;s criminal conviction for defamatory libel. Thereafter, Newman relied on Badeley for legal advice, though in 1855 Hope-Scott conducted the negotiations which ended in Newman&#x27;s accepting the rectorship of the Catholic University of Ireland.

==Personal and family life==
# In 1847, James Hope married firstly to Charlotte Harriet Jane Lockhart, daughter of John Gibson Lockhart and granddaughter of Sir Walter Scott. Six years after their marriage Charlotte came into possession of Scott&#x27;s Abbotsford House estate, and Hope then assumed the surname of Hope-Scott. His wife died on 26 October 1858. 
## Mary Monica (born 2 October 1852) m. Joseph Constable Maxwell, third son of William, Lord Herries
# In 1861, he married secondly to Lady Victoria Alexandrina Fitzalan-Howard, a daughter of the 14th Duke of Norfolk. 
## James Fitzalan Hope (1870–1949), who was created Baron Rankeillour 
## Josephine Ward, novelist 
## Minna Margaret m. diplomat Sir Nicolas Roderick O&#x27;Conor

Hope-Scott retired from the bar in 1870 and spent the rest of his life in charitable and literary work, in particular in making an abridgement of his father-in-law&#x27;s seven-volume biography of Scott, with a preface dedicated to Gladstone. Hope-Scott maintained a lifelong correspondence with Badeley.

Both his wives died in childbirth. The only child by his first marriage to survive to adulthood, Mary Monica (born 2 October 1852), married Joseph Constable Maxwell, third son of William, Lord Herries. (James and Charlotte Hope&#x27;s two other children died in infancy.) By his second marriage, he left a son, James Fitzalan Hope (1870–1949), who was created Baron Rankeillour, and three daughters, one of whom was the novelist Josephine Ward and another of whom married the diplomat Sir Nicolas Roderick O&#x27;Conor. (Two other children from the second marriage died young.)

<text>Christopher Wordsworth (30 October 180720 March 1885) was an English intellectual and a bishop of the Church of England.

==Life==

Wordsworth was born in London, the youngest son of Christopher Wordsworth, Master of Trinity, who was the youngest brother of the poet William Wordsworth. Thus, Wordsworth was a nephew of the celebrated poet.

Wordsworth was the younger brother of the classical scholar John Wordsworth and Charles Wordsworth, Bishop of Saint Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane. He was educated at Winchester and Trinity, Cambridge. Like his brother Charles, he was distinguished as an athlete as well as for scholarship. He won the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal for poetry in 1827 and 1828.

He became senior classic, and was elected a fellow and tutor of Trinity in 1830; shortly afterwards he took holy orders. He went for a tour in Greece in 1832–1833, and published various works on its topography and archaeology, the most famous of which is &quot;Wordsworth&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Greece&quot; (1839). In 1836 he became Public Orator at Cambridge, and in the same year was appointed Headmaster of Harrow, a post he resigned in 1844. In 1844 Sir Robert Peel appointed him as a Canon of Westminster (1844–1869). He was Vicar of Stanford in the Vale, Berkshire (1850–1869) and Archdeacon of Westminster (1864–1869). In 1869 Benjamin Disraeli appointed him Bishop of Lincoln which he retained until his death in 1885. His election to the See of Lincoln was confirmed at St Mary-le-Bow on 22 February 1869 (whereby he legally became Bishop of Lincoln) and he was ordained and consecrated a bishop at Westminster Abbey on 24 February by Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury; George Selwyn, Bishop of New Zealand; and six other prelates.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, he was a man of fine character, with a high ideal of ecclesiastical duty, and he spent his money generously on church objects.

He is buried near the Shrine of St Hugh in Lincoln Cathedral.

==Works==

As a scholar he is best known for his edition of the &quot;Greek New Testament&quot; (1856–1860), and the &quot;Old Testament&quot; (1864–1870), with commentaries; but his writings were many in number, and included a volume of devotional verse, &quot;The Holy Year&quot; (1862), &quot;Church History up to A.D. 451&quot; (1881–1883), and &quot;Memoirs&quot; of his uncle, William Wordsworth (1851), to whom he was literary executor. His &quot;Inscriptiones Pompeianae&quot; (1837) was an important contribution to epigraphy. He also wrote several hymns (Hymns Ancient and Modern New Standard contains seven) of which perhaps the best known is the Easter hymn &#x27;Alleluia, Alleluia, hearts to heaven and voices raise&#x27;. His daughter Elizabeth Wordsworth worked as his research assistant for his publications and as his secretary, before becoming founding Principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.

With William Cooke, a Canon of Chester, Wordsworth edited for the Henry Bradshaw Society the early 15th-century &quot;Ordinale Sarum&quot; of Clement Maydeston, but the work did not appear in print until 1901, several years after the death of both editors.

==Family==

In 1838 Wordsworth married Susanna Hartley Frere (d. 1884) and they had seven children. The elder son, John (1843–1911), was Bishop of Salisbury, founder of Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School, Salisbury, and author of &quot;Fragments of Early Latin&quot; (1874); their eldest daughter, Dame Elizabeth (1840–1932), was the first principal (in 1879) of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and the founder (in 1886) of St Hugh&#x27;s College. His daughter Dora married Edward Tucker Leeke, Canon and sub-dean of Lincoln Cathedral. His younger son Christopher (1848–1938) was a noted liturgical scholar.

His &quot;Life&quot;, by J. H. Overton and Elizabeth Wordsworth, was published in 1888.

<text>Joseph Hubert Reinkens (March 1, 1821 – January 4, 1896) was the first German Old Catholic bishop.

==Biography==
He was born at Burtscheid (now part of Aachen) in the Rhine Province, the son of a gardener. In 1836, on the death of his mother, he took to manual work in order to support his numerous brothers and sisters, but in 1840 he was able to go to the gymnasium at Aachen, and he afterwards studied theology at the universities of Bonn and Munich. He was ordained priest in 1848, and in 1849 graduated as doctor in theology. He was soon appointed professor of ecclesiastical history at Breslau, and in 1865 he was made rector of the university. During this period he wrote, among other treatises, monographs on Clement of Alexandria, Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours.

In consequence of an essay on art, especially in tragedy, after Aristotle, he was made a doctor of philosophy in the university of Leipzig. When, in 1870, the question of papal infallibility was raised, Reinkens attached himself to the party opposed to the proclamation of the dogma. He wrote several pamphlets on church tradition relative to infallibility and on the procedure of the Council. When the dogma of infallibility was proclaimed, Reinkens joined the band of influential theologians, headed by Ignaz von Döllinger, who resolved to organize resistance to the decree. He was one of those who signed the Declaration of Nuremberg in 1871, and at the Bonn conferences with Orientals and Anglicans in 1874 and 1875 he was conspicuous.

The Old Catholics having decided to separate themselves from the Church of Rome, Reinkens was chosen their bishop in Germany at an enthusiastic meeting at Cologne in 1873. In August of that year he was consecrated by Johannes Heykamp, bishop of Deventer. Reinkens devoted himself zealously to his office, and it was due to his efforts that the Old Catholic movement crystallized into an organized church, with a definite status in the various German states. He wrote a number of theological works after his consecration, but none of them so important as his treatise on &quot;Cyprian and the Unity of the Church&quot; (1873).

The chief act of his episcopal career was his consecration in 1876 of Dr Eduard Herzog to preside as bishop over the Old Catholic Church in Switzerland. In 1881 Reinkens visited England, and received Holy Communion more than once with bishops, clergy and laity of the Church of England, and in 1894 he defended the validity of Anglican orders against his co-religionists, the Old Catholics of the Netherlands who later recognised the orders. He died at Bonn on 4 January 1896.

<text>Johann Friedrich (5 May 1836 – 19 August 1917) was a German theologian. He was prominent as a leader of the Old Catholics.

==Biography==
He was born at Poxdorf in Upper Franconia, and was educated at Bamberg and at the University of Munich. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1859. In 1865, he was appointed extraordinary professor of theology. In 1867, he was appointed to the Academy of Sciences. He was a pupil of Ignaz von Döllinger.

In 1869 he went to the Vatican Council as secretary to Cardinal Hohenlohe, and took an active part in opposing the dogma of papal infallibility, notably by supplying the opposition bishops with historical and theological material. He left Rome before the council closed. 
:&quot;No German ecclesiastic of his age appears to have won for himself so unusual a repute as a theologian and to have held so important a position, as the trusted counsellor of the leading German cardinal at the Vatican Council. The path was fairly open before him to the highest advancement in the Church of Rome, yet he deliberately sacrificed all such hopes and placed himself in the van of a hard and doubtful struggle&quot; (&quot;The Guardian&quot;, 1872, p. 1004).

A sentence of excommunication was passed on Friedrich in April 1871, but he refused to acknowledge it and was upheld by the Bavarian government. He continued to perform ecclesiastical functions and maintained his academic position, becoming an ordinary professor in 1872. In 1874, he inaugurated the Old Catholic theological faculty at the University of Bern and lectured there for a year. In Bavaria, in 1882, the Minister of Public Worship, yielding to ultramontane pressure, transferred him from his chair in theology to the philosophical faculty as professor of history. By this time he had to some extent withdrawn from the advanced position which he at first occupied in organizing the Old Catholic Church, for he was not in agreement with its abolition of enforced celibacy. He died in Munich.

==Works==
Friedrich was a prolific writer; among his chief works are:
*, 1862 (&quot;Wessel Gansfort; a portrait of church history in the 15th century&quot;)
*, 1862 (&quot;The teachings of John Hus&quot;)
*, 2 volumes, 1867–69 (&quot;German church history&quot;)
*, 1871 (&quot;Journal of the Vatican Council&quot;)
*, 1871
*, 1876 (&quot;Contribution to church history of the 18th century&quot;)
*, 1876 (&quot;The mechanism of the Vatican religion&quot;)
*, 2 volumes, 1877–86 (&quot;History of the Vatican Council&quot;)
*, 1892 (&quot;The papacy&quot;)
*, 1894 (&quot;On Johann Adam Möhler&quot;)
*, 3 volumes, 1899–1901 (&quot;Ignaz von Dollinger; his life on the basis of his literary estate&quot;)

<text>A memory card is an electronic data storage device used for storing digital information, typically using flash memory. These are commonly used in digital portable electronic devices, such as digital cameras as well as in many early games consoles such as the Nintendo Wii. They allow adding memory to such devices using a card in a socket instead of protruding USB flash drives.

Common types of flash memory card include SD cards (including microSD), Sony&#x27;s Memory Stick and CompactFlash. , SD cards are the most common type of memory cards.

== History ==
The basis for memory card technology is flash memory. It was invented by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba in 1980 and commercialized by Toshiba in 1987.

The development of memory cards was driven in the 1980s by the need for an alternative to floppy disk drives that had lower power consumption, had less weight and occupied less volume in laptops. Some were also marketed as a lower cost alternative to ROM cartridges. Several competing and incompatible memory card formats were developed by several vendors, such as for example the Bee Card, Astron SoftCards, Sega Cards, NEC UltraLite memory cards, and the Mitsubishi Melcard which came in variants using 60 and 50 connector pins. The Sega Card was developed as a cheaper alternative to game cartridges. Some memory cards were used for memory expansion in laptops.

JEIDA, the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association, began to work on a standard for memory cards in 1985, and developed the JEIDA memory card in 1986.
The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) was an industry association created in 1989 to promote a standard for memory cards in PCs, and worked closely with JEIDA, adopting their 68 pin connector design. The specification for PCMCIA type I cards, later renamed PC Cards, was first released in 1990, and unified the JEIDA memory card standard with the PC Card standard. This format later included support for other devices besides memory cards. PC Card was among the first commercial memory card formats to come out, but is mainly used in industrial applications and to connect I/O devices such as modems.

Some early memory cards used SRAM as a storage medium, which required a lithium battery to keep the contents in the SRAM. These cards were faster than their flash counterparts. Some of the first PCMCIA cards had capacities of 1 to 5 MB and cost US$100 per MB. Other early cards such as the Bee Card contained non-modifiable ROM, Write once read many EPROM or rewriteable EEPROM memory. In 1992, SanDisk introduced FlashDisk, a PCMCIA card and one of the first memory cards that did not require battery power to retain its contents, as it used flash memory.

In 1994, memory card formats smaller than the PC Card arrived. The first one was CompactFlash and later SmartMedia and Miniature Card. The desire for smaller cards for cell-phones, PDAs, and compact digital cameras drove a trend that left the previous generation of &quot;compact&quot; cards looking big. In 2000 the SD card was announced. SD was envisioned as a single memory card format for several kinds of electronic devices, that could also function as an expansion slot for adding new capabilities for a device. In 2001, SmartMedia alone captured 50% of the digital camera market and CF had captured the professional digital camera market.

However, by 2005, SD and similar MMC cards had nearly taken over SmartMedia&#x27;s spot, though not to the same level and with stiff competition coming from Memory Stick variants, as well as CompactFlash. In industrial and embedded fields, even the venerable PC card (PCMCIA) memory cards still manage to maintain a niche, while in mobile phones and PDAs, the memory card has become smaller.

Initially memory cards were expensive, costing US$3 per megabyte of capacity in 2001; this led to the development of miniaturized rotating disk memory devices such as the Microdrive, PocketZip and Dataplay. The Microdrive had higher capacities than memory cards at the time. All three concepts became obsolete once flash memory prices became lower and their capacities became higher by 2006.

New products of Sony (previously only using Memory Stick) and Olympus (previously only using XD-Card) have been offered with an additional SD-Card slot beginning in 2010. Effectively the format war has turned in SD-Card&#x27;s favor.

=== Comparison ===
== Video game consoles ==
Many older video game consoles used memory cards to hold saved game data. Cartridge-based systems primarily used battery-backed volatile RAM within each individual cartridge to hold saves for that game. Cartridges without this RAM may have used a password system, or would not save progress at all. The Neo Geo AES, released in 1990 by SNK, was the first video game console able to use a memory card. AES memory cards were also compatible with Neo Geo MVS arcade cabinets, allowing players to migrate saves between home and arcade systems and vice versa. Memory cards became commonplace when home consoles moved to read-only optical discs for storing the game program, beginning with systems such as the TurboGrafx-CD and Sega-CD.

Until the sixth generation of video game consoles, memory cards were based on proprietary formats; Later systems used established industry formats for memory cards, such as FAT32.

Home consoles commonly use hard disk drive storage for saved games and allow the use of USB flash drives or other card formats via a memory card reader to transport game saves and other game information. Though some consoles have implemented cloud storage saving, most portable gaming systems still rely on custom memory cartridges to store program data, due to their low power consumption, smaller physical size and reduced mechanical complexity.

<text>Macaulay Macaulay Culkin Culkin (born Macaulay Carson Culkin; ) is an American actor and musician. Considered one of the most successful child actors of the 1990s, Culkin has received a Golden Globe Award nomination and other accolades. In 2005, he was ranked second on VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Kid-Stars&quot;. In 2023, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 

Culkin earned recognition for playing Kevin McCallister in the Christmas comedy &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), and reprised the role in &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992). He furthered his success with the coming-of-age film &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991), the psychological thriller film &quot;The Good Son&quot; (1993), and the comedy films &quot;Getting Even with Dad&quot; and &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (both 1994). He took a hiatus starting in 1995, and returned to acting with the biographical drama film &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003). Culkin appeared in the independent films &quot;Saved!&quot; (2004) and &quot;Sex and Breakfast&quot; (2007), and two projects by Adam Green: &quot;The Wrong Ferarri&quot; (2011) and &quot;Adam Green&#x27;s Aladdin&quot; (2016). He starred in the comedy film &quot;Changeland&quot; (2019) and the tenth season of the anthology series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (2021), and had a voice role in Kid Cudi&#x27;s television special &quot;Entergalactic&quot; (2022).

Culkin wrote the autobiography &quot;Junior&quot; (2006), which describes his experiences with stardom and relationship with his father. From 2013 to 2016, he was a member of the comedy rock band the Pizza Underground, serving as the lead vocalist. In 2018, Culkin became the publisher and CEO of Bunny Ears, a satirical popular culture website and podcast.

==Early life==
Macaulay Carson Culkin was born on August 26, 1980, in the Manhattan borough of New York City. He was named after British historian Thomas Babington Macaulay. Culkin was the third of seven children born to Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Culkin, a former stage actor, and Patricia Brentrup, a native of North Dakota. The couple met in 1974 while Brentrup was working as a road traffic controller in Sundance, Wyoming. Culkin&#x27;s six siblings include Shane ( 1976), Dakota (1979–2008), Kieran ( 1982), Quinn ( 1984), Christian ( 1987), and Rory ( 1989). He also had a paternal half-sister, Jennifer Adamson (1970–2000). His paternal aunt is actress Bonnie Bedelia. Culkin has German, Irish, and Norwegian ancestry.

During Culkin&#x27;s early childhood, the family lived together in a small apartment in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, and struggled financially. His mother worked as a telephone operator and his father was a sacristan at a local Catholic church. Culkin was raised Roman Catholic and attended St. Joseph&#x27;s School of Yorkville for five years before transferring to the Professional Children&#x27;s School.

Culkin said his father, Kit Culkin, was cruel and violent in his childhood. He said he felt his father was jealous, because &quot;everything [Kit] tried to do in his life [Macaulay] excelled at before [he] was 10 years old&quot;. Culkin&#x27;s parents never married; they split when Culkin was in his teens, and his mother filed for custody. Culkin took his parents to court to block them from controlling his trust fund, which was reportedly worth between $15 and 20 million. He has been estranged from his father since. The media reported that Culkin had divorced or emancipated himself from his parents; in 2018, Culkin denied this, saying he had instead removed his parents&#x27; name from his trust fund and found an executor.

==Career==
===1980s: Early work===
Culkin began acting at age four. His early roles included a stage production of &quot;Bach Babies&quot; at the New York Philharmonic. He continued appearing in roles on stage, television and films throughout the 1980s. He made an appearance in the TV movie &quot;The Midnight Hour&quot; (1985). In 1988, he appeared in an episode of the popular action television series &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, in which he played a kidnapping victim, Paul Gephardt.

Culkin made his film debut as Cy Blue Black in the drama &quot;Rocket Gibraltar&quot; (1988). He played the role of Billy Livingstone in the romantic comedy film &quot;See You in the Morning&quot; (1989), starring Jeff Bridges, Alice Krige, Farrah Fawcett and Drew Barrymore. He starred as Miles Russell alongside actor John Candy in the comedy film &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989).

===1990s: Breakthrough===

Culkin rose to fame with his lead role of Kevin McCallister in the blockbuster comedy film &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990). The film reunited him with &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; writer and director John Hughes and &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; co-star John Candy, who played the role of Polka band member Gus Polinski. For his performance, Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won an American Comedy Award and a Young Artist Award. In a 2022 interview with &quot;People&quot;, co-star Joe Pesci said Culkin was &quot;a really sweet kid and, even at his age, very professional&quot;.

In 1991, Culkin starred in an animated Saturday morning cartoon television series titled &quot;Wish Kid&quot;, hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and starred in Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Black or White&quot; music video. He starred as Thomas J. Sennett in the film &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991), for which he was nominated for Best On-Screen Duo and won Best Kiss at the MTV Movie Awards, with Anna Chlumsky.

Culkin was paid $4.5 million (compared to $110,000 for the original) for &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992). He played the role of Henry in the drama thriller film &quot;The Good Son&quot; (1993), which only did reasonably well, although he was nominated for an MTV Movie Award in the category for Best Villain for his performance. He was also a student at the School of American Ballet and appeared in a filmed version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; as the title role in 1993, which was staged by Peter Martins from the 1954 George Balanchine New York City Ballet version of the work. In 1994, Culkin appeared in three films: &quot;Getting Even with Dad&quot; (1994), &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; (1994) and &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (1994).

Culkin established himself as one of the most successful child actors of the 1990s. He grew tired of acting and retired after &quot;Richie Rich.&quot; Wanting a &quot;normal life&quot;, he went to a private high school in Manhattan. In 1998, he appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Sunday&quot; by the rock band Sonic Youth.

===2000s: Guest roles and independent films===
In 2000, Culkin returned to acting with a role in the play &quot;Madame Melville&quot;, which was staged in London&#x27;s West End. In early 2003, he made a guest appearance on the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. His role as Karen Walker&#x27;s deceptively immature divorce lawyer won him favorable reviews. Culkin headed back into motion pictures in 2003 with &quot;Party Monster&quot;, in which he played a role very different from those he was known for, that of party promoter Michael Alig, a drug user and murderer. He quickly followed that with a supporting part in &quot;Saved!&quot;, as a cynical wheelchair-using, non-Christian student in a conservative Christian high school. Though &quot;Saved!&quot; only had modest success at the box office, Culkin received positive reviews for his role in the film and its implications for a career as an adult actor. Culkin began doing voice-over work, with appearances in Seth Green&#x27;s &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. In 2005, he was ranked second on VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Kid-Stars&quot; behind Gary Coleman.

In 2006, he published an experimental, semi-autobiographical novel titled &quot;Junior&quot;, which talked about Culkin&#x27;s stardom and his shaky relationship with his father. He starred in &quot;Sex and Breakfast&quot;, a dark comedy written and directed by Miles Brandman. Alexis Dziena, Kuno Becker and Eliza Dushku also star in this story of a couple whose therapist recommends they engage in group sex. Shooting for the film, Culkin&#x27;s first since &quot;Saved!&quot;, took place in September 2006. The film opened in Los Angeles on November 30, 2007, and was released on DVD on January 22, 2008, by First Look Pictures. Culkin&#x27;s next project was a role in the thirteen-episode NBC television series &quot;Kings&quot; as Andrew Cross.

In 2009, Culkin appeared in a UK-based commercial for Aviva Insurance (formerly Norwich Union) to help promote their company&#x27;s rebranding. Culkin stared into the camera stating, &quot;Remember me.&quot; On August 17, 2009, Culkin made a brief cameo appearance on &quot;WWE Raw&quot; at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri, following a &quot;falls count anywhere&quot; match between Hornswoggle and Chavo Guerrero Jr., in which Guerrero was defeated by the classic &quot;Home Alone&quot; gag of rigging a swinging paint can to hit him upon opening a door. Culkin appeared in the doorway and said, &quot;That&#x27;s not funny.&quot; 

===2010s: Professional expansion===

In February 2010, Culkin appeared in an episode of Poppy de Villeneuve&#x27;s online series for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Park&quot;. On March 7 of the same year, he appeared alongside actors Matthew Broderick, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall, and Jon Cryer in a tribute to the late John Hughes at the Oscars. In April 2011, Culkin was featured in musician Adam Green&#x27;s experimental film &quot;The Wrong Ferarri&quot;, which was entirely shot on an iPhone. In the same month, he also appeared in the music video for &quot;Stamp Your Name on It&quot; performed by Green&#x27;s former bandmate Jack Dishel/Only Son. In September 2012, he appeared in a video on YouTube explaining how he turned his apartment in New York into a painting workshop.

In December 2013, a viral video of Culkin eating a cheese pizza was uploaded to YouTube. This was a parody of Andy Warhol consuming a Burger King Whopper in Jørgen Leth&#x27;s documentary &quot;66 Scenes from America&quot;. Culkin was promoting the debut of his New York–based, pizza-themed comedy rock band The Pizza Underground. Their tour began in Brooklyn on January 24, 2014. In late May 2014, Culkin stormed off stage at Rock City during his kazoo solo after fans began booing and throwing pints of beer at the band. They subsequently cancelled the remaining UK shows, though they claimed the cancellation had nothing to do with the Rock City performance. On July 10, 2016, Culkin announced that The Pizza Underground was splitting up and their next album would be the last.

In July 2016, Culkin appeared in a television advertisement for Compare the Market. In January 2018, Culkin launched a comedy website and podcast called Bunny Ears that parodied other celebrity-owned websites such as Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s Goop. Since 2018, Culkin has been a frequent guest of Red Letter Media, appearing in multiple episodes of their &quot;Best of the Worst&quot;, &quot;re:View&quot;, and &quot;Half in the Bag&quot; webseries, as well as &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot;, where he appears as a parody of himself. In an advertisement for Google Assistant published on December 19, 2018, Culkin reprised his &quot;Home Alone&quot; role as Kevin McCallister after 28 years. It recreated scenes from the movie where McCallister shaved his face, jumped on the bed, and decorated the Christmas tree, all while asking Google Assistant to set reminders for him. In 2019, he had a role in Seth Green&#x27;s movie &quot;Changeland&quot; with his future wife, Brenda Song, which was released on June 7, 2019.

===2020s===
In 2021, Culkin was part of the starring cast of the series&#x27; tenth season, &quot;American Horror Story: Double Feature&quot;. His role in the season was critically praised. On December 1, 2023, Culkin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In attendance at the ceremony were his &quot;Home Alone&quot; co-star Catherine O&#x27;Hara and &quot;Party Monster&quot; co-star Natasha Lyonne, who gave speeches in Culkin&#x27;s honor.

==Personal life==
Culkin tends to refrain from disclosing aspects of his personal life; however, he has discussed his life as a child actor, the conflict in his family life, including his estrangement from his father, and how he retired from acting at age 14. He resides in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on an estate that was formerly owned by Kiefer Sutherland.

On September 17, 2004, Culkin was arrested in Oklahoma City for the possession of of marijuana and two controlled substances, of alprazolam and of clonazepam, for which he was briefly jailed and then released on $4,000 bail. After being arraigned in court for misdemeanor drug offenses, he pleaded not guilty at the trial (October 15, 2004, to June 9, 2005), but later reversed the plea to guilty. He received three one-year suspended prison sentences and was ordered to pay $540 in fees.

In December 2018, Culkin announced that he would legally change his name to &quot;Macaulay Macaulay Culkin Culkin&quot; after holding a vote through his website to choose a new middle name, with &quot;Macaulay Culkin&quot; winning the vote over four other candidates. He announced in April 2019 that the legal name change process had been completed.

In August 2020, on his 40th birthday, Culkin tweeted, &quot;Hey guys, wanna feel old? I&#x27;m 40. You&#x27;re welcome.&quot; The tweet became one of the most-liked tweets of all time, peaking at number 9.

===Relationships===
Culkin married actress Rachel Miner in 1998 when they were both 18, but they separated in 2000 and divorced in 2002. 

Culkin began dating actress Mila Kunis in May 2002. By 2006, he was living in New York, while Kunis was living in Los Angeles. On January 3, 2011, Kunis&#x27;s publicist confirmed reports that Culkin and Kunis had ended their relationship several months previously, saying, &quot;The split was amicable, and they remain close friends.&quot; 

In 2017, Culkin&#x27;s &quot;Changeland&quot; co-star Brenda Song shared that the two of them were in a relationship, having met in June 2017 when they worked together on that film, and after having been seen in public dating the following month. Their first child, a son, was born on April 5, 2021. Shortly after their son&#x27;s birth, comments Culkin made on a 2018 episode of &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; about his relationship with Song (a Hmong–Thai American) resurfaced, which were criticized for stereotyping Asians. In the interview, Culkin joked about the shape of Song&#x27;s eyes, their interracial relationship, and the appearance of their potential future children. He argued that he was entitled to make Asian jokes because of his relationship with Song, and because of his future fatherhood to multiracial children, stating that he would &quot;understand the struggle&quot;. Culkin and Song&#x27;s second son was born in December 2022.

===Friendships===
Around the time of the first &quot;Home Alone&quot; movie, Culkin became friends with the pop singer Michael Jackson and appeared in Jackson&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Black or White&quot; music video. In 2005, at Jackson&#x27;s trial for sexual child abuse, Culkin testified that he had slept in bed with Jackson but that he was never molested. Culkin dismissed the allegations against Jackson as &quot;absolutely ridiculous&quot;. Culkin attended Jackson&#x27;s burial on September 3, 2009. Culkin is also the godfather of Jackson&#x27;s children Paris Jackson, Prince and Michael Jr. Culkin has consistently defended Jackson against allegations of child molestation, and said in a 2020 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;: &quot;I never saw anything; he never did anything.&quot;

Culkin is close with fellow actor Seth Green, with whom he co-starred in the film &quot;Party Monster&quot;, as well as in Green&#x27;s 2019 directorial debut, &quot;Changeland&quot;, and on episodes of Green&#x27;s adult animated sitcom &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;.

<text>A software company is an organisation — owned either by the state or private — established for profit whose primary products are various forms of software, software technology, distribution, and software product development. They make up the software industry.

== Types ==
There are a number of different types of software companies:
*There are companies selling available to use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products.
*Many companies provide Software Development services, and have a structure to develop custom software for other companies and businesses.
*Companies producing specialized commercial off-the-shelf software.
*Companies providing Software as a Service (SaaS).
*There are also other types of SaaS products, of companies providing IT infrastructure services and Cloud Computing services.
*API as a Service, that allows third party developers to interact with a company&#x27;s software.
*Companies producing software components.
*Application Service Provider.
*Companies producing bespoke software for vertical industries or particular geographical regions.
*Independent software vendors (ISVs) that build, develop and sell consumer or enterprise software that is consumed by end users.

== Common roles in a software company ==

Organizing a software company is a very specialized type of management skill, where experienced persons can turn the organizational problem into a unique benefit. For example, having sub-teams spread in different time zones may allow a 24-hour company working day, if the teams, systems, and procedures are well established. A good example is the test team in a time zone 8 hours ahead or behind the development team, who fix software bugs found by the testers.

A professional software company normally consists of at least three dedicated sub-teams :
*Business analysts who define the business needs of the market
*Software developers who create the technical specification and write the software
*Software testers who are responsible for the whole process of quality management

In bigger software companies, greater specialization is employed, and quite often there are also:

*Technical writers who write all the documentation such as user guides
*Release specialists who are responsible for building the whole product and software versioning
*User experience designers, who are creating the design architecture based on business requirements, user research and expertise in usability
*Graphic designers who are normally responsible for the design of the graphical user interface.
*Maintenance engineers who are behind two, three or more lines of support
*Consultants are responsible for making the solution operational, especially if some specialist knowledge is necessary. Examples of this include: building multidimensional cubes in business intelligence software, integrating with existing solutions, and implementing business scenarios in Business Process Management software.

== Structure ==

The manager of a software company is usually called the Head Of Development (HOD), and reports to the stakeholders. He or she leads the sub-teams directly or via the managers/leaders depending on the size of the organization. Usually teams of up to 10 person are the most operational. In bigger organizations, there are in general two models of the hierarchy:

All the teams are fully independent and they work separately on the different projects. The structure is quite simple and all the employees reports to one person, what make the situation quite clear however it is not a good solution in terms of knowledge exchange and optimal usage of human resources.

In this model there are dedicated managers/leaders for each main specialization, &quot;renting&quot; their people for particular projects led by product/project managers, who formally or informally buy the people and pay for their time. This leads to each private employee having two bosses – the product/project manager and the specialized &quot;resource&quot; manager. On one hand it optimizes the usage of human resources, on the other hand it may give rise to conflicts about which one manager has priority in the structure.

There are also a number of variants of these structures, and a number of organizations have this structure spread and split within various departments and units.

==Methodologies==

Software companies may use a number of various methodologies to produce the code. These can include:
*the waterfall model, including project management methodologies like PRINCE2 or PMBoK
*agile software development, such as Extreme Programming and SCRUM

There are also some methodologies which combine both, such as the spiral model, Rational Unified Process (RUP) or MSF.

==Product life cycle==
Regardless of the methodology used, the product life cycle always consists of at least three stages:
* Design – including both the business and technical specification
* Coding – the development itself
* Testing – the quality management

Each stage ideally takes 30% of the total time, with the remaining 10% in reserve.

The UML sequence diagram of interaction between these groups may look like:
At each stage a different group plays a key role, however each type of role must be involved throughout the whole development process:
* Analysts, after completing the business specification, manage the changing business situation to minimize the possibility of change over time. They also support both programmers and testers during the whole development process to ensure that the final product fulfills the business needs specified at the start. The process ideally puts business analysts as the key players during final delivery of the solution to the customer, as they are best placed to provide the best business layer.
* Programmers do the technical specification during the design phase, which is why they are called programmers/designers, and during testing time they fix bugs.
* Testers complete the test scenarios during the design phase, and evaluate them during the coding phase

== Systems and procedures ==
Software companies possess various systems and procedures implemented and working internally across all the sub-teams. These include:

===Business analysts===
*Modeling tools like Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect or IBM Rational Rose

===Programmers===
*Version Control Systems and software versioning procedures
*Code analysis tools and coding standards, validated manually or automatically
*Deployment mechanisms

===Testers===
*Bug tracking systems
*Test automation tools
*Performance and stress test tools

===Project/product managers===
*Enterprise Project Management (EPM) systems and procedures
*Product portfolio management (PPM)
*Change management systems and procedures

There are also Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), which embed some of these functionalities in one package and are used across the groups. They are delivered from various vendors like Borland, ECM or Compuware.

== Efficiency audits ==
Well-established software companies typically have some way of measuring their own efficiency. This is usually done by defining the set of key performance indicators (KPI), such as
*The average number of bugs done by the developer per unit of time or source lines of code
*The number of bugs found by tester per test cycle
*The average number of test cycles until Zero Bug Bounce (ZBB)
*The average time of test cycle
*Estimated time of task comparing to the real time of the task (exactitude of planning)
*Number of corrections to the baseline

 A number of organizations are focused on reaching the optimum level of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), where &quot;optimum&quot; does not necessarily mean the highest. There are also other systems such as Carnegie-Mellon University&#x27;s SEMA, or particular ISO standards. Small software companies will often use light-weight approaches to their process, formalized or not. Each organization works out its own style, which lies somewhere between total technocracy (where all is defined by numbers) and total anarchy (where there are no numbers at all). Whichever way the organization goes, they consider the pyramid describing the cost and risk of introducing change to already-begun development processes as a true model to manage changes.

<text>Franz Heinrich Reusch (4 December 1825 – 3 March 1900) was an Old Catholic theologian.

He was born at Brilon, in Westphalia, studied general literature at Paderborn, and theology at Bonn, Tübingen and Munich. The friend and pupil of Döllinger, he took his degree of Doctor in Theology at Munich. He was ordained a priest in 1849, and was immediately made chaplain at Cologne. In 1854 he became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in the exegesis of the Old Testament in the Catholic Theological Faculty at Bonn; in 1858 he was made extraordinary, and in 1861 ordinary, professor of theology in the same university. From 1866 to 1877 he was editor of the &quot;Bonner Theologisches Literaturblatt&quot;.

In the controversies on the infallibility of the Pope, Reusch belonged to Döllinger&#x27;s party, and he and his colleagues Bernhard Josef Hilgers, Franz Peter Knoodt and Joseph Langen were interdicted by the Archbishop of Cologne in 1871 from pursuing their courses of lectures. In 1872 Reusch was excommunicated. For many years after this he held the post of Old Catholic curé of Bonn, as well as the position of vicar-general to the Old Catholic Bishop Reinkens, but resigned both in 1878, when, with Döllinger, he disapproved of the permission to marry granted by the Old Catholic Church in Germany to its clergy.

He retired into lay communion, but continued to give lectures as usual in the Old Catholic Faculty of Theology in the University of Bonn, and to write on theological subjects. He was made rector of that university in 1873. In 1874 and 1875 he was the official reporter of the memorable Reunion Conferences held at Bonn in those years and attended by many distinguished theologians of the Oriental and Anglican communions. Reusch was a profound scholar and an untiring worker. Among his many works were contributions to the &quot;Revue internationale de theologie&quot;, a review started at Bern at the instance of the Old Catholic Congress at Lucerne. He wrote also works on the Old Testament; a pamphlet on &quot;Die Deutschen Bischöfe und der Aberglaube&quot;; and another on the falsifications to be found in the treatise of Aquinas against the Greeks; as well as essays on the history of the Society of Jesus, and a book of prayers.

His fame mainly rests on the works which he and Döllinger published jointly. These consisted of a work on the &quot;Autobiography of Cardinal Bellarmine&quot;, the &quot;Geschichte der Moralstreitigkeiten in der Römisch-Katholischen Kirche seit dem XVI. Jahrhundert&quot;, and the &quot;Erörterungen über Leben und Schriften des hl. Liguori&quot;. During the last few years of his life he was stricken with paralysis. He died in Bonn leaving behind him in manuscript a collection of letters to Bunsen about Roman cardinals and prelates, which has since been published.

<text>Joseph Langen (3 June 1837 – 13 July 1901) was a German theologian and priest, who was instrumental for the German Old Catholic movement.

Langen was born at Cologne, studied at Bonn, and was ordained priest for the Roman Catholic Church in 1859. He was nominated professor extraordinary at the University of Bonn in 1864, and a professor in ordinary of the exegesis of the New Testament in 1867—an office which he held until his death. He was one of the band of professors who in 1870 supported Döllinger in his resistance to the Vatican decrees, and was excommunicated along with Döllinger, Johann Nepomuk Huber, Johann Friedrich, Franz Heinrich Reusch, Joseph Hubert Reinkens and others, for refusing to accept them. In 1878, in consequence of the permission given to priests to marry, Langen ceased to identify himself with the Old Catholic movement, but was not reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church. His first work was an inquiry into the authorship of the &quot;Commentary on St Paul&#x27;s Epistles and the Treatise on Biblical Questions&quot;, ascribed to Saint Ambrose and Augustine of Hippo respectively. In 1868 he published an &quot;Introduction to the New Testament&quot;.

He also published works on the &quot;Last Days of the Life of Jesus&quot;, on &quot;Judaism in the Time of Christ&quot;, on &quot;John of Damascus&quot; (1879) and an &quot;Examination of the Vatican Dogma in the Light of Patristic Exegesis of the New Testament&quot;. But he is chiefly famous for his &quot;Geschichte der Römischen Kirche&quot; (&quot;History of the Church of Rome to the Pontificate of Innocent III&quot;) (4 vols, 1881–1893), a work of sound scholarship, based directly upon the authorities, the most important sources being woven carefully into the text. He also contributed largely to the &quot;internationale theologische Zeitschrift&quot;, a review started in 1893 by the Old Catholics to promote the union of several National Churches on the basis of the councils of the Undivided Church, and admitting articles in German, French and English.

Among other subjects, he wrote on the School of Hierotheus, on &quot;Romish falsifications of the Greek Fathers&quot;, on Pope Leo XIII, on Liberal Ultramontanism, on the &quot;Papal Teaching in regard to Morals&quot;, on Vincent of Lerins and he carried on a controversy with Professor Willibald Beyschlag, of the German Evangelical Church, on the respective merits of Protestantism and Old Catholicism regarded as a basis for teaching the Christian faith. An attack of apoplexy put an end to his teaching career and hastened his death. He died in Bonn.

<text>Agraphia is an acquired neurological disorder causing a loss in the ability to communicate through writing, either due to some form of motor dysfunction or an inability to spell. The loss of writing ability may present with other language or neurological disorders; disorders appearing commonly with agraphia are alexia, aphasia, dysarthria, agnosia, acalculia and apraxia. The study of individuals with agraphia may provide more information about the pathways involved in writing, both language related and motoric. Agraphia cannot be directly treated, but individuals can learn techniques to help regain and rehabilitate some of their previous writing abilities. These techniques differ depending on the type of agraphia.

Agraphia can be broadly divided into central and peripheral categories. Central agraphias typically involve language areas of the brain, causing difficulty spelling or with spontaneous communication, and are often accompanied by other language disorders. Peripheral agraphias usually target motor and visuospatial skills in addition to language and tend to involve motoric areas of the brain, causing difficulty in the movements associated with writing. Central agraphia may also be called aphasic agraphia as it involves areas of the brain whose major functions are connected to language and writing; peripheral agraphia may also be called nonaphasic agraphia as it involves areas of the brain whose functions are not directly connected to language and writing (typically motor areas).

The history of agraphia dates to the mid-fourteenth century, but it was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that it sparked significant clinical interest. Research in the twentieth century focused primary on aphasiology in patients with lesions from strokes.

==Characteristics==
Agraphia or impairment in producing written language can occur in many ways and many forms because writing involves many cognitive processes (language processing, spelling, visual perception, visuospatial orientation for graphic symbols, motor planning, and motor control of handwriting).

Agraphia has two main subgroupings: central (&quot;aphasic&quot;) agraphia and peripheral (&quot;nonaphasic&quot;) agraphia. Central agraphias include , phonological, deep, and semantic agraphia. Peripheral agraphias include allographic, apraxic, motor execution, hemianoptic and afferent agraphia.

===Central===
Central agraphia occurs when there are both impairments in spoken language and impairments to the various motor and visualization skills involved in writing. Individuals who have agraphia with fluent aphasia write a normal quantity of well-formed letters, but lack the ability to write meaningful words. Receptive aphasia is an example of fluent aphasia. Those who have agraphia with nonfluent aphasia can write brief sentences but their writing is difficult to read. Their writing requires great physical effort, lacks proper syntax, and often has poor spelling. Expressive aphasia is an example of nonfluent aphasia. Individuals who have alexia with agraphia have difficulty with both the production and comprehension of written language. This form of agraphia does not impair spoken language.
* Deep agraphia affects an individual&#x27;s phonological ability and orthographic memory. Deep agraphia is often the result of a lesion involving the left parietal region (supramarginal gyrus or insula). Individuals can neither remember how words look when spelled correctly, nor sound them out to determine spelling. Individuals typically rely on their damaged orthographic memory to spell; this results in frequent errors, usually semantic in nature. Individuals have more difficulty with abstract concepts and uncommon words. Reading and spoken language are often impaired as well.
* Gerstmann syndrome agraphia is the impairment of written language production associated with the following structural symptoms: difficulty discriminating between one&#x27;s own fingers, difficulty distinguishing left from right, and difficulty performing calculations. All four of these symptoms result from pathway lesions. Gerstmann&#x27;s syndrome may additionally be present with alexia and mild aphasia.
* Global agraphia also impairs an individual&#x27;s orthographic memory although to a greater extent than deep agraphia. In global apraxia, spelling knowledge is lost to such a degree that the individual can only write very few meaningful words, or cannot write any words at all. Reading and spoken language are also markedly impaired.
* Lexical and structural agraphia are caused by damage to the orthographic memory; these individuals cannot visualize the spelling of a word, though they do retain the ability to sound them out. This impaired spelling memory can imply the loss or degradation of the knowledge or just an inability to efficiently access it. There is a regularity effect associated with lexical agraphia in that individuals are less likely to correctly spell words without regular, predictable spellings. Additionally, spelling ability tends to be less impaired for common words. Individuals also have difficulty with homophones. Language competence in terms of grammar and sentence writing tends to be preserved.
* Phonological agraphia is the opposite of lexical agraphia in that the ability to sound out words is impaired, but the orthographical memory of words may be intact. It is associated with a lexicality effect by a difference in the ability to spell words versus nonwords; individuals with this form of agraphia are depending on their orthographic memory. Additionally, it is often harder for these individuals to access more abstract words without strong semantic representations (i.e., it is more difficult for them to spell prepositions than concrete nouns).
* Pure agraphia is the impairment in written language production without any other language or cognitive disorder.

Agraphia can occur separately or co-occur and can be caused by damage to the angular gyrus

===Peripheral===
Peripheral agraphias occurs when there is damage to the various motor and visualization skills involved in writing.
* Apraxic agraphia is the impairment in written language production associated with disruption of the motor system. It results in distorted, slow, effortful, incomplete, and/or imprecise letter formation. Though written letters are often so poorly formed that they are almost illegible, the ability to spell aloud is often retained. This form of agraphia is caused specifically by a loss of specialized motor plans for the formation of letters and not by any dysfunction affecting the writing hand. Apraxic agraphia may present with or without ideomotor apraxia. Paralysis, chorea, Parkinson&#x27;s disease (micrographia), and dystonia (writer&#x27;s cramp) are motor disorders commonly associated with agraphia.
* Hysterical agraphia is the impairment in written language production caused by a conversion disorder.
* Reiterative agraphia is found in individuals who repeat letters, words, or phrases in written language production an abnormal number of times. Perseveration, paragraphia, and echographia are examples of reiterative agraphia.
* Visuospatial agraphia is the impairment in written language production defined by a tendency to neglect one portion (often an entire side) of the writing page, slanting lines upward or downward, and abnormal spacing between letters, syllables, and words. The orientation and correct sequencing of the writing will also be impaired. Visuospatial agraphia is frequently associated with left hemispatial neglect, difficulty in building or assembling objects, and other spatial difficulties.

==Causes==

Agraphia has a multitude of causes ranging from strokes, lesions, traumatic brain injury, and dementia. Twelve regions of the brain are associated with handwriting. The four distinct functional areas are the left superior frontal area composed of the middle frontal gyrus and the superior frontal sulcus, the left superior parietal area composed of the inferior parietal lobule, the superior parietal lobule and the intraparietal sulcus and lastly the primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. The eight other areas are considered associative areas and are the right anterior cerebellum, the left posterior nucleus of the thalamus, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the right posterior cerebellum, the right superior frontal cortex, the right inferior parietal lobule, the left fusiform gyrus and the left putamen. The specific type of agraphia resulting from brain damage will depend on which area of the brain was damaged.

Phonological agraphia is linked to damage in areas of the brain involved in phonological processing skills (sounding out words), specifically the language areas around the sylvian fissure, such as Broca&#x27;s area, Wernicke&#x27;s area, and the supramarginal gyrus.

Lexical agraphia is associated with damage to the left angular gyrus and/or posterior temporal cortex. The damage is typically posterior and inferior to the perisylvian language areas.

Deep agraphia involves damage to the same areas of the brain as lexical agraphia plus some damage to the perisylvian language areas as well. More extensive left hemisphere damage can lead to global agraphia.

Gerstmann&#x27;s syndrome is caused by a lesion of the dominant (usually the left) parietal lobe, usually an angular gyrus lesion.

Apraxic agraphia with ideomotor apraxia is typically caused by damage to the superior parietal lobe (where graphomotor plans are stored) or the premotor cortex (where the plans are converted into motor commands). Additionally, some individuals with cerebellar lesions (more typically associated with non-apraxic motor dysfunction) develop apraxic agraphia. Apraxic agraphia without ideomotor apraxia may be caused by damage to either of the parietal lobes, the dominant frontal lobe, or to the dominant thalamus.

Visuospatial agraphia typically has a right hemisphere pathology. Damage to the right frontal area of the brain may cause more motor defects, whereas damage to the posterior part of the right hemisphere leads predominantly to spatial defects in writing. 

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===

Agraphia is often seen in association with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). Writing disorders can be an early manifestation of AD. In individuals with AD, the first sign pertaining to writing skills is the selective syntactic simplification of their writing. Individuals will write with less description, detail and complexity, and other markers, such as grammatical errors, may emerge. Different agraphias may develop as AD progresses. In the beginning stages of AD, individuals show signs of allographic agraphia and apraxic agraphia. Allographic agraphia is represented in AD individuals by the mixing of lower and upper case letters in words; apraxic agraphia is represented in AD patients through poorly constructed or illegible letters and omission or over repetition of letter strokes. As their AD progresses, so does the severity of their agraphia; they may begin to form spatial agraphia, which is the inability to write in a straight horizontal line, and there are often unnecessary gaps between letters and words.

A connection between AD and agraphia is the role of memory in normal writing ability. Normal spellers have access to a lexical spelling system that uses a whole-word; when functioning properly, it allows for recall of the spelling of a complete word, not as individual letters or sounds. This system further uses an internal memory store where the spellings of hundreds of words are kept. This is called the graphemic output lexicon and is aptly named in relation to the graphemic buffer, which is the short term memory loop for many of the functions involved in handwriting. When the spelling system cannot be used, such as with unfamiliar words, non-words or words that we do not recognize the spelling for, some people are able to use the phonological process called the sub-lexical spelling system. This system is used to sound out a word and spell it. In AD individuals, memory stores that are used for everyday handwriting are lost as the disease progresses.

Agraphia cannot be directly treated, but individuals can be rehabilitated to regain some of their previous writing abilities.

For the management of phonological agraphia, individuals are trained to memorize key words, such as a familiar name or object, that can then help them form the grapheme for that phoneme. Management of allographic agraphia can be as simple as having alphabet cards so the individual can write legibly by copying the correct letter shapes. There are few rehabilitation methods for apraxic agraphia; if the individual has considerably better hand control and movement with typing than they do with handwriting, then they can use technological devices. Texting and typing do not require the same technical movements that handwriting does; for these technological methods, only spatial location of the fingers to type is required. If copying skills are preserved in an individual with apraxic agraphia, repeated copying may help shift from the highly intentional and monitored hand movements indicative of apraxic agraphia to a more automated control.

Micrographia is a condition that can occur with the development of other disorders, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and is when handwriting becomes illegible because of small writing. For some individuals, a simple command to write bigger eliminates the issue.
* Anagram and Copy Treatment (ACT) uses the arrangement of component letters of target words and then repeated copying of the target word. This is similar to the CART; the main difference is that the target words for ACT are specific to the individual. Target words that are important in the life of the individual are emphasized because people with deep or global agraphias do not typically have the same memory for the words as other people with agraphia may. Writing can be even more important to these people as it can cue spoken language. ACT helps in this by facilitating the relearning of a set of personally relevant written words for use in communication.
* Copy and Recall Treatment (CART) method helps to reestablish the ability to spell specific words that are learned through repeated copying and recall of target words. CART is more likely to be successful in treating lexical agraphia when a few words are trained to mastery than when a large group of unrelated words is trained. Words chosen can be individualized to the patient, which makes treatment more personalized.
* Graphemic buffer uses the training of specific words to improve spelling. Cueing hierarchies and copy and recall method of specific words are used, to work the words into the short-term memory loop, or graphemic buffer. The segmentation of longer words into shorter syllables helps bring words into short-term memory.
* Problem solving approach is used as a self-correcting method for phonological errors. The individual sounds out the word and attempts to spell it, typically using an electronic dictionary-type device that indicates correct spelling. This method takes advantage of the preserved sound-to-letter correspondences when they are intact. This approach may improve access to spelling memory, strengthen orthographic representations, or both.

==History==
In 1553 Thomas Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;Arte of Rhetorique&quot; held the earliest known description of what would now be called acquired agraphia. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the loss of the ability to produce written language received clinical attention, when ideas about localization in the brain influenced studies about dissociation between written and spoken language as well as reading and writing. Paul Broca&#x27;s work on aphasia during this time inspired researchers across Europe and North America to begin conducting studies on the correlation between lesions and loss of function in various cortical areas.

During the 1850s, clinicians such as Armand Trousseau and John Hughlings Jackson held the prevailing view that the same linguistic deficiency occurred in writing as well as speech and reading impairments. In 1856, Louis-Victor Marcé argued that written and spoken language were independent of each other; he discovered that in many patients with languages disorders, both speech and writing was impaired. The recovery of written and spoken language was not always parallel suggesting that these two modes of expression were independent. He believed the ability to write not only involved motor control, but also the memory of the signs and their meaning.

In 1867, William Ogle, who coined the term &quot;agraphia&quot;, made several key observations about the patterns of dissociation found in written and spoken language. He demonstrated that some patients with writing impairments were able to copy written letters but struggled arranging the letters to form words. Ogle knew that aphasia and agraphia often occurred together, but he confirmed that the impairment of two different types of language (spoken and written) can vary in type and severity. Although Ogle&#x27;s review helped make important advancements toward understanding writing disorders, a documented case of pure agraphia was missing.

In 1884, over two decades after the research of acquired language disorders began, Albert Pitres made an important contribution when he published a clinical report of pure agraphia. According to Pitres, Marcé and Ogle were the first to emphasize the dissociation between speech and writing. His work was also strongly influenced by Théodule-Armand Ribot&#x27;s modular approach to memory. Pitres&#x27;s clinical case study in 1884 argues for the localization of writing in the brain.

Pitres&#x27;s reading and writing models consisted of three main components: visual (the memory for letters and how letters are put together to form syllables and word), auditory (the memory for the sounds of each letter), and motor (motor-graphic memory of the letters). He proposed the following classifications of agraphia:
# Agraphia by word blindness: inability to copy a model, but the individual can write spontaneously and in response to dictation.
# Agraphia by word deafness: inability to write to dictation, but the individual can copy a model and write spontaneously.
# Motor agraphia: no ability to write, but the individual can spell.
Pitres said in aphasia, the intellect is not systematically impaired.

Research in the twentieth century focused primarily on aphasiology in patients with lesions from cerebrovascular accidents. From these studies, researches gained significant insight into the complex cognitive process of producing written language.

<text>Johann Adam Möhler (6 May 1796 – 12 April 1838) was a German Roman Catholic theologian and priest associated with the Catholic Tübingen school.

He was born at Igersheim in the Bailiwick of Franconia of the Teutonic Order (from 1809 on part of Württemberg), and after studying philosophy and theology in the lyceum at Ellwangen, entered the University of Tübingen in 1817. Ordained to the priesthood in 1819, he was appointed to a curacy. He returned to Tübingen where he became &quot;privatdozent&quot; in 1825, an associate professor of theology in 1826 and a full professor in 1828.

His lectures drew large audiences that included many Protestants. The controversy aroused by his &quot;Symbolik&quot; (1832) was such that in 1835 he left for the University of Munich, because of polemics with the Protestant Tübingen theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur. In 1838 he was appointed to the deanery of Würzburg, but died shortly afterwards.

He died young but was very influential for other theologians, such as Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar, and others.

As a church historian, he has a more confessional and conservative orientation and organic thinking.

A &quot;Biographie&quot; by Balthasar Wörner was published at Regensburg in 1866.

The &quot;Symbolik&quot; is his most famous work; the interest excited by it in Protestant circles is shown by the fact that within two years of its appearance it had elicited three replies of considerable importance, those namely of FC Baur, PK Marheineke and KI Nitzsch.

<text>Philip Konrad Marheineke (May 1, 1780, Hildesheim – May 31, 1846, Berlin), was a German Protestant church leader within the Evangelical Church in Prussia.

==Life==
He was born at Hildesheim, Bishopric of Hildesheim, and studied at the University of Göttingen. In 1805 he was appointed professor extraordinarius of philosophy at Erlangen; in 1807 he moved to Heidelberg. In 1811 he became professor ordinarius at Frederick William University, Berlin, where from 1820 he was also preacher at Trinity Church and worked with Schleiermacher. When he died he was a member of the supreme consistorial council.

==Works==
At first influenced by Schelling, Marheineke found a new master in G. W. F. Hegel, and came to be regarded as the leader of the Hegelian Right. He sought to defend and explain all the orthodox doctrines of the Church in an orthodox way in the terms of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy. 

Marheineke&#x27;s developed views on dogmatics are given in the third edition (1847) of his &quot;Die Grundlehren der christlichen Dogmatik als Wissenschaft&quot;. When he published the first edition (1819) he was still under the influence of Schelling; the second edition (1827) marked his change of view. His works on symbolics show profound scholarship, keen critical insight, and rare impartiality. The &quot;Christliche Symbolik&quot; (1810-1814) has been pronounced his masterpiece.

His other works include &quot;Institutiones symbolicae&quot; (1812; 3rd ed., 1830), &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Reformation&quot; (1816; 2nd ed., 18311834); &quot;Die Reformation, ihre Entstehung und Verbreitung in Deutschland&quot; (1846; 2nd ed., 1858), and the posthumous &quot;Theol. Vorlesungen&quot; (1847-1849).

He co-edited Hegel&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Werke&quot; series (1832-1845) and an 1840 edition of &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion&quot;.

<text>Charles-Forbes-René, comte de Montalembert (; 15 April 1810 – 13 March 1870) was a French publicist, historian and Count of Montalembert, Deux-Sèvres, and a prominent representative of liberal Catholicism.

==Family==
Charles Forbes René de Montalembert who was born on 15 April 1810, was of French and Scots ancestry. His father, Marc René, belonged to the family of Angoumois, which could trace its descent back to the 13th century, while charters show the history of the house even two centuries earlier. For several generations the family had been distinguished, both in the army and in the field of science. Montalembert senior had fought under Condé, and subsequently served in the British army. He married Eliza Rose Forbes, whose father, James Forbes, belonged to a very old Scottish Protestant family. Charles, their eldest son, was born in London. At the French Restoration of 1814, Marc René returned to France, was raised to the peerage in 1820, and became ambassador to Sweden, where Charles completed his education in 1826.

==Career==
Montalembert&#x27;s early years were spent in England, where he was largely raised by his grandfather, who, although a Protestant, encouraged him to follow the religion of his father. In 1819 he attended the Lycée Bourbon and at the Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris. In 1829 he was a contributor to the review &quot;Le Correspondant&quot;. In September and October 1830, he travelled in Ireland, where he met Daniel O&#x27;Connell; he was thinking of assisting the cause for which O&#x27;Connell was struggling by writing a history of Ireland, when he learned that the House of Commons had passed the Irish Emancipation Act.

Charles de Montalembert was under twenty-five at his father&#x27;s death in 1831 and therefore too young to take his seat as a peer, but he retained other rights. Combined with his literary and intellectual activity, this made him a person of some importance. He was a Liberal, in the English sense, and disagreed with the new regime on only the religious question. He would have approved of the policy of the golden mean represented by Louis Philippe. He wished to see the Church free from state control and attacked the monopoly of public instruction by which the monarchy fortified its position. This latter scheme first brought Montalembert to public attention when he was formally charged with unlicensed teaching. He claimed the right of trial by his peers and made a notable defence with a deliberate intention of protest in 1832.

On the other hand, he thought that the Church should not obstinately oppose new ideas. He had eagerly entered into the plans of his friends, Lamennais and Lacordaire, and he collaborated with them in the newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; (&quot;The Future&quot;). He especially distinguished himself in &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; by his campaigns in favour of freedom for Ireland and Poland, and for these he received the congratulations of Victor Hugo and Alfred de Vigny. In 1831 he thought of going to Poland and joining the insurgents there. He was instrumental in setting up the Polish Library in Paris and its associated literary society for the Great Emigration into France.

The Ultramontane party was roused by the boldness of Montalembert and his two friends who then left for Rome. They failed to win any mitigation of the measures which the Roman curia took against &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;. Its doctrines were condemned in two encyclicals, &quot;Mirari vos&quot; in 1832 and &quot;Singulari Nos&quot; in 1834, and Montalembert submitted. In 1835 he took his seat in the Chamber of Peers, and his competence soon made him famous. He clung to his early liberalism, and in 1848 saw the end of a government towards which he had always been hostile. In 1848 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. He was at first inclined to support Napoleon III, but was soon alienated by his policy. Montalembert remained in the Chamber until 1857, when he was obliged to retire to private life. He was still recognised as a formidable opponent of the Empire. Meanwhile, his Liberal ideas had made him some irreconcilable enemies among the Ultramontanists. Louis Veuillot, in his paper, &quot;L&#x27;Univers religieux&quot;, opposed him. In 1855 Montalembert answered them by reviving a review which had for some time ceased publication, &quot;Le Correspondant&quot;. This he used to fight the party of Veuillot and the far-left Liberals of the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;.
At a noted Catholic congress in Malines, Belgium in 1863, Montalembert gave two long addresses on Catholic Liberalism. He was also a staunch supporter of the independence of education from the state:

I do not want to be constrained by the state to believe what it believes to be true, because the State is not the judge of truth. However the State is bound to protect me in the practice of the truth that I choose, that is to say, the exercise of the religion that I profess This is what constitutes religious freedom in the modern state, which the free state is bound to respect and guarantee, not only for each citizen in particular, but for groups of citizens joined together to profess and propagate their belief, that is to say, for corporation, for associations, and for churches.&quot;

He took great interest in the débuts of the Liberal empire. He severed his connection with Père Hyacinthe Loyson as he had with Lamennais and made the submission expected of him to the Council. It was his last fall. Montalembert became increasingly isolated, politically, for his support of religious freedom in education; and by the Church for his liberal views.

Charles de Montalembert died in 1870.

==Marriage==
Montalembert married Mlle de Merode, daughter of Félix de Mérode. His daughter married the vicomte de Meaux, a Roman Catholic statesman and distinguished writer. He was thus the brother-in-law of Belgian prelate and papal statesman Xavier de Mérode.

Montalembert was a close friend of Edwin Wyndham-Quin, 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl with whom he toured Scotland in 1862, staying at Dunraven Castle on his return journey. The viscount travelled with Montalembert to Switzerland the following year and stayed at Maîche, Doubs (Montalembert&#x27;s country property) on his return.

==Writing and works (selection)==
In addition to being an eloquent orator, Montalembert wrote in a style at once picturesque, fiery and polished. He was an ardent student of the Middle Ages, but his medieval enthusiasm was strongly tinctured with religious sentiments. His first historical work, &quot;La Vie de Ste Elisabeth de Hongrie&quot; (1836), is not so much a history as a religious manifesto, which did much to restore the position of hagiography. It met with great success, but Montalembert was not elected a member of the until 1851, after the fall of the July Monarchy.

From this time he gave much of his attention to a great work on monasticism in the West. He was at first attracted by the figure of St. Bernard and devoted one volume to him. He later withdrew it on the advice of his friend Dupanloup, and the entire printing was destroyed. He then enlarged his original plan and published the first volumes of his &quot;Moines d&#x27;occident&quot; (1860), an eloquent work which was received with much admiration in those circles where language was more appreciated than learning. The work, unfinished at the time of the author&#x27;s death, was completed later from some long fragments found among his papers. Volumes VI and VII appeared in 1877.

Like Chateaubriand he kept a close (now published) record of acquaintances, invitations, necrology.

<doc id="212877" wikidata="Q2404639" url="?curid=212877" title="Louis Veuillot">
<text>Louis Veuillot (11 October 1813 – 7 March 1883) was a French journalist and author who helped to popularize ultramontanism (a philosophy favoring Papal supremacy).

==Career overview==
Veuillot was born of humble parents in Boynes (Loiret). When he was five years of age, his parents relocated to Paris. With little education, he gained employment in a lawyer&#x27;s office, and was sent in 1830 to serve with a newspaper of Rouen, and afterwards to Périgueux. Initially, Veuillot supported the July Monarchy of Louis Phillippe criticizing both Republicans and supporters of the deposed Bourbon Dynasty. 

He returned to Paris in 1837, and a year later visited Rome during Holy Week. There he embraced ultramontane sentiments, and became an ardent champion of Catholicism. The results of his conversion were published in &quot;Pélerinages en Suisse&quot; (1839), &quot;Rome et Lorette&quot; (1841) and other publications. Veuillot&#x27;s embrace of Ultramontanism led to his violent rejection of Bourgeois society and norms. He had little regard for theological nuance and held fast to the overall philosophies of Joseph de Maistre and Louis de Bonald, the original Catholic counter-revolutionary thinkers. Veuillot viewed all issues through the prism of their relationship to the Church and thought any disruption of the faith was a catastrophe. For this reason, he expressed surprise when he learned that his friend Joseph-Théophile Foisset was working on a new edition of Blaise Pascal since he was a Jansenist. 

In 1840, Veuillot joined the staff of the newspaper &quot;Univers Religieux&quot;, a journal created in 1833 by Abbé Migne, and soon helped make it the leading organ of ultramontane propaganda as &quot;L&#x27;Univers&quot;. His methods of journalism, which made great use of irony and ad hominem criticism, had already provoked more than one duel, and he was imprisoned for a brief time for his polemics against the University of Paris. In 1848, he became editor of the newspaper, which was suppressed in 1860, but revived in 1867, when Veuillot resumed his ultramontane propaganda, causing a second suppression of his journal in 1874. Veuillot then occupied himself by writing polemical pamphlets against liberal Catholics, the Second French Empire and the Italian government. 
His services to the papal see were recognized by Pope Pius IX, on whom he wrote (1878) a monograph. 
Matthew Arnold said of him:

M. Louis Veuillot is a polemic worthy of the golden age of polemics. He is singly devoted to ultramontanism; he lives on a small fixed salary from the proprietors of the &quot;Univers;&quot; he is a man of the purest and simplest domestic life; he is poor, and has a large family, but he has refused all offers of place and salary from the government, and maintains his entire independence.

And Orestes Brownson wrote:

[Veuillot] manifests the temper and breeding of a fanatic, and seems to act on the principle that whoever differs on any important point in history, politics, or philosophy, from himself, must needs be a bad Catholic, or no Catholic at all. We question not his sincerity, we question not his personal piety; but we do question his qualification to be a Catholic leader. His mind is too narrow and one-sided for that, and his leadership, with the best intentions on his part, is fitted only to bring about the very results he most deprecates. Notwithstanding his hostility to those who regret the loss of parliamentary freedom, and his devotion to Imperialism, he has not been able to save his journal from an &quot;avertissement&quot;; and it would seem that, after having aided in erecting an Absolute government for his country, and in breaking down all the safeguards established by constitutionalism to freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and public discussion, the police have had the cruelty to take him at his word, and give him a taste of the despotism he has been willing to fasten upon others.

Some of his papers were collected in &quot;Mélanges Religieux, Historiques et Littéraires&quot; (12 vols., 1857–1875), and his &quot;&quot; (7 vols., 1883–85) has great political interest. His younger brother, Eugène Veuillot, published (1901–1904) a comprehensive and valuable life, &quot;Louis Veuillot&quot;.

After the First Vatican Council, Veuillot&#x27;s influence began to wane. In 1879 Pope Pius IX released a letter praising him, but also regretting his &quot;bitter zeal&quot; in advocating his views. Among the lower clergy Veuillot retained influence. Politically he returned to advocating the restorations of the Bourbon Monarchy under Henri, Count of Chambord.

==Anti-Semitism==
Veuillot was a virulent anti-Semite. As early as the 1840s, he wrote articles in &quot;L&#x27;Univers&quot; defaming Jews, portraying them as alien vagabonds, accusing them of blood libel, and asserting that the Talmud commanded Jews to hate all Christians. He contemptuously dismissed Jews who criticized him as &quot;the deicide people&quot;, claiming they were a foreign element which plotted to control all of French society. Veuillot&#x27;s hatred intensified during the Mortara case to the point where it put him at odds with Napoleon III whom he had previously supported, causing the latter to temporarily suppress the journal. Veuillot&#x27;s two-pronged assault on the Jews and liberalism would influence the anti-Semitism of Édouard Drumont, who worked for &quot;L&#x27;Univers&quot; in his youth. Drumont, who in his turn was an employer of Charles Maurras, was admired by Karl Lueger, whom Adolf Hitler acknowledged as an influence in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

==Legacy==
A misattributed quote to Veuillot, &quot;When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles&quot;, is quoted in Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune.

<text>Dying is the final stage of life which will eventually lead to death. Diagnosing dying is a complex process of clinical decision-making, and most practice checklists facilitating this diagnosis are based on cancer diagnoses.

== Signs of dying ==

The National Cancer Institute in the United States advises that the presence of some of the following signs may indicate that death is approaching:

* Drowsiness, increased sleep, and/or unresponsiveness (caused by changes in the patient&#x27;s metabolism).
* Confusion about time, place, and/or identity of loved ones; restlessness; visions of people and places that are not present; pulling at bed linens or clothing (caused in part by changes in the patient&#x27;s metabolism).
* Decreased socialization and withdrawal (caused by decreased oxygen to the brain, decreased blood flow, and mental preparation for dying).
* Decreased need for food and fluids, and loss of appetite (caused by the body&#x27;s need to conserve energy and its decreasing ability to use food and fluids properly).
* Loss of bladder or bowel control (caused by the relaxing of muscles in the pelvic area).
* Darkened urine or decreased amount of urine (caused by slowing of kidney function and/or decreased fluid intake).
* Skin becoming cool to the touch, particularly the hands and feet; skin may become bluish in color, especially on the underside of the body (caused by decreased circulation to the extremities).
* Rattling or gurgling sounds while breathing, which may be loud (death rattle); breathing that is irregular and shallow; decreased number of breaths per minute; breathing that alternates between rapid and slow (caused by congestion from decreased fluid consumption, a buildup of waste products in the body, and/or a decrease in circulation to the organs).
* Turning of the head toward a light source (caused by decreasing vision).
* Increased difficulty controlling pain (caused by progression of the disease).
* Involuntary movements (called myoclonus), increased heart rate, hypertension followed by hypotension, and loss of reflexes in the legs and arms are additional signs that the end of life is near.

== Cultural perspectives on dying ==
How humans understand and approach the process dying differs across cultures. In some cultures, death is the complete termination of life. In other cultures, death can include altered states of being, like sleep or illness. In some traditions, death marks the transition into a different kind of existence, or involves reincarnation, a cyclic pattern of death and rebirth. These cultural differences affect people&#x27;s lifestyles, behaviors, and approach to death and dying.

=== United States ===
In the United States, a pervasive &quot;death-defying&quot; culture leads to resistance against the process of dying. Death and illness are often conceived as things to &quot;fight against&quot;, with conversations about death and dying considered morbid or taboo. Most people die in a hospital or nursing facility, with only around 30% dying at home. As the United States is a culturally diverse nation, attitudes towards death and dying vary according to cultural and spiritual factors.

=== China ===
In Chinese culture, death is viewed as the end of life — there is no afterlife — resulting in negative perceptions of dying. These attitudes towards death and dying originate from the three dominant religions in China: Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.

=== South Pacific ===
In some cultures of the South Pacific, life is believed to leave a person&#x27;s body when they are sick or asleep, making for multiple &quot;deaths&quot; in the span of one lifetime.

== Religious perspectives on dying ==

=== Christianity ===
In Christian belief, most people agree that believers will only experience death once; however, various traditions hold different beliefs about what happens during the intermediate state, the period between death and the universal resurrection. For many traditions, death is the separation of body and soul, so the soul continues to exist in a disembodied state. Other traditions believe that the soul and body are inseparable, meaning that the body&#x27;s death renders the soul unconscious until the resurrection. Others believe that the spirit leaves the body to exist in heaven or hell.

=== Islam ===

In Islamic belief, the time of death is predetermined, with dying therefore perceived as the will of Allah. Dying is therefore considered as something to be accepted, with Muslims regularly encouraged to reflect upon death and dying. The majority of Muslims prefer to die at home, surrounded by their loved ones, with large numbers expected at the bedside of those who are dying.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hinduism, people are believed to die and be reborn with a new identity.

=== Buddhism ===
In Chinese Buddhism, it is said that dying patients will experience phases between the state of torment and the state of exultation, and that caretaker must help the dying patient remain in the state of exultation through Nianfo prayers. In some parts of Buddhism, the dead and living exist together, with the former having power and influence over the lives of the latter.

== Medicalization ==

=== Resuscitation ===
Resuscitation is the act of reviving of someone and is performed when someone is unconscious or dying. Resuscitation is performed using a variety of techniques; of these, the most common is cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR is a procedure consisting of cycles of chest compressions and ventilation support with the goal of maintaining blood flow and oxygen to the vital organs of the body. Defibrillation, or shock, is also provided following CPR in an attempt to jump start the heart. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are often the first to administer CPR to patients outside of the hospital. Although EMS is not able to pronounce death, they are asked to determine the presence of clear signs of death and gauge whether CPR should be attempted or not. CPR is not indicated if the provider is at risk of harm or injury while attempting CPR, if clear signs of death are present (rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation, transection, decomposition, etc.), or if the patient is exempt from resuscitation. Exemption is typically the case when the patient has an advanced directive, a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form indicating that resuscitation is not desired, or a valid Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) order.

=== End-of-life care ===
End-of-life care is oriented towards a natural stage in the process of living, unlike other conditions. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) states that hospice care or end-of-life care begins when curative treatments are no longer possible, and a person is diagnosed with a terminal illness with less than six months to live. Hospice care involves palliative care aimed at providing comfort for patients and support for loved ones. This process integrates medical care, pain management, as well as social and emotional support provided by social workers and other members of the healthcare team including family physicians, nurses, counselors, trained volunteers, and home health aides. Hospice care is associated with enhanced symptom relief, facilitates achievement of end-of-life wishes, and results in higher quality of end-of-life care compared with standard care involving extensive hospitalization.

== Psychological adjustment processes ==
When a person realizes that their life is threatened by a fatal illness, they come to terms with it and with their approaching end. This confrontation has been described in diaries, autobiographies, medical reports, novels, and also in poetry. Since the middle of the 20th century, the &quot;fight&quot; against death has been researched in the social sciences on the basis of empirical data and field studies field research. The developed theories and models are intended to serve helpers in the accompaniment of terminally ill people above anything else.

The theories of dying describe psychosocial aspects of dying as well as models for the dying process. Particularly highlighted psychosocial aspects are: Total Pain (C. Saunders), Acceptance (J. M. Hinton, Kübler-Ross), Awareness/Insecurity (B.Glaser, A.Strauß), Response to Challenges (E.S.Shneidman), Appropriateness (A. D. Weisman), Autonomy (H.Müller-Busch), Fear (R. Kastenbaum, G.D.Borasio) and Ambivalence (E. Engelke).

===Phase and stage models===
There have been many phase and stage models for the course of dying developed from a psychological and psychosocial perspective. A distinction is made between three and twelve phases that a dying person goes through.

A more recently developed and revised phase model is the &quot;Illness Constellation Model&quot;, first published in 1991. The phases are associated with shock, dizziness, and uncertainty at the first symptoms and diagnosis; changing emotional states and thoughts, efforts to maintain control over one&#x27;s own life; withdrawal, grief over lost abilities, and suffering from the imminent loss of one&#x27;s own existence; finally psycho-physical decline.

The best known is the &quot;Five stages of Grief Model&quot; developed by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a Swiss-US psychiatrist. In her work, Kübler-Ross compiled various preexisting findings of Thanatology published by John Hinton, Cicely Saunders, Barney G. Glaser and Anselm L. Strauss and others. Because of this, she brought the public&#x27;s attention to it more than it previously received, which has continued to this day. She focused on the treatment of the dying, with grief and mourning, as well as with studies on death and near-death experiences. The five stages in this model are the following: &quot;Denial and Isolation&quot;, &quot;Anger&quot;, &quot;Bargaining&quot;, &quot;Depression&quot;, and &quot;Consent&quot;. According to Kübler-Ross, hope is almost always present in each of the five phases, suggesting that the patients never completely give up and that hope must not be taken away from them. Loss of hope is soon followed by death, and the fear of death can only be overcome by everyone starting with themselves and accepting their own death, according to Kübler-Ross.
From Kübler-Ross&#x27;s research, psychiatrists have set new impulses for dealing with dying and grieving people. Her key message was that the people aiding must first clarify their own fears and life problems (&quot;unfinished business&quot;) as far as possible and accept their own death before they can turn to the dying in a helpful way. 
The five phases of dying were extracted by Kübler-Ross from interviews of terminally ill people describing psychological adjustment processes in the dying process. The five phases are widely referred to, although Kübler-Ross herself critically questions the validity of her phase model several times. Some of her self-critiques include the following: The phases are not experienced in a fixed order one after the other, but they can alternate or repeat; some phases may not be experienced at all; a final acceptance of one&#x27;s own dying may not take place in every case. In end-of-life care, space is given to psychological conflict, but coping with the phases can rarely be influenced from the outside.

In international research on dying, there are a number of scientifically based objections to the phase model and to models that describe dying in terms of staged behaviors in general. Above all, the naïve use of the phase model is viewed critically and even in specialist books, hope–a central aspect of the phase model for Kübler-Ross–is not mentioned.

===Influencing factors===
The scientifically based criticism of phase models has led to forgoing defying the dying process in stages, and instead to elaborating on factors that influence the course of dying. 
Based on research findings from several sciences, Robert J. Kastenbaum says, &quot;Individuality and universality combine in dying.&quot;
In Kastenbaum&#x27;s model, individual and societal attitudes influence our dying and how we deal with knowledge about dying and death. Influencing factors are age, gender, interpersonal relationships, the type of illness, the environment in which treatment takes place, religion, and culture. This model is the personal reality of the dying person, where fear, refusal, and acceptance form the core of the dying person&#x27;s confrontation with death.

Ernst Engelke took up Kastenbaum&#x27;s approach and developed it further with the thesis, &quot;Just as each person&#x27;s life is unique, so is their death unique. Nevertheless, there are similarities in the death of all people. According to this, all terminally ill people have in common that they are confronted with realizations, responsibilities, and constraints that are typical of dying.&quot; For example, a characteristic realization is that the illness is threatening their life. Typical constraints result from the disease, therapies, and side effects. In Engelke&#x27;s model, the personal and unique aspects of death result from the interaction of many factors in coping with the realizations, responsibilities, and constraints. Important factors include the following: the genetic make-up, personality, life experience, physical, psychological, social, financial, religious, and spiritual resources; the type, degree, and duration of the disease, the consequences and side effects of treatment, the quality of medical treatment and care, the material surroundings (i.e. furnishings of the apartment, clinic, home); and the expectations, norms, and behavior of relatives, carers, doctors and the public. According to Engelke, the complexity of dying and the uniqueness of each dying person creates guidelines for communication with dying people.

=== Awareness ===
Along with medical professionals and relatives, sociologists and psychologists also engage in the question of whether it is ethical to inform terminally ill patients of the infaust prognosis, or the uncertain diagnosis. In 1965, the sociologists Barney G. Glaser and Anselm Strauss published the results of empirical studies where they derived four different types of Awareness of dying patients: &quot;Closed Awareness&quot;, &quot;Suspected Awareness&quot;, &quot;Mutual Pretense Awareness&quot;, and &quot;Open Awareness&quot;. In &quot;Closed Awareness&quot;, only relatives, caregivers, and medical professionals recognize the patient&#x27;s condition; the patient themselves does not recognize their dying. In &quot;Suspected Awareness&quot;, the patient suspects what those around him know, but they are not told by relatives or medical professionals. In &quot;Mutual Pretense Awareness&quot;, all participants know about that the person is dying, but they behave as if they did not know. In &quot;Open Awareness&quot;, all participants behave according to their knowledge.

The Hospice Movement in the United Kingdom in particular has since advocated for open, truthful and trustful interaction. The situation does not become easier for all involved if difficult conversations are avoided; rather it intensifies and possibly leads to a disturbed relationship of trust between people, which makes further treatment more difficult or impossible.

<text>Henry Edward Manning (15 July 1808 – 14 January 1892) was an English prelate of the Catholic Church, and the second Archbishop of Westminster from 1865 until his death in 1892. He was ordained in the Church of England as a young man, but converted to Catholicism in the aftermath of the Gorham judgement.

==Early life==

Manning was born on 15 July 1808 at his grandfather&#x27;s home, Copped Hall, Totteridge, Hertfordshire. He was the third and youngest son of William Manning, a prominent merchant and slave owner, who served as a director and (1812–1813) as a governor of the Bank of England and also sat in Parliament for 30 years, representing in the Tory interest Plympton Earle, Lymington, Evesham and Penryn consecutively. Manning&#x27;s mother, Mary (died 1847), daughter of Henry Lannoy Hunter, of Beech Hill, and sister of Sir Claudius Stephen Hunter, 1st Baronet, came from a family of French Huguenot extraction.

Manning spent his boyhood mainly at Coombe Bank, Sundridge, Kent, where he had for companions Charles Wordsworth and Christopher Wordsworth, later bishops of St Andrews and Lincoln respectively. He attended Harrow School (1822–1827) during the headmastership of George Butler, but obtained no distinction beyond playing for two years in the cricket eleven. However, this proved to be no impediment to his academic career.

Manning matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1827, studying Classics, and soon made his mark as a debater at the Oxford Union, where William Ewart Gladstone succeeded him as president in 1830. At this date he had ambitions of a political career, but his father had sustained severe losses in business and, in these circumstances, having graduated with first-class honours in 1830, he obtained the year following, through the 1st Viscount Goderich, a post as a clerk in the Colonial Office. Manning resigned from this position in 1832, his thoughts having turned towards a clerical career under Evangelical influences, including his friendship with Favell Lee Mortimer, which affected him deeply throughout life.

==Anglican cleric==
Returning to Oxford in 1832, he gained election as a fellow of Merton College and received ordination as a deacon in the Church of England. In January 1833 he became curate to John Sargent, Rector of Lavington-with-Graffham, West Sussex. In May 1833, following Sargent&#x27;s death, he succeeded him as rector due to the patronage of Sargent&#x27;s mother.
Manning married Caroline, John Sargent&#x27;s daughter, on 7 November 1833, in a ceremony performed by the bride&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Revd Samuel Wilberforce, later Bishop of Oxford and Winchester. Manning&#x27;s marriage did not last long: his young wife came of a consumptive family and died childless on 24 July 1837. Upon his death more than half a century later, a locket containing Caroline&#x27;s picture was found on a chain around Manning&#x27;s neck, by then a celibate Catholic cleric of many decades.

Though he never became an acknowledged disciple of John Henry Newman (later Cardinal Newman), the latter&#x27;s influence meant that from this date Manning&#x27;s theology assumed an increasingly High Church character and his printed sermon on the &quot;Rule of Faith&quot; publicly signalled his alliance with the Tractarians.

In 1838 he took a leading part in the church education movement, by which diocesan boards were established throughout the country; and he wrote an open letter to his bishop in criticism of the recent appointment of the ecclesiastical commission. In December of that year he paid his first visit to Rome and called on Nicholas Wiseman, the Rector of the English College, in company with Gladstone.

In January 1841 Philip Shuttleworth, Bishop of Chichester, appointed Manning as the Archdeacon of Chichester, whereupon he began a personal visitation of each parish within his district, completing the task in 1843. In 1842 he published a treatise on &quot;The Unity of the Church&quot; and his reputation as an eloquent and earnest preacher being by this time considerable, he was in the same year appointed select preacher by his university, thus being called upon to fill from time to time the pulpit which Newman, as vicar of St Mary&#x27;s, was just ceasing to occupy.

Four volumes of Manning&#x27;s sermons appeared between the years 1842 and 1850 and these had reached the 7th, 4th, 3rd and 2nd editions respectively in 1850, but were not afterwards reprinted. In 1844 his portrait was painted by George Richmond, and the same year he published a volume of university sermons, omitting the one on the &quot;Gunpowder Plot&quot;. This sermon had annoyed Newman and his more advanced disciples, but it was proof that at that date Manning was loyal to the Church of England.

Newman&#x27;s secession in 1845 placed Manning in a position of greater responsibility, as one of the High Church leaders, along with Edward Bouverie Pusey, John Keble and Marriott; but it was with Gladstone and James Robert Hope-Scott that he was at this time most closely associated.

== Conversion to Catholicism ==
Manning&#x27;s belief in Anglicanism was shattered in 1850 when, in the so-called Gorham judgement, the Privy Council ordered the Church of England to institute an evangelical cleric who denied that the sacrament of baptism had an objective effect of baptismal regeneration. The denial of the objective effect of the sacraments was to Manning and many others a grave heresy, contradicting the clear tradition of the Christian Church from the Church Fathers on. That a civil and secular court had the power to force the Church of England to accept someone with such an unorthodox opinion proved to him that, far from being a divinely created institution, the Anglican Communion was a man-made creation and, even worse in his views, still completely controlled by Her Majesty&#x27;s Government.

The following year, on 6 April 1851, Manning was received into the Catholic Church in England and then studied at the academia in Rome where he took his doctorate, and on 14 June 1851 was ordained a Catholic priest at the Jesuit Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street. Given his great abilities and prior fame, he quickly rose to a position of influence. He served as provost of the cathedral chapter under Cardinal Wiseman.

In 1857, he established at Wiseman&#x27;s direction the mission of St Mary of the Angels, Bayswater, to serve labourers building Paddington Station. There he founded, at Wiseman&#x27;s request, the Congregation of the Oblates of St. Charles. This new community of secular priests was the joint work of Cardinal Wiseman and Manning, for both had independently conceived of the idea of a community of this kind, and Manning had studied the life and work of Charles Borromeo in his Anglican days at Lavington and had, moreover, visited the Oblates at Milan, in 1856, to satisfy himself that their rule could be adapted to the needs of Westminster. Manning became superior of the congregation.

==Archbishop==
In 1865 he was appointed Archbishop of Westminster. 

Among his accomplishments as head of the Catholic Church in England were the acquisition of the site for Westminster Cathedral, but his focus was on a greatly expanded system of Catholic education, including the establishment of the short-lived Catholic University College in Kensington. 

In 1875 Manning was created Cardinal-Priest of Ss Andrea e Gregorio al Monte Celio. Manning participated in the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIII in 1878.

Manning approved the founding of the Catholic Association Pilgrimage.

== Influence on social justice teaching ==
Manning was very influential in setting the direction of the modern Catholic Church. His warm relations with Pope Pius IX and his ultramontane views gained him the trust of the Vatican, though &quot;it was ordained that he should pass the evening of his days in England, and that he should outlive his intimacy at the Vatican and his influence on the general policy of the Church of Rome&quot;.

Manning used this goodwill to promote a modern Catholic view of social justice. Several scholars consider Manning to be a key contributor to the papal encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; issued by Pope Leo XIII, which marks the beginning of modern Catholic social justice teaching.

For a portion of 1870, he was in Rome attending the First Vatican Council. Manning was among the strongest supporters of the doctrine of papal infallibility, unlike Cardinal Newman who believed the doctrine but thought it might not be prudent to define it formally at the time. (For a comparison of Manning and Newman, see the section entitled &quot;Relationships with other converts&quot; in the article on Cardinal Newman.)

In 1888, Manning was interviewed by social activist and journalist Virginia Crawford, a fellow English Catholic, for &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, and was instrumental in settling the London dock strike of 1889 at the behest of Margaret Harkness. He played a significant role in the conversion of other notable figures including Elizabeth Belloc, mother of famous British author Hilaire Belloc, upon whose thinking Manning had a profound influence. Manning did not, however, support enfranchising women. In 1871, at St. Mary Moorfield, he said he hoped English womanhood would &quot;resist by a stern moral refusal, the immodesty which would thrust women from their private life of dignity and supremacy into the public conflicts of men.&quot;

== View of the priesthood ==
In 1883, Manning published &quot;The Eternal Priesthood&quot;, his most influential work. In the book, Manning defended an elevated idea of the priesthood as, &quot;in and of itself, an outstanding way to perfection, and even a &#x27;state of perfection&#x27;&quot;. In comparison to his polemical writings, &quot;The Eternal Priesthood&quot; is &quot;austere&quot; and &quot;glacial&quot;, arguing for a rigorous conception of the moral duties of the office. Manning additionally stressed the social function of the priest, who must be more to his community than a dispenser of the sacraments.

==Animal welfare==

Manning was an anti-vivisectionist and founding member of the Victoria Street Society for the Protection of Animals from Vivisection. He was a vice-president of the Society. At the annual meeting of the Victoria Street Society in June 1881, he denounced vivisection as inhumane and of doubtful benefit to science. In 1887, Manning commented that vivisection is not &quot;the way that the all-wise and all-good maker of us all has ordained for the discovery of the healing arts&quot;.

== Death and burial ==
Manning died on 14 January 1892, at which time his estate was probated at £3,527. He received a formal burial at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery in Kensal Green. Some years later, in 1907, his remains were transferred to the newly completed Westminster Cathedral.

<text>Nicholas Patrick Stephen Wiseman (3 August 1802 – 15 February 1865) was an English Catholic prelate who served as the first Archbishop of Westminster upon the re-establishment of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales in 1850. He was made a cardinal in 1850.

Born in Seville to Irish parents, Wiseman was educated at a school in Waterford before attending St. Cuthbert&#x27;s College at Ushaw. From there he went to the English College in Rome, where he subsequently became Rector. While in Rome, he was assigned to preach to the English Catholics there. As Rector, he was the representative of the English bishops. During a visit to England in 1836, he helped initiate the periodical &quot;Dublin Review&quot;. In 1840, he was appointed president of Oscott College.

==Early life==

Wiseman was born in Seville on 2 February 1802, the younger son of merchant James Wiseman and his second wife, Xaviera (née Strange), of Waterford, Ireland, who had settled in Spain for business. On his father&#x27;s death in 1805, he was brought to his parents&#x27; home in Waterford. In 1810, he was sent to Ushaw College, near Durham, where he was educated until the age of sixteen. Wiseman would later recall that John Lingard, Vice-President of the college at the time, showed the quiet, retiring boy much kindness. In 1818, Wiseman proceeded to the English College in Rome, which had reopened in 1818 after being closed by the Napoleonic Wars for twenty years. He graduated with a doctorate of theology with distinction in July 1824, and was ordained to the priesthood 10 March 1825.

He was appointed vice-rector of the English College in 1827, and rector in 1828, although he was not yet twenty-six years of age. He had this office until 1840. From the first a devoted student and scholar of antiquity, he devoted much time to the examination of Oriental manuscripts in the Vatican library, and a first volume, entitled &quot;Horae Syriacae&quot;, published in 1827, showed that he had promise as a good scholar.

Pope Leo XII (r. 1823–1829) appointed him curator of the Arabic manuscripts in the Vatican, and professor of Oriental languages in the Roman University. His academic life was, however, interrupted by the pope&#x27;s command to preach to English residents of Rome. A course of his lectures, &quot;On the Connexion between Science and Revealed Religion&quot;, attracted much attention. His general thesis was that whereas scientific teaching had repeatedly been thought to disprove Christian doctrine, further investigation has shown that reconciliation is possible. It is much to Wiseman&#x27;s credit that his lectures on the relationship between religion and science were approved by a critic as stern as Andrew Dickson White. In his extremely influential &quot;A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom&quot;, the primary contention of which was the conflict thesis, White wrote that &quot;it is a duty and a pleasure to state here that one great Christian scholar did honour to religion and to himself by quietly accepting the claims of science and making the best of them... That man was Nicholas Wiseman, better known afterward as Cardinal Wiseman. The conduct of this pillar of the Church contrasts admirably with that of timid Protestants, who were filling England with shrieks and denunciations&quot;.

==England==
Wiseman visited England during 1835–1836 and delivered lectures on the principles and main doctrines of Catholicism in the Sardinian Chapel, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, and in the church in Moorfields. The effect of his lectures was considerable. At Edward Bouverie Pusey&#x27;s request, John Henry Newman reviewed them in the periodical &quot;British Critic&quot; during December 1836, treating them for the most part with sympathy as a triumph over popular Protestantism. To another critic, who had claimed a resemblance between Catholic and pagan ceremonies, Wiseman replied admitting the likeness, and saying that it could be shown equally well to exist between Christian and non-Christian doctrines.

In 1836, Wiseman initiated the periodical &quot;Dublin Review&quot;, partly to give English Catholics greater ideals for their religion and enthusiasm for the papacy, and partly to deal with the Oxford Movement. In 1916 the name was changed to the &quot;Wiseman Review&quot;. At this date he was already distinguished as a scholar and critic, fluent in many languages, and informed on questions of scientific, artistic or historical interest.

An article by Wiseman on the Donatist schism, appearing in the &quot;Dublin Review&quot; in July 1839, made an impression in Oxford, Newman and others seeing the analogy between Donatists and Anglicans. Wiseman, preaching at the opening of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Derby, in the same year, anticipated Newman&#x27;s argument on religious development, published six years later. In 1840, he was consecrated bishop, and was sent to England as coadjutor to Bishop Thomas Walsh, vicar-apostolic of the Central district, and was also appointed president of Oscott College near Birmingham.

Oscott, during his presidency, became a centre for English Catholics. The Oxford converts (1845 and later) added to Wiseman&#x27;s responsibilities, as many of them found themselves wholly without means, while the old Catholic body looked on the newcomers with distrust. It was by his advice that Newman and his companions spent some time in Rome before undertaking clerical work in England. Soon after the accession of Pope Pius IX, Bishop Walsh was assigned to be vicar-apostolic of the London district with Wiseman still as his coadjutor. For Wiseman, the appointment became permanent on Walsh&#x27;s death in February 1849.

On his arrival from Rome in 1847, Wiseman acted as an informal diplomatic envoy from the pope, to ascertain from the government what assistance England was likely to give in implementing the liberal policy with which Pius inaugurated his reign. In response, Lord Minto was sent to Rome as &quot;an authentic organ of the British Government&quot;, but the policy in question proved abortive. Residing in London in Golden Square, Wiseman threw himself into his new duties with many-sided activities, working especially for the reclamation of Catholic criminals and for the restoration of the lapsed poor to the practice of their religion. He was zealous for the establishment of religious communities, both of men and women, and for performing retreats and missions. He preached on 4 July 1848 at the opening of St George&#x27;s, Southwark, an occasion unique in England since the Reformation, 14 bishops and 240 priests being present, and six religious orders of men being represented.

==Cardinal==

The progress of Catholicism was undeniable, but Wiseman found himself opposed by a minority among his own clergy, who disliked his ultramontane ideas of his &quot;Romanizing and innovating zeal&quot;, especially in regard to the introduction of sacred images into the churches and the use of devotions to the Blessed Virgin and the Blessed Sacrament, lately forgotten among English Catholics. In July 1850, Wiseman heard of the pope&#x27;s intention to create him a cardinal, and took this to mean that he was to be permanently recalled to Rome. But on his arrival, he ascertained that a part of the pope&#x27;s plan for restoring a diocesan hierarchy in England was that he himself should return to England as cardinal and archbishop of Westminster. The papal brief establishing the hierarchy, &quot;Universalis Ecclesiae&quot;, was dated 29 September 1850, and Wiseman wrote a pastoral, dated &quot;Given out of the Flaminian Gate of Rome, this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord MDCCCL&quot;, a form diplomatically correct, but of bombastic tone for Protestant ears, in which he said enthusiastically, &quot;Catholic England has been restored to its orbit in the ecclesiastical firmament, from which its light had long vanished&quot;.

Wiseman travelled slowly to England, via Vienna. When he reached London on 11 November, the whole country was ablaze with indignation at the &quot;papal aggression,&quot; which was interpreted to imply a new and unjustifiable claim to territorial rule. Some indeed feared that his life was endangered by the violence of popular feeling. Wiseman displayed calmness and courage, and immediately penned a pamphlet of over 30 pages titled &quot;Appeal to the English People&quot;, in which he explained the nature of the pope&#x27;s action. He argued that the admitted principle of toleration included leave to establish a diocesan hierarchy. In his concluding paragraphs, he effectively contrasted that dominion over Westminster, which he was taunted with claiming, with his duties towards the poor Catholics resident there, with which alone he was really concerned. A course of lectures at St George&#x27;s, Southwark, further moderated the storm. In July 1852, he presided at St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott over the first provincial synod of Westminster, at which Newman preached his sermon on the &quot;Second Spring&quot;; and at this date, Wiseman&#x27;s dream of the rapid conversion of England to the ancient faith seemed capable of realisation. But many difficulties with his own people shortly beset his path, due largely to the suspicions aroused by his evident preference for the ardent Roman zeal of the converts, and especially of Manning, to the dull and cautious formalism of the old Catholics.

During the autumn of 1853, Wiseman went to Rome, where Pius IX gave full approval to his ecclesiastical policy. It was during this visit to Rome that Wiseman projected, and began to write, the most popular book that he ever wrote, the historical romance, &quot;Fabiola&quot;, a tale of the Church of the Catacombs. The book was published at the end of 1854, and its success was immediate and phenomenal. Translations of it were published in almost every European language. Wiseman wrote &quot;Fabiola&quot; in part as an answer to the vigorously anti-Catholic book &quot;Hypatia&quot; (1853) by Charles Kingsley. The novel was mainly intended the aid the embattled Catholic minority in England.

The year 1854 was also marked by Wiseman&#x27;s presence in Rome at the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin on 8 December.
In 1855, Wiseman applied for a coadjutor bishop. George Errington, who was then Bishop of Plymouth and his friend since boyhood, was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Westminster and Titular Archbishop of Trapezus. Two years later, Manning was appointed Provost of Westminster. During Wiseman&#x27;s later years Errington was hostile to Manning, and to himself insofar as he was supposed to be influenced by Manning. The story of the estrangement, which was largely a matter of temperament, is told in Ward&#x27;s biography. In July 1860 Errington was deprived by the Pope of his coadjutorship with right of succession. He retired to Prior Park, near Bath, where he died in 1886.

Wiseman&#x27;s speeches, sermons and lectures, delivered during his tour, were printed in a volume of 400 pages, showing an extraordinary power of speaking with sympathy and tact. He was able to use considerable influence with English politicians, partly because in his time English Catholics were wavering in their historical allegiance to the Liberal party. He was in a position to secure concessions that bettered the condition of Catholics in regard to poor schools, reformatories and workhouses, and in the status of their army chaplains. In 1863, addressing the Catholic Congress in Mechelen, he stated that since 1830 the number of priests in England had increased from 434 to 1242, and of convents of women from 16 to 162, while there were no religious houses of men in 1830 and 55 in 1863. The last two years of his life were troubled by illness and by controversies in which he found himself, by Manning&#x27;s influence, compelled to adopt a policy less liberal than that which had been his during earlier years.

Wiseman had to condemn the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom, with which he had shown some sympathy at its inception during 1857, and to forbid Catholic parents to send their sons to Oxford or Cambridge, though at an earlier date he had hoped (with Newman) that at Oxford at least a college or hall might be assigned to them. In other respects, however, his last years were cheered by marks of general regard and admiration, in which non-Catholics joined. After his death on 16 February 1865, there was an extraordinary demonstration of popular respect as his body was taken from St Mary&#x27;s, Moorfields, to St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery in Kensal Green, where it was intended that it should rest only until a more appropriate place could be found in a Catholic cathedral church of Westminster. On 30 January 1907, the body was removed with great ceremony from Kensal Green and was reburied in the crypt of the new cathedral, where it lies beneath a Gothic altar tomb, with a recumbent effigy of the archbishop in full pontificals.

Wiseman&#x27;s birthplace on Calle Fabiola in Barrio Santa Cruz, the old Jewish part of Seville, features a commemorative plaque, as does Etloe House in Leyton, London E10, where he lived from 1858 to 1864.

==Quotes==
&quot;The doctrine and practice of the Church must not be allowed to be impugned by those who have no claim at all to Scripture, and who can prove neither the canon, its inspiration, nor its primary doctrines, except through that very authority which they are questioning, and through treacherous inconsistency with the principles on which they are interrogating it. When many years ago this ground was boldly adopted, it was charged with being an attempt to throw Protestants into infidelity, and sap the foundations of the Bible. Years of experience, and observation not superficial, have only strengthened our conviction, that this course must be fearlessly pursued. We must deny to Protestantism any right to use the Bible, much more to interpret it. Cruel and unfeeling it may be pronounced by those who understand the strength of our position, and the cogency of the argument, but it is much more charitable than to leave them to the repeated sin of blaspheming God&#x27;s Spouse and trying to undermine the faith of our poor Catholics. The cry of &#x27;The Bible! [T]he Bible! [N]othing but the Bible!&#x27; is as perilous to man&#x27;s salvation as the Jews&#x27; senseless cry, &#x27;The Temple of the Lord! [T]he Temple of the Lord! [T]he Temple of the Lord it is!&#x27; ()&quot;

==Artistic recognition==

Wiseman was sculpted by Christopher Moore during 1853.

In Robert Browning&#x27;s 1855 poem &quot;Bishop Blougram&#x27;s Apology&quot;, the speaker, a somewhat hypocritical English Catholic cleric, is based on Wiseman.

==Schools==
Several schools have been named after Wiseman, including:

*The Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School, Greenford, a high school located in Greenford, West London. It was originally opened in 1959 as a special agreement school catering for 456 boys and girls aged 11–15 years.
*Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School, Birmingham, a Catholic secondary school, in Birmingham, England.
*Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School, Coventry, a Catholic secondary school in Coventry, England.

<text>&#x27;, abbreviated HS&quot;&quot;&#x27; and colloquially known as , is the largest subscription newspaper in Finland and the Nordic countries, owned by Sanoma. Except after certain holidays, it is published daily. Its name derives from that of the Finnish capital, Helsinki, where it is published. It is considered a newspaper of record for Finland.

==History and profile==

The paper was founded in 1889 as &quot;Päivälehti&quot;, when Finland was a Grand Duchy under the Tsar of Russia.

Political censorship by the Russian authorities, prompted by the paper&#x27;s strong advocacy of greater Finnish freedoms and even outright independence, forced Päivälehti to often temporarily suspend publication, and finally to close permanently in 1904. Its proprietors re-opened the paper under its current name in 1905.

Founded as the organ of the Young Finnish Party, the paper has been politically independent and non-aligned since 1932. During the Cold War period was among the Finnish newspapers which were accused by the Soviet Union of being the instrument of US propaganda, and the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki frequently protested the editors of the paper.

 has a long history as a family business, owned by the Erkko family. It is currently owned by the Sanoma media group which also owns &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot;. The relationship between the owners of and Finland&#x27;s government have sometimes been close. For instance, during the run-up to the Winter War, Eljas Erkko was at the same time the paper&#x27;s publisher and Finland&#x27;s foreign minister.

 strongly advocated Finland joining the European Union in the run-up to the decision to do so in 1994. It has also openly expressed support for Finland&#x27;s membership of NATO. 

Mikael Pentikäinen was the editor-in-chief until May 2013 when he was fired from the post. Riikka Venäläinen replaced him temporarily in the post. After Riikka Venäläinen the post has been held by Kaius Niemi.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the newspaper established a Russian-language news website to cover the war. In May 2022, Russian authorities blocked access to the website of the newspaper.

On 5 April 2023, editor-in-chief Kaius Niemi was arrested for driving under the influence. He was fined in court and resigned from his post. Erja Yläjärvi became the new editor-in-chief in August.

==Format==
 is published daily in Finnish in compact format with the exception of the days after public holidays when the paper does not appear. Subscriptions make up 97% of the newspaper&#x27;s circulation. The front page is usually devoted to advertisements.

The newspaper was published in broadsheet format until 6 January 2013.

The paper also has a monthly supplement named &quot;Kuukausiliite&quot; (Finnish for &quot;Monthly Supplement&quot;), and a weekly TV guide and entertainment-oriented supplement named &quot;Nyt&quot; (meaning &quot;Now&quot; in English). Between 1999 and 2012 there were also both Finnish and English-language online newspaper editions.

Content of can be accessed also through mobile devices.

==Circulation and influence==

The circulation of was 476,163 copies in 1993, making it the most read newspaper in Finland. In the period of 1995–96 the paper sold 470,600 copies. Its circulation was 446,380 copies in 2001, making it the largest paper in the country. In 2008 the paper sold 412,421 on weekdays (a change of −1.8% from 2007) and 468,505 copies on Sundays (−1.3%). In 2011 the daily had a circulation of 365,994 copies, making it the most read paper in the country. The same year it was also the largest paper in terms of readership.

Approximately 75% of households in the Helsinki metropolitan area subscribe to , and it functions as the region&#x27;s local paper. Its total daily circulation is well over 400,000, or about 8% of Finland&#x27;s total population, making it the biggest daily subscription newspaper in the Nordic countries. This reaches about 14% of all households in Finland.

The paper is a significant factor in Finnish society and in public opinion. Pertti Klemola, a Finnish journalist and scholar, once called it a state authority, an institution with its own independent social and political will.

In June 2009 the site was the sixth most popular Finnish website. In 2010 it was the seventh most visited website in Finland in 2010 and was visited by 1,236,527 people per week.

==&quot;Helsingin Sanomat International Edition&quot;==
The English-language section of the website, the &quot;Helsingin Sanomat International Edition&quot; (&quot;HSIE&quot;), ran for thirteen years.

The &quot;International Edition&quot; launched on 14 September 1999 with the aim of informing readers of news from Finland during the Finnish presidency of the European Union. It continued after the European presidency owing to the quantity of readers it was getting became one of the major English-language sources of news regarding Finland—making it popular with English-speaking immigrants to the country.

The &quot;Helsingin Sanomat International Edition&quot; closed down on 26 October 2012. English material is now published in cooperation with &quot;Helsinki Times&quot; weekly newspaper. For a while, also published some of its material in Russian, but the service was discontinued on 6 October 2014.

<doc id="212888" wikidata="Q304825" url="?curid=212888" title="Angelo Mai">
<text>Angelo Mai (&quot;Latin&quot; Angelus Maius; 7 March 17828 September 1854) was an Italian Cardinal and philologist. He won a European reputation for publishing for the first time a series of previously unknown ancient texts. These he was able to discover and publish, first while in charge of the Ambrosian Library in Milan and then in the same role at the Vatican Library. The texts were often in parchment manuscripts that had been washed off and reused; he was able to read the lower text using chemicals. In particular he was able to locate a substantial portion of the much sought-after &quot;De Republica&quot; of Cicero and the complete works of Virgilius Maro Grammaticus.
In 1954, to celebrate the first century after his death, the public library of Bergamo, the city where he was from, was named after him Biblioteca civica Angelo Mai e archivi storici.

==Biography==
He was born of humble parents at Schilpario in what is now the province of Bergamo, Lombardy.

In 1799 he entered the Society of Jesus, and in 1804 he became a teacher of classics in the college of Naples. After completing his studies at the Collegium Romanum, he lived for some time at Orvieto, where he was engaged in teaching and palaeographical studies. The political events of 1808, when French troops occupied the Papal States, necessitated his withdrawal from Rome (to which he had meanwhile returned) to Milan, where in 1813 he was made custodian of the Ambrosian library.

He now threw himself with characteristic energy and zeal into the task of examining the numerous manuscripts committed to his charge, and in the course of the next six years was able to restore to the world a considerable number of long-lost works. Having withdrawn from the Society of Jesus, he was invited to Rome in 1819 as chief keeper of the Vatican Library. In 1833 he was transferred to the office of secretary of the Congregation of the Propaganda; on 12 February 1838 he was raised to the dignity of cardinal. He died at Castel Gandolfo, near Albano, on 8 September 1854.
His monumental tomb is located in the left transept of the Basilica di Sant&#x27;Anastasia al Palatino by the late neoclassical sculptor Giovanni Maria Benzoni.

==Works==
It is on his skill as a reader of palimpsests that Mai&#x27;s fame chiefly rests. To the period of his residence at Milan belong:
*fragments of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Pro Scauro&quot;, &quot;Pro Tullio&quot;, &quot;Pro Flacco&quot;, &quot;In Clodium et Curionem&quot;, &quot;De aere alieno Milonis&quot;, and &quot;De rege Alexandrino&quot; (1814)
*&quot;M. Corn. Frontonis opera inedita, cum epistolis item ineditis&quot;, &quot;Antonini Pii&quot;, &quot;Marci Aurelii&quot;, &quot;Lucii Veri et Appiani&quot; (1815; new ed., 1823, with more than 100 additional letters found in the Vatican library)
*portions of eight speeches of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus
*fragments of Plautus
*the oration of Isaeus&#x27; &quot;De hereditate Cleonymi&quot;
*the last nine books of the &quot;Antiquities&quot; of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and a number of other works.
*&quot;M Tullii Ciceronis de republica quae supersunt&quot; appeared at Rome in 1822
*&quot;Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, e Vaticanis codicibus edita&quot; (&quot;A new collection of ancient writings, edited from Vatican codices&quot;) in 1825-1838
*&quot;Classici scriptores e Vaticanis codicibus editi&quot; (&quot;Classical writers edited from Vatican codices&quot;) in 1828-1838
*&quot;Spicilegium Romanum&quot; (&quot;A Roman gleaning&quot;) in 1839-1844
*&quot;Patrum nova bibliotheca&quot; (&quot;A new library of [Church] fathers&quot;) in 1845-1853

His edition of the celebrated &quot;Codex Vaticanus&quot;, completed in 1838, but not published (ostensibly on the ground of inaccuracies) till four years after his death (1858), is the least satisfactory of his labours and was superseded by the edition of Vercellone and Cozza (1868), which itself leaves much to be desired.

Although Mai was not as successful in textual criticism as in the decipherment of manuscripts, he will always be remembered as a laborious and persevering pioneer, by whose efforts many ancient writings have been rescued from oblivion.

The species &quot;Anconodon cochranensis&quot; was named by Russell in 1929 and Van Valen and Sloan in 1966. It has also been known as &quot;A. russelli&quot; (Simpson 1935; Jepsen 1940); &quot;Ectopodon cochranensis&quot; (Russel 1967); &quot;Ectypodus cochranensis&quot; (Simpson 1937a); &quot;Ectypodus russelli&quot; (Simpson 1935d); &quot;Liotomus russelli&quot;; and &quot;Ptilodus cochranensis&quot; (Russell 1929). Fossil remains have been found in the Tiffanian (Middle-Upper Paleocene)-age strata of Alberta (Canada) and Montana and Wyoming (United States). It has been cited as a descendant of &quot;A. gidleyi&quot;. The holotype is in the University of Alberta collection. The body mass has been estimated to be about 55 g, the weight of two standard mice.

The species &quot;Anconodon gidleyi&quot; was named by Simpson G.G. in 1935 and Jepsen G.L. in 1940. It has also been known as &quot;A. gibleyi&quot; and &quot;Ptilodus ?gidleyi&quot; (Simpson 1935d). Fossil remains have been found in the Torrejonian (Middle-Upper Paleocene)-age strata of the Gidley Quarry in Montana and in Wyoming, New Mexico and Alberta. This species is cited as a possible descendant of &quot;Cimolodon nitidus&quot;.

The species: &quot;Anconodon lewisi&quot; was named by Sloan R.E. in 1987. Fossil remains were discovered in the Middle-Upper Paleocene-age strata of Keefer Hill in Wyoming and Douglass Quarry in Montana. The holotype is from Wyoming.

<text>Thomas Burgess (18 November 175619 February 1837) was an English author, philosopher, Bishop of St Davids and Bishop of Salisbury, who was greatly influential in the development of the Church in Wales. He founded St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter, was a founding member of the Odiham Agricultural Society, helped establish the Royal Veterinary College in London, and was the first president of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Life==
Thomas Burgess was born at Odiham in Hampshire, youngest son of William Burgess (1720/21-1787) and his wife Elizabeth née Harding (1729/30-1797), grocers.
 He was educated at Robert May&#x27;s School in Odiham, at Winchester College, and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (Scholar 1775, B.A. 1778, M.A. 1782). He was a precocious scholar. Before graduating, he edited a reprint of John Burton&#x27;s &quot;Pentalogia&quot;, and in 1781 he brought out an annotated edition of Richard Dawes&#x27; &quot;Miscellanea Critica&quot; (reprinted, Leipzig, 1800). In 1783 he became a fellow of his college, and in 1784 he was ordained deacon and priest. In 1785 Burgess was appointed examining and domestic chaplain to Shute Barrington, bishop of Salisbury. In that capacity Burgess wrote &quot;The Salisbury Spelling Book&quot;, an introductory manual for teaching reading and writing, which became highly popular in Sunday school classes throughout the country. The first edition (1785) was followed rapidly by further editions. From 1787 to 1803 he held the prebend of Wilsford and Woodford in Salisbury cathedral, resigning on his appointment as bishop of St Davids. In 1788 Burgess published his &quot;Considerations on the Abolition of Slavery&quot;, in which he advocated the principle of gradual emancipation.

When Barrington was appointed bishop of Durham in 1791, Burgess moved to Durham with Barrington. From 1791 until 1825 he held a prebendal stall at Durham, holding in turn the 9th (1791–92), 6th (1792–1820) and 2nd (1820–1825) stalls. At Durham he carried out evangelistic work among the poorer classes. A pen portrait of the Durham prebendaries in 1831 describes Burgess as &#x27;silent in company, learned and intelligible in the pulpit; addressing the understanding in sound and classical language, informing the ignorant as the sun dispels the darkness of night.&#x27;

In June 1803, his old friend Henry Addington, then prime minister, appointed Burgess bishop of St Davids, by far the largest of the Welsh sees. He held the see for over twenty years, retaining his prebendal stall in Durham. Burgess was &quot;the first Welsh bishop for generations to devote himself to his duties... [He] was enthusiastically in favour of clergy who could preach in Welsh ... [and] equally enthusiastically in favour of giving church patronage to Welsh cultural activities.&quot; In 1804 a Welsh translation of a catechism written by Burgess was published at Carmarthen. He refused to induct clergy ignorant of Welsh into Welsh-speaking parishes. To educate Welsh clergy for the diocese, Burgess founded and endowed St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter (now the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David). After nearly twenty years of preparation, the foundation stone for the college was laid in 1822; students were first admitted on St David&#x27;s Day 1827. Burgess also established the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in the diocese and was a prime mover in the creation of the Cambrian Societies, organisers of the provincial eisteddfodau. &quot;He devoted himself with such zeal to the reformation of his diocese as to make a deep mark on the history of the Welsh church&quot;.

In 1825 Burgess was translated Bishop of Salisbury, resigning his stall in Durham. He was the last Bishop of Salisbury to be &quot;ex officio&quot; Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. Both at Salisbury and at St Davids, Burgess founded a Church Union Society for the assistance of infirm and distressed clergymen. Burgess opposed both Unitarianism and Catholic Emancipation. The latter policy led to several clashes with the Government; the Duke of Wellington told him sharply that he would do far more to strengthen the Protestant faith by staying in his diocese and minding his flock than he could by bombarding the Government with political pamphlets.

Thomas Burgess was a founding member of the Odiham Agricultural Society in 1783 and played a leading role in establishing the Royal Veterinary College in order to contribute to improved education in the treatment of sick animals. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1807. In 1820 he was appointed first president of the recently founded Royal Society of Literature.

On 1 October 1799, Burgess married Margery, daughter of John Bright of Pontefract in Yorkshire; the marriage was without children. He died on 19 February 1837, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 27 February. His monument is sculpted by William Osmond. His widow died in 1842.

Burgess saw the creation of St David&#x27;s College Lampeter as his great work: he left the college at his death his personal library of some 9,000 volumes, a working collection gathered during a lifetime devoted to the study of classics, literature, history, antiquities, and theology. His library remains at Lampeter, now as a special collection of the University of Wales Trinity St Davids; his many annotations offer an insight into Burgess&#x27;s scholarly and theological preoccupations.

==Works==
A list of his works, which are very numerous, will be found in his biography by John Scandrett Harford (2nd ed, 1841). In addition to those already referred to may be mentioned his &quot;Essay on the Study of Antiquities&quot;; &quot;First Principles of Christian Knowledge&quot;; &quot;Reflections on the Controversial Writings of Dr. Priestley&quot;; &quot;Emendationes in Suidam et Hesychium, et alios Lexicographos Graecos&quot;; &quot;The Bible, and nothing but the Bible, the Religion of the Church of England&quot;.

<text>Therapy? are a Northern Irish rock band from Larne, formed in 1989 by guitarist-vocalist Andy Cairns and drummer-vocalist Fyfe Ewing. Therapy? recorded their first demo with Cairns filling in on bass guitar. To complete the lineup, the band recruited Larne bassist Michael McKeegan. The band signed with major label A&amp;M Records in 1992, for which they released four albums, most notably &quot;Troublegum&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Infernal Love&quot; in 1995. Ewing&#x27;s departure in early 1996 preceded the arrivals of his replacement Graham Hopkins, as well as Martin McCarrick on guitar and cello. Neil Cooper replaced Hopkins in 2002. McCarrick departed in 2004, and the band have remained a three-piece ever since.

Therapy? are currently signed to UK independent label Marshall Records. The band have released 14 full-length studio albums and sold over two million albums worldwide.

==History==
===Early years (1989–1992)===
While attending a charity gig at the Jordanstown Polytechnic in 1988, Andy Cairns noticed Fyfe Ewing playing drums in a punk covers band. The two spoke afterwards and agreed to meet for rehearsal in Fyfe&#x27;s house in Larne with Andy playing a small practice amp and Fyfe playing his kit with brushes. In April 1989 they recorded a four track demo tape (&quot;Thirty Seconds of Silence&quot;) with Andy playing a bass guitar borrowed from Fyfe&#x27;s classmate Michael McKeegan. Deciding to play live, they recruited McKeegan and played their debut gig at the Belfast Art College supporting Decadence Within on 20 August 1989. They followed this up with another four track demo tape (&quot;Meat Abstract&quot;). Their sound was becoming highly influenced by artists of the indie rock movement such as The Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and The Membranes as well as new beat disco acts such as Belgian outfit Erotic Dissidents.

Therapy? released its first single, called &quot;Meat Abstract&quot; in July 1990. The single was limited to 1,000 copies and released on the band&#x27;s own Multifuckinational Records. During the summer of that year, the band made its first tour through the United Kingdom with The Beyond, catching the attention of influential DJ John Peel along the way. The band&#x27;s early years followed the familiar pattern of hard graft on the local alternative music scene, with Cairns often putting in a full day at the Michelin tyre factory (where he worked as a quality controller), then speeding across Northern Ireland in order to make it to gigs. The band also took whatever support slot they could, opening for the likes of Loop, Ride, Teenage Fanclub, Inspiral Carpets, Tad, Fugazi and Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin. Therapy? quickly came to the attention of local music fans with their distinctively uncompromising style. Their use of guitar feedback as a &quot;fourth instrument&quot; and unconventional song structures, combined with a darkly original approach to lyrics and imaginative use of samples pulled from cult movies and obscure documentaries, led them to be spotted in 1990 by London-based independent label Wiiija Records. The move was helped by Lesley Rankine of Silverfish, who passed the band&#x27;s first single on to Gary Walker of Wiiija.

The band&#x27;s first album, July 1991&#x27;s &quot;Babyteeth&quot;, and its January 1992 follow-up, &quot;Pleasure Death&quot;, were successful enough to earn the band a major label deal with A&amp;M Records. Both albums were underground successes, hitting number 1 in the UK Indie Charts. The attention led to support slots with both Babes in Toyland and Hole on their respective UK tours. A compilation of the two albums titled &quot;Caucasian Psychosis&quot; was prepared for the North American market, and the band embarked on their first U.S. tour in October 1992.

Their debut A&amp;M record, &quot;Nurse&quot;, made its way into UK&#x27;s Top 40 Album Chart in November 1992, while lead single &quot;Teethgrinder&quot; became the band&#x27;s first Top 40 single in both the UK and Ireland. The grunge revolution was in full swing, with US outfit Nirvana leading the way. Predictably, the media began to draw comparisons between the two bands. The heavy guitars and inventive drumming that was swiftly becoming Therapy?&#x27;s trademark led them more towards the grunge camp than away from it.

===The success (1993–1995)===
If there was one true &quot;breakthrough&quot; year in the band&#x27;s history, it would almost certainly be 1993. The release of the &quot;Shortsharpshock&quot; EP catapulted Therapy? into the Top 40, peaking at nine, featuring the lead track &quot;Screamager&quot;. The single led to the first of several appearances on the venerable UK music show Top of the Pops. Two more UK Top 40 EPs &quot;Face the Strange&quot; and &quot;Opal Mantra&quot; followed, as the band toured heavily on the European festival circuit, made two separate jaunts to the United States in support of Kings X initially, and then both Helmet and The Jesus Lizard, and played their debut shows in Japan. Compilations of the three EP&#x27;s were released in the U.S. and Japan (&quot;Hats Off to the Insane&quot;), and in Europe (&quot;Born in a Crash&quot;).

1994 saw the release of the commercially successful &quot;Troublegum&quot; album in February which earned the band appearances at a string of rock and indie festivals, including Reading (third consecutive appearance), Donington and Phoenix in the UK alone, as well as a clutch of top 40 singles. It achieved a string of nominations in end-of-year polls, including a Mercury Music Prize nomination, and success at the Kerrang! Awards.

With impatience mounting for a new album, &quot;Infernal Love&quot; was released in June 1995. This time, the press reaction was lukewarm. The band had attempted to create a &quot;cinematic&quot; record with Belfast DJ David Holmes employed to link each track with &quot;insanity&quot;, but in the eyes of many, had produced a disjointed piece over-subscribed with ballads. Despite a second consecutive Donington appearance at Metallica&#x27;s request, and singles &quot;Stories&quot; and &quot;Loose&quot; charting in the UK earlier in the year, it was clear that Therapy? had changed direction. Although the string laden single &quot;Diane&quot; (originally by &quot;Hüsker Dü&quot;) was a Top 10 hit in 15 European countries later in the year, much of the early momentum had gone.

===Ewing quits / Four piece (1996–1998)===
Fyfe Ewing left the band in January 1996. The band quickly recruited Graham Hopkins to replace Ewing as well as the permanent addition of guest cellist Martin McCarrick, and steadily toured throughout the US and Canada in 1996.

After the tour wound up in October 1996, Therapy? finally took a long break. They reconvened after a few months and spent most of 1997 writing, rehearsing and recording the follow-up to &quot;Infernal Love&quot;.

While the &quot;Church of Noise&quot; single in March 1998 failed commercially, it marked the return of the band following three years out of the spotlight. The &quot;Semi-Detached&quot; album transcended the trajectory of &quot;Troublegum&quot; and &quot;Infernal Love&quot; with their dark, broody atmosphere. However, promotion for the album was scant at best, due to problems at the A&amp;M label, which culminated in the loss of their record deal with the company. Without label support, Cairns and McKeegan needed to finance the band&#x27;s European tour in late 1998 themselves.

===The turn of the millennium (1999–2003)===
The band&#x27;s sentiment towards newer alternative metal bands was expressed in the song &quot;Ten Year Plan&quot; from the band&#x27;s uncompromising 1999 Ark21 album &quot;Suicide Pact – You First&quot;, which was packed full of vitriol, discontent and barely-repressed musical aggression. This album revealed a fuller-sound, yet was noticeably lacking in songs suitable of mainstream-radio airplay.

The following year saw the release of the &quot;So Much for the Ten Year Plan: A Retrospective 1990–2000&quot; album which (in title at least) was a self-deprecating poke at the bands&#x27; difficulties with corporate rock in recent years. It also allowed the band to fulfill some outstanding obligations to Universal Music.
Therapy? recorded follow-up record &quot;Shameless&quot; in early 2001 in Seattle. The album, produced by the legendary Jack Endino, was released by Ark21 in September. Graham Hopkins, who was unhappy with his musical limitation within the band, quit in December 2001. Following Hopkins&#x27; departure, the band yet again found themselves without a drummer and a record deal.

The band toured Europe in 2002 with ex-3 Colours Red drummer Keith Baxter. Hopkins was permanently replaced in Therapy? by ex-The Beyond/Cable/Gorilla drummer Neil Cooper, while the band signed a new record deal with Spitfire Records.

This line-up lasted one album, the commercially inclined &quot;High Anxiety&quot;. The bands&#x27; first home video release, a DVD titled &quot;Scopophobia&quot; was released shortly afterwards, consisting of a full concert recorded live at Belfast&#x27;s Mandella Hall in June 2003, promo videos and other extras. The band completed a UK tour at the end of 2003 as a three piece, due to McCarrick leaving the tour midway through owing to a perforated eardrum.

===Back to a three piece (2004–2009)===
McCarrick left the band permanently in March 2004, and the band were now slimmed down to a permanent three piece again for the first time since 1995. &quot;Never Apologise Never Explain&quot; was released in September 2004 to an audience re-acquainted with the three-piece Therapy? and was reminiscent of the claustrophobic sound of their earlier material.

The following album &quot;One Cure Fits All&quot; was released in April 2006. The album, produced by Pedro Ferreira, was a return to the melodic tendencies of &quot;High Anxiety&quot; and again divided opinion among the band&#x27;s fans.

On 19 September 2006, Therapy? performed an exclusive studio show of songs chosen by fans who had voted for their three favourite tracks from a lengthy list on the band&#x27;s website. These votes were counted and the twelve tracks with the most votes were then performed and recorded (both as audio and video). In early 2007, these tracks became available to buy from the band&#x27;s official website. The &quot;Webgig&quot; is no longer available to purchase. In addition to this release, the band received some attention from their old record company Universal Records (who own the rights to the band&#x27;s material recorded on A&amp;M Records) who released both a DVD of old promo clips (&quot;Gold&quot;) and a double-CD compilation of BBC sessions &quot;(Music Through A Cheap Transistor)&quot; in 2007. On the touring front, Therapy? focused on markets they had not usually played, including a slot at the NXNE festival in Canada, festival dates in Europe (one of which was as a late replacement for Helmet at the Nova Rock Festival) and a tour through countries such as Romania, Croatia and Serbia, even playing two gigs on Reunion Island, off the East African coast. The band ended 2007 by supporting New Model Army at their Christmas gig in Cologne.

Therapy? were a last minute replacement for Biffy Clyro on the Jägermeister Rock Liga tour of Germany which lasted five dates in February 2008. These dates were the only gigs played in 2008 as the band focused their energies exclusively on recording the new record. Therapy? began recording the new album in late July at Blast Studios in Newcastle and finished recording by late August. It was produced by Andy Gill. Video of rehearsals surfaced on Therapy?&#x27;s website offering previews of the new work, showcasing a more rythmetic jazz-influenced direction (&quot;Rehearsal&quot;), alongside a rough track typical of newer Therapy? output (&quot;Clowns Galore&quot;). The album, titled &quot;Crooked Timber&quot;, was released on 23 March 2009 via &quot;Blast Records&quot;/&quot;Global Music&quot;. The band performed the new album in its entirety on selected live dates in May, played various European festivals throughout the summer (including a debut appearance at Oxegen in Ireland and a second outing at England&#x27;s Download) and toured Europe extensively from October to December.

===20th anniversary (2010–2013)===
To mark the 20th anniversary of their debut commercial recording release, Therapy? performed for three consecutive nights at London&#x27;s Monto Water Rats in March which were recorded for the bands&#x27; first official live album titled &quot;We&#x27;re Here to the End&quot;, released in November. A deluxe gold edition of 2009&#x27;s &quot;Crooked Timber&quot; album was released on 19 July. Therapy? also appeared at European festivals in the summer, including at Knebworth Sonisphere on 31 July when the band performed the &quot;Troublegum&quot; album in its entirety. Later in 2010, the band performed several &quot;Troublegum &amp; more&quot; sets throughout Europe as part of their 20th anniversary celebrations.

In December 2010, the band began recording their thirteenth studio album, titled &quot;A Brief Crack of Light&quot;, in Newcastle&#x27;s Blast Studio. The album recording was completed in February 2011 and mixing began in March. In late May 2011, the group announced a change of plan for the new album; another recording session was planned for June in order to record new songs that had emerged. Those songs were mixed in July 2011 and included, along with songs from the first session, for the new album. The album was released in February 2012. A preceding single and video titled &quot;Living in the Shadow of the Terrible Thing&quot; was released in January 2012.

In May 2013, Cairns embarked on his first ever solo acoustic tour of the UK, as well as some dates in Europe. To especially mark the tour, he released a CD of acoustic material for sale exclusively at the shows, comprising 12 Therapy? songs, 6 original tracks freshly written for the tour and a cover version, all recorded in late April in Newcastle&#x27;s Blast Studios

&quot;The Gemil Box&quot; was released on 18 November 2013; a career-spanning box set of rare and unreleased material. Contents included remastered versions of &quot;Nurse&quot;, &quot;Troublegum&quot;, &quot;Infernal Love&quot; and &quot;Semi-Detached&quot;, three CDs of rare and unreleased tracks, a DVD of the band&#x27;s 2010 Sonisphere performance of the &quot;Troublegum&quot; album, official bootlegs of London ULU &#x27;91 and London Mean Fiddler &#x27;92, a 12&quot; vinyl of their early demo releases and a cassette of a live recording from Dublin 1990.

Deluxe Edition releases of both &quot;Troublegum&quot; and &quot;Infernal Love&quot; were released by Universal Music on 31 March 2014. The band promoted these releases with a series of retro video and audio uploads to their official YouTube channel, proceeding a short UK tour in early April. A compilation of singles from 1992 to 1998 followed on 14 April 2014 via &quot;Spectrum Records&quot;, a subsidiary of Universal Music, titled &quot;Stories: The Singles Collection&quot;.

===&quot;Disquiet&quot; and acoustic shows (2014–2017)===

On 18 February 2014, the band began pre-production on studio album number 14 with producer Tom Dalgety in their now usual surroundings of &quot;Blast Studios&quot; in Newcastle. The session finished on 28 February with 18 tracks laid down in demo form. Having chosen 11 songs, the band began recording the album proper on 17 April 2014 and it was completed on 30 April 2014. The album, titled &quot;Disquiet&quot;, was released on the bands&#x27; new record label on 23 March 2015. Pre-orders of the album were announced on 23 February 2015 and included an instant download of two album tracks and an exclusive pre-order track called &quot;We Kill People&quot;. A digital only single called &quot;Still Hurts&quot;, featuring two more non-album tracks, was released on 9 March 2015.

The band began the first leg of their Disquiet Tour in the UK in March, before taking in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, and returning to the UK throughout April. Their performance in Utrecht was filmed by &#x27;Quantum VR Media&#x27; for a future 360 VR release. In early May, Therapy? recorded a session for XFM, their 4th overall following previous sessions in 2001, 2004 and 2012. &quot;Deathstimate&quot; was released as a download only single on 30 October 2015. The single &quot;Tides&quot; was released on 15 April 2016, although it was available in early March to purchase on limited edition CD at the bands&#x27; UK tour performing the &quot;Infernal Love&quot; album in its entirety. Summer festivals on the European circuit followed, including a date at the Wacken Open Air in Germany. Therapy? performed a fully acoustic &quot;Wood &amp; Wire&quot; tour through Belgium, Holland, Austria, Germany and the UK from 14 November until 1 December 2016. A newly recorded 11-track acoustic album titled &quot;Wood &amp; Wire&quot; was available for purchase on CD at these shows. A six date Irish &quot;Wood &amp; Wire&quot; tour took place in April 2017.

On 21 July 2017, the band announced a double live acoustic album, &quot;Communion: Live at the Union Chapel&quot;, for release on 21 August 2017. The album was recorded in London on 1 December 2016 during the &quot;Wood &amp; Wire&quot; European tour.

===&quot;Cleave&quot; (2018–2019)===
On 15 January 2018 the band began recording their 15th studio album at Blast Recording in Newcastle with Chris Sheldon producing. Recording was completed on 6 February 2018. In March, the band completed a 22-date UK and Ireland tour supporting The Stranglers.

On 10 May 2018, the band announced via their social media that they signed a worldwide record deal with Marshall Records:

&quot;Absolutely delighted to announce we have signed to @marshallrecs for a worldwide deal! The first single, &quot;Callow&quot;, from our 15th album &quot;CLEAVE&quot; will be released Fri May 25th 2018&quot;
A second single, &quot;Wreck It Like Beckett&quot;, was released as a digital download on 7 September 2018, preceding the release of &quot;Cleave&quot; on 21 September 2018, following an extensive Pledge Music pre-order campaign which featured signed CDs, coloured vinyl, black vinyl and test presses.

&quot;Kakistocracy&quot; was released as a digital only single along with a music video on 24 January 2019.

===30th anniversary (2020–2022)===

On 16 January 2020, the band announced that they would be releasing a greatest hits compilation, titled &quot;Greatest Hits (The Abbey Road Session)&quot;. The album featured newly re-recorded versions of 12 Top 40 UK singles spanning the albums &quot;Nurse&quot;, &quot;Troublegum&quot;, &quot;Infernal Love&quot;, and &quot;Semi-Detached&quot;, and was recorded at the venerable Abbey Road Studios in November 2019.

The band was due to embark on a European tour in support of the album beginning in March; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they postponed the tour until October 2020. In June 2020, they rescheduled the tour again for spring 2021. Once more, in March 2021, the tour was rescheduled to begin in January 2022. The over 18 months between the last show of 2019 and the first show of 2021 (a festival date in July which was one of only three gigs in 2021) was the longest the group has ever gone between shows in their existence. Therapy? spent the majority of 2022 touring the UK and Europe to celebrate their 30-year anniversary, since re-dubbed the &quot;So Much for the 32 Year Plan&quot; tour. The band rounded up the 30th anniversary celebrations by doing a special &quot;Love Your Early Stuff&quot; UK tour in November - December 2022, playing cities they rarely visited and a setlist including rarities and less often played songs. 

On 2 November 2021, the band announced that their major label debut Nurse would be reissued by Caroline Records on 26 November 2021. The remastered 2CD version contained b-sides and previously unreleased demo tracks. There was also a vinyl release.

===&quot;Hard Cold Fire&quot; (2023–present)===
The band&#x27;s 16th studio album, &quot;Hard Cold Fire&quot;, was released on 5 May 2023. The album was recorded in November 2021 at Marshall Studios with producer Chris Sheldon. Due to touring commitments in 2022 related to the delayed 30th anniversary tour, the album had been shelved for 18 months. The album was released across three formats, including CD, cassette and six colour vinyl variants.

In February 2023, supergroup JAAW (featuring Cairns on vocals) announced their debut album called &quot;Supercluster&quot; to be released on 26 May 2023 on Svart Records.

==Question mark suffix==
Much has been made over the years of the unusual question mark suffix to the band&#x27;s name. In early interviews the band said that the name was &quot;really deep&quot; and intended to raise the question &quot;do you need therapy?&quot;, but in a 1992 interview guitarist Andy Cairns admitted that it was a chance design when he was working on the band&#x27;s first record sleeve. Working with Letraset transfers, Cairns misaligned the band&#x27;s name, and used the &quot;?&quot; icon to fill the space to the right. &quot;And then we thought, well maybe we can bluff our way through when people start reading into it.&quot;

==Collaborations and other appearances==
Therapy? collaborated with the short-lived rap group Fatal (part of the Soul Assassin camp, not to be confused with the hip hop artist Fatal) on the track &quot;Come and Die&quot; from the soundtrack to the 1993 film &quot;Judgment Night&quot;. Cairns has contributed vocals and guitar to various recordings with different bands throughout the years – &quot;Jonestown Mind&quot; (1994) and &quot;Waiting For Earthquakes&quot; (2001) by The Almighty, &quot;Rehab&quot; (2000) by UK band Manchild, &quot;Radio&quot; (2001) by UK band Dog Toffee (although this version remains unreleased), &quot;Gleason&quot; (2002) by Northern Irish band Throat, &quot;Get Your Groove On&quot; (2003) by The Wildhearts, &quot;F8&quot; (2005) by This Is Menace, &quot;The Second Triumvirate of Lavonia&quot; (2009) by Italian band Inferno, &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; and &quot;Ignite&quot; (2014) by UK band Thirty Six Strategies and &quot;Celebrating Sinking&quot; (2015) by Ricky Warwick. Therapy? appear on the 2005 &quot;Welt Turbojugend Tage&quot; DVD, performing three songs live in Hamburg. Therapy?, along with Biohazard and Gunshot, contributed with remixes on Pitchshifter&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;The Remix War&quot;.

Some of their songs were used in movies and video games. &quot;Auto Surgery&quot; and &quot;Teethgrinder&quot; are featured on Electronic Arts&#x27; video game &quot;Road Rash&quot; for the 3DO, Saturn, and PlayStation consoles while &quot;Nowhere&quot; is featured on EA Sports&#x27;s video game &quot;NCAA Football 2006&quot; for the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2 consoles.

&quot;Accelerator&quot; appears in Dominic Sena&#x27;s 1993 movie &quot;Kalifornia&quot; while &quot;He&#x27;s Not That Kind of Girl&quot; and &quot;God Kicks&quot; appear in John Carney&#x27;s 2001 movie &quot;On The Edge&quot;, starring Cillian Murphy. &quot;Screamager&quot; and &quot;Nowhere&quot; are heard on the first series of the BBC sitcom &quot;Game On&quot;. &quot;Speedball&quot; appears in the movie S.F.W.

==Influences==
Therapy? covered Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man&quot;, and other songs such The Police&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, The Misfits&#x27; &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, The Smiths&#x27; &quot;Vicar in a Tutu&quot; and Turbonegro&#x27;s &quot;Denim Demon&quot;. Cairns cited in his other favorite bands, Siouxsie and the Banshees for the album &quot;Juju&quot;, and Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band for the album &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;.
Influences from bands such as Sonic Youth, The Jesus Lizard, Hüsker Dü, Big Black, Killing Joke and Helmet can also be heard in Therapy?&#x27;s music.

The band&#x27;s songs and artwork often reference the work of Irish novelist and playwright Samuel Beckett.

==Equipment==

Andy Cairns uses several Gibson SG and a Gibson Explorer. He has changed his effects pedals a few times. As of November 2023, he used a small pedalboard powered by a T-Rex Fuel Tank Junior: Boss Chromatic Tuner → Electro-Harmonix POG Nano → Marshall SV-1 Supervibe → Boss Digital Delay.

<doc id="212900" wikidata="Q4838552" url="?curid=212900" title="Babyteeth (Therapy? album)">
<text>Babyteeth is the first mini-album by the Northern Irish rock band Therapy?, released on 15 July 1991 on Wiiija Records. Tracks 1 and 3 were recorded in January 1990, with the remaining tracks recorded later that year, all at Homestead Studio in Randalstown, Northern Ireland.

The album reached number 1 in both the UK and Irish Indie Charts.

==Release==
The EP was first released by Wiiija on 12&quot; vinyl. In 1993, Southern Records re-issued the album on 12&quot; vinyl, limited edition red 12&quot; vinyl, CD and Cassette. &quot;Meat Abstract&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s own &quot;Multifuckingnational&quot; label as a 7&quot; vinyl in July 1990. Promo videos were made for the tracks &quot;Meat Abstract&quot; and &quot;Innocent X&quot;. Both were shot as part of Fyfe and some friends&#x27; media course on hi-8 film. The mini-album was collected, together with &quot;Pleasure Death&quot;, as the compilation &quot;Caucasian Psychosis&quot; in 1992.

== Samples ==
* The sample in &quot;Meat Abstract&quot; (&quot;Wake up, time to die&quot;) is taken from the 1982 movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and is spoken by actor Brion James.
* The samples in &quot;Loser Cop&quot; are: &quot;All we represent to them man, is somebody who needs a haircut&quot; is taken from the 1969 movie &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and is spoken by actor Dennis Hopper, &quot;You little punk&quot; taken from the 1989 movie &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Good morning, you fascists, you pigs, you bigots, you pinkos, you fags, you bastards, fuzz. This indoctrination of vocal harassment was compiled by our own Juvenile Division is preparation for the concert this weekend&quot; is taken from the 1973 movie &quot;Electra Glide In Blue&quot; and is spoken by actor Joe Samsil.
* A sample in &quot;Innocent X&quot; (at 2:25) is taken from the 1988 movie &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; and is spoken by actor Jeremy Irons, while the &quot;My voice is nothing, my thoughts are nothing, in many respects I&#x27;m like you… nothing&quot; sample is taken from the 1973 porn movie &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; and is spoken by actor John Clemens.
* The sample in &quot;Dancin&#x27; With Manson&quot; (&quot;Take a knife on up the hill, lover, and kiss the girl goodbye&quot;) is taken from the 1978 movie &quot;Magic&quot; and is spoken by actor Anthony Hopkins.

== Miscellaneous ==
* &quot;Meat Abstract&quot; is named after a piece of art by British avant-garde artist Helen Chadwick. The noise at the beginning of the track is Fyfe Ewing drinking a can of beer in the vocal booth.
* &quot;Innocent X&quot; is named after a painting by Irish painter Francis Bacon. The breathing at the beginning of the track belongs to Michael McKeegan.
* Andy Cairns plays piano (un-credited) on &quot;Loser Cop&quot;.
* The rear artwork is taken from a book called &quot;Deep Red Horror Handbook&quot; by Chas Balun, which was in turn a still-frame from the 1986 movie Combat Shock.

== Personnel ==
* Andy Cairns – vocals, guitar
* Fyfe Ewing – vocals, drums
* Michael McKeegan – bass

<text>Jean-Baptiste Henri-Dominique Lacordaire, OP (; 12 May 1802 – 21 November 1861), often styled Henri-Dominique Lacordaire, was a French Catholic priest, journalist, theologian and political activist. He re-established the Dominican Order in post-Revolutionary France. Lacordaire was reputed to be the greatest pulpit orator of the nineteenth century.

==Early life and education==
The son of a doctor in the French navy, Henri Lacordaire was born on 12 May 1802 at Recey-sur-Ource (Côte-d&#x27;Or) and raised in Dijon by his mother, Anne Dugied, the daughter of a lawyer at the Parliament of Bourgogne who was widowed at an early age, when her husband died in 1806. Henri had three brothers, one of whom was the entomologist Jean Théodore Lacordaire. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but stopped actively practicing during his studies at the Dijon Lycée. He went on to study law. He distinguished himself in oratory at the Society of Studies in Dijon, a political and literary circle of the town&#x27;s royalist youth. There he discovered the ultramontane theories of de Bonald, de Maistre, and Félicité de Lamennais. Under their influence he slowly lost his enthusiasm for the encyclopedists and Rousseau, though he maintained an attachment to Classical Liberalism and the revolutionary ideals of 1789.

In 1822 he left for Paris to complete his legal training. Although legally too young to plead cases, he was allowed to do so and he successfully argued several in the Court of Assizes, attracting the interest of the great liberal lawyer Berryer. However, he became bored and felt isolated in Paris and in 1824 he re-embraced Catholicism and soon decided to become a priest.

Thanks to the support of Monseigneur de Quélen, the Archbishop of Paris, who granted him a scholarship, he began studying at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Issy in 1824 over the objections of his mother and friends. In 1826, he continued this education in Paris, which was generally mediocre. He wrote later that: &quot;Those who remember having observed me at the seminary know that they have several times had the temptation of calling me mad.&quot; His seminary experience inspired Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s novel &quot;Volupté&quot;.

At Saint-Sulpice, he met with Cardinal Rohan-Chabot, later archbishop of Besançon, who advised him to join the Society of Jesus. Nevertheless, after long hesitations by his superiors, he succeeded in being ordained a priest of the archdiocese of Paris on 22 September 1827. Shortly after his ordination he was offered the position of auditor of the rota at the court of Rome, an office which at once confers the title of monsignore, and is always a step to the episcopate, and often to a cardinal&#x27;s hat; but he declined it peremptorily. He was appointed to a modest position as chaplain of a convent of nuns of the Order of the Visitation. In the following year, he was named second chaplain of the Lycée Henri-IV. This experience convinced him of the inevitable de-Christianization of French youth educated in public institutions.

==Lamennais, Montalembert, &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; and liberal Catholicism==

Discouraged, when Bishop John Dubois of New York came to Paris to recruit missionaries for the United States, Lacordaire volunteered and was granted permission, but the revolutionary events of 1830 kept him in France. He visited Father Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais. Lacordaire had long resisted the views of Father Lamennais, one of the leading intellectuals concerned with French Catholic youth, but in May 1830, Lamennais converted him to his liberal version of ultramontanism, that is, the adherence to the absolute universal authority of the papacy in opposition to nationalist and secularist ideas.

He, Lamennais, Olympe-Philippe Gerbet, and the young Viscount Charles de Montalembert, who became one of his closest friends, allied themselves with the July Revolution. They demanded the integral application of the Charter of 1830 and voiced support of foreign liberal revolutions in Poland, Belgium and Italy. Together they launched the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Ami de l&#x27;Ordre&quot; (precursor of &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;) on 16 October 1830, whose motto was &quot;Dieu et la Liberté!&quot; (&quot;God and Freedom!&quot;). In that largely anti-clerical and revolutionary context, the journal sought to synthesize ultramontanism and liberalism to reconcile democratic aspirations and Roman Catholicism.

On 7 December 1830, the editors of &quot;L’Avenir&quot; articulated their demands as follows:

We firstly ask for the freedom of conscience or the freedom of full universal religion, without distinction as without privilege; and by consequence, in what touches us Catholics, for the total separation of church and state... this necessary separation, without which there would exist for Catholics no religious freedom, implies, for a part, the suppression of the ecclesiastical budget, and we have fully recognized this; for another part, the absolute independence of the clergy in the spiritual order... Just as there can be nothing religious today in politics there must be nothing political in religion.

Their other demands included freedom of the press, freedom of association, and the extension of electoral suffrage.

He was especially vehement in demanding the separation of Church and State. To this end, he called on French priests to refuse the salary which was paid them by the government, advocating for the embrace of apostolic poverty by the clergy. On 15 November 1830, he expressed himself: &quot;We are preyed upon by our enemies, by those who regard us as hypocrites or as imbeciles, and by those who are persuaded that our life depends on money... Freedom is not given, it is taken.&quot; These demands, along with numerous attacks against bishops appointed by the new government, whom he characterized as ambitious and servile, provoked a scandal in the French episcopate, which was largely Gallican (i.e., conciliarist, nationalist, royalist, asserting the authority of the local episcopacy, and opposed to papal absolutism) and conservative. The virulence of &quot;L’Avenir,&quot; and particularly of Lamennais and Lacordaire, provoked the French Bishops to form a tribunal against the editors of the periodical. Lamennais and Lacordaire spent January 1831 before the court, and obtained a triumphal acquittal.

Lacordaire believed that state control of education compromised religious instruction, especially in colleges, and that most students lost their faith upon leaving school. He was against the government&#x27;s monopoly of the universities, and opposed Montalivet, the minister of public education and faith. On 9 May 1831 Lacordaire and Montalembert opened a free school, rue des Beaux-Arts, which was shut down by the police two days later. At a trial which took place in front of the Chambre des Pairs (Chamber of Peers) Lacordaire defended himself, but failed to prevent the permanent closure of the school.

The editors of &quot;L’Avenir&quot; founded in December 1830 the General Society for the defense of religious freedom. &quot;L’Avenir&quot; was suspended by its founders on 15 November 1831 while Lacordaire, Lamennais and Montalembert, the &quot;Pilgrims of Freedom,&quot; went to Rome to seek recourse to Pope Gregory XVI, to whom they hoped to present a dissertation composed by Lacordaire. At first confident, they fast became disenchanted by the reserved welcome with which they were received. On 15 August 1832, the Pope, without naming them, condemned their ideas in the encyclical Mirari vos, most notably their demands for freedom of conscience and freedom of the press. Even before this condemnation, Lacordaire distanced himself from his companions, and returned to Paris where he took up again his functions as a chaplain at the Convent of Visitations.

On 11 September, he published a letter of submission to the Pope&#x27;s judgment. He then successfully used all his force of persuasion to convince Montalembert, who at first remained recalcitrant, to imitate him in his submission. In 1834 he also challenged Lamennais, who rather than accept what he saw as Rome&#x27;s reactionary absolutism, publicly renounced his priesthood and published &quot;Les Paroles d’un Croyant&quot; (Words of a Believer,) a vociferous republican polemic against the established social order, denouncing what he now saw as the conspiracy of kings and priests against the people. Pope Gregory responded quickly, calling Lammenais&#x27; new book &quot;small in size, but immense in perversity.&quot; He promulgated the encyclical &quot;Singulari Nos&quot; (15 July 1834) condemning its contents. Most commentators see this episode as effectively squelching of the open expression of modernist ideas in Catholic circles, until at least the papacy of Leo XIII at the end of the century. Lacordaire, for his part, then further distanced himself from Lammenais, expressed his disappointment at the consequences of the Revolution of 1830, and proclaimed his continued faithfulness to the Church of Rome. He condemned the pride of Lamennais and charged him with Protestantism, accusing him of having wanted to place the authority of the human race above that of the Church.

== Preaching ==
In January 1833 he met Madame Swetchine, who was to become a significant moderating influence upon him. She was a Russian convert to Catholicism who had a famous salon in Paris which Montalembert, the Earl of Falloux, and Lamennais also frequented. He developed a friendly filial relationship with her through an extensive correspondence.

In January 1834, at the encouragement of the young Frédéric Ozanam, the founder the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (a charitable organization,) Father Lacordaire started a series of lectures at the Collège Stanislas. This met with great success, even beyond his students. His thematic emphasis on freedom provoked his critics, who charged him with perverting the youth. Lacordaire was reputed to be the greatest pulpit orator of the nineteenth century. Lacordaire&#x27;s preaching was not so much penitential as an exercise in apologetics. He demonstrated that one could be a French citizen and a Catholic. The lectures were a great success.

Monseigneur de Quélen, the Archbishop of Paris, asked Lacordaire to preach a Lenten series in 1835 at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, as part of the Notre-Dame Lectures specially aimed at the catechesis of Christian youth, which had been inaugurated at the behest of his friend Ozanam. Lacordaire&#x27;s first lecture took place on 8 March 1835, and was met with wide acclaim. The social event of its day, 6,000 attended. Because of this immediate success, he was asked to preach again the following year. According to Thomas Bokenkotter, Lacordaire&#x27;s Notre Dame Conferences, &quot;...proved to be one of the most dramatic events of nineteenth century church history.&quot; Today the Lacordaire Notre-Dame Lectures, which mixed theology, philosophy and poetry, are still acclaimed as a sublime modern re-invigoration of traditional homiletics.

Among those who attended his Lenten sermons in 1836 was Marie-Eugénie de Jésus de Milleret. The encounter with Lacordaire marked a turning point in her life and the beginning of a spiritual journey that would eventually lead her to found the Religious of the Assumption. In a letter written to Lacordaire years later, she recalled, &quot;Your words gave me a faith which henceforth nothing could shake.&quot;

But in 1836 after such considerable success, he was still the object of mounting attacks on his theological stance. Suddenly his mother died. Lacordaire, aware of the need to continue his theological studies, retreated to Rome to study with the Jesuits. There, he published his &quot;Letter on the Holy See&quot; in which he reaffirmed with vigor his ultramontane positions, insisting on the primacy of the Roman Pontiff, &quot;the one and permanent trustee, supreme organ of the Gospel, and the sacred source of the universal communion.&quot; This text ran afoul of the Archbishop of Paris, Monseigneur Quélen, who was a sincere Gallican.

==Re-establishment of the Dominican Order in France==

In 1837, seeing the example of Guéranger&#x27;s restoration of the Benedictines, Lacordaire decided to enter the Dominican Order despite the loss of certain personal freedoms that would entail, and to re-establish the Dominicans in France.

Pope Gregory XVI and the general master of the Dominicans, Father Ancarani, supported his plan, the latter providing the Roman convent of Santa Sabina to serve as a novitiate for French Dominicans. In September 1838, Lacordaire returned to France to identify candidates for the novitiate as well as financial and political support. He published an eloquent announcement in the journal &quot;L’Univers&quot;. He argued that religious orders were compatible with the principles of the Revolution, particularly because of the democratic structure of the Dominicans. He represented the vow of poverty as a radical application of the revolutionary ideas of égalité and fraternité.

On 9 April 1839, Lacordaire formally joined the Dominicans at the convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome and received the name Dominic. He took final vows on 12 April 1840. In 1841, he returned to France wearing the illegal Dominican habit. On 14 February 1841, he preached in Paris at Notre-Dame. He then founded several convents, starting in Nancy in 1843. In April 1844 Lacordaire obtained permission to purchase the former Carthusians monastery of Notre-Dame de Châlais and establish a Dominican novitiate. The religious painter Hyacinthe Besson was appointed the first Master of the novices. In 1849 he established a house of studies in Paris. He also exerted an important influence on Jean-Charles Prince and Joseph-Sabin Raymond, two Canadians who took the Dominican Order to Canada.

In 1850, the Dominican Province of France was officially re-established under his direction and he was elected provincial superior, but Pope Pius IX named Alexandre Jandel, a philosophical opponent of Lacordaire, vicar general of the order. Jandel held a severe interpretation of Dominican medieval constitutions and was opposed to Lacordaire&#x27;s more liberal vision. A dispute about setting the hours for prayer in the priories erupted in 1852. Lacordaire preferred lax enforcement of the timetable in deference to other functions like preaching and teaching. In 1855 the pope supported Jandel by naming him general master of the Order. Lacordaire, after a time without administrative duties, was re-elected head of the French province in 1858.

==Final years==
Both political controversies and disputes within the Dominican order clouded Lacordaire&#x27;s later years. Long hostile to the July Monarchy, he supported the Revolution of 1848. With Frédéric Ozanam and the Abbot Maret, he launched a newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Ère Nouvelle&quot; (&quot;The New Era&quot;), to campaign for the rights of Catholics under the new regime. Their program mixed traditional Liberal Catholicism&#x27;s defense of the freedom of conscience and education with Ozanam&#x27;s Social Catholicism. Lacordaire was elected to the Assemblée Nationale from the Marseille region. Favoring the Republic, he sat on the extreme left of the Assemblée, but resigned on 17 May 1848, following workers&#x27; riots and the invasion of the Assemblée Nationale by demonstrators on 15 May. He preferred to retire rather than take sides in what he expected would be a civil war between extreme partisans. When &quot;L&#x27;Ère Nouvelle&quot; endorsed ever more socialist policies, he left the paper&#x27;s leadership on 2 September, while continuing to support it.

Lacordaire supported the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states and the later French invasion of the Papal States: &quot;We must not at all be too alarmed by the possible fall of Pius IX,&quot; he wrote to Montalembert. He found the Falloux Laws a disappointment despite their attempt to establish a degree of freedom for Catholic secondary education. Opposed to the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Lacordaire condemned his coup d’état of 2 December 1851. He retired from public life, and later explained: &quot;My hour had come to disappear with the others. Many Catholics followed another line, and separating themselves from all they had said and done, threw themselves with ardor before absolute power. This schism that I do not want at all to call here an apostasy, has always been a great mystery to me and a great sadness.&quot;

In quasi-retirement, he dedicated himself to the education of youth as permitted by the Falloux Laws. In July 1852 he accepted the leadership of a school in Oullins, near Lyon, then a similar role at the school of Sorèze in Tarn in 1854. Finally, on 2 February 1860, he was elected to the Académie française, filling the seat of Alexis de Tocqueville, whose eulogy he had delivered. His election represented a protest by the Académie and Catholic sympathizers against Napoléon III, who had conceded to allowing the Italian states of Florence, Midena, Parma, and Bologna to withdraw from the Papal States and ally themselves with independent Piedmont. Encouraged by opponents of the Imperial Regime, supported by Montalembert and Berryer, he agreed that he would not criticize Napoléon III&#x27;s intervention in Italian politics. His reception at the Académie was therefore not controversial.

About this time he uttered his famous epitaph: &quot;J&#x27;espère mourir un religieux pénitent et un libéral impénitent.&quot; (&quot;I hope to die a penitent religious man and an unrepentant liberal.&quot;)

Lacordaire only sat once at the Académie. He died at the age of 59 on 21 November 1861 in Sorèze (Tarn) and was buried there.

=== Modern reception ===
The liberal catholicism propagated by Lacordaire and others was viewed negatively by the Holy See. In Mirari vos (1832) the pope condemned the freedom of the press and the demand for the liberty of conscience for catholics: &#x27;This shameful font of indifferentism gives rise to that absurd and erroneous proposition which claims that &quot;liberty of conscience&quot; must be maintained for everyone. It spreads ruin in sacred and civil affairs, though some repeat over and over again with the greatest impudence that some advantage accrues to religion from it.&#x27;

The later encyclyclical Singulari Nos of 1834 summoned Lamennais and his followers to renounce the radical views he developed against temporal and spiritual sovereignties. This hostility all played out around the same time that the dogma of papal infallibility was defined (1870).

The hostile view of Liberal Catholicism lessened during the Second Vatican Council. When Pope Paul VI promulgated the encyclical Dignitatis Humanae the church took back ‘the rights of truth’ doctrine and allowed for the assertion that humans have the right to have freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. Modern Catholic scholarship and literature tends to look more favorable on the l’Avenir movement and the views of liberal catholicism.

Recent scholarship on 19th century church history tends to focus more on the broad developments of liberal catholicism and the developments surrounding the Second Vatican Council. At the council the separation between church and state and the liberty of conscience was confirmed. Lacordaire and the former members of the L&#x27;avenir are now recognized as being part of a bigger intellectual current which recent scholarship has more attention for.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Drouet (8 January 1763 – 11 April 1824) was a French politician of the Revolution and the Empire, best known for his key role in the arrest of King Louis XVI and his family during the Flight to Varennes.

==Background==
Drouet was born at Sainte-Menehould, in the province of Champagne. He enlisted in the Condé-Dragons regiment in 1781, but left seven years later to help his father in his duties as postmaster of Sainte-Menehould.

==Flight to Varennes==
On 21 June 1791, at around 8.p.m, the berline carrying the disguised royal family on their flight to the frontier made a stop at Sainte-Menehould. About 13 hours earlier, a valet de chambre in the Tuileries had noticed the king&#x27;s disappearance and alerted the authorities. Shortly after the royal family&#x27;s arrival, Drouet (by then himself the city&#x27;s postmaster) recognized the king, under the identity of a valet &quot;Mr. Durand&quot;, from his portrait printed on an assignat in his possession, but did not take action immediately. The carriage left Sainte-Menehould around ten minutes later. Just after receiving the news of the king&#x27;s escape sent from Paris by Lafayette, at around 9.p.m, Drouet set out to the nearby town of Varennes-en-Argonne, along with his friend Guillaume, in the direction he believed the berline had departed to.

Riding separately, with Drouet going through Clermont and Guillaume through the Forest of Argonne in Les Islettes, they arrived with their horses in Varennes just a few minutes after the royal family, and quickly notified the local authority of their presence in town. A bridge over the river Aire on the way to the frontier was then barricaded, and the National Guard, commanded by the future General Étienne Radet, was mobilized to assist in the blockade. The fugitives were finally detained at around 11:10.p.m, and arrested some time later after being formally identified as the royal family by Jacques Destez, a judge who had resided in Versailles.

==Later life and political career==
===National Convention===
Drouet arrived at the capital on 24 June, and was invited by the Legislative Assembly to give his own account of the events in Varennes. The following month, the Legislative Assembly offered a reward of 30,000 livres for his service, which he declined, instead unsuccessfully requesting a post in the National Gendarmerie of his department of Marne, in November 1791. He was elected as a deputy from Marne to the National Convention in September 1792, where he sat with the radical Montagnards, and was later employed in the Committee of Public Safety.

In 1793 he voted for the death of Louis XVI without appeal, showed virulent opposition to the Girondins, and in July proposed the expulsion of all non-naturalized British speculators and stockjobbers residing in France. Sent as a representative on mission to the Army of the North in 1793, Drouet was captured by the Austrians during their siege of Maubeuge, and imprisoned at Spielberg Castle in Brno, Southern Moravia. In July 1794 he attempted to escape from one of the castle&#x27;s windows but failed. He returned to France in December 1795, exchanged with other French revolutionaries and military officers for Marie Thérèse of France, daughter of Louis XVI.

===Directory and beyond===
Drouet then became a member of the Directory&#x27;s Council of Five Hundred following the Thermidorian Reaction. In 1796 he was accused of involvement in Babeuf&#x27;s Conspiracy of the Equals and imprisoned at the Prison de l&#x27;Abbaye, but shortly made his escape, going first to Switzerland and from there to the Canary Islands, where he took part in the successful resistance to Horatio Nelson&#x27;s attack on Tenerife in 1797, and later visited India. He returned to France after being accquitted by the High Court.

In the First Empire, Drouet was appointed &quot;sub-préfet&quot; of Sainte-Menehould by Emperor Napoleon, and was made a member of the Legion of Honor on 7 August 1807. When bestowing Drouet with the order, Napoleon told him, &quot;Mr. Drouet, you have changed the face of the world&quot; (&quot;Monsieur Drouet, vous avez changé la face du monde&quot;). He served as deputy in the Chamber of Representatives during the Hundred Days, but with the Bourbon Restoration was exiled in January 1816, being deemed a perpetrator of regicide. He soon returned secretly, however, and settled in Mâcon under the name of &quot;Merger&quot;, keeping his identity hidden until his death on 11 April 1824.

<text>Liotomus is a genus of extinct mammal from the Paleocene epoch (early Cenozoic era). It lived in Europe and North America, and was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata, lying within the suborder Cimolodonta and possibly the family Cimolodontidae.

The genus &quot;Liotomus&quot; was named by E. D. Cope in 1884. This genus is sometimes placed within family Eucosmodontidae (Jepsen 1940).

==Species==
*&quot;Liotomus marshi&quot; (Lemoine, 1882)
** &quot;L. marshi&quot; remains are known from the Upper Paleocene of Cernay, France.
** &quot;L. marshi&quot; has been cited as a descendant of &quot;Anconodon gidleyi&quot;.
*&quot;Liotomus vanvaleni&quot;
** &quot;L. vanvaleni&quot; remains are known from the San Juan Basin, New Mexico.

<text>Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D&#x27;Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. Howard Jones was the band&#x27;s lead vocalist from 2002 to 2012.

Leach was the band&#x27;s founding vocalist but left after two albums. He was replaced by Jones, and Killswitch Engage rose to fame with its 2004 release &quot;The End of Heartache&quot;, which peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA for over 500,000 shipments in the United States. The title track was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Metal Performance. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot;, was certified platinum in the US and spawned the platinum-selling single &quot;My Curse&quot;.

Jones departed in 2012 and Leach returned to his founding position. &quot;Disarm the Descent&quot; (2013), the band&#x27;s first album since Leach&#x27;s return, went top 10 in the US and featured the Grammy-nominated single &quot;In Due Time&quot;. The band&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;This Consequence&quot;, was released on February 21, 2025.

Killswitch Engage has sold over four million records in the U.S. and has been considered notable within the New Wave of American Heavy Metal, and has also been considered one of the earliest leading forces of the metalcore genre.

==History==
===Early years and debut album (1999–2001)===
Killswitch Engage formed following the disbandment of metalcore bands Overcast and Aftershock in 1999. After Overcast broke up in 1998, bassist Mike D&#x27;Antonio collaborated with Aftershock guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz. Dutkiewicz, now playing drums, recruited guitarist Joel Stroetzel from Aftershock and vocalist Jesse Leach of the band Nothing Stays Gold (who were signed to a record label owned by Dutkiewicz&#x27;s brother Tobias, who was also the vocalist in Aftershock) to form a new band, Killswitch Engage. The band&#x27;s name is derived from an episode of the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; entitled &quot;Kill Switch&quot;, written by William Gibson, who gave the episode this title after meeting the industrial band Kill Switch...Klick.

In 1999, Killswitch Engage recorded a demo containing four tracks, including &quot;Soilborn&quot;, the first song written by the band. The demo was first released at the band&#x27;s first show, opening for melodic death metal act In Flames, in November 1999. They released their self-titled debut album the following year. Although initially the album was not a financial success and did not land on any charts, it attracted the interest of Carl Severson, who worked at Roadrunner Records at the time. Severson handed &quot;Killswitch Engage&quot; to several Roadrunner representatives. Mike Gitter, a talent agent of the company, contacted D&#x27;Antonio, attended several of the band&#x27;s shows, and offered the band a recording contract with Roadrunner. Realizing that Roadrunner had the resources to promote and distribute Killswitch Engage releases, the band accepted his offer, declining several offers from smaller labels.

===Lineup changes and &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; (2001–2004)===
For a brief time in 2000 and 2001, ex-Overcast guitarist Pete Cortese joined Killswitch Engage, but left when he became a father. Killswitch Engage began writing new material for their second album in November 2001. Mixed in January at Backstage Studios by producer Andy Sneap, the album was titled &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;, after lyrics in the song &quot;Just Barely Breathing&quot;. A music video for the single &quot;My Last Serenade&quot; increased the band&#x27;s exposure, and the album peaked at number 37 on the Top Heatseekers chart.

Following &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot;″s release, the album having been written and recorded for two guitarists, the band decided to expand and become a fivesome; Dutkiewicz moved to guitar and former Aftershock drummer Tom Gomes filled in the vacant drummer position. After Leach was married on April 20, 2002 and began touring again he fell into a depression. Leach left the band a few days before the band was meant to play a show and sent the band members an e-mail telling them he had quit. On Leach&#x27;s end, he remarked &quot;I didn&#x27;t have the mental energy to face them, or even call them on the phone rather. I was at a point in my life where I just didn&#x27;t want to face any of them so I wrote them a long email explaining, like, I&#x27;m just done&quot;, while D&#x27;Antonio said in an interview that &quot;after three years of hanging out with the dude, and considering him a brother, to just get an email was a little bit harsh.&quot;

The band immediately started to search for a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band&#x27;s sound when he first heard it. He commented, &quot;I was like, &#x27;Meh.&#x27; I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But the more I listened to it, I realized there&#x27;s some really good songs here&quot;. After hearing about Leach&#x27;s vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest. Bleeding Through vocalist Brandan Schieppati says that both he and James Hart of Eighteen Visions were also asked to try out for the band in 2002, though Hart has contested this, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true. I remember it being talked about that they needed a new singer [but] neither of us lived on the East Coast... I was never like asked to try out or join the band and I don&#x27;t think he was either.&quot;

The new lineup played on the Road Rage tour in Europe in 2002 with 36 Crazyfists and Five Pointe O . Touring continued through the New Year&#x27;s Day, and in 2003 the first song to feature Jones, &quot;When Darkness Falls&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack of the 2003 horror film &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. Following the 2003 Ozzfest, drummer Gomes left the band because he wished to spend more time with his wife, to pursue his band Something of a Silhouette, and because he was tired of touring. He was replaced by Justin Foley of Blood Has Been Shed, and Foley&#x27;s first tour with the band was the MTV2 Headbangers Ball in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Bits: EMI/WMG, Liza/VH1, &#x27;Headbanger&#x27;s Ball&#x27;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;The End of Heartache&quot; (2004–2006)===
&quot;The End of Heartache&quot; was released on May 11, 2004, and peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 38,000 sales in its first week, and it also peaked at number 39 on the Australian Albums Chart. The album went on to sell more than 500,000 copies in the U.S and was certified gold on December 7, 2007. The album received mostly positive reviews, with Jon Caramanica of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calling the album a &quot;stunning collection, retaining much of their signature musical brutality&quot;. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic commented &quot;riffs upon riffs are piled sky-high into each number that follows, it&#x27;s the unpredictable rhythmic shifts used to build and then relieve internal pressure that fuel the Killswitch Engage power source&quot;.

&quot;The End of Heartache&quot; became the main single for the movie &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, and in 2005 the song was nominated for Best Metal Performance for the 47th Grammy Awards. In late 2004, &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; was re-released as a special edition album, with a second disc featuring various live performances, a Japanese bonus track, and a re-recorded version of &quot;Irreversal&quot;. During the summer of 2005, the band returned for Ozzfest, and on November 1, 2005, &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; was re-released as part of Roadrunner Records&#x27; 25th anniversary. On November 22, 2005, the live DVD &quot;(Set This) World Ablaze&quot; was released, which contained a live concert at the Palladium in Worcester, Massachusetts, an hour-long documentary, and all the band&#x27;s music videos. The DVD was certified gold in the US on April 8, 2006.

===&quot;As Daylight Dies&quot; (2006–2007)===

Killswitch Engage played the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006, having already played Australian dates without Dutkiewicz, who was suffering from back problems and needed corrective surgery. On May 23, 2006, the song &quot;This Fire Burns&quot; was released on the &quot;WWE Wreckless Intent&quot; album. The track was intended to be the new theme song for WWE wrestler Randy Orton; however, it was scrapped and later became the theme song for the WWE Judgment Day 2006 pay-per-view. &quot;This Fire Burns&quot; was used as the entrance theme for WWE wrestler CM Punk (along with his stables the Straight Edge Society and The New Nexus) from 2006 until 2011 and was later re-released as &quot;This Fire&quot; on the &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot; Special Edition.

Recorded in three months, &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot; was released on November 21, 2006 and peaked at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with 60,000 sales in its first week. &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot; proved to be one of their biggest albums yet. It also entered the Australian Albums Chart at number 29. Mixed by Dutkiewicz, the album received mostly positive reviews—Thom Jurek of Allmusic called it &quot;a Top Five metal candidate for 2006 for sure&quot;. &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; contributor Nick Terry said &quot;To call &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot; addictive would be an understatement. That it outdoes its already impressive enough predecessor could almost go without saying&quot;. Cosmo Lee of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; commented &quot;the album is astonishingly badly sequenced&quot;, though he praised the album as being &quot;less emotionally heavy-handed, and a lot more fun&quot;. As of November 27, 2007, &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot; has sold more than 500,000 units in the US.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;My Curse&quot;, peaked at number 21 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and is featured in the video games &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, &quot;Burnout Dominator&quot; and &quot;Burnout Paradise&quot; and is available as downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series. &quot;The Arms of Sorrow&quot; peaked at number 31 on the same chart. The band&#x27;s cover of Dio&#x27;s &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, originally recorded for a &quot;Kerrang!&quot; compilation album titled &quot;High Voltage&quot;, peaked at number 12 on the Mainstream Rock charts. Early in 2007, the band had to cancel three of its European tour dates with The Haunted due to Dutkiewicz&#x27;s back problems. He required emergency back surgery and was replaced on the tour by Soilwork guitarist Peter Wichers.

Due to Dutkiewicz&#x27;s back problems in early 2007, he was replaced by Damageplan and The Mercy Clinic frontman Patrick Lachman during the No Fear Tour. Dutkiewicz recovered and was able to finish the No Fear tour, and the band began filming its video for &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot;″s second single, &quot;The Arms of Sorrow&quot;. On August 6, 2007, Dutkiewicz was forced to leave the Warped Tour so he could fully recover from his back surgery and continue daily physical therapy. He was replaced by Killswitch&#x27;s guitar technician Josh Mihlek for select songs, until his return on August 14, 2007.

===Second self-titled album (2007–2011)===

Killswitch Engage entered the studio in October 2008 to start recording their next album with Dutkiewicz and Brendan O&#x27;Brien co-producing the album. In mid-February, bassist Mike D&#x27;Antonio confirmed in an interview with Metal Hammer that &quot;drums were finished&quot;, and that he had &quot;finished up the last few bass fixes&quot;. He also stated that Howard [Jones] was in Atlanta finishing vocals, and that &quot;it shouldn&#x27;t be too much longer now.&quot; From March to May, Killswitch Engage was a part of Disturbed&#x27;s Music as a Weapon IV festival along with Lacuna Coil, Chimaira, Suicide Silence, Bury Your Dead and more. On April 14, the band announced the name of their album as &quot;Killswitch Engage&quot;, the second time the band has self-titled an album. The album was released on June 30, 2009, debuting at No. 7 on the Billboard 200, marking the band&#x27;s highest chart position for an album. In July and August, Killswitch Engage took part in Mayhem Festival with headliners Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Bullet for My Valentine and others. In February 2010, Killswitch Engage announced that vocalist Howard Jones would not be performing with Killswitch Engage during their winter tour with The Devil Wears Prada and Dark Tranquillity; during the time, All That Remains vocalist Philip Labonte was substituting for Jones until he could return. At least one source speculated that Jones&#x27;s hiatus was due to back pain. On March 18, 2010, original vocalist Jesse Leach returned to the band for a series of songs. From then on, Leach and Labonte performed as substitute vocalists for the remainder of the tour.

In 2010, the band contributed the track &quot;My Obsession&quot; to the &quot;God of War: Blood &amp; Metal&quot; soundtrack. The band was later added as late replacement to 2010&#x27;s Download Festival in June, after original sub-headliner, Wolfmother could not attend as scheduled. Afterward, Killswitch Engage took a break from the road, and its members pursued other interests. Adam Dutkiewicz formed the band Times of Grace with Leach and released the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Hymn of a Broken Man&quot; on January 18, 2011. Along with Dutkiewicz and Leach, Times of Grace added Joel Stroetzel to their tour lineup. Justin Foley provided the drum tracking for the band Unearth on their album &quot;Darkness in the Light&quot;, released on July 5, 2011. Foley also traveled with the band for their 2011 summer tour. D&#x27;Antonio started the hardcore band Death Ray Vision, with Shadows Fall vocalist Brian Fair and former Killswitch Engage guitarist Pete Cortese.

===Jones&#x27;s departure, Leach&#x27;s return and &quot;Disarm the Descent&quot; (2011–2015)===
In an interview with FTC, Gun Shy Assassin, Mike D&#x27;Antonio had stated that the band was currently in the works for a sixth studio album. D&#x27;Antonio stated, &quot;Currently, everyone is individually writing demos for the next Killswitch Engage record. There is no release date yet, but I would assume it will be out early 2012.&quot; Adam Dutkiewicz followed that up with a statement on the Killswitch Engage Facebook, saying &quot;YO! Its Adam D! We&#x27;re about to begin writing our new record. Thanks to all of our fans for waiting so friggin&#x27; patiently...now let&#x27;s turn on the &quot;riff faucet&quot; and RAGE!&quot; On December 1, 2011, Mike D&#x27;Antonio posted online that Killswitch Engage should be entering the studio around February/March 2012 to record their sixth album expected around summer 2012. He also stated that the band had eight demos finished for the new record.

On January 4, 2012, the band announced via the band&#x27;s official website, along with their other official sources, that Howard Jones had left the band after his nine-year membership with them. In the statement, the band did not disclose the reason for this decision out of respect for Jones, but simply thanked him for his nine years with the band and wished him well, as well as thanking the fans for their support as they began the search for a new lead singer; Jones later explained he departed the band to manage his type 2 diabetes which was worsened by a hectic touring lifestyle. Soon after the announcement of Jones&#x27;s departure, rumors began that Phil Labonte of All That Remains would officially take over lead vocals due to his previous history with the band, although Labonte quickly dispelled the rumor. Many vocalists were considered in the search for a new one for the band. The band&#x27;s search for a new singer concluded in February with the announcement that original lead vocalist Jesse Leach would return to the band, as the band felt that Leach&#x27;s energy, as well as his overall comfort and command of both the old and new material, made him the clear choice during auditions. Following Leach&#x27;s return, the band continued to the process of recording their new album and touring. On April 22, 2012, the band performed Leach&#x27;s first show since 2002 at the New England Metal and Hardcore Fest.

On June 20, 2012, the demo version of a new song titled &quot;This Is Confrontation&quot; was leaked on YouTube. Not long after the song was leaked, the videos were soon deleted. Later, the band took part in Metal Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Trespass America Festival&quot; headlined by Five Finger Death Punch with additional support from God Forbid, Emmure, Pop Evil, Trivium and Battlecross. The band performed this song live, confirming the song&#x27;s title &quot;No End in Sight&quot;. Not long after the album was confirmed, the song was streamed publicly again. In October 2012, with Jesse back at the helm, Killswitch Engage announced they would be celebrating the ten-year anniversary of their seminal album &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; with a US Tour through November/December 2012, in which the band played the album live in its entirety. Support on the tour came from fellow Massachusetts natives Shadows Fall and Acaro.

The album &quot;Disarm the Descent&quot; was released April 1, 2013 in the UK. The album debuted at #15 in the UK charts while debuting at #7 in the Billboard top 200 April 2 in the US. The first single &quot;In Due Time&quot; was released on February 5, 2013. The album has received critical acclaim from reviewers, and has been labeled as a &quot;true standout&quot; and &quot;nothing short of amazing&quot;. It was announced in December 2013 that &quot;In Due Time&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Metal Performance&quot; at the 2014 Grammy Awards, but lost to &quot;God Is Dead?&quot; by Black Sabbath. A tour in May 2013 was done to promote the new album. With Miss May I, Darkest Hour, The Word Alive and Affiance as support. As I Lay Dying was originally supposed to be on the tour but dropped due to criminal charges from frontman Tim Lambesis. The band also did a co-headliner with fellow Heavy Metal act Lamb of God in October 2013 with Testament and Huntress as support for both bands. The band did a small headliner on the east coast for Halloween 2014, with All That Remains, Death Ray Vision and City of Homes supporting.

===&quot;Incarnate&quot; (2015–2017)===

In an interview with Wikimetal, Jesse Leach announced that the band will start demoing new material &quot;in the coming months&quot;.

On February 25, 2015, the band released a 40-second snippet of a new single titled &quot;Loyalty&quot;. The track appears on the &quot;Catch The Throne: The Mixtape Volume 2&quot; to promote the HBO TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. The mixtape also features appearances from various other metal and rap acts such as Anthrax and Snoop Dogg.

On March 30, 2015, Mike D&#x27;Antonio stated that the band had completed demoing material for its next studio album.

Killswitch Engage took part in a summer tour in July 2015, opening up for Rise Against with support from letlive.

On December 10, 2015, the band premiered a new song entitled &quot;Strength of the Mind&quot; on Revolver. The band also did a small Christmas 2015 tour on the East Coast with Unearth, Act of Defiance and &#x27;68.

The two disc set had a one day exclusive sale in record stores everywhere on Black Friday. The set is now available for online purchase and digital download on the Killswitch Engage store.

===&quot;Atonement&quot; (2017–2023)===

On August 30, 2017, the band announced on their Instagram page that they were in the process of demoing material for their upcoming eighth studio album.

In April 2018, it was revealed that their former singer Howard Jones will appear on their new album performing a duet with Jesse Leach during a song that was revealed to be titled &quot;The Signal Fire&quot;.

The band cancelled their tour dates from April 26 to May 5 due to the need of vocalist Jesse Leach undergoing surgery on his vocal cords.

During an interview with the &quot;Wall of Sound: Up Against the Wall&quot; podcast in October 2018, Jesse Leach revealed more details about the song with former singer Howard Jones stating, &quot;He does a verse. I do a verse. We sing the chorus together. It&#x27;s a real heavy shitkicker.&quot; He also mentioned that the song was inspired by Howard&#x27;s new band name Light the Torch and their friendship. On April 24, 2019, the band posted on their Instagram that the follow-up to the 2016 album &quot;Incarnate&quot; would be released in the autumn.

On August 20, 2019, the band released their music video for &quot;Atonement&quot;″s third single &quot;The Signal Fire&quot;, the song they recorded with former frontman Howard Jones (now of Light the Torch).

In January 2025, the band release the single &quot;I Believe&quot;, and on February 21, the band officially released &quot;This Consequence&quot;. The album was met with mixed reviews.

==Musical style, influences, and lyrical themes==
Killswitch Engage&#x27;s musical style has been described as a blend of &quot;New England hardcore and Swedish death metal&quot;, and has been categorized as metalcore and melodic metalcore. Like some 2000s metalcore bands, Killswitch Engage vocally combine singing, screaming vocals, and growls in their music. In 2009, MTV, while naming &quot;The Greatest Metal Bands of All Time&quot;, said that Killswitch Engage have been &quot;called one of the founders of metalcore&quot;. Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic said &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; is &quot;a pure metal album that seemingly has ignored any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of the meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of Metallica and Slayer.&quot;

Both current vocalist Jesse Leach and former vocalist Howard Jones write lyrics that are considered positive. Jesse Leach stated on &quot;(Set This) World Ablaze&quot;, that the lyrics contain &quot;unity, positivity, [and] love.&quot; On the lyrical themes of &quot;Killswitch Engage&quot;, Ultimate Guitar reviewer Amy Sciarretto noted:


On Killswitch Engage&#x27;s 2009 self-titled album, Howard Jones states the change in lyrical themes:
 Killswitch Engage&#x27;s influences include Van Halen, Black Sabbath, Fear Factory, Carcass, At the Gates, Machine Head, Neurosis, Metallica, Iron Maiden, HIM, Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, Anthrax, Slayer, Testament, Bad Brains, Agnostic Front, Leeway, and Sick of It All. Both Leach and Jones cited Faith No More singer Mike Patton as their biggest influence.

Jesse Leach has talked about the band&#x27;s label of metalcore, stating: &quot;I never liked the term &#x27;metalcore.&#x27; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accurate representation of the wide variety of bands that get lumped under that category. But I get it. People have to categorize stuff and put it into their own little category so they can describe stuff to somebody else. I like to say we&#x27;re more of a metal band. It is what it is. People are going to use that term whether I like it or not.&quot;

==Legacy==
Bands like Bring Me The Horizon, The Word Alive, Rise To Remain and Miss May I cited Killswitch Engage as an influence.

<text>Troublegum is the second major label album by the Northern Irish rock band Therapy? It was released on 7 February 1994 via A&amp;M Records. The album features a more punk-oriented style compared to the likes of Stiff Little Fingers, the Undertones and the band&#x27;s previous noise rock-influenced works.

==Background==
The album was recorded in 1993 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Oxfordshire, as well as RAK Studios and Church Studios, both in London. It has a melodically dark, metal-like sound. The album contains a cover of &quot;Isolation&quot; by Joy Division, which also became a single. The Therapy? version also incorporates many musical elements from &quot;Atrocity Exhibition&quot;. Troublegum is generally considered to be Therapy? at their musical and commercial peak and has since sold over one million copies worldwide. The album reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold in the UK in September 1994. It was also nominated as album of the year by the Mercury Prize of 1994.

==Releases==
The album was released on 12-inch vinyl, CD and cassette. In the UK, the album was released on limited edition green 12-inch vinyl. There was also a green cassette, and the original CD copies had a green tray. A remastered CD version of the album was included in &quot;The Gemil Box&quot;, released in 2013. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of its original release, a three-disc deluxe edition version of &quot;Troublegum&quot; was released by Universal on 31 March 2014.

==Reception==
The album was rated the top album of 1994 in the 1,000th issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2004.
The album was number 31 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s 100 best British rock albums of all time.
The album was shortlisted for the 1994 Mercury Music Prize.

<text>Pleasure Death is the second mini-album by the Northern Irish rock band Therapy? It was released on 27 January 1992 by Wiiija Records on 12&quot; vinyl. The album was recorded on 14 and 15 August 1991 and mixed on 16 and 17 August 1991 at Southern Studios in London. It reached number 1 on the UK Indie Charts.

The mini-album was collected, together with &quot;Babyteeth&quot;, as the compilation &quot;Caucasian Psychosis&quot; in 1992. In 1993, Southern Records re-issued the album on 12&quot; vinyl, CD and cassette.

The album was remastered in 2010 by Harvey Birrell and has been touted for possible release since then, although nothing has been confirmed as yet.

* The sample in &quot;Skinning Pit&quot; (&quot;Every once in a while I&#x27;d have to take a beating. But by then, I didn&#x27;t care. The way I saw it, everybody takes a beating sometime&quot;) is taken from the 1990 movie &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and is spoken by actor Ray Liotta.
* The sample in &quot;Potato Junkie&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t you ever feel attracted to the girls you photograph…&quot;) is often cited as having come from the 1978 movie &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;, being spoken by actress Brooke Shields and actor Keith Carradine, but is in fact from the 1981 ozploitation film &quot;Centrespread&quot;, being spoken by actress Kylie Foster and actor Paul Trahair.

== Releases ==
The album was originally released on limited edition red 12&quot; vinyl, CD and Cassette. The Japanese release did not feature the &quot;insanity&quot; links by David Holmes, but included two bonus tracks. A remastered CD version of the album by Harvey Birrell was included in The Gemil Box, released on 18 November 2013. A two-disc Deluxe Edition version of &quot;Infernal Love&quot; was released by Universal Music on 31 March 2014.

<doc id="212912" wikidata="Q334973" url="?curid=212912" title="Félicité de La Mennais">
<text>Félicité Robert de La Mennais (or Lamennais, ; 19 June 178227 February 1854) was a French Catholic priest, philosopher and political theorist. He was one of the most influential intellectuals of Restoration France. Lamennais is also considered the forerunner of both liberal Catholicism and Modernism.

His opinions on matters of religion and government changed dramatically over the course of his life. He initially held rationalistic views, but in part due to the influence of his elder brother, Jean-Marie, came to see religion as an antidote for the anarchy and tyranny unleashed by revolution. He derided Napoleon, in part because of the Organic Articles, in which France acting unilaterally amended the Concordat of 1801 between France and the papacy. Lamennais vocally assailed both Gallicanism and Caesaropapism, views that demanded a completely subservient relationship by the Church to the State, and he was for a time a staunch defender of the independence of the Church.

Lamennais was ordained a priest in 1817, the same year he published &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;indifférence en matière de religion&quot;. In 1830, he founded &quot;L&#x27;Ami de l&#x27;ordre&quot; (precursor of &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;) with Montalembert and Lacordaire. His social ideas embraced an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press. His radicalism distanced him from a number of his friends. In 1833, he broke with the Church and the following year published &quot;&quot;, which Pope Gregory XVI condemned for its philosophical theories.

He served as a deputy for Paris to the Constituent Assembly; his draft for a Constitution was rejected as too radical. He died in Paris in 1854.

== Biography ==
===Family===
Félicité Robert de la Mennais was born in Saint-Malo. He belonged to , which was engaged in international maritime trade.

Louis-François Robert de La Mennais (1717–1804), his paternal grandfather, was the founder of the “Compagnie commerciale et maritime” in Saint-Malo. He was a trader, and he armed boats for the needs of trade, in order to provide all the equipment, provisions, sometimes even a few cannons, to choose a serious captain who knows how to recruit a crew, in order to maintain counters in foreign ports. It was a job that required a certain daring and temerity. Then, when his sons were old enough to take responsibility, he handed over the administration of the company to them.

Pierre Lorin (1719–1799), his maternal grandfather, was a lawyer at the Parliament of Paris, and Subdelegate of the Jurisdictions of Saint-Malo, that is to say, representative of the royal power for the district of Saint-Malo, which at the time corresponded to about thirty parishes. He worked under the orders of the Intendant of Brittany. A man of heart, he had a great social sense and worked against the suffering and poverty which were great, especially in the countryside. He advocated, for example, in each parish, the establishment of a charity office. He acquired La Chésnaie in 1781, he built a bourgeois house there, it was in this place that Félicité would later found a school of theological thought.

The two sisters, Gratienne Lorin and Félicité Lorin (daughters of Pierre Lorin and Bertranne Roce) were married on the same day, September 5, 1775, in Saint-Malo, with the two sons Robert (son of Louis-François Robert): Pierre -Louis Robert de la Mennais and Denis Robert des Saudrais.

Félicité was one of the five children of Pierre-Louis Robert, sieur de La Menais and of Gatienne Lorin, who died in 1787 when he was five years old, so that &#x27;he was brought up by one of his uncles.

===Youth===
Lamennais was born at Saint-Malo in the ancient Province of Brittany on 19 June 1782, the son of a wealthy merchant who had recently received a coat of arms from the king. He lost his mother at the age of five and as a result, he and his brother, Jean-Marie, were sent for education to an uncle, Robert des Saudrais at La Chênaie, an estate near Saint-Malo. Resistant to any kind of discipline, his uncle would lock him in the library where he spent long hours reading Rousseau and Pascal, among others, and acquired a vast and varied learning. Revolution was to have a profound effect on Lammennais. His family sheltered non-juring priests. Father Vielle said Mass on occasion in the dark at La Chênaie.

===First publications===

Of a sickly and sensitive nature, and shocked by the events of the French Revolution, Lamennais developed a morbid frame of mind. He first held rationalistic views, but partly through the influence of his brother Jean-Marie and partly as a result of his philosophical and historical studies, he came to see the power of faith and religion. He voiced his convictions in &quot;&quot;, published anonymously in Paris in 1808. The idea for this work and the materials were due to Jean-Marie, but the actual writing was done almost exclusively by Félicité. It recommended religious revival and active clerical organization and the awakening of an ultramontane spirit. Napoleon&#x27;s police deemed the book dangerously ideological and tried to suppress it.

Lamennais devoted most of the following year to translating Louis de Blois&#x27;s &quot;Speculum Monachorum&quot; into French, which he published in 1809 under the title &quot;Le Guide spirituel&quot;.

In 1811 Lamennais received the tonsure and became professor of mathematics in an ecclesiastical college at Saint-Malo founded by his brother, who had been ordained a Catholic priest in 1804. When the school was closed by imperial authority the following year, Félicité withdrew to La Chênaie, while his brother became vicar-general of the diocese of Saint-Brieuc.

In 1814 he published, with his brother, &quot;&quot; (1814), in which he strongly condemned Gallicanism and the interference of political authority in ecclesiastical affairs. It was provoked by Napoleon&#x27;s nomination of Jean Siffrein Maury as Archbishop of Paris in accordance with the provisions of the Concordat of 1801.

===Exile, return, and ordination===
Lamennais hailed the Bourbon restoration of 1814, which he witnessed in Paris, because he saw Louis XVIII as a force for religious regeneration. During the Hundred Days, he escaped to London, where he worked in Kensington at an institution for the children of poor immigrants. After the final overthrow of Napoleon in 1815, he returned to Paris. Lamennais sought in religion a remedy for the anarchy and tyranny unleashed by the revolution. He undertook the study of theology and was ordained a subdeacon on 21 December. At this time he considered joining the Jesuits, however the prospect of a novitiate year led him to decide to become a secular priest. It was in Saint-Brieuc, in February 1816 that Lamennais received the diaconate. He was ordained by the Bishop of Rennes on 9 March 1817.

==&quot;Essai sur l&#x27;indifférence en matière de religion&quot;==
The first volume of his great work, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Essay on Indifference in Matters of Religion&quot;, appeared in 1817 and established his reputation throughout Europe. He became, according to Lacordaire, &quot;a humble priest with all the authority once enjoyed by Bossuet&quot;. His experience of Napoleon persuaded him that the state had no right to interfere in religion. Lamennais denounced religious indifference by the state and toleration while advocating for a restoration of the pre-Revolutionary authority of the Catholic Church. He contended that private judgment, introduced by Martin Luther into religion, by Descartes and Leibniz into philosophy and science, and by Rousseau and the Encyclopedists into politics, had resulted in practical atheism and spiritual death. He asserted that ecclesiastical authority, founded on the absolute revelation delivered to the Jewish people, but supported by the universal tradition of all nations, was the sole hope of regenerating the European communities.

Three more volumes (Paris, 1818–1824) followed and met with a mixed reception from the Gallican bishops and monarchists, but with the enthusiastic support from the younger clergy. Three Roman theologians examined his work and Pope Leo XII gave it his formal approval. Leo XII held Lamennais in high personal regard having a portrait of him hung in his private chambers. When the later visited Rome in 1824 Leo offered him a Vatican apartment and in 1828 a cardinalate, which Lamennais declined. According to Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman before the full consistory he said that Lamennais was &quot; a distinguished writer, whose works had not only rendered eminent services to religion, but rejoiced and astonished Europe.&quot; However, some believe that the quote was actually about the historian John Lingard.

Lamennais also published works of piety, for example, a widely read French version of &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; with notes and reflections (1824), &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot; (1828). The failure of a publishing house aimed at spreading this pious literature resulted in his own financial ruin.

==Political advocacy==
===During the Bourbon Restoration===
On his return to France he took a prominent part in political work. Together with Chateaubriand and the Comte de Villèle he was a regular contributor to &quot;Le Conservateur littéraire&quot;. However, when Villèle became the chief supporter of absolute monarchy, Lamennais withdrew his support and started two rival organs, &#x27; and &#x27;. He authored a pamphlet criticizing the 1825 Anti-Sacrilege Law introduced by Villèle&#x27;s administration. Various other minor works, together with &quot; (1825–1826) kept his name before the public.

===Ultramontane and theocratic democracy advocacy===
He retired to La Chênaie and gathered a group of disciples, including Montalembert, Lacordaire and Maurice de Guérin. He espoused ultramontanism and aimed to create an organized body of opinion to campaign against Gallicanism, the control and influence of the state in church matters. &quot;, or &quot;On the Progress of the Revolution and the War against the Church&quot;, (1828) marked his complete renunciation of royalist principles and from that time on he advocated on behalf of a theocratic democracy.

J.P.T. Bury suggests that Lamennais and his associates found inspiration in a Belgian Liberal Catholic movement centered in Malines and led by Archbishop de Méan&#x27;s vicar-general, Engelbert Sterckx. Largely Catholic Belgium seceded from the Netherlands in 1830 and established a constitutional monarchy. Sterckx, who became archbishop in 1832 found a way not merely to tolerate the new liberal constitution, but to expand the Church under the new liberties guaranteed.

Lamennais founded &quot;L&#x27;Ami de l&#x27;ordre&quot; (precursor of &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;) the first issue of which appeared on 16 October 1830, with the motto &quot;God and Liberty.&quot; His social theories became more radical. The paper was aggressively democratic, demanding rights of local administration, an enlarged suffrage, separation of church and state, universal freedom of conscience, instruction, assembly, and the press. Styles of worship were to be criticized, improved or abolished in absolute submission to the spiritual, not to the temporal authority. His views were opposed by the bishops and supported by the younger clergy, but he lost even their support when he said priests should not be paid by the state. With the help of Montalembert, he founded the &quot;&quot;, which became a far-reaching organization with agents throughout France who monitored violations of religious freedom. As a result, the periodical&#x27;s career was stormy and its circulation opposed by conservative bishops.

Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, Pope Gregory XVI would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter. However, Lamennais, Montalembert, and Lacordaire suspended their work and in November 1831 set out to Rome to obtain the Pope&#x27;s approval. Archbishop Quélen of Paris had warned Lammenais that he was being unrealistic and was viewed as a demagogue in favor of revolution. As Quelen was a Gallican, Lammenais ignored him. After much opposition, they gained an audience, but only on condition that their political project should not be mentioned. Metternich, whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States, pressed for a condemnation. A few days later they received a letter from Cardinal Pacca, advising their departure from Rome and suggesting that the Holy See, while admitting the justice of their intentions, would like the matter left open for the present.

Lacordaire and Montalembert departed immediately, but Lamennais stayed on until Gregory&#x27;s letter to the Polish bishops, which denounced the Polish revolution against the Tsar, dashed his last hopes. Gregory thought the Polish revolutionaries were seeking to undermine Russian Tsar Nicholas I&#x27;s efforts to support the Catholic royalist cause in France by forcing him to divert his troops to suppress the uprising in Poland. While staying in Munich, Lamennais received the 1832 encyclical &quot;Mirari vos&quot;, which condemned religious pluralism in general and certain of Lamennais&#x27;s ideas advanced in &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; without mentioning his name. After this, Lamennais and his two lieutenants declared that out of deference to the pope they would not resume the publication of &quot;&quot; and dissolved the Agence générale as well.

===Separation from the Church, imprisonment, and further publications===
Lamennais retired to La Chênaie, an estate near Saint-Malo, Brittany. He communicated his resentment and political beliefs only through correspondence. The Vatican in turn demanded his frank and full adhesion to the encyclical &quot;Mirari vos&quot;. Lamennais refused to submit without qualification and in December 1833 renounced his ecclesiastical functions and abandoned all external profession of Christianity.

In May 1834, Lamennais penned &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Words of a Believer&quot; (1834), a collection of aphorisms that denounced the established social order—what he called the conspiracy of kings and priests against the people—and declared his rupture with the Church. In the encyclical &quot;Singulari nos&quot; of 25 June 1834, Pope Gregory XVI condemned the book as &quot;small in size, [but] enormous in wickedness&quot; and censured Lamennais&#x27; philosophical system.

&quot;Paroles&quot; was inspired by Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego&quot; (&quot;Books of the Polish Nation and Polish Pilgrimage&quot;). The &quot;Paroles&quot; marked Lamennais&#x27; turn to a Christian socialism that inspired a whole generation of socialists. His radical ideas reflected an overlap of Catholic and socialist discourses that can be traced back to the 1820s.

Sometime after 5 April 1836 he was imprisoned at Ste. Pelagie, a prison for debtors.

Lamennais was increasingly abandoned by his friends and in 1837 published &quot;Les Affaires de Rome, des maux de l&#x27;Église et de la société&quot;, in which he provided his perspective on his relations with Gregory XVI.

After this, Lamennais penned several articles in the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;, the &quot;Revue du Progrès&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot;, and published the pamphlets &#x27; (1837), &#x27; (1839), &#x27; (1839), &quot;Discussions critiques&quot; (1841), &#x27; (1841), &#x27; (1843), in which he espoused popular sovereignty and attacked contemporary society and the public authorities. After the publication of &#x27; (1840), he was censored and imprisoned for a year in 1841.

From 1841 to 1846 Lamennais published the four volumes of &#x27;, a treatise on metaphysics, which detailed his departure from Christianity. The third volume, an exposition of art as a development of the aspirations and needs of worship, formed its core. Lamennais also published &#x27;, a French translation of the Gospels with added notes and reflections.

In 1846 Lamennais published &quot;, written during his imprisonment.

===Involvement in the Second Republic===
Lamennais sympathized with the Revolution of 1848 and was elected a deputy for Paris to the Constituent Assembly. He drew up a plan for a Constitution, which was rejected as too radical. After this, he confined himself to silent participation in the sessions. He also started the newspapers &#x27; and &#x27;, espousing radical revolution. Both papers quickly ceased publication. He was also named president of the &quot;. He remained a deputy in the legislative assemblies until Napoleon III&#x27;s 1851 coup, which depressed and isolated him once more.

==Later years and death==
After 1851, he occupied himself with &quot;La Divine Comédie&quot;, a translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, and refused several attempts to reconcile him to the Church. He died in Paris in 1854 and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in a common grave, without funeral rites, mourned by political and literary admirers.

==Works==
There are two complete works in ten volumes, the first published in 1836–1837 as &quot;Œuvres complètes de La Mennais&quot;, the second published in 1844 as &quot;Œuvres complètes de Lamennais&quot;. Both are incomplete.

<text>Bihu is of three types and it is an important cultural festival unique to the Indian state of Assam – &#x27;Rongali&#x27; or &#x27;Bohag Bihu&#x27; observed in April, &#x27;Kongali&#x27; or &#x27;Kati Bihu&#x27; observed in October or November, and &#x27;Bhogali&#x27; or &#x27;Magh Bihu&#x27; observed in January. The festivals present an admixture of Tibeto-Birman, Austroasiatic and Indo-Aryan traditions entwined so intricately that it is impossible to separate them—festivals which are uniquely Assamese to which all communities of Assam had contributed elements. The Rongali Bihu is the most important of the three, celebrating spring festival. The Bhogali Bihu or the Magh Bihu is a harvest festival, with community feasts. The Kongali Bihu or the Kati Bihu is the sombre, thrifty one reflecting a season of short supplies and is an animistic festival.

The Rongali Bihu is the most important of them all, coincides with the Assamese New Year and as well as with other regions of Indian subcontinent, East Asia and South-East Asia, which follow the Hindu calendar and Buddhist calendar. The other two Bihu festivals every year are unique to Assamese people. Like some other Indian festivals, Bihu is associated with agriculture, and rice in particular. Bohag Bihu is a sowing festival, Kati Bihu is associated with crop protection and worship of plants and crops and is an animistic form of the festival, while Bhogali Bihu is a harvest festival. Assamese celebrate the Rongali Bihu with feasts, music and dancing. Some hang brass, copper or silver pots on poles in front of their house, while children wear flower garlands then greet the new year as they pass through the rural streets.

The three Bihu are Assamese festivals elders in family, fertility and mother goddess, but the celebrations and rituals reflect influences from Southeast Asia and Sino-Tibetan cultures. In contemporary times, the Bihus are celebrated by all Assamese people irrespective of religion, caste or creed. It is also celebrated overseas by the Assamese diaspora community living worldwide.

The term &quot;Bihu&quot; is also used to imply Bihu dance otherwise called Bihu Naas and Bihu folk songs also called Bihu Geet.

==History==

===Indigenous origin===

The word &quot;Bihu&quot; has been derived from the Deori (a Boro-Garo language) word &quot;Bisu&quot; which means &quot;excessive joy&quot;. original form of Bihu continue among the Chutias, Sonowal Kacharis, Thengal Kacharis and Deoris. These groups, known as Sadiyal Kacharis were associated with the historical Kingdom of Sadiya. The other branches of Bodo-Kacharis which include Boros, Dimasas, Rabhas, Tiwas, etc. have also been celebrating Bihu since ancient times. The Boros call it &quot;Baisagu&quot;, while the Dimasas, Tiwa and Rabha call it &quot;Bushu&quot; or &quot;Bushu Dima&quot;,&quot;Pisu&quot;, &quot;Dumsi&quot; respectively.

In local folklore, it is said that &quot;Bordoisila&quot; (Bardai Sikhla in Bodo) (meaning north-westerly winds in Assamese) was the daughter of God Earth who married to a bridegroom of some distant land. Bordoisila visits her mother&#x27;s home once in year during spring time which indicates the beginning of Bihu and leaves after a few days which indicates the end of Bihu. Assam experience strong gale (wind) at that period which marks the beginning of Bihu and another strong gale after her departure which is devastating. The word &quot;Bordoisila&quot; is derived from the Bodo word &quot;Bordaisikhla&quot; which means &quot;girl of storm&quot; (Sikhla meaning girl and Bardai meaning storm). There is even a dance with the same name performed among Boro people during Baisagu which points to the origin of Bihu in the Bodo-Kachari groups.
The first reference of Bihu can be found in the copperplate inscription of the Chutia king Lakshminarayan. The inscription was found in Ghilamara region of Lakhimpur district in the year 1935 and it was issued in the year 1401 A.D. It states that the king Lakshminarayan has donated land grants to Brahmins on the auspicious occasion of Bihu. It reads,
This means that on the pious occasion of Bihu, a Brahmin named Dvija Ravidev was granted land by the king. This indicates that Bihu played an important role in the social life of people of Assam at that period.

Yet another reference of &quot;Bihu&quot; can be found in the &quot;Deodhai Buranji&quot; which mentions that the capital of the Chutia kingdom, Sadiya was suddenly attacked by the Ahom forces on the first day of Bihu/Bisu in 1524 (first Wednesday of Bohag/Vaisakha), when the people were busy celebrating Bihu. The Ahom general Phrasenmung Borgohain upon the advice of a Chutia general (who sided with the enemies) played the Bihu Dhul (on Ujha Bisu day i.e. 7th Bohag/Vaisakha) to trick the Chutias which ultimately led to their defeat.

In early texts, Bohag Bihu celebrations started from the first week of &quot;Chot&quot; in Assamese month. The period from the first week of Chaitra till the end was known as &quot;Raati Bihu&quot; or &quot;Chotor Bihu&quot;. During this period, young people danced at night in the grounds of the &quot;Than&quot; (temple). The last day of Chaitra or the first Tuesday of Bohag was when the Rati Bihu ended. This was known as the &quot;Uruka&quot; (derived from the Deori-Chutia &quot;Urukuwa&quot; meaning &quot;to end&quot;). The temple dancers &quot;Deodhani&quot; danced the entire night and were believed to be possessed by the goddess &quot;Kechai-khati&quot; (kolimoti), signaling that she had descended upon earth from heaven (&quot;Bihu nomai ona&quot;). This belief of the goddess arriving during the Bihu season each year can still be found in Bihu songs as, The day after &quot;Uruka&quot;, i.e. the first Wednesday was celebrated as Goru Bihu. This tradition of cattle rites is same as that followed by the Boros in Bwisagu indicating the common roots of both the festivals. During the night of Goru-bihu, people danced Bihu in separate groups in the Thans where animal sacrifice took place. After the sacrifices to the goddess, the young folk visited the households of the village, which was the start of &quot;&quot;. This old tradition of starting from the temple is still followed by the Deoris, some Sonowals, Chutias and Morans as well as the people of Sadiya. In other communities, the temple has been replaced by the &quot;Namghar&quot;. The festivities of Bohag Bihu continued for a week and ended with the rite by which the goddess was bid farewell. In this rite, a boat was first prepared out of banana stem and decorated with flowers and offerings. Then, it was carried to the banks of the river where a duck/chicken was put inside the boat and allowed to float as a symbol of sacrifice. After performing the rite, the people returned to their homes, singing along the way with the beats of the Dhul and the tunes of the Pepa.

Some old Assamese Bihu folklore still hint to this tradition.
The modern form of Bihu dance was derived from the &quot;Faat Bihu&quot; dance celebrated in Dhakuakhana, Lakhimpur. The performers were called by the Ahom king Rudra Singha in 1694 to dance in the royal arena Rang Ghar. The origin of &quot;Faat Bihu&quot; can be traced to Sadiya. The word &quot;Faat&quot; in Deori-Chutia language means &quot;to migrate&quot;. After the defeat of the Sadiyal Kacharis in Sadiya, the survivors were displaced from Sadiya to different places in the kingdom. A group of these people moved from Sadiya, to Dibrugarh and finally settled down in Harhi Sapori, Dhakuakhana. These people had brought the idols of god and goddess along with them and established a temple now known as Harhi Dewaloi. It was here that the first form of modern Bihu dance was developed. Later, in the 19th century, this form of Bihu dance was adopted by the other communities as well and started being performed in Mahguli sapori, Dhakuakhana by Chutias, Sonowals, Deoris, Ahoms, Mishing etc.
===Ahom contribution===
Ahoms used to celebrate their own spring festival Chyeng-Ken; the rituals of Chyeng-Ken are described in Khyek-Lai-Bet manuscript. But later on they adopted Bihu as their spring festival. Ahom King Rudra Singha gave patronage to Bihu and was also the first one to celebrate Bihu in the courtyard of Rang Ghar. This policy was later followed by his successors.

===Indo-Aryan contribution===

The Indo-Aryans upon their arrival in Assam helped in gradually sanskritisation of the native Bihu/Bisu to bring it to the present form. Being the pioneers of Astronomy, they further associated the term Bisu with the Visuvan day for coincidence of the Bohag Bihu with other springtime festivals observed elsewhere in India on this day and adopted the festival of the natives.

== The three Bihu Festivals ==

===Bohag Bihu===

Bohag Bihu (mid-April, also called Rongali Bihu), the most popular Bihu celebrates the onset of the Assamese New Year (around 14–15 April) and the coming of Spring. This marks the first day of the Hindu solar calendar and is also observed in Bengal, Manipur, Mithila, Nepal, Orissa, Punjab, Kerala and Tamil Nadu though called by different names. It&#x27;s a time of merriment and feasting and continues, in general, for seven days. The farmers prepare the fields for cultivation of paddy and there is a feeling of joy around. The women make pitha, &quot;laroos&quot; (traditional food made of rice, coconut) various drinks by local tribes such as Chuje by Deoris, Nam-Lao by Tai-Ahom, Aapong by Mising tribe and Jolpan which gives the real essence of the season.

The first day of the bihu is called &quot;goru&quot; bihu or cow bihu, where the cows are washed and worshipped, which falls on the last day of the previous year, usually on 14 April. This is followed by &quot;manuh&quot; (human) bihu on 15 April, the New Year Day. This is the day of getting cleaned up, wearing new cloths and celebrating and getting ready for the new year with fresh vigor. The third day is &quot;Gosai&quot; (Gods) bihu; statues of Gods, worshiped in all households are cleaned and worshiped asking for a smooth new year.

The folk songs associated with the Bohag Bihu are called Bihugeets or Bihu songs. The form of celebration and rites vary among different demographic groups.

===The Seven days===
Bohag Bihu or Rongali Bihu festival continues for seven days and called as Haat Bihu. The seven days are known as Chot Bihu, Goru Bihu, Manuh Bihu, Kutum Bihu, Senehi Bihu, Mela Bihu and Chera Bihu.

Goru Bihu: The &quot;goru bihu&quot; or cattle worship rites are observed on the last day of the year. The cattle are washed, smeared with ground turmeric and other pastes, struck with sprigs of &quot;dighalati&quot; and &quot;makhiyati&quot; and endeared to be healthy and productive (&quot;lao kha, bengena kha, bosore bosore barhi ja / maar xoru, baper xoru, toi hobi bor bor goru&quot;—eat gourd, eat brinjal, grow from year to year / your mother is small, your father is small, but you be a large one). The old cattle ropes are cast away through the legs and new ropes are tied to them, and they are allowed to roam anywhere they wished for the entire day.
Manuh Bihu: The New Year Day, the day after the &quot;goru bihu&quot;, is called the &quot;manuh bihu&quot;. Elders are shown respect, with gifts of &quot;bihuwan&quot; (a gamosa), a &quot;hachoti&quot; (kerchief), a &quot;cheleng&quot; etc., and their blessings are sought. Children are given new clothes, and Husori singing begins on this day, and people visit their relatives and friends.

Husori: Village elders move from household to households singing carols, also in the style of &quot;bihu geets&quot;, called &quot;&quot;. 
 It possibly derives from the Dimasa Kachari word formation &quot;ha&quot; (land) and &quot;char&quot; (move over): &quot;hachari&quot;. Villages could have more than one band, and they would visit households in a village non-contiguous to itself, first singing carols at the &quot;Naamghar&quot;. The husari singers then visit individual households, by first announcing their arrival at the gate (&#x27;) with drum beats. The singers are traditionally welcomed into the courtyard where they sing the songs and perform a ring dance. At the end of the performance they are thanked with an offering &quot;dakshina&quot; of &quot;paan&quot; (betel leaf) &quot;tamul&quot; (areka nut) in a &quot;xorai&quot; (brass dish with stand), whereupon the singers bless the household for the coming year. If there is a bereavement in the family, or the family does not invite the singers due to an illness, the band offers blessings from &#x27; and move on. Generally the singers are all male.

Faat Bihu: This is a very old form of Bihu, characterized by spontaneity, popular in the Lakhimpur area of Assam.

Mukoli Bihu: Young unmarried men and women attired in traditional golden silk &quot;muga&quot; dance the bihu and sing bihu songs in the open fields. The songs have themes of romance and sexual love, requited or unrequited. Sometimes the songs describe tragic events too but treated very lightly. The dance celebrates female sexuality.

Jeng Bihu: This is Bihu dance and song performed and watched only by women. The name &quot;jeng&quot; comes from the fact that in earlier days women in the villages used to surround the place of their performance with sticks dug into the ground called &quot;jeng&quot; in Assamese. It is also called &quot;gos tolor bihu&quot; (Bihu beneath the tree).

Baisago: The Bodo-Kachari people celebrate for seven days—the first day for cattle (&quot;Magou&quot;), the second day for man (&quot;Mansoi&quot;) and ancestor worship, feasting, singing and merriment. Songs follow the same themes as the Bihu songs.

Bihutoli Bihu: The rural festival made its transition to urban life when it was first time brought to the stage in Lataxil field in Guwahati by the Guwahati Bihu Sanmilani in 1962, promoted by leading citizens like Radha Govinda Baruah and others. Bihu to a great extent has been popularized by the Bihu &#x27;Samrat&#x27;( king ), of Assam, Khagen Mahanta. Unlike the rural version, the dancers danced on a makeshift elevated stage in an open area that came to be known as a &quot;Bihutoli&quot;. Many such Bihutolis have sprouted since then in Guwahati and other urban areas. The performances are not confined to the Bihu dance form but may incorporate all forms of theatrical performances to keep the audience enthralled well into the early hours. Performances could include standup comedy, to concerts by solo singers. The stage form of Bihu has become so popular, that organizers have begun extending the celebrations to &quot;bohagi bidai&quot;, or farewell to the &quot;Bohag&quot; month, which is similar performances held a month later.

Saat Bihu: Rongali Bihu also called &quot;saat Bihu&quot; (seven Bihus). It celebrates seven days, it&#x27;s called so. On the other hand, Rangali Bihu is constitute of seven different types of Bihu -Goru Bihu (Cow Bihu), Manuh Bihu, Xat Bihu, Senehi Bihu, Maiki Bihu, Rongali Bihu, and Sera Bihu. Actually, the first day to pay respect to cows and other days for social activities.

===Kati Bihu===
Kongali Bihu (mid-October, also called &quot;Kati-Bihu&quot;) has a different flavor as there is less merriment and the atmosphere has a sense of constraining and solemnity. During this time of the year, the paddy in the fields are in the growing stage and the granaries of the farmers are almost empty. On this day, earthen lamps (&quot;saki&quot;) are lit at the foot of the household tulsi plant, the granary, the garden (&quot;bari&quot;) and the paddy fields. In ancient times, earthen lamps were lit all around the paddy fields to attract the insects, thus acting as a natural insecticide. To protect the maturing paddy, cultivators whirl a piece of bamboo and recite &quot;rowa-khowa&quot; chants and spells to ward off pests and the evil eye. During the evening, cattle are fed specially made rice items called &quot;pitha&quot;. Kati Bihu is known as &quot;Kati Gasa&quot; by the Bodo people and &quot;Gathi Sainjora&quot; by the Dimasa people. The Bodo people light lamps at the foot of the &quot;siju&quot; (&quot;Euphorbia neriifolia&quot;) tree. This Bihu is also associated with the lighting of &quot;akaxi gonga&quot; or &quot;akaxbonti&quot;, lamps at the tip of a tall bamboo pole, to show the souls of the dead the way to heaven, a practice that is common to many communities in India, as well as Asia and Europe. Kati bihu is generally celebrated around 19 October, as it is almost mid-October.
=== Magh Bihu ===

Bhogali Bihu (mid-January, also called Magh Bihu) comes from the word &quot;Bhog&quot; that is eating and enjoyment. It is a harvest festival and marks the end of harvesting season. Since the granaries are full, there is a lot of feasting and eating during this period. On the eve of the day called &quot;uruka&quot;, i.e., the last day of &quot;pausa&quot;, menfolk, more particularly young men go to the field, preferably near a river, build a makeshift cottage called &quot;Bhelaghar&quot; with the hay of the harvest fields and the bonfire or &quot;Meji&quot;, . the most important thing for the night. During the night, they prepare food and there is community feasting everywhere. There is also the exchange of sweets and greetings at this time. The entire night (called Uruka) is spent around a &quot;Meji&quot; with people singing bihu songs, beating Dhol, a typical kind of drums or playing games. Boys roam about in the dark stealing firewood and vegetables for fun. The next morning they take a bath and burn the main &quot;Meji&quot;. People gather around the &quot;Meji&quot; and throw &quot;Pitha&quot;s (rice cakes) and betel nuts to it while burning it at the same time. They offer their prayers to the god of Fire and mark the end of the harvesting year. Thereafter they come back home carrying pieces of half burnt firewood for being thrown among fruit trees for favorable results. All the trees in the compound are tied to bamboo strips or paddy stems. Different types of sports like Buffalo-fight, Egg-fight, Cock-fight, Nightingale-fight etc. are held throughout the day. There are other conventional festivals observed by various ethnic-cultural groups. Me-dam-me-phi, Ali-aye-ligang, Porag, Garja, Hapsa Hatarnai, Kherai are few among them. The koch celebrates this bihu as .

==Instruments used in Bihu==

*Dhol (Drum)
*Taal
*Pepa (An instrument made of buffalo horn)
*Toka
*Baanhi (Flute)
*Xutuli
*Gogona (An instrument made of Bambo)

== Bihu elsewhere ==

Bihu is also seen to be celebrated abroad. Many Bihu associations/committees exist elsewhere where this festival is celebrated with enthusiasm. The London Bihu Committee (LBC), UK is one of them among others.

==Related festivals==
The Bohag Bihu (Rongali Bihu) festive day is celebrated elsewhere but called by other name. Some examples of related festivals in Asia include:
Indian subcontinent:
*Vaisakhi in Punjab, India
*Vishu in Kerala, India
*Pohela Boishakh in Bangladesh, and West Bengal, India
*Nobanno in Bangladesh, and West Bengal, India
*Puthandu in Tamil Nadu, India
*Vaishak Ek in Nepal
*Sinhalese New Year in Sri Lanka.
East Asia:
*Cambodian New Year in Cambodia, Thingyan in Burma, Songkran festival in Thailand and other festivals of East Asia and South-East Asia

However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five day Diwali festival. For others, the new year falls on Ugadi and Gudi Padwa, which falls about two weeks before Bohag Bihu.

<text>Gemini 3 was the first crewed mission in NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini and was the first time two American astronauts flew together into space. On March 23, 1965, astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young flew three low Earth orbits in their spacecraft, which they nicknamed &quot;Molly Brown&quot;. It was the first U.S. mission in which the crew fired thrusters to change the size and shape of their orbit, a key test of spacecraft maneuverability vital for planned flights to the Moon. It was also the final crewed flight controlled from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station in Florida, before mission control functions were moved to a new control center at the newly opened Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===

===Original crew===

===Support crew===
* Roger B. Chaffee (Houston CAPCOM)
* L. Gordon Cooper Jr. (Cape CAPCOM)

==Mission parameters==
* Mass: 
* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 32.6 degrees
* Period: 88.3 minutes

==Objectives==

The mission&#x27;s primary goal was to test the new, maneuverable Gemini spacecraft. In space, the crew fired thrusters to change the shape of their orbit, shift their orbital plane slightly, and drop to a lower altitude. Other firsts were achieved on Gemini 3: two people flew aboard an American spacecraft (the Soviet Union launched a three-person crew on Voskhod 1 in 1964 and a two-person crew just a few days earlier on Voskhod 2, upstaging the two-person Gemini and three-person Apollo programs), and the first crewed reentry where the spacecraft was able to produce lift to change its touchdown point.

The mission also tested a system that had originally been designed for the cancelled Mercury-Atlas 10 mission, in which water was injected into the plasma sheath surrounding the capsule during re-entry. This had the effect of improving communications with the ground.

==First orbital maneuver by crewed spacecraft==
On March 23, 1965, at 15:57:00 UTC, at the end of the first orbit, over Corpus Christi, Texas, a 1-minute 14 second burn of the Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) engines gave a reverse delta-V of , which changed the orbit from (with a period of 88.3 minutes), to an orbit of (period of 87.8 minutes). This was the first orbital maneuver made by any crewed spacecraft.

==Flight==

Gus Grissom, hoping to avoid duplication of the experience with his Mercury flight &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot; in which the capsule sank after splashdown, named the Gemini 3 spacecraft &quot;Molly Brown&quot;, in a playful reference to the Broadway musical &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;. NASA management did not like this name, and asked him to change it. Grissom replied, &quot;How about the &quot;Titanic&quot;?&quot;. The managers relented and allowed Grissom to keep &quot;Molly Brown&quot;, but this was the last Gemini flight they allowed the astronauts to name.

The only major incident during the orbital phase involved a contraband corned beef sandwich that Young had smuggled on board, hiding it in a pocket of his spacesuit (though Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton wrote in his autobiography that he gave Young permission to do so). Grissom found this to be highly amusing, saying later, &quot;After the flight our superiors at NASA let us know in no uncertain terms that non-man-rated corned beef sandwiches were out for future space missions. But John&#x27;s deadpan offer of this strictly non-regulation goodie remains one of the highlights of our flight for me.&quot;

The crewmen each took a few bites before the sandwich was restowed. The crumbs it released could have wreaked havoc with the craft&#x27;s electronics, so the crewmen were reprimanded when they returned to Earth. Other crews were warned not to pull the same type of stunt.

Two small failures occurred in-flight. The first was an experiment testing the synergistic effect of zero gravity on sea urchin eggs. A lever essential to the experiment broke off when pulled. The second involved the photographic coverage objective. It was only partially successful due to an improper lens setting on the 16 mm camera.

Early in the flight, the crew noticed the craft gradually yawing left:
00 18 41 (Command Pilot) I seem to have a leak. There must be a leak in one of the thrusters, because I get a continuous yaw left.

00 18 53 (CapCom) Roger. Understand that you get a continuous yaw left.

00 18 57 (Command Pilot) Very slight. Very slow drift.
First attributed to a stuck thruster, the problem was traced to a venting water boiler.

The crewmen made their first orbit change an hour and a half into the flight. The burn lasted 75 seconds and moved them from a orbit to a nearly circular one with a drop in speed of . The second burn, changing the orbital inclination by 0.02 degrees, was made 45 minutes later. The last burn, during the third orbit, lowered the perigee to . This was made so, in case the retrorockets had failed, the spacecraft would still have reentered the atmosphere. The experience of reentry initially matched expectations, with even the color and pattern of the plasma sheath that enveloped the capsule matching those produced for ground simulations. However, it soon became clear that &quot;Molly Brown&quot; was off course and would land off target. Though wind tunnel studies had suggested the spacecraft could maneuver to make up for the discrepancy, Gemini&#x27;s real lift was far less than predicted, and Grissom was unable to significantly adjust course. &quot;Molly Brown&quot; ultimately landed short of its intended splashdown point.

This was not the only unexpected event of the short descent: After its parachutes were deployed, the spacecraft shifted from a vertical to horizontal attitude. The change was so sudden that Grissom cracked his faceplate (made of acrylic) on the control panel in front of him. Later Gemini spacesuits and all Apollo and Space Shuttle (both launch-entry and EVA suits) used polycarbonate plastic.

Upon landing, the astronauts decided to stay in the capsule, not wanting to open the hatch before the arrival of the recovery ship. The crew spent an uncomfortable half-hour in a spacecraft not designed to be a boat. Due to unexpected smoke from the thrusters, the astronauts decided to deviate from the post landing checklist and to keep their helmets on with the face plates closed for some time after splashdown. recovered the craft and crew. The &quot;Gemini III&quot; mission was supported by 10,185 personnel, 126 aircraft and 27 ships from the United States Department of Defense.

The mission insignia was not worn by the flight crew as a patch, like those from Gemini 5 onwards. The Gemini 3 &quot;The Molly Brown&quot; emblem was designed and minted on gold-plated, sterling silver, medallions. The crew carried a number of these medallions into space to give to their families and friends. The same design was printed on the cover of Grissom&#x27;s book &quot;Gemini!: A Personal Account of Man&#x27;s Venture Into Space&quot;. Young was seen wearing the emblem as a patch, produced post-flight, on his flightsuit as late as 1981.

<text>The United States Secretary of Homeland Security is the head of the United States Department of Homeland Security, the federal department tasked with ensuring public safety in the United States. The secretary is a member of the Cabinet of the United States. The position was created by the Homeland Security Act following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

The new department consisted primarily of components transferred from other Cabinet departments because of their role in homeland security, such as the Coast Guard, the Federal Protective Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (which includes the United States Border Patrol), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (which includes Homeland Security Investigations), the United States Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

The current secretary of homeland security is Kristi Noem, since January 25, 2025.

==List of secretaries of homeland security==
Prior to the establishment of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there existed an assistant to the president for the Office of Homeland Security, which was created following the September 11 attacks in 2001.

;Parties

 (5)

;Status


a. James Loy served as acting secretary in his capacity as Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.

b. Rand Beers served as acting secretary in his capacity as confirmed Undersecretary of Homeland Security for National Protection and Programs and Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security; Beers was the highest ranking Senate-approved presidential appointee at the Department of Homeland Security.

c. Elaine Duke served as acting secretary in her capacity as Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.

d. Kevin McAleenan served as acting secretary in his capacity as Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. His tenure was ruled unlawful.

e. Chad Wolf served as acting secretary in his capacity as Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans. His tenure was ruled unlawful.

f. Peter Gaynor served as acting secretary in his capacity as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator.

g. David Pekoske served as acting secretary in his capacity as Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration

h. Benjamine Huffman served as acting secretary in his capacity as Director of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers.

==Order of succession==
While appointment of acting officials is generally governed by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), the Homeland Security Act of 2002 creates exceptions to FVRA, mandating that the under secretary of homeland security for management is third in the line of succession for Secretary of Homeland Security, and establishes an alternate process by which the secretary can directly establish a line of succession outside the provisions of the FVRA.

As of November 8, 2019, the order of succession is as follows. However, the legality of this update was challenged.

# Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security
# Under Secretary for Management
# Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
# Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans
# Administrator and Assistant Secretary of the Transportation Security Administration
# Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency

Formerly, an April 10, 2019 update to the DHS Orders of Succession, made pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, provided a different order in the case of unavailability to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency:

# Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security 
# Under Secretary for Management 
# Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
# Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
# Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
# Under Secretary for Science and Technology 
# Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis 
# Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration 
# Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
# Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
# Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans 
# General Counsel 
# Deputy Under Secretary for Management
# Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
# Deputy Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration 
# Deputy Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
# Deputy Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
# Director of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers

As a result of Executive Order 13753 in 2016, the order of succession for the secretary of homeland security was as follows:

# Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security
# Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Management
# Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
#Under Secretary of Homeland Security for National Protection and Programs
#Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Science and Technology
#Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis
#Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection
#Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration
#Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
#Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
#Assistant Secretary for Policy
#General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security
#Deputy Under Secretary for Management
#Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection
#Deputy Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration
#Deputy Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
#Deputy Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
#Director of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center

==Administration-cited potential nominees==
===Bernard Kerik===
George W. Bush nominated Bernard Kerik for the position in 2004. However a week later, Kerik withdrew his nomination, explaining that he had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny.

===Raymond Kelly===
By July 2013, Raymond Kelly had served as Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for nearly 12 straight years. Within days of Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano&#x27;s announcement that she was resigning, Kelly was soon cited as an obvious potential successor by New York senator Charles Schumer and others.
During a July 16, 2013, interview, President Obama referred generally to the &quot;bunch of strong candidates&quot; for nomination to head the Department of Homeland Security, but singled out Kelly as &quot;one of the best there is&quot; and &quot;very well qualified for the job&quot;.

Later in July 2013, the online internet news website/magazine &quot;Huffington Post&quot; detailed &quot;a growing campaign to quash the potential nomination of New York City Police commissioner Raymond Kelly as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security&quot; amid claims of &quot;divisive, harmful, and ineffective policing that promotes stereotypes and profiling&quot;. Days after that article, Kelly penned a statistics-heavy &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion article defending the NYPD&#x27;s programs, stating &quot;the average number of stops we conduct is less than one per officer per week&quot; and that this and other practices have led to &quot;7,383 lives saved—and... they are largely the lives of young men of color.&quot;

Kelly was also featured because of his NYPD retirement and unusually long tenure there in a long segment on the CBS News program &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; in December 2013, especially raising the question of the controversial &quot;stop and frisk&quot; policy in New York City and the long decline and drop of various types of crimes committed.

== Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security ==

=== Purpose ===
The Office of the Secretary (OS) oversees the execution of the duties of the Department of Homeland Security. Certain elements also aid the Secretary of Homeland Security and senior officials of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as private sector and government partners in their duties.

=== Composition ===
The Office of the Secretary contains several offices and other elements of the DHS. Most of the heads of these elements report directly to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary, but the Military Advisor and Executive Secretary report to the DHS Chief of Staff, who is currently Jonathan Davidson.

From 1992 until 1993, Card served as the 11th U.S. Secretary of Transportation under President Bush. In August 1992, at the request of President Bush, Secretary Card coordinated the administration&#x27;s disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Later that year, Secretary Card directed President Bush&#x27;s transition office during the transition from the Bush administration to the Clinton administration.

====Under George W. Bush====
In 2000, Card was asked by Texas Governor George W. Bush to run the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.

On November 26, 2000, Card was appointed to be chief of staff for President-elect George W. Bush upon Bush&#x27;s January 20, 2001 inauguration.

On September 11, 2001, Card approached Bush as he was visiting Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, and whispered in his ear the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center, confirming that a terrorist attack was underway. Card later recounted his story, saying that he whispered &quot;A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.&quot;

On March 28, 2006, the White House announced that Card would resign as Chief of Staff and be replaced by United States Office of Management and Budget director Joshua B. Bolten. Card&#x27;s resignation was effective April 14, 2006. At 5 years and 84 days, his tenure as Chief of Staff was the second-longest in the office&#x27;s history.

===Post-government career===
Card received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst on May 25, 2007. While accepting the degree, Card was booed loudly by students and faculty who deplored the choice to bestow the honor.

Card considered running in the 2010 special election to fill the United States Senate seat held by Ted Kennedy, who had died in office. State Senator Scott Brown, who considered entering the race, promised to drop out if Card decided to run. Card announced on September 11, 2009, that he would not enter the race and that he was throwing his support to Brown, who went on to win the election.

On July 5, 2011, Card was named acting dean of The Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University.

In 2014, Card was selected as the fifth president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire. He began his tenure in December 2014, and resigned in summer of 2016.

Since December 2023, Card has served as the Chief Executive Officer of the George &amp; Barbara Bush Foundation.

==Personal life==
Card is married to Reverend Kathleene Card. They reside in Jaffrey, New Hampshire. They have three grown children and six grandchildren.

<text>Major-General Philip Skippon ( – 20 February 1660) was an English army officer and politician. He fought for the Parliamentary cause during the English Civil War as a senior officer in the New Model Army. Prior to the war, Skippon fought in the religious wars on the continent. During the Interregnum he was a member of Parliament, an active soldier and on occasions a government administrator.

==Life==
===Background===
Philip Skippon was the son of Luke Skippon (c. 1567–1638), the son of Bartholomew Skippon of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk. Luke and his elder brother William (born c. 1566) went to school at Dereham and studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. William lived at Tawstock in north Devon where he was Secretary to Lord Bath, and died there on 1 January 1633/34. Luke (born c. 1567) had his seat at West Lexham, Norfolk, and was father of two notable sons, Philip, and Luke (died 1676), who entered Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1614 and made his career there, becoming junior Proctor in 1633–34, and being nominated for Mastership of the college in 1663 but not appointed.

===To 1638 ===
Philip entered the military profession at an early age and in July 1620 volunteered to join Sir Horace Vere&#x27;s expedition to aid Frederick V of Bohemia in the Electorate of the Palatinate. He served in it until the Bohemian defeat in 1623, participating in the two sieges of Frankenthal (where he was married in 1622). He then went on to serve Maurice of Nassau in the Netherlands, receiving a commission in 1625. At the sieges of Breda in 1625 and 1637 he was wounded, and under his old commander, Lord Vere, he was present when &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Maastricht were attacked in 1629. By 1632 he was a sergeant major and led many of the sorties at Maastricht with distinction. He also became deeply interested in religion, writing small private religious volumes for his family.

===1639–1644===
A veteran of 18 years&#x27; experience, Captain Skippon returned to England in 1638. On 23 October 1639 he was recommended by Charles I of England for a command in the Honourable Artillery Company and he moved to London to take up this command. With civil war looming, on 10 January 1642 he was made major-general and commander of the City of London&#x27;s Trained Bands by Parliament in defiance of the king&#x27;s authority, and two days later he mustered them to welcome the five members who Charles had failed to arrest. On 13 May Charles ordered Skippon to join him at York, but Skippon replied &quot;I desire to honour God and not to honour men&quot;, and Parliament declared Charles&#x27;s order illegal. Skippon was absent at the Parliamentarian defeats at Edgehill and Brentford, but continued to train his men before marching them out of London to strengthen the forces of the Earl of Essex, Captain-General of the Parliament&#x27;s forces. He then faced Royalist forces at the Battle of Turnham Green, encouraging his under-trained militiamen with the words:
Within a week of the battle Essex made Skippon his Sergeant-Major-General, a post which carried with it the command of the foot and the complicated duty of arranging the line of battle. In 1643 his religious tracts written in the Netherlands were collected and published as &quot;The Christian Centurion&quot;, one of many devotional tracts he published for his troops to read. However, his high level of experience meant that Parliament was unwilling to risk him in action early in the war, though he did serve alongside Essex at Gloucester. His first field command came on 20 September 1643, with command of the left wing and reserves at the First Battle of Newbury. He continued serving with Essex during the disastrous Lostwithiel campaign and was left in command of the Parliamentarian garrison of 6,000 there on 1 September 1644 when Essex and Lord Robartes fled to Plymouth. The following day, without hope of reinforcement, Skippon negotiated with King Charles: having gained very reasonable terms for his forces, he surrendered and marched his force out of the town. He then gathered the infantrymen from that force in October and marched them to take part in the second Battle of Newbury, occupying the centre of the high ground near Stockcross and recapturing seven of the guns they had lost at Lostwithiel.

===1645===
The appointment as Sergeant-Major-General of the New Model Army soon followed, as, apart from his distinguished services, there was scarcely another man in England with the knowledge of detail requisite for the post. In this capacity he supported Thomas Fairfax as loyally as he had supported Essex. He led the centre at the Battle of Naseby, where he refused to leave the field while victory was still in the balance despite being dangerously wounded. For his conduct on this decisive occasion, the two Houses of Parliament thanked him, and they sent him special physicians to cure him of his wound. It was a long time before he was fit to serve in the field again. He only reappeared at the siege of Oxford, which he directed. At the end of the war he was selected for the command of the forthcoming Irish expedition, with the rank of marshal-general. The discontent of the soldiery, however, which ended in open mutiny, put an end to a command which Skippon had only accepted under great pressure. He bore a part in all the movements which the army leaders now carried out.

===Post-war===
Skippon endeavoured to preserve a middle position between his own Presbyterianism and the Independents, and to secure a firm treaty with the king by any means. The army outstripped Fairfax and Skippon in action. The major-general was named as one of the king&#x27;s judges, but, like Fairfax, did not take his place. After the war he was returned as MP for King&#x27;s Lynn in 1654, 1656 and 1658 during the Commonwealth. He also held high military and civil offices. During the Rule of the Major-Generals he was appointed to command the London military district (with John Barkstead as his deputy, who was zealous in suppressing immorality and ungodliness in the area under Skippon&#x27;s control), where his popularity was always high— but ceased to influence passing events. He said little in Parliament, though his comment on John Naylor (&quot;If this be liberty, God deliver us from such liberty!&quot;) is well known. He was one of the members of Cromwell&#x27;s House of Lords, and, in general, was universally respected and beloved. On Cromwell&#x27;s death he was made head of the London Militia again by the restored Long Parliament. Age and infirmities prevented him from taking any part in the revolutions which culminated in the Restoration, and in March 1660 he died.

===Family===
He had first married Maria Comes of Frankenthal, Lower Palatinate, in the Netherland church there on 14 May 1622, by whom he had several children, most of whom did not survive infancy. These were Anna (Utrecht, 1623–1624), Anna (Montfoort, 1625), William (Amersfoort, 1628-1646/47), Marie (Amersfoort, 1631), Phillip (Amersfoort, 1633-1633), Susanna (West Lexham, 1635), Luke (Foulsham, 1638) and Philip (Hackney, 1641). Their son and surviving heir Philip became MP for Dunwich. The General&#x27;s wife Maria Skippon died at Acton on 24 January 1655/56, and had a monument in the church there. There was a second marriage, for his widow Dame Katherine Skippon is first-named in his will written at Acton, Middlesex, which leaves lands there, and at Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, and in Norfolk and Suffolk. The will also refers to his son Philip and daughters Anne Bragge, Mary Skippon and Susan Meredith. Susan was the wife of Sir Richard Meredith, 2nd Baronet of Leeds Abbey, Kent.

<text>The White House chief of staff is the head of the Executive Office of the President of the United States, a cabinet position in the federal government of the United States.

The chief of staff is a political appointee of the president of the United States who does not require Senate confirmation, and who serves at the pleasure of the President. While not a legally required role, all presidents since Harry S. Truman have appointed a chief of staff.

In the second administration of Donald Trump, the current chief of staff is Susie Wiles, who succeeded Jeff Zients on January 20, 2025. The chief of staff is the most senior political appointee in the White House. 
The position is widely recognized as one of great power and influence, owing to daily contact with the president of the United States and control of the Executive Office of the President of the United States.

==Historical background==
Originally, the duties now performed by the chief of staff belonged to the president&#x27;s private secretary and were fulfilled by crucial confidantes and policy advisers such as George B. Cortelyou, Joseph Tumulty, and Louis McHenry Howe to presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt, respectively. The private secretary served as the president&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; chief aide, in a role that combined personal and professional assignments of highly delicate and demanding natures, requiring great skill and utmost discretion. The job of gatekeeper and overseeing the president&#x27;s schedule was separately delegated to the appointments secretary, as with aide Edwin &quot;Pa&quot; Watson.

From 1933 to 1939, as he greatly expanded the scope of the federal government&#x27;s policies and powers in response to the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt relied on his &#x27;Brain Trust&#x27; of top advisers. Although working directly for the president, they were often appointed to vacant positions in federal agencies and departments, whence they drew their salaries since the White House lacked statutory or budgetary authority to create staff positions. It was not until 1939, during Roosevelt&#x27;s second term in office, that the foundations of the modern White House staff were created using a formal structure. Roosevelt was able to persuade Congress to approve the creation of the Executive Office of the President, which would report directly to the president. During World War II, Roosevelt created the position of &quot;Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief&quot; for his principal military adviser, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy.

In 1946, in response to the rapid growth of the U.S. government&#x27;s executive branch, the position of &quot;Assistant to the President of the United States&quot; was established. Charged with the affairs of the White House, it was the immediate predecessor to the modern chief of staff. It was in 1953, under Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower, that the president&#x27;s preeminent assistant was designated the &quot;White House Chief of Staff&quot;.

Assistant to the president became a rank generally shared by the chief of staff along with the other most senior presidential aides such as the White House counsel, the White House press secretary, and others. This new system did not catch on immediately however. Presidents Kennedy and Johnson still relied on their appointments secretaries instead, and it was not until the Nixon administration that the chief of staff took over maintenance of the President&#x27;s schedule. This concentration of power in the Nixon and Ford White House (whose last chief of staff was Dick Cheney) led presidential candidate Jimmy Carter to campaign in 1976 with the promise that he would not appoint a chief of staff. And indeed, for the first two and a half years of his presidency, he appointed no one to the post.

=== Average tenure in office ===
The average tenure for a White House chief of staff is just over 18 months. The inaugural chief of staff, John R. Steelman, under Harry S. Truman, was the president&#x27;s only chief of staff; Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell alone served in the position during John F. Kennedy&#x27;s unfinished term of 34 months in office. Andrew Card and Denis McDonough each served at least one entire presidential term of office under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, respectively.

==Role==
Chris Whipple, author of &quot;The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency&quot;, loosely describes the role of a White House chief of staff through his interview with former president Barack Obama:

The responsibilities of the chief of staff are both managerial and advisory and may include the following:

* Selecting senior White House staffers and supervising their offices&#x27; activities
* Managing and designing the overall structure of the White House staff system
* Control the flow of people into the Oval Office
* Manage the flow of information to and decisions from the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk (with the White House staff secretary)
* Directing, managing and overseeing all policy development
* Protecting the political interests of the president
* Negotiating legislation and appropriating funds with United States Congress leaders, Cabinet secretaries, and extra-governmental political groups to implement the president&#x27;s agenda
* Advise on any and usually various issues set by the president

These responsibilities have recently extended to firing of senior staff members. In the case of Omarosa Manigault Newman, who published a tape she alleged was made in the Situation Room of her firing by Chief of Staff John Kelly, the chief of staff said that his decision for her departure was non-negotiable and that &quot;the staff and everyone on the staff works for me and not the president.&quot;

Richard Nixon&#x27;s first chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, garnered a reputation in Washington for the iron hand he wielded in the position. Referring to himself as &quot;the president&#x27;s son-of-a-bitch&quot;, he was a rigid gatekeeper who would frequently meet with administration officials in place of the president, and then report to Nixon on the officials&#x27; talking points himself. Journalist Bob Woodward, in his books &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Secret Man&quot; (2005), wrote that many of his sources, including Mark Felt, later revealed as &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, displayed a genuine fear of Haldeman.

<doc id="212935" wikidata="Q6804195" url="?curid=212935" title="Measure of non-compactness">
<text>In functional analysis, two measures of non-compactness are commonly used; these associate numbers to sets in such a way that compact sets all get the measure 0, and other sets get measures that are bigger according to &quot;how far&quot; they are removed from compactness.

The underlying idea is the following: a bounded set can be covered by a single ball of some radius. Sometimes several balls of a smaller radius can also cover the set. A compact set in fact can be covered by finitely many balls of arbitrary small radius, because it is totally bounded. So one could ask: what is the smallest radius that allows to cover the set with finitely many balls?

Formally, we start with a metric space &quot;M&quot; and a subset &quot;X&quot;. The ball measure of non-compactness is defined as
:α(&quot;X&quot;) = inf {&quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 : there exist finitely many balls of radius &quot;r&quot; which cover &quot;X&quot;}
and the Kuratowski measure of non-compactness is defined as
:β(&quot;X&quot;) = inf {&quot;d&quot; &gt; 0 : there exist finitely many sets of diameter at most &quot;d&quot; which cover &quot;X&quot;}

Since a ball of radius &quot;r&quot; has diameter at most 2&quot;r&quot;, we have α(&quot;X&quot;) ≤ β(&quot;X&quot;) ≤ 2α(&quot;X&quot;).

The two measures α and β share many properties, and we will use γ in the sequel to denote either one of them. Here is a collection of facts:
* &quot;X&quot; is bounded if and only if γ(&quot;X&quot;) &lt; ∞. 
* γ(&quot;X&quot;) = γ(&quot;X&quot;cl), where &quot;X&quot;cl denotes the closure of &quot;X&quot;. 
* If &quot;X&quot; is compact, then γ(&quot;X&quot;) = 0. Conversely, if γ(&quot;X&quot;) = 0 and &quot;X&quot; is complete, then &quot;X&quot; is compact. 
* γ(&quot;X&quot; ∪ &quot;Y&quot;) = max(γ(&quot;X&quot;), γ(&quot;Y&quot;)) for any two subsets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.
* γ is continuous with respect to the Hausdorff distance of sets.

Measures of non-compactness are most commonly used if &quot;M&quot; is a normed vector space. In this case, we have in addition:
* γ(&quot;aX&quot;) = |&quot;a&quot;| γ(&quot;X&quot;) for any scalar &quot;a&quot;
* γ(&quot;X&quot; + &quot;Y&quot;) ≤ γ(&quot;X&quot;) + γ(&quot;Y&quot;)
* γ(conv(&quot;X&quot;)) = γ(&quot;X&quot;), where conv(&quot;X&quot;) denotes the convex hull of &quot;X&quot;

Note that these measures of non-compactness are useless for subsets of Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot;: by the Heine–Borel theorem, every bounded closed set is compact there, which means that γ(&quot;X&quot;) = 0 or ∞ according to whether &quot;X&quot; is bounded or not.

Measures of non-compactness are however useful in the study of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, for example. In this context, one can prove that any ball &quot;B&quot; of radius &quot;r&quot; has α(&quot;B&quot;) = &quot;r&quot; and β(&quot;B&quot;) = 2&quot;r&quot;.

<doc id="212948" wikidata="Q887489" url="?curid=212948" title="John H. Sununu">
<text>John Henry Sununu (born July 2, 1939) is an American politician who served as the 75th governor of New Hampshire from 1983 to 1989 and as the 14th White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush from 1989 to 1991.

Born in Cuba to an American father and a Salvadoran mother, he is of Greek, Hispanic, and Lebanese descent, making him the first Arab American, Greek American, and Hispanic American to be governor of New Hampshire and White House chief of staff. He is the father of John E. Sununu, the former United States Senator from New Hampshire, and Christopher Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire. Sununu was the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2009 to 2011.

==Early life and education==
Sununu was born in Havana, Cuba, while his parents were visiting Cuba on a business trip. He is the son of John Saleh Sununu, an international film distributor, and Victoria Sununu (née Dada). His father&#x27;s family came to the United States from Lebanon as Greek Orthodox Christians at the turn of the 20th century and his ancestry was Greek and Lebanese from Jerusalem and Beirut respectively. John Saleh Sununu was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother Victoria Dada was born in El Salvador. Her family were also Greek Orthodox Christians, of Greek and Hispanic ancestry, and had settled in Central America at the turn of the 20th century. Sununu visited Beirut, Lebanon, as a child in the late 1940s. He grew up in New York City and graduated from the La Salle Military Academy on Long Island.

Sununu earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1961, a Master of Science degree in 1963, and a PhD in 1966 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, all in mechanical engineering. He was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.

==Career==
From 1966 to 1982 he taught at Tufts University, where he was an associate professor of mechanical engineering. He was the associate dean of the university&#x27;s College of Engineering from 1968 to 1973. As of 1988, Sununu retained his title and family tuition benefits from Tufts during an &quot;extremely rare&quot; unpaid six-year leave of absence that coincided with his governorship. He was on the advisory board of the Technology and Policy Program at MIT from 1984 until 1989.

A Republican, Sununu represented the 5th Rockingham district in the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 1973 to 1975. Sununu ran for the New Hampshire Senate in 1974 and 1976, but lost the general election both times to Delbert F. Downing. He ran for the Executive Council of New Hampshire in 1978, but lost the general election to Dudley Dudley. He ran for the United States Senate in 1980, but lost the Republican primary to Warren Rudman.

===Governor===
Sununu became New Hampshire&#x27;s 75th governor on January 6, 1983, and was re-elected twice to hold the position for three consecutive terms. He was the first Arab-American governor of New Hampshire. Sununu was chairman of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, the Republican Governors Association and, in 1987, the National Governors Association.

Sununu angered some when he was the only governor of a U.S. state not to call for repeal of the UN General Assembly Resolution 3379 (&quot;Zionism is racism&quot;). He later reversed his position on this issue and supported the Republicans&#x27; pro-Israel 1988 platform.

===White House chief of staff===
Sununu was the first White House chief of staff for George H. W. Bush, holding the position from 1989 to 1991. &quot;Time&quot; magazine dubbed him &quot;Bush&#x27;s Bad Cop&quot; on the front cover on May 21, 1990.

Sununu is considered to have engineered Bush&#x27;s mid-term abandonment of his 1988 campaign promise of &quot;no new taxes&quot;. In his report &quot;Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change&quot;, Nathaniel Rich wrote that in November 1989 Sununu prevented the signing of a 67-nation commitment at the Noordwijk Climate Conference to freeze carbon dioxide emissions, with a reduction of 20 percent by 2005, and singled him out as a force starting coordinated efforts to bewilder the public on the topic of global warming and changing it from an urgent, nonpartisan and unimpeachable issue to a political one. Interviewed as to his involvement in preventing an agreement, he stated: &quot;It couldn&#x27;t have happened, because, frankly, the leaders in the world at that time were at a stage where they were all looking how to seem like they were supporting the policy without having to make hard commitments that would cost their nations serious resources. Frankly, that&#x27;s about where we are today.&quot;

Sununu recommended David Souter of New Hampshire to President George H. W. Bush for appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, at the behest of his close friend, then-U.S. senator and fellow New Hampshirite Warren Rudman. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the events leading up to the appointment of the &quot;liberal jurist&quot; in a 2000 editorial, saying Rudman in his &quot;Yankee Republican liberalism&quot; took &quot;pride in recounting how he sold Mr. Souter to gullible White House chief of staff John Sununu as a confirmable conservative. Then they both sold the judge to President Bush, who wanted above all else to avoid a confirmation battle [after Robert Bork].&quot; Rudman wrote in his memoir that he had &quot;suspected all along&quot; that Souter would not &quot;overturn activist liberal precedents.&quot; Sununu later said that he had &quot;a lot of disappointment&quot; about Souter&#x27;s positions on the Court and would have preferred him to be more similar to Justice Antonin Scalia.
At the recommendation of George W. Bush, Sununu resigned his White House post on December 4, 1991. He remained at the White House as Counselor to the President until March 1, 1992.

====USS &quot;Liberty&quot; veterans reunion====
On the 24th anniversary of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident (in 1991), approximately 50 &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors, including Captain William McGonagle, were invited to the White House to meet with President George H.W. Bush in a meeting set up by former Congressmen Paul Findley and Pete McCloskey. After waiting for over 2 hours, President Bush waved at them as he passed by in his limousine, but did not meet with them in person. Many of the survivors were reportedly disheartened and disappointed with this. Instead, Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft greeted them. Rear Admiral Thomas A. Brooks, who had spoken out in favor of &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors previously, presented them with a Presidential Unit Citation that had been signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson but never awarded. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, a longtime &quot;Liberty&quot; advocate, was also in attendance. This meeting was objected to by the Anti-Defamation League.

====Conflict-zone mining====
Sununu is a major shareholder of the Anglo-Asian mining company (holding 9.38%) which stands to profit after Azerbaijan military victories over Nagorno-Karabakh.

====Expenses controversy====
As White House chief of staff, Sununu reportedly took personal trips, for skiing and other purposes, and classified them as official, for purposes such as conservation or promoting the Thousand Points of Light. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Sununu&#x27;s jets &quot;took him to fat-cat Republican fund-raisers, ski lodges, golf resorts and even his dentist in Boston.&quot; Sununu had paid the government only $892 for his more than $615,000 worth of military jet travel. Sununu said that his use of the jets was necessary because he had to be near a telephone at all times for reasons of national security. Sununu became the subject of much late-night television humor over the incident. Sununu worsened the situation shortly afterwards when, after leaking rumors of financial difficulties in his family, he traveled to a rare stamp auction at Christie&#x27;s auction house in New York City from Washington in a government limousine, spending $5,000 on rare stamps. Sununu then sent the car and driver back to Washington unoccupied while he returned on a corporate jet. In one week, 45 newspapers ran editorials on Sununu, nearly all of them critical of his actions. Sununu resigned his White House post on December 4, 1991. Sununu repaid over $47,000 to the government for the flights on the orders of White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, with the help of the Republican Party. However, the reimbursements were at commercial rates, which are about one-tenth the cost of the actual flights; one ski trip to Vail, Colorado alone had cost taxpayers $86,330.

==Other activities==

Sununu co-hosted CNN&#x27;s nightly &quot;Crossfire&quot; from March 1992 until February 1998.

From 1963 until 1983, he was President of JHS Engineering Company and Thermal Research Inc. In addition, he helped establish and worked as chief engineer for Astro Dynamics Inc. from 1960 until 1965.

In 2012, Sununu as a national co-chair for the Mitt Romney presidential campaign made controversial comments directed towards then President Barack Obama calling Obama &quot;un-American&quot;. After receiving backlash for the comment, Sununu apologized soon afterwards. A few months later, Sununu again caused controversy for the Romney campaign when he said that the reason he believed former Secretary of State, Colin Powell (a Republican) endorsed President Obama over Romney was because both Powell and Obama are the same race. After the election, Sununu blamed Romney&#x27;s loss to Obama on Obama&#x27;s supporters being &quot;dependent&quot; on government programs.

Sununu is President of JHS Associates, Ltd. and is a partner in Trinity International Partners, a private financial firm. He is also a member of Honorary Council of Advisors for U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce (USACC).

==Awards and honors==
He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1990 for exceptionally significant creativity in energy systems development, in engineering education, and in integration of technological advances with public policy.

==Personal life==

Sununu was married to the former Nancy Hayes, with whom he had eight children, including former U.S. senator John E. Sununu and Chris Sununu, formerly a member of the New Hampshire Executive Council and currently the governor of New Hampshire. In recent years, he moved from Salem, New Hampshire, to Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, to be closer to relatives. He and his wife were subsequently elected as the town&#x27;s honorary hog reeves and poundkeepers. The title is usually given to an unsuspecting newcomer each year.

Sununu&#x27;s daughter Cathy is the president of the Portsmouth Museum of Art in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

Sununu is a fluent Spanish speaker.

On September 7, 2024, Nancy Sununu died following a long battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==In popular culture==
In the 1991 police comedy film &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot;, Sununu is played by Peter Van Norden.

In January 1995, John Sununu made a cameo appearance on the first episode of the Delta Burke CBS sitcom, &quot;Women of the House&quot;, titled &quot;Miss Sugarbaker Goes to Washington&quot;. In the episode, Suzanne Sugarbaker is a guest on the CNN political program, &quot;Crossfire&quot;. Michael Kinsley also appears.

In the 1996 film &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;, a clip (from &quot;This Island Earth&quot;) of a jet plane prompts Tom Servo to quip, &quot;John Sununu goes for a haircut.&quot; The joke was a recurring one on the original series, as well. It refers to Sununu’s use of a military jet for personal business while he was Bush I’s Chief of Staff.

In the 1996 episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. &quot;Glen Campbell,&quot; Matt Groening mentions he makes it a point to watch shows that having rhyming titles, and after several real show titles, he mentions &quot;Yoo-Hoo, It&#x27;s John Sununu.&quot;

==Political endorsements==
After the first presidential debate of 2016, Sununu endorsed Donald Trump for President of the United States.

In early January 2024, Sununu endorsed Nikki Haley for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

<doc id="212950" wikidata="Q4160493" url="?curid=212950" title="Joey Skaggs">
<text>Joey Skaggs (born 1945) is an American multi-media artist, activist, satirist, educator and prankster. In a career spanning six decades, he has produced paintings, sculptures, guerrilla theater, performance art, socially revealing hoaxes, media pranks, and films. Skaggs is one of the originators of the phenomenon known as culture jamming.

== Career and Artistic Philosophy ==
Joey Skaggs, originally trained as a painter and sculptor, began experimenting with performance art in the 1960s, utilizing public spaces and mass media as platforms for his work. His projects often incorporate elements of guerrilla theater, satire, and hoaxes to address themes such as societal norms, media sensationalism, and institutional power dynamics.

Skaggs is known for creating various aliases like Doctor Schlafer or Father Anthony Joseph and scenarios to critique media systems and highlight the spread of misinformation. His work frequently incorporates humor and absurdity as a means to engage audiences and spark discussion on issues such as corporate practices, political systems, environmental concerns, and social inequality.

Described as a pioneer of culture jamming, Skaggs has been recognized for his innovative use of performance and media deception. In this regard, he can be likened to a playwright or filmmaker in that his hoaxes are tightly scripted affairs meant to bypass an already suspicious gatekeeping establishment—conceived, written, produced, directed, staged and acted with locations, props, and pre-packaged footage (press release and video content). Critics and commentators have noted his influence on art and activism, highlighting his unique approach to blending performance with social critique.

== Films ==
In 2017, the feature documentary &quot;Art of the Prank&quot;, directed by Andrea Marini, about artist Joey Skaggs, was released internationally on television and streaming platforms after screening at film festivals.

In 2020, production began on a series of short oral history films titled &quot;Joey Skaggs Satire and Art Activism, 1960s to the Present and Beyond&quot;. The films document firsthand accounts of Skaggs’ art and satirical performances, exploring the planning, execution, and impact of his interventions. They aim to preserve the legacy of his critique on media and societal norms, while examining public and media reactions to his work. The series serves as both an educational resource and historical archive, highlighting Skaggs’ role as a pioneer in performance art and media activism. Individual episodes have been screened at film festivals in the United States and internationally as production continues.

==Partial works==

=== 1960s and 1970s ===

==== Crucifixion ====
In the late 1960s, Joey Skaggs erected a life-size sculpture depicting a decayed Jesus Christ in Tompkins Square Park to critique religious hypocrisy within the Church. The piece was later exhibited in 1967 at New York University and two Central Park Be-ins. In 1969, Skaggs brought a duplicate of the sculpture to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, where church officials denied him entry and he was removed by police.

==== Hippie Bus Tour to Queens ====
In 1968, Joey Skaggs took a group of approximately 60 East Village hippies to suburban Queens to satirize tour buses that brought visitors to Greenwich Village to observe the hippie counterculture. Participants included publisher Paul Krassner and artist Yayoi Kusama, who painted polka dots on nude dancers as part of the performance. The event received media attention, including an interview with Skaggs on the &quot;Today Show&quot;, a front-page article in the &quot;Daily News&quot;, and coverage in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other publications.

==== Vietnamese Christmas Nativity Burning ====
Joey Skaggs staged a protest against the Vietnam War on Christmas Day, creating a life-size Nativity scene with symbolic elements to critique U.S. involvement in the conflict. The display, set up in Central Park, included a manger, papier-mâché figures such as pigs in police hats, sheep holding briefcases, and a camel representing Hubert Humphrey. It also featured depictions of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. as beheaded wise men, along with a Vietnamese baby Jesus surrounded by peasant sculptures of Mary and Joseph. Skaggs and his collaborators, dressed as American soldiers, planned to set the display on fire but authorities intervened. The event was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; under the headline “Yippie ‘Nativity Scene’ Leads to Tickets for Littering.” 

==== Earlville Opera House ====
In 1971, while living on a dairy farm in central New York, Joey Skaggs learned about the Earlville Opera House, a historic building constructed in 1892 in Earlville, New York, that was slated for demolition to make way for a parking lot. Skaggs purchased the building and led a campaign to preserve it. Today the opera house is listed on the National Register of Historical Places and operates as a vibrant performance and exhibition venue. It celebrated its 50th anniversary as a cultural center in 2022.

==== Cathouse for Dogs ====
The &quot;Cathouse for Dogs&quot; is regarded as Skaggs’ first major media hoax. In 1976, Joey Skaggs placed an ad in New York’s &quot;Village Voice&quot; promoting a &quot;Cathouse for Dogs,&quot; claiming pet owners could pay $50 for their dogs to be sexually gratified. When the media expressed interest, Skaggs staged an event with volunteers and dogs and later provided video footage to WABC-TV, which was incorporated into the documentary, &quot;It&#x27;s A Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;, which addressed animal cruelty and won an Emmy. Skaggs was subpoenaed by the Attorney General’s office for operating a bordello for dogs. At the hearing, he revealed the hoax, emphasizing the role of media in misrepresentation. WABC-TV did not issue a correction.

==== Celebrity Sperm Bank ====
Later in 1976, under the alias Giuseppe Scaggoli, Joey Skaggs announced an auction for a fictitious “Celebrity Sperm Bank,” claiming to offer sperm from rock stars such as Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, and John Lennon. On the day of the supposed event, Skaggs staged a scene outside a brownstone on Waverly Place in New York City, featuring actors posing as bidders and protesters. When the media arrived, Skaggs claimed the sperm had been stolen and read a ransom note that humorously referenced activist Abbie Hoffman. Despite the event not occurring as advertised, it attracted significant media attention in both print and broadcast news.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===

==== Metamorphosis, Cockroach Miracle Cure ====
In 1981, Joey Skaggs orchestrated the “Metamorphosis Cockroach Miracle Cure” hoax to critique the media’s susceptibility to sensational stories. Using the alias Dr. Josef Gregor—an allusion to Gregor Samsa, the protagonist in Franz Kafka’s novella The Metamorphosis—Skaggs held a press conference dressed in a white suit and Panama hat adorned with fake cockroaches. He claimed to have developed a “miracle cure” derived from hormones extracted from super-roaches immune to toxins, asserting it could treat conditions such as acne, anemia, and radiation exposure. Accompanied by friends, colleagues, and students from the School of Visual Arts, Skaggs offered the cure “freely to the world.” Despite overt references to Kafka’s story, the clues went unnoticed and the claim was widely reported, including by UPI. Skaggs, in character as Dr. Gregor, appeared on WNBC-TV’s Live at Five, where he was interviewed about the discovery. Media outlets, including People and The Wall Street Journal, later exposed the hoax, though WNBC-TV did not issue a retraction.

==== Fish Condos ====
In 1983, Joey Skaggs created “Fish Condos,” a series of aquatic sculptures designed to resemble bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, and kitchens, intended for upwardly mobile guppies. While some speculated whether the pieces were part of a hoax, the fish tanks were functional and real. The sculptures satirized gentrification in New York City and commented on environmental degradation. “Fish Condos” received significant media coverage, appearing in New York Magazine, Life, and the Neiman Marcus Christmas Catalog, among other outlets. They were also featured on television and exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide.

==== Bad Guys Talent Management Agency ====
In 1984, Joey Skaggs created the fictitious “Bad Guys Talent Management Agency” to help his friend Verne Williams fulfill his dream of becoming an actor. The agency claimed to represent “bad guys, bad girls, bad kids, and bad dogs.” Skaggs designed a mock FBI wanted poster as a headshot for Williams and sent it to casting agents in New York City, leading to Williams securing a role in Berry Gordy’s feature film &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; and launching his acting career. The story gained media attention, including coverage in &quot;People Magazine&quot; and other outlets, which led to an influx of aspiring “bad” actors seeking representation. 

==== The Fat Squad ====
In 1986, Joey Skaggs, under the alias Joe Bones, created the “Fat Squad,” a fictitious organization offering to enforce clients’ diets for $300 a day with a three-day minimum. The &quot;Fat Squad Commandos&quot; claimed to monitor clients and prevent them from cheating on their diets, operating under the motto, “You can hire us, but you cannot fire us. Our commandos take no bribes.” The hoax attracted significant media attention, including a segment on ABC’s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, where a staged scene featured a client and commandos guarding a refrigerator.

==== April Fool’s Day Parade ====
In 1986, Joey Skaggs announced the creation of the “Annual New York City April Fools’ Day Parade,” a satirical event publicized each year through a press release. The parade is described as featuring satirical floats and performers parodying political figures and social issues. According to the press release, the route begins at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street and ends at Washington Square Park, where the “King of Fools” is crowned.

==== Comacocoon and Hair Today, Ltd. ====
In 1990, Joey Skaggs orchestrated two simultaneous hoaxes, “Comacocoon” and “Hair Today, Ltd.” “Comacocoon” was presented as a company offering a vacation alternative involving anesthesiology and subliminal programming, claiming to provide benefits such as relaxation, weight loss, and elective surgery. “Hair Today, Ltd.” purported to offer total scalp transplants using donor cadavers. Promotional materials for both fictitious companies were designed to resemble genuine advertisements and were sent exclusively to journalists. The exaggerated claims were intended to attract media attention. After both campaigns generated coverage and Comacocoon received a subpoena from the Department of Consumer Affairs with 17 charges related to the company’s claims, Skaggs revealed them as hoaxes, further highlighting the media&#x27;s susceptibility to sensational stories.

==== Portofess hoax ====
In July 1992, Joey Skaggs, using the alias Father Anthony Joseph, an Anglican priest from California, pedaled “Portofess,” a portable confessional booth mounted on a tricycle to the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The manifesto he handed out declared “Religion on the move for people on the go” and said, “The church must go where the sinners are.”

==== SEXONIX ====
In the fall of 1993, Joey Skaggs, using the alias Dr. Joseph Skaggs, announced the launch of &quot;SEXONIX,&quot; a purported virtual reality company claiming to turn sexual fantasies into immersive virtual experiences. Skaggs announced the company would debut at the Metro Toronto Christmas Gift and Invention Show but, just before it did, he alleged that Canadian customs had seized the equipment at the border, labeling it morally offensive. Taking the hoax into cyberspace, Skaggs posted messages on electronic bulletin boards in New York and San Francisco (early precursors to social media platforms), asking for public assistance in retrieving the equipment. The hoax attracted media attention in both Canada and the U.S. and has been described as one of the earliest documented internet hoaxes, illustrating the potential for disinformation in the emerging digital age.

==== Maqdananda Psychic Attorney ====
Joey Skaggs created a 30 second television commercial featuring Maqdananda, a new-age psychic attorney who claimed he could predict outcomes for his clients. Offering services like psychic surgery malpractice and renegotiating past-life contracts, the ad aired on CNN Headline News across the Hawaiian Islands. Callers to 1-808-UCA-DADA were met with the message, “I knew you’d call.”

==== Dog Meat Soup ====
In 1994, Joey Skaggs, posing as Kim Yung Soo, the head of a fictional Korean company called Kea So Joo, Inc. (purportedly translating to “dog meat soup with alcohol” in Korean), launched a hoax titled “Dog Meat Soup.” Skaggs claimed the company was offering to buy unwanted dogs from shelters for $0.10 per pound for human consumption. Despite never directly responding to any inquiries, reports emerged alleging conversations with company representatives, along with unverified claims that large dogs were disappearing from the streets and that legal charges were being pursued against the company. Skaggs later revealed the hoax, which he orchestrated with assistance from Korean collaborators. The performance aimed to critique the media’s willingness to report on news without verification and highlighted widespread cultural bias.

==== The Solomon Project ====
In 1995, Joey Skaggs, under the alias Dr. Joseph Bonuso, Ph.D., announced the creation of the “Solomon Project,” a fictitious artificial intelligence program he claimed could deliver swift, unbiased legal verdicts and revolutionize the American judicial system. Following O.J. Simpson’s acquittal in the trial for Nicole Simpson’s murder, Skaggs, as Dr. Bonuso, declared that the Solomon Project had found Simpson guilty. CNN contacted the Solomon Project and aired a segment examining the implications of using AI in legal decision-making. After discovering the project was a hoax, CNN issued a follow-up report acknowledging they had been misled.

==== STOP BioPEEP ====
Between 1996 and 1998, Joey Skaggs, using the alias Dr. Joseph Howard, created a media hoax titled “Stop BioPEEP.” In this performance, Skaggs portrayed a whistleblower alleging that a fictional multinational corporation was developing a virus capable of genetically addicting consumers to specific products, transforming them into “consumer junkies.” He further claimed this virus could be used for targeted genetic manipulation, which he termed “gene-ocide,” suggesting it could eliminate specific groups. The hoax incorporated an international group of collaborators, a fake website, and staged protests in the U.S. and Australia, including one at the United Nations. The hoax attracted media attention and, at times, was conflated with reports of an emerging bird flu outbreak in China. Skaggs later explained that the performance was designed to provoke discussion about the ethical and societal implications of genetic engineering.

==== Doody Rudy ====
In 1999, Joey Skaggs organized the “Doody Rudy” protest in New York’s Washington Square Park in response to then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s policies, which included efforts to limit creative expression and the “quality of life” campaign targeting homelessness. Skaggs collaborated with artist Steve Powers (ESPO) to create a 10’ x 14’ painting depicting Giuliani as the Madonna. Protesters, wearing “Doody Rudy” hats, wheeled a trashcan filled with faux elephant dung and held signs such as “Doody Rudy with Dumbo’s Dung” and “Help Support the Homeless—$1.00 Contribution Per Throw Will be Donated to Housing Works, Inc.” Participants threw the faux dung at the portrait, referencing Giuliani’s criticism of Chris Ofili’s &quot;Holy Virgin Mary&quot; painting, which incorporated elephant dung and had been displayed at the Brooklyn Museum. Giuliani had publicly opposed the exhibition and threatened to withdraw city funding from the museum. The funds raised during the protest were donated to Housing Works, a non-profit organization supporting homeless individuals living with AIDS.

=== 2000 to present ===

==== The Final Curtain ====
In 2000, Joey Skaggs launched “Final Curtain,” a performance art hoax critiquing the commercialization of the death-care industry. Advertisements in alternative newspapers with the tagline “Death got you down? At last an alternative” directed readers to a website for the fictitious “Final Curtain” memorial theme park and mall. The site featured detailed architectural drawings, a business plan, artist-designed memorials, and descriptions of attractions such as “Dante’s Grill,” themed gift shops and restrooms each equipped with a perpetually flowing drinking fountain of nondenominational holy water. The website also listed fictional company executives, with Skaggs personally assuming all roles in media responses. The hoax garnered widespread media coverage, both before and after Skaggs revealed it as a satirical commentary on the commodification of death. 

==== Bush! ====
On July 4, 2004, Joey Skaggs staged a satirical performance in New York City’s Washington Square Park, critiquing President George W. Bush’s leadership. Skaggs, dressed as Uncle Sam, pedaled a tricycle carrying a large replica of the White House and led a parade of approximately 75 participants, including singers, cheerleaders, and actors portraying government officials. At the park’s center, Skaggs delivered a speech and opened the replica White House to reveal an effigy of President Bush seated on an upside-down bucket of fertilizer. The effigy was surrounded by symbolic props, including toilet paper designed to resemble hundred-dollar bills, toy weapons, and a pen attached to a replica of the Constitution, for its potential rewriting. Actors portraying members of the President’s Cabinet and Saudi Royals distributed mock $20 bills, representing the purchase of votes, as part of the performance. The event continued Skaggs’ tradition of using public art and mobile sculptures to address political and social issues through satire and humor.

==== Mobile Homeless Homes ====
In 2012, Joey Skaggs staged a protest at the Goldman Sachs headquarters in New York City, critiquing the role of major financial institutions in the 2008 economic and housing crisis. As part of the protest, Skaggs, portraying &quot;Recycle Man,&quot; towed a sculpture titled &quot;Mobile Homeless Homes&quot; with a tricycle. The sculpture, resembling three connected garbage receptacles, was designed to appear like overflowing trash cans but was hollow and habitable. The performance was accompanied by participants dressed as homeless Muppet-inspired characters and a band playing a satirical song titled &quot;Mobile Homeless Blues&quot;. The protest referenced reports of Goldman Sachs employees allegedly using &quot;Muppets&quot; as a derogatory term for clients affected during the financial downturn.

==== Santa&#x27;s Missile Tow ====
In 2012, Joey Skaggs staged another performance art piece titled &quot;Santa’s Missile Tow&quot; outside the United Nations headquarters in New York City. Dressed as Santa Claus, Skaggs pedaled a mobile rocket launcher featuring a 10-foot mock nuclear missile mounted on a slingshot. Accompanied by six performers dressed as elves, he delivered a message to world leaders with the slogan, “Peace on Earth—Or Else.” The performance included a parody of “Jingle Bells,” with revised lyrics critiquing nuclear proliferation and advocating for peace.

==== Bigfoot and The Tiny Top Circus ====
In 2014, Joey Skaggs, under the alias Peppe Scaggolini, staged a performance art piece titled &quot;The Tiny Top Circus&quot; in Washington Square Park, New York City. Promoted as “the world’s only pataphysical circus,” the event featured a purported Bigfoot, displayed in a cage draped with a circus tent and mounted on the back of a tricycle. The tricycle was pedaled into the park by a performer billed as “the world’s strongest man.” The event included theatrical elements such as armed guards, a carnival barker, sword swallowers, jugglers, and live music by the Coney Island Sideshow Band. Audience members were escorted to view Bigfoot, which was ultimately revealed to be Skaggs dressed as a large, hairy foot.

==== Political protests ====
Following the election of Donald Trump as President in 2016, Joey Skaggs incorporated a series of performances titled &quot;Trumpathons&quot; into his Annual New York City April Fools’ Day Parade. The 32nd Annual Parade in 2017 featured a sculpture called “Trump’s Golden Throne,” depicting a life-sized effigy of Trump tweeting while seated in a golden outhouse. Parade participants, many wearing Trump masks, attempted to set a Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of Trump look-alikes.

In 2018, for the 33rd Annual Parade, Skaggs staged “Trump&#x27;s Military Parade,&quot; inspired by Trump’s expressed interest in a military display. The performance featured an effigy of Trump riding a tricycle-mounted rocket launcher, accompanied by look-alikes of world leaders, including Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, alongside participants in Trump masks portraying soldiers.

The 34th Annual Parade in 2019 included an oversized effigy of Trump with a Pinocchio-like nose, wearing a witch’s hat and cape, and accompanied by a mobile Kool-Aid stand. Participants held signs and wore Trump masks, critiquing the volume of false statements attributed to the President during his administration.

Since 2021, Skaggs’ website has offered satirical materials, including a customizable Trump Presidential Pardon and, since 2022, a downloadable Top Secret Cover Sheet for Classified Information. During the 37th Annual Parade in 2022, Skaggs distributed Putin Protest Masks as a statement against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In 2024, for the 39th Annual Parade, a billboard truck displayed images of Skaggs as the Grim Reaper alongside his sculpture “Democracy at the Guillotine,” encouraging voter participation. As of December 2024, the website also offered a customizable Biden Presidential Pardon.

<text>The Ranters were one of a number of dissenting groups that emerged about the time of the Commonwealth of England (1649–1660). They were largely common people, and the movement was widespread throughout England, though they were not organised and had no leader.

==History==
The chaos of the Second English Civil War, the execution of King Charles I, and the animosity between the Presbyterians and Independents during the era of the Commonwealth gave rise to many sectarian groups that attempted to make sense of their society and place within that society. The Ranters were one such group. They were regarded as heretical by the established Church and seem to have been regarded by the government as a threat to social order. The quote &quot;...the bishops, Charles and the Lords have had their turn, overturn, so your turn shall be next...&quot;, published in a Ranter pamphlet, no doubt caused some concern in the halls of power. The Ranters denied the authority of churches, of Scripture, of the current ministry and of services, instead calling on men to listen to the divine within them. In many ways they resemble the 14th century Brethren of the Free Spirit. In fact, they were causing such controversy, that by the early 1650s multiple anti-Ranter pamphlets were circulating throughout Britain.

The origin for the term &quot;Ranter&quot; seems to come from an anonymous pamphlet titled &quot;A Justification of the Mad Crew&quot;, where the word rant was used in reference to the enemies of those espousing this particular view, equating ranting with hypocrisy. The anonymous author calls those who would eventually be deemed Ranters &quot;the Mad Crew&quot; instead. There is also a confluence between the term &quot;Ranter&quot; with the verb rent, as in to be rent away from God. Most written evidence points to the use of &quot;Ranter&quot; as an insult by the enemies of the sect and not a self-designated moniker. By the 1660s, the term became attached to any group that promoted theological deviance but since most of the literary evidence we have was created by those opposed to Ranters in general, it is difficult to determine their exact creed.

There are few primary sources actually written by Ranters, but those that do exist give us a clearer picture of what they believed. The most famous English member, Laurence Clarkson or Claxton, joined the Ranters after encountering them in 1649. Although he does not mention them directly, his 1650 tract called &quot;A Single Eye&quot; is widely believed to have been inspired by this dissenting group and directly reflects their views. Other less well known members of the Ranter cohort included Abiezer Coppe and Joseph Salmon.

Their central idea was pantheistic, that God is essentially in every creature, including themselves.

They embraced antinomianism and believed that Christians are freed by grace from the necessity of obeying Mosaic Law, rejecting the very notion of obedience. They held that believers are free from all traditional restraints and that sin is a product only of the imagination. The Ranters revived the Brethren of the Free Spirit&#x27;s amoralism and &quot;stressed the desire to surpass the human condition and become godlike&quot;.

They denied the authority of the church, of accepted religious practice and of Scripture. In fact, they denied the power of any authority in general.

Gerrard Winstanley, a leader of another English dissenting group called the Diggers, commented on Ranter principles in characterizing them by their &quot;general lack of moral values or restraint in worldly pleasures&quot;. However, another prominent Digger, William Everard, was, some time after the failure of the Digger communes, imprisoned as a Ranter, and later confined to Bethlem Hospital. John Bunyan, author of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners&quot;, that he had encountered Ranters prior to his Baptist conversion.

In England, they came into contact and even rivalry with the early Quakers, who were often falsely accused of direct association with them. In the American colonies, there is evidence that Ranters were actually breakaway Quakers who did not agree with the standardization of belief that occurred in the late 1670s. Although the Quakers retained their loose, sect-like character until the 1660s, they began to formalize their worship practices and set of beliefs in order to gain some stability in the New World; this in turn pushed out those who did not fall in line, creating a group of people referred to as Ranters. (Whether these people were directly inspired by the Ranters in England or if the moniker was simply imported via anti-Ranter pamphlets that were so popular during this era is debatable.)

The historian J. C. Davis has suggested that the Ranters were a myth created by conservatives in order to endorse traditional values by comparison with an unimaginably radical other. Richard L. Greaves, in a review of Davis&#x27; book, suggests that though a very radical fringe existed, it was probably never as organized as conservatives of the time suggested.

In the mid-19th century, the name was often applied to the Primitive Methodists, with reference to their crude and often noisy preaching.

<doc id="212959" wikidata="Q6144274" url="?curid=212959" title="Jim Morris">
<text>James Samuel Morris Jr. (born January 19, 1964) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for two seasons with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Although brief, Morris&#x27; career is noted for making his MLB debut at the age of 35 and after undergoing several arm surgeries. His story was dramatized in the 2002 film &quot;The Rookie&quot;.
==Early life==
Morris was born in Brownwood, Texas, but spent most of his childhood moving to different cities, as his father was in the United States Navy. Throughout his childhood, Morris lived in New Haven, Connecticut, Great Lakes, Illinois, and Jacksonville, Florida. He began playing baseball at the age of three. His father, Jim Sr., became a recruiter for the Navy. His father and mother, Olline Hale, settled in Brownwood, Texas. He attended Brownwood High School, but as Brownwood did not yet have a baseball program, he played football for the Lions from 1979–82 and won the state championship as a wingback, punter and kicker with Gordon Wood as a head coach.

==College career==
Morris attended Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas, Paris Junior College in Paris, Texas, and Ranger College in Ranger, Texas.

Angelo State did not sponsor a collegiate baseball team during Morris&#x27;s time there, so he instead competed for the Ram football team as a punter for the 1991 and 1992 seasons. In his second and final year on the team, the 28-year-old left-footer (who was listed as a sophomore) led all of NCAA Division II with an average of 44.5 yards per punt. The performance earned him a spot on the AFCA/Kodak All-America team.

Morris graduated the following summer with a degree in kinesiology and psychology and hung up his football cleats as he entered graduate school and took a full-time job as the director of the ASU Men&#x27;s High Rise dormitory.

His career punting average for the Rams was 42.8 yards, just short of the standing ASU record of 43.2 yards by Bill Dement (1968–1971).

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Morris was originally selected 466th overall in the January 1982 amateur baseball draft by the New York Yankees but did not sign. He was selected out of Ranger College fourth overall in the 1983 amateur draft (January Secondary) by the Milwaukee Brewers and signed with the organization. Morris suffered several arm injuries in the minor leagues, missing all of the 1986 season. After four pitching appearances in 1987, he was released, never having progressed past the single-A minor leagues.

After sitting out all of 1988, Morris signed with the Chicago White Sox organization for 1989. Arm injuries and ineffectiveness limited him to pitching in just two games and he was again unable to rise past the single-A leagues before being released.

Unable to make anything of his career, Morris retired and moved to Big Lake, Texas with his wife Lorri, his nine-year-old son, and his five- and one-year-old daughters, where he became a physical science teacher and baseball coach at Reagan County High School. At this point, Morris had retired with a minor league record of 17–22, and a 5.13 earned run average (ERA) in 270 innings pitched.

Morris remained a teacher for Reagan County High School for the next decade. While coaching baseball for the Reagan County Owls in the spring of 1999, Morris made a promise to his team that he would try out for an MLB if his team won the District Championship, something the team had never accomplished before. His team won the title and Morris kept his end of the bargain by attending a Tampa Bay Devil Rays tryout. The scout was not interested in Morris, but gave him a tryout solely to let Morris keep his promise to his players. Surprisingly, Morris discovered that in spite of his age, and having several surgeries on his arm, he was able to throw 12 consecutive 98-mph fastballs. After much debate with his family, Morris signed a professional contract with the Devil Rays organization at the age of 35. He started out with the AA Orlando Rays and moved up quickly to a spot with the AAA Durham Bulls.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays (1999–2000)===
Thanks to solid pitching performances with Durham, Tampa Bay gave him a chance to pitch with the Rays when rosters expanded in September. On September 18, 1999, against Royce Clayton of the Texas Rangers, the 35-year-old Morris made his debut, striking Clayton out on four pitches. He made four more appearances later that year.

Morris made 16 major league appearances in 2000, during which his arm problems recurred. His final appearance came on May 9, 2000, at Yankee Stadium (home of the very team that had first drafted him 17 years earlier). He entered a tie game in the bottom of the 10th inning with the bases loaded, and issued a game-ending RBI walk to his first batter, Paul O&#x27;Neill, after which the Rays shut him down for the season (the club ultimately released Morris in November). He was not the losing pitcher in the game as the runner who scored on the walk had been put on base by the previous pitcher Rick White, who was tagged with the loss. Morris never recorded any wins or losses in any of his major league appearances.

Morris was signed in December 2000 to a minor-league contract by the Los Angeles Dodgers, but was released during spring training. At the end of his major league career he was 0–0 with an ERA of 4.80 and 13 strikeouts.

Morris has released an autobiography, &quot;The Oldest Rookie&quot;. He often appears as a motivational speaker. Morris released his second book, &quot;Dream Makers,&quot; in 2020. It deals with his life in the twenty years since his retirement from Major League Baseball.

A feature film made by Disney called &quot;The Rookie&quot; was released in 2002 about Morris&#x27;s climb to playing in MLB. He is portrayed in the film by Dennis Quaid. Morris cameos in the movie as &quot;Orlando Umpire #2&quot;.

==Personal life==
Morris was married to Lorri Morris from 1987 until their divorce in 2002, and they have three children, Hunter, Jessica, and Jaimee. He married Shawna Morris in 2002, and they have one daughter, Chelsey. Morris is also an accomplished motivational speaker, as he has traveled the world telling people about how he was able to fulfill his dream and that they will be able to fulfill their own.

<text>The Seekers, or Legatine-Arians as they were sometimes known, were an English dissenting group that emerged around the 1620s, probably inspired by the preaching of three brothers – Walter, Thomas, and Bartholomew Legate. Seekers considered all organised churches of their day corrupt and preferred to wait for God&#x27;s revelation. Many of them subsequently joined the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).

==Origins==
Long before the English Civil War there already existed what the English Marxist historian, Christopher Hill, calls a &quot;lower-class heretical culture&quot; in England. The cornerstones of this culture were anti-clericalism and a strong emphasis on Biblical study, but specific doctrines had &quot;an uncanny persistence&quot;: millenarianism, mortalism, anti-Trinitarianism and a rejection of predestination. Such ideas became &quot;commonplace to seventeenth-century Baptists, Seekers, early Quakers and other radical groupings which took part in the free-for-all discussions of the English Revolution.&quot;

==Beliefs and practices==
The Seekers were not an organised religious group in any way that would be recognised today (not a religious cult or denomination), but informal and localised. Membership in a local Seekers assembly did not preclude membership in another sect. Indeed, Seekers shunned creeds (see nondenominational Christianity) and each assembly tended to embrace a broad spectrum of ideas.

Seekers after the Legates were Puritan but not Calvinist. Some contemporary historians, though accepting their zeal in desiring a &quot;godly society&quot;, doubt whether the English Puritans during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey’s recent work has emphasised the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for so-called heresy, blasphemy, Catholicism, non-Christian religions, and even atheism. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the General Baptists. Their collective witness demanded the church to be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of magisterial Protestantism held by the Calvinist majority. Nevertheless, in common with other Dissenters, the Seekers believed that the Roman Church corrupted itself and, through its common heritage, the Church of England as well. Only Christ himself could establish the &quot;true&quot; Church.

However, there were a number of beliefs and practices that made the Seekers distinctive from the large number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around the time of the Commonwealth of England. Most significant was their form of collective worship; the Seekers held meetings free of all Church ritual and in silence, mindful of direct inspiration and guidance.

Seekers anticipated aspects of Quakerism and a significant number of them became Quakers and many remaining Seekers attended the funeral of George Fox. A contemporary and unsympathetic author, Richard Baxter, claimed that they had merged with the &quot;Vanists&quot; or followers of Henry Vane the Younger.

Often when &quot;heretics&quot; were faced with being burnt at the stake they retracted, retaining their beliefs in a less public way. The Legates were exceptional. Thomas died in Newgate Prison after being arrested for his preaching and Bartholomew was burnt for heresy in 1612.

<doc id="212980" wikidata="Q845118" url="?curid=212980" title="Order of operations">
<text>In mathematics and computer programming, the order of operations is a collection of rules that reflect conventions about which operations to perform first in order to evaluate a given mathematical expression.

These rules are formalized with a ranking of the operations. The rank of an operation is called its precedence, and an operation with a &quot;higher&quot; precedence is performed before operations with &quot;lower&quot; precedence. Calculators generally perform operations with the same precedence from left to right, but some programming languages and calculators adopt different conventions.

For example, multiplication is granted a higher precedence than addition, and it has been this way since the introduction of modern algebraic notation. Thus, in the expression , the multiplication is performed before addition, and the expression has the value , and not . When exponents were introduced in the 16th and 17th centuries, they were given precedence over both addition and multiplication and placed as a superscript to the right of their base. Thus and .

These conventions exist to avoid notational ambiguity while allowing notation to remain brief. Where it is desired to override the precedence conventions, or even simply to emphasize them, parentheses ( ) can be used. For example, forces addition to precede multiplication, while forces addition to precede exponentiation. If multiple pairs of parentheses are required in a mathematical expression (such as in the case of nested parentheses), the parentheses may be replaced by other types of brackets to avoid confusion, as in .

These rules are meaningful only when the usual notation (called infix notation) is used. When functional or Polish notation are used for all operations, the order of operations results from the notation itself.

== Conventional order ==
The order of operations, that is, the order in which the operations in an expression are usually performed, results from a convention adopted throughout mathematics, science, technology and many computer programming languages. It is summarized as:
# Parentheses
# Exponentiation 
# Multiplication and division
# Addition and subtraction
This means that to evaluate an expression, one first evaluates any sub-expression inside parentheses, working inside to outside if there is more than one set. Whether inside parenthesis or not, the operation that is higher in the above list should be applied first. Operations of the same precedence are conventionally evaluated from left to right.

If each division is replaced with multiplication by the reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) then the associative and commutative laws of multiplication allow the factors in each term to be multiplied together in any order. Sometimes multiplication and division are given equal precedence, or sometimes multiplication is given higher precedence than division; see below. If each subtraction is replaced with addition of the opposite (additive inverse), then the associative and commutative laws of addition allow terms to be added in any order.

The radical symbol is traditionally extended by a bar (called vinculum) over the radicand (this avoids the need for parentheses around the radicand). Other functions use parentheses around the input to avoid ambiguity. The parentheses can be omitted if the input is a single numerical variable or constant, as in the case of and . Traditionally this convention extends to monomials; thus, and even , but , because is not a monomial. However, this convention is not universally understood, and some authors prefer explicit parentheses. Some calculators and programming languages require parentheses around function inputs, some do not.

Symbols of grouping can be used to override the usual order of operations. Grouped symbols can be treated as a single expression. Symbols of grouping can be removed using the associative and distributive laws, also they can be removed if the expression inside the symbol of grouping is sufficiently simplified so no ambiguity results from their removal.

===Examples===

Multiplication before addition:
: formula_1

Parenthetical subexpressions are evaluated first:
: formula_2

Exponentiation before multiplication, multiplication before subtraction:
: formula_3

When an expression is written as a superscript, the superscript is considered to be grouped by its position above its base:
: formula_4

The operand of a root symbol is determined by the overbar:
: formula_5

A horizontal fractional line also acts as a symbol of grouping:
: formula_6

Parentheses can be nested, and should be evaluated from the inside outward. For legibility, outer parentheses can be made larger than inner parentheses. Alternately, other grouping symbols, such as curly braces } or square brackets , are sometimes used along with parentheses . For example: 
: formula_7

==Special cases==
===Unary minus sign===
There are differing conventions concerning the unary operation  (usually pronounced &quot;minus&quot;). In written or printed mathematics, the expression −32 is interpreted to mean .

In some applications and programming languages, notably Microsoft Excel, PlanMaker (and other spreadsheet applications) and the programming language bc, unary operations have a higher priority than binary operations, that is, the unary minus has higher precedence than exponentiation, so in those languages −32 will be interpreted as . This does not apply to the binary minus for example in Microsoft Excel while the formulas codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 return 4, the formulas codice_4 and codice_5 return −4.

===Mixed division and multiplication===

There is no universal convention for interpreting an expression containing both division denoted by &#x27;÷&#x27; and multiplication denoted by &#x27;×&#x27;. Proposed conventions include assigning the operations equal precedence and evaluating them from left to right, or equivalently treating division as multiplication by the reciprocal and then evaluating in any order; evaluating all multiplications first followed by divisions from left to right; or eschewing such expressions and instead always disambiguating them by explicit parentheses.

Beyond primary education, the symbol &#x27;÷&#x27; for division is seldom used, but is replaced by the use of algebraic fractions, typically written vertically with the numerator stacked above the denominator – which makes grouping explicit and unambiguous – but sometimes written inline using the slash or solidus symbol &#x27;/&#x27;.

 Multiplication denoted by juxtaposition (also known as implied multiplication) creates a visual unit and has higher precedence than most other operations. In academic literature, when inline fractions are combined with implied multiplication without explicit parentheses, the multiplication is conventionally interpreted as having higher precedence than division, so that e.g. is interpreted to mean rather than . For instance, the manuscript submission instructions for the &quot;Physical Review&quot; journals directly state that multiplication has precedence over division, and this is also the convention observed in physics textbooks such as the &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; by Landau and Lifshitz and mathematics textbooks such as &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik. However, some authors recommend against expressions such as , preferring the explicit use of parenthesis .

More complicated cases are more ambiguous. For instance, the notation could plausibly mean either
 or . Sometimes interpretation depends on context. The &quot;Physical Review&quot; submission instructions recommend against expressions of the form ; more explicit expressions or are unambiguous.
This ambiguity has been the subject of Internet memes such as &quot;&quot;, for which there are two conflicting interpretations: 8 ÷ [2 · (2 + 2)] = 1 and (8 ÷ 2) · (2 + 2) = 16. Mathematics education researcher Hung-Hsi Wu points out that &quot;one never gets a computation of this type in real life&quot;, and calls such contrived examples &quot;a kind of Gotcha! parlor game designed to trap an unsuspecting person by phrasing it in terms of a set of unreasonably convoluted rules&quot;.

===Serial exponentiation===

If exponentiation is indicated by stacked symbols using superscript notation, the usual rule is to work from the top down:
which typically is not equal to (&quot;a&quot;&quot;b&quot;)&quot;c&quot;. This convention is useful because there is a property of exponentiation that (&quot;a&quot;&quot;b&quot;)&quot;c&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;bc&quot;, so it&#x27;s unnecessary to use serial exponentiation for this.

However, when exponentiation is represented by an explicit symbol such as a caret (^) or arrow (↑), there is no common standard. For example, Microsoft Excel and computation programming language MATLAB evaluate codice_6 as (&quot;a&quot;&quot;b&quot;)&quot;c&quot;, but Google Search and Wolfram Alpha as &quot;a&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;c&quot;). Thus codice_7 is evaluated to 4,096 in the first case and to 262,144 in the second case.

==Mnemonics==

Mnemonic acronyms are often taught in primary schools to help students remember the order of operations. The acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, is common in the United States and France. Sometimes the letters are expanded into words of a mnemonic sentence such as &quot;Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally&quot;. The United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries may use BODMAS (or sometimes BOMDAS), standing for Brackets, Of, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction, with &quot;of&quot; meaning fraction multiplication. Sometimes the O is instead expanded as Order, meaning exponent or root, or replaced by I for Indices in the alternative mnemonic BIDMAS. In Canada and New Zealand BEDMAS is common.

In Germany, the convention is simply taught as , &quot;dot operations before line operations&quot; referring to the graphical shapes of the taught operator signs , , and , .

These mnemonics may be misleading when written this way. For example, misinterpreting any of the above rules to mean &quot;addition first, subtraction afterward&quot; would incorrectly evaluate the expression formula_8 as formula_9, while the correct evaluation is formula_10. These values are different when formula_11.

Mnemonic acronyms have been criticized for not developing a conceptual understanding of the order of operations, and not addressing student questions about its purpose or flexibility. Students learning the order of operations via mnemonic acronyms routinely make mistakes, as do some pre-service teachers. Even when students correctly learn the acronym, a disproportionate focus on memorization of trivia crowds out substantive mathematical content. The acronym&#x27;s procedural application does not match experts&#x27; intuitive understanding of mathematical notation: mathematical notation indicates groupings in ways other than parentheses or brackets and a mathematical expression is a tree-like hierarchy rather than a linearly &quot;ordered&quot; structure; furthermore, there is no single order by which mathematical expressions must be simplified or evaluated and no universal canonical simplification for any particular expression, and experts fluently apply valid transformations and substitutions in whatever order is convenient, so learning a rigid procedure can lead students to a misleading and limiting understanding of mathematical notation.

==Calculators==

Different calculators follow different orders of operations. Many simple calculators without a stack implement chain input, working in button-press order without any priority given to different operations, give a different result from that given by more sophisticated calculators. For example, on a simple calculator, typing codice_8 yields 9, while a more sophisticated calculator will use a more standard priority, so typing codice_8 yields 7.

Calculators may associate exponents to the left or to the right. For example, the expression codice_6 is interpreted as &quot;a&quot;(&quot;b&quot;&quot;c&quot;) on the TI-92 and the TI-30XS MultiView in &quot;Mathprint mode&quot;, whereas it is interpreted as (&quot;a&quot;&quot;b&quot;)&quot;c&quot; on the TI-30XII and the TI-30XS MultiView in &quot;Classic mode&quot;.

An expression like codice_11 is interpreted as 1/(2&quot;x&quot;) by TI-82, as well as many modern Casio calculators (configurable on some like the fx-9750GIII), but as (1/2)&quot;x&quot; by TI-83 and every other TI calculator released since 1996, as well as by all Hewlett-Packard calculators with algebraic notation. While the first interpretation may be expected by some users due to the nature of implied multiplication, the latter is more in line with the rule that multiplication and division are of equal precedence.

When the user is unsure how a calculator will interpret an expression, parentheses can be used to remove the ambiguity.

Order of operations arose due to the adaptation of infix notation in standard mathematical notation, which can be notationally ambiguous without such conventions, as opposed to postfix notation or prefix notation, which do not need orders of operations. Hence, calculators utilizing reverse Polish notation (RPN) using a stack to enter expressions in the correct order of precedence do not need parentheses or any possibly model-specific order of execution.

==Programming languages==

Most programming languages use precedence levels that conform to the order commonly used in mathematics, though others, such as APL, Smalltalk, Occam and Mary, have no operator precedence rules (in APL, evaluation is strictly right to left; in Smalltalk, it is strictly left to right).

Furthermore, because many operators are not associative, the order within any single level is usually defined by grouping left to right so that codice_12 is interpreted as rather than ; such operators are referred to as &quot;left associative&quot;. Exceptions exist; for example, languages with operators corresponding to the cons operation on lists usually make them group right to left (&quot;right associative&quot;), e.g. in Haskell, codice_13.

Dennis Ritchie, creator of the C language, said of the precedence in C (shared by programming languages that borrow those rules from C, for example, C++, Perl and PHP) that it would have been preferable to move the bitwise operators above the comparison operators. Many programmers have become accustomed to this order, but more recent popular languages like Python and Ruby do have this order reversed. The relative precedence levels of operators found in many C-style languages are as follows:
Examples:
* codice_14 is interpreted as codice_15
* codice_16 is interpreted as codice_17
* codice_18 is interpreted as codice_19
* codice_20 is interpreted as codice_21
* codice_22 is interpreted as codice_23
* codice_24 is interpreted as codice_25
(In Python, Ruby, PARI/GP and other popular languages, codice_24 is interpreted as codice_27.)

Source-to-source compilers that compile to multiple languages need to explicitly deal with the issue of different order of operations across languages. Haxe for example standardizes the order and enforces it by inserting brackets where it is appropriate.

The accuracy of software developer knowledge about binary operator precedence has been found to closely follow their frequency of occurrence in source code.

==History==

The order of operations emerged progressively over centuries. The rule that multiplication has precedence over addition was incorporated into the development of algebraic notation in the 1600s, since the distributive property implies this as a natural hierarchy. As recently as the 1920s, the historian of mathematics Florian Cajori identifies disagreement about whether multiplication should have precedence over division, or whether they should be treated equally. The term &quot;order of operations&quot; and the &quot;PEMDAS/BEDMAS&quot; mnemonics were formalized only in the late 19th or early 20th century, as demand for standardized textbooks grew.
Ambiguity about issues such as whether implicit multiplication takes precedence over explicit multiplication and division in such expressions as &quot;a&quot;/2&quot;b&quot;, which could be interpreted as &quot;a&quot;/(2&quot;b&quot;) or (&quot;a&quot;/2) × &quot;b&quot;, imply that the conventions are not yet completely stable.

<doc id="212981" wikidata="Q647945" url="?curid=212981" title="Georgy Girl">
<text>Georgy Girl is a 1966 British romantic comedy film directed by Silvio Narizzano and starring Lynn Redgrave, Alan Bates, Charlotte Rampling, James Mason, and Rachel Kempson (Redgrave&#x27;s mother). The screenplay was written by Margaret Forster and Peter Nichols, based on the Forster&#x27;s 1965 novel of the same name. The film tells the story of a virginal young woman (Redgrave) in 1960s Swinging London, who is faced with a dilemma when she is pursued by her father&#x27;s older employer (Mason) and the young lover of her promiscuous, pregnant flatmate (Rampling)

The film premiered at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. It was released in the UK by Columbia Pictures on October 21, 1966. Grossing $16.8 million, &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; was a box-office success, and it also spawned a hit theme song. It was nominated for four Oscars at the 29th Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Redgrave and Best Supporting Actor for Mason. It was also nominated for four BAFTA Awards, including Best British Film. Redgrave also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

==Plot==
Georgina &quot;Georgy&quot; Parkin is a 22-year-old Londoner who has musical talent, is well-educated, and has an engaging, unpretentious character. She has an inventive imagination and loves children. At the same time, she believes herself to be plain and overweight, dresses haphazardly, and is incredibly naïve on the subjects of love and flirtation, having never had a boyfriend. Her parents are live-in employees of businessman James Leamington, who is in a loveless, childless marriage with the sickly Ellen.

Leamington watched Georgy grow up and treated her as if he were her second father, but as she has become a young woman, his feelings for her have become more than fatherly. On his 49th birthday, Leamington offers her a legal contract, proposing to supply her with the luxuries of life in return for becoming his mistress. Georgy sidesteps his proposal.

Her flatmate is the beautiful Meredith, who is a violinist in an orchestra. While she is out on dates with other men, Georgy entertains her boyfriend Jos Jones, on whom she has developed a crush.

When Meredith discovers that she is pregnant by Jos, they decide to get married, even though she tells him that she has previously aborted two of his children and only wants to marry because she is &quot;bored&quot;. After the wedding, Jos moves in with Meredith and Georgy, becomes disillusioned with Meredith, and finds himself attracted to Georgy. Meanwhile, although she uses Leamington&#x27;s interest in her to convince him to buy several expensive items for the baby, and Ellen dies suddenly, Georgy does not sign Leamington&#x27;s contract.

In the midst of an argument with Meredith over her cavalier attitude to her pregnancy, Jos kisses Georgy and tells her that he loves her. Georgy flees the apartment, and Jos follows her into the streets of London, shouting his love for her. The two return to the flat, where they have sex, after which Peggy, a neighbor, tells Jos that Meredith has gone into labour, and he and Georgy go to the hospital.

Although Georgy feels guilty, she continues her affair with Jos while Meredith is in the hospital. Meredith has no interest in her daughter, Sara, and has tired of Jos, so she announces that she plans to put the child up for adoption. When Georgy sees Sara, she is smitten.

Georgy and Jos bring Sara back to the flat. It quickly becomes clear that Georgy cares more for the baby than for Jos, and their relationship ends when Jos tires of a father&#x27;s responsibilities and abandons Georgy and his baby. Now that Georgy is the sole caregiver of a child to whom she has no blood ties, Social Services wishes to remove Sara from her care.

Leamington has been following the developments in Georgy&#x27;s life. When he mentions modifying his contract to accommodate the recent changes, Georgy, seeing an opportunity to keep Sara, gets him to propose marriage. As the newlyweds are chauffeured away from the church on their wedding day, Georgy ignores Leamington, devoting all of her attention to Sara.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Locations===
Several of the film&#x27;s scenes were filmed in north London, in Belsize Park and Little Venice, notably outside a canalside house on Maida Avenue.

===Title song===
The title song, written by Tom Springfield and Jim Dale, was recorded by Australian band The Seekers. A single release of the song (with different lyrics) topped the singles chart in Australia, and was a top 10 hit in both the UK (#3) and the U.S. (#2 for two weeks). It was the 56th biggest British hit of 1967, and the 57th biggest American hit of 1967. The song became a gold record, and it was nominated for the 1966 Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was successful at the box office. By 1967, it had earned an estimated $7 million in the United States and $6 million in other countries. By the end of 1967, it had earned $7,330,000 in North America in rentals accruing to the distributors.

===Critical reception===
Bosley Crowther wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;&quot;Georgy Girl&quot; is a striking example of what could only be achieved with a uniquely right performer in the crucial rule. ... The screenplay is generously spangled with truly wonderful throwaway lines, delicious plot surprises and lovely quirks of character.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Miss Redgrave has a pushover of a part, and never misses a trick to get that extra yock, whether it&#x27;s her first passionate encounter with Alan Bates or her fielding of Mason&#x27;s amorous overtures. She&#x27;s consistently on target, and hits the bullseye all along the line. Mason adeptly displays that wealth is an important factor in getting one&#x27;s girl. Bates makes a breezy lover and husband, though the scene in which he pursues his quarry through London, stripping on the way, is rather way out, Charlotte Rampling is fine as the attractive, bitchy flat mate, Bill Owen and Rachel Kempson add effective contributions as the parents. A lively score, brisk editing and excellent lensing, contribute to a well-made commercial picture.&quot;

British film critic Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Frantic black farce which seemed determined to shock, but has a few good scenes once you get attuned to the mood. A censorship milestone.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;Another swinging London story filled with people running through London late at night, dancing madly in the rain, and visiting deserted children&#x27;s playgrounds to ride on the roundabouts. In style a poor imitation of various &#x27;new wave&#x27; exercises, it has a slick line in repartee which amuses at first until its shallowness becomes apparent. The continual jokes about Georgy&#x27;s size, for example, tend to pall after numerous repetitions. Nor does the film have much continuity. It proceeds in triangular jerks from scene to scene, linked tenuously and loudly by continuous snatches of music to keep the action going. The potentially excellent cast and the promising comedienne talent of Lynn Redgrave can do little in the face of such opposition from both script and direction.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, writing: &quot;At the time a sexual showstopper, this can now be seen as an unconscious parody of Swinging Sixties chic. It is saved from mere shock novelty by Lynn Redgrave&#x27;s performance as the dowdy girl pursued by older employer James Mason, who finds her own identity looking after the illegitimate baby of flatmate Charlotte Rampling. Former TV director Silvio Narizzano piles on the tricks of cinematic trendiness, but it&#x27;s the acting that stabilises the story into something memorable from a boringly self-conscious era.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
== Adaptations in other media ==
The film was the basis for a 1970 Broadway musical titled &quot;Georgy.&quot;

In 1992, it was dramatised in 6 parts for BBC Radio 4 by Joe Dunlop.

In 2013, it was adapted for BBC Radio 4 by Rhiannon Tise.

<text>Artie Matthews (November 15, 1888 – October 25, 1958) was an American songwriter, pianist, and ragtime composer.

Artie Matthews was born in Braidwood, Illinois; his family moved to Springfield, Illinois in his youth. He learned to play piano, mostly popular songs and light classics, until he heard ragtime played by a pianist named Banty Morgan about 1905. Matthews was fascinated and immersed himself in ragtime and started playing and writing numbers in the style. In 1908 he moved to the ragtime center of St. Louis, Missouri, which would be one of his bases, frequently alternating with Chicago, Illinois. He worked as a pianist, arranger, and wrote music for local theater productions.

In early 1913 music publisher John Stark heard Matthews and offered him 50 dollars each for any original rags he submitted for publication. Matthews also worked as an arranger for Starks.

In 1916 Artie Matthews moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he first worked as a church organist. In 1921 Matthews and his wife Anna Howard founded the &quot;Cosmopolitan School of Music&quot;, a music school for African Americans, where Matthews taught until his death. Among Matthews students was Frank Foster, who would become the principal arranger for the Count Basie orchestra.

Some rank Artie Matthews with Scott Joplin, Joseph Lamb, and James Scott as one of the finest and most sophisticated ragtime composers. His most famous rags are the &quot;Pastime Rags&quot;, numbered 1 to 5, the latter of which was recorded in 1946 by Lu Watters and the Yerba Buena Jazz Band with Wally Rose on piano. His 1912 &quot; Baby Seals Blues&quot; was one of the first published Blues. His &quot;Weary Blues&quot; remains a standard in Dixieland and New Orleans jazz bands.

<text>Basehead, also known as dc Basehead and Basehead 2.0, is an American alternative hip hop and rock group formed by Michael Ivey in 1992. Ivey serves as the group&#x27;s songwriter and leader, performing vocals and various instruments. Basehead&#x27;s 1992 debut album, &quot;Play with Toys&quot;, was recorded at Ivey&#x27;s home with various studio musicians. Ivey formed a touring band for live performances, which contributed to Basehead&#x27;s second album, &quot;Not in Kansas Anymore&quot;. The group&#x27;s current lineup consists of Ivey, drummer Aaron Burroughs and bassist Brendan Ciotta.

Basehead has received praise for its distinctive sound and lyrics. The group&#x27;s music incorporates elements of various genres, including blues, funk, hip hop and rock. The lyrics of &quot;Play with Toys&quot; and &quot;Not in Kansas Anymore&quot; focus on subjects such as alcohol and cannabis use, depression, philosophy, politics and relationships. Beginning with the 1996 release of &quot;Faith&quot;, the group&#x27;s lyrics have focused primarily on Christian themes, which carried over to its albums &quot;In the Name of Jesus&quot;, &quot;dc Basehead&quot; and &quot;Rockalyptic Music&quot;.

== History ==

Basehead released its debut album, &quot;Play with Toys&quot;, in 1992 on the small independent label Emigre. Vocalist Michael Ivey recorded much of the album at his home on a four-track with various friends. The album received favorable reviews and frequent airplay on college radio. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Kevin Powell wrote that &quot;Without being preachy, Basehead&#x27;s unconventional style challenges listeners to get beyond their basic instincts and open their minds, search their souls.&quot; Assembling a five-member touring band, Ivey toured the United States and Europe, opening for the Beastie Boys, Stone Temple Pilots, and Ween. After College Music Journal featured Basehead on its cover, the group received attention from major labels, and signed with Imago Records, a former subsidiary of BMG the following year, releasing its second studio album, &quot;Not in Kansas Anymore&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Danyel Smith called the album &quot;an alternative to the benign bullshit music that floods the chain stores and commercial radio waves.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that &quot;Although it retains many of the same qualities of their critically acclaimed debut [...] there&#x27;s nothing that has the same sense of discovery that made &quot;Play with Toys&quot; an interesting record.&quot;

In April 1994, Basehead recorded its third studio album, &quot;Faith&quot;, which retained the musical elements of previous albums, but featured lyrics focusing on religious themes. During this period, Ivey also formed a side project, Bastard Youth of Basehead, also known as B.Y.O.B., and founded I3Records, an imprint of Rykodisc Records focusing on alternative music aimed at and produced by African American musicians. In December 1994, Imago separated from BMG, and &quot;Faith&quot; was not released until two years later. The album&#x27;s release problems resulted in the cancellation of a planned tour between Basehead and B.Y.O.B. Although some band members felt that they had not been given proper financial compensation for their work, Ivey stated that he took a smaller percentage of the songwriting credits than he was legally entitled to, and that the group&#x27;s underpaid work would have &quot;laid the groundwork&quot; for future success if &quot;Faith&quot; did not have release problems.

In 1998, Basehead released its fourth studio album, &quot;In the Name of Jesus&quot; on the label Union of Vineyard Workers. In 2002 the group changed its name to dc Basehead, releasing their self-titled fifth album on November 19. Hamlin wrote that &quot;the mastermind&#x27;s [...] effective use of subtly shifting patterns inside a repeating framework, and his talented co-conspirators lift &quot;DC&quot; into distinction.&quot; Reforming as Basehead 2.0, the group released its sixth studio album, &quot;Rockalyptic Music&quot; in 2007.

== Music and lyrics ==

Basehead&#x27;s musical style, which fuses elements of blues, funk, hip hop, pop, psychedelic, reggae, rock and rhythm and blues, is categorized as &quot;black rock&quot;, &quot;alternative funk&quot;, &quot;alternative dance&quot;, &quot;progressive rap&quot;, alternative hip hop and alternative rock. David Jeffries from Allmusic described &quot;Play with Toys&quot; as &quot;slacker rap&quot;. According to Michael Ivey, &quot;There are hip-hop elements in there, but if a hardcore hip-hop fan bought it, they might be disappointed&quot;. Ivey also stated that Basehead&#x27;s music &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the expected samples and sounds.&quot; The lyrical themes of &quot;Play with Toys&quot; and &quot;Not in Kansas Anymore&quot; focus on diverse subjects, including alcohol and marijuana use, depression, philosophy, politics, racism, and relationship breakups. Francis Davis wrote that Ivey&#x27;s lyrics &quot;[subvert] both rock and gangsta-rap conventions.&quot; Basehead&#x27;s albums and performances feature live instrumentation, which differentiates the group&#x27;s sound from that of mainstream hip hop artists who rely solely on sampled instrumentation. On the group&#x27;s albums, vocals and instruments are altered with studio techniques for effect. Ivey&#x27;s vocals mix singing and rapping. According to Ivey, Basehead&#x27;s former DJ, Citizen Cope, &quot;doesn&#x27;t play music. He makes sounds—[he&#x27;s] an instrument in his own self. He might scratch certain words for a special effect.&quot;

In 1994, the group&#x27;s lyrics shifted to Christian themes, starting with the album &quot;Faith&quot;. Andrew Hamlin describes the lyrics of &quot;Faith&quot; as having &quot;caught Ivey mid-capitulation. He wanted Jesus in his life but he also wanted his beer, his pot, his television, and his lust.&quot; During the release of &quot;Faith&quot;, Ivey stated that Basehead&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;In the Name of Jesus&quot;, would feature even more Christian-oriented lyrics than &quot;Faith&quot;. Regarding the lyrics of &quot;In the Name of Jesus&quot;, Hamlin writes that &quot;chanting praises leaves the Basehead mastermind without his characteristic wit, and he lacks the energetic exhortations that often lift gospel performers above sameness in material.&quot; Regarding &quot;dc Basehead&quot;, Hamlin wrote that the album&#x27;s lyrics were &quot;miles in some direction or other from any stereotyped Christian rock bin.&quot;

During a performance in which the group received a request for early material, Ivey stated &quot;I&#x27;m still trying to work it out—how to follow God and still give you the old shit&quot; and introduced the group&#x27;s Christian songs with self-deprecation, referring to the songs as &quot;the new, reborn, love-God Basehead stuff.&quot; In a 1998 interview, Ivey stated &quot;I&#x27;m kind of wary of the Church. I know there&#x27;s this whole Christian music market, but I don&#x27;t think, theology-wise, I&#x27;m in agreement with a whole lot of Christians. [...] In fact, I don&#x27;t know whether I like even being called a Christian.&quot;

== Pop culture ==
Two Basehead songs, &quot;Play with Toys&quot; and &quot;2000,&quot; were featured in the Union Wheels skateboarding video titled &quot;Right to Skate&quot;, during the Alphonzo Rawls segment.

<text>The western jackdaw (Coloeus monedula), also known as the Eurasian jackdaw, the European jackdaw, or simply the jackdaw, is a passerine bird in the crow family. Found across Europe, western Asia and western North Africa; it is mostly resident, although northern and eastern populations migrate south in the winter. Four subspecies are recognised, which differ mainly in the colouration of the plumage on the head and nape. Linnaeus first described it formally, giving it the name &quot;Corvus monedula&quot;. The common name derives from the word &quot;jack&quot;, denoting &quot;small&quot;, and daw, a less common synonym for &quot;jackdaw&quot;, and the native English name for the bird.

Measuring in length, the western jackdaw is a black-plumaged bird with a grey nape and distinctive pale-grey irises. It is gregarious and vocal, living in small groups with a complex social structure in farmland, open woodland, on coastal cliffs, and in urban settings. Like its relatives, jackdaws are intelligent birds, and have been observed using tools. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant material and invertebrates, as well as food waste from urban areas. Western jackdaws are monogamous and build simple nests of sticks in cavities in trees, cliffs, or buildings. About five pale blue or blue-green eggs with brown speckles are laid and incubated by the female. The young fledge in four to five weeks.

==Systematics==

===Etymology===
The western jackdaw was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th century work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Owing to its supposed fondness for picking up coins, Linnaeus gave it the binomial name &quot;Corvus monedula&quot;, choosing the specific name &quot;mǒnēdŭla&quot;, which is derived from &quot;moneta&quot;, the Latin stem of the word &quot;money&quot;. Jackdaws are sometimes placed in the genus &quot;Coloeus&quot;, from the Ancient Greek κολοιός (&quot;koloios&quot;) for jackdaw, though most subsequent works have retained the two jackdaw species in &quot;Corvus&quot;.

The original Old English words &quot;ċēo&quot; and &quot;ċeahhe&quot; (pronounced with initial &quot;ch&quot;) gave modern English &quot;chough&quot;; Chaucer sometimes used this word to refer to the western jackdaw, as did Shakespeare in &quot;Hamlet&quot; although there has been debate about which species he was referring to. This onomatopoeic name, based on the western jackdaw&#x27;s call, now refers to corvids of the genus &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;; the red-billed chough (&quot;Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax&quot;), formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as the &quot;Cornish chough&quot; and then just the &quot;chough&quot;, the name transferring from one species to the other.

The common name &quot;jackdaw&quot; first appeared in the 16th century, and is thought to be a compound of the forename &quot;Jack&quot;, used in animal names to signify a small form (e.g. jack snipe), and the archaic native English word &quot;daw&quot;. Formerly, western jackdaws were simply called &quot;daws&quot;. The metallic &quot;chyak&quot; call may be the origin of the &quot;jack&quot; part of the common name, but this is not supported by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. &quot;Daw&quot;, first used for the bird in the 15th century, is held by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; to be derived from the postulated Old English &quot;dawe&quot;, citing the cognates in Old High German &quot;tāha&quot;, Middle High German &quot;tāhe&quot; or &quot;tāchele&quot;, and modern German &quot;Dahle&quot; or &quot;Dohle&quot;, and dialectal &quot;Tach, Dähi, Däche&quot; and &quot;Dacha&quot;.

Names in English dialects are numerous. Scottish and north English dialects have included &quot;ka&quot; or &quot;kae&quot; since the 14th century. The Midlands form of this word was &quot;co&quot; or &quot;coo&quot;. &quot;Caddow&quot; is potentially a compound of &quot;ka&quot; and &quot;dow&quot;, a variant of &quot;daw&quot;. Other dialectal or obsolete names include &quot;caddesse&quot;, &quot;cawdaw&quot;, &quot;caddy&quot;, &quot;chauk&quot;, &quot;college-bird&quot;, &quot;jackerdaw&quot;, &quot;jacko&quot;, &quot;ka-wattie&quot;, &quot;chimney-sweep bird&quot; (from their nesting propensities), and &quot;sea-crow&quot; (from the frequency with which they are found on coasts). It was also frequently known quasi-nominally as &quot;Jack&quot;.

An archaic collective noun for a group of jackdaws is a &quot;clattering&quot;. Another name for a flock is a &quot;train&quot;.

===Taxonomy===
A study in 2000 found that the genetic distance between western jackdaws and the other members of &quot;Corvus&quot; was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name &quot;Coloeus&quot;, created by Johann Kaup in 1829, in her &quot;Birds of South Asia&quot; (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters. A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related Daurian jackdaw (&quot;C. dauuricus&quot;) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core &quot;Corvus&quot; clade. The names &quot;Coloeus monedula&quot; and &quot;Coloeus dauuricus&quot; have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list. The two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the Altai Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.

===Subspecies===
There are four recognized subspecies of the western jackdaw. All European subspecies intergrade where their populations meet. &quot;C. m. monedula&quot; intergrades into &quot;C. m. soemmerringii&quot; in a transition zone running from Finland south across the Baltic and eastern Poland to Romania and Croatia.

*The Nordic jackdaw (&quot;C. m. monedula&quot;) (Linnaeus, 1758), the nominate subspecies, is found in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and northwestern Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape and sides of the neck, a dark throat, and a light grey partial collar of variable extent.
*The Western Eurasian jackdaw (&quot;C. m. spermologus&quot;) (Vieillot, 1817) occurs in western, central and southern Europe and North Africa, from the British Isles, the Netherlands and the Rhineland in the north, through western Switzerland into Italy in the southeast, and the Iberian peninsula and Morocco in the south. It winters in the Canary Islands and Corsica. The name &quot;spermologus&quot; comes from the Greek σπερμολόγος, &quot;a picker of seeds&quot;. It is darker in colour than the other subspecies and lacks the whitish border at the base of the grey nape.
*The Eastern Eurasian jackdaw (&quot;C. m. soemmerringii&quot;) (Fischer von Waldheim, 1811) is found in northeastern Europe and northern and central Asia from the former Soviet Union to Lake Baikal and northwestern Mongolia and south to Turkey, Israel and the eastern Himalayas. Its southwestern limits are Serbia and southern Romania. It winters in Iran and northern India (Kashmir). Johann Fischer von Waldheim described this taxon as &quot;Corvus soemmerringii&quot; in 1811, noting its differences from populations in western Europe. Its subspecific name was given in honour of the German anatomist Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring. It is distinguished by the nape and the sides of the neck being paler, creating a contrasting black crown and lighter grey part collar.
*The Algerian jackdaw (&quot;C. m. cirtensis&quot;) (Rothschild and Hartert, 1912) is found in Morocco and Algeria in Northwest Africa. It was also formerly found in Tunisia. The name &quot;cirtensis&quot; refers to the ancient city of Cirta in Numidia. The plumage is duller and more uniformly dark grey than the other subspecies, with the paler nape less distinct.

== Description ==

The western jackdaw measures in length and weighs around . Most of the plumage is a shiny black, with a purple (in subspecies &quot;monedula&quot; and &quot;spermologus&quot;) or blue (in subspecies &quot;cirtensis&quot; and &quot;soemmerringii&quot;) sheen on the crown, forehead, and secondaries, and a green-blue sheen on the throat, primaries, and tail. The cheeks, nape and neck are light grey to greyish-silver, and the underparts are slate-grey. The legs are black, as is the short stout bill, the length of which is about 75% of the length of the rest of the head. There are rictal bristles covering around 40% of the maxilla and 25% of the lower mandible. The irises of adults are greyish or silvery white while those of juveniles are light blue, becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age. The sexes look alike, though the head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear, particularly just before moulting. Western jackdaws undergo a complete moult from June to September in the western parts of their range, and a month later in the east. The purplish sheen of the cap is most prominent just after moulting.

Immature birds have duller and less demarcated plumage. The head is a sooty black, sometimes with a faint greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.

There is very little geographic variation in size. The main differences are the presence or absence of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.

A skilled flyer, the western jackdaw can manoeuvre tightly as well as tumble and glide. It has characteristic jerky wing beats when flying, though these are not evident when birds are migrating. Wind tunnel experiments show that the preferred gliding speed is between per second and that the wingspan decreases as the bird flies faster. On the ground, western jackdaws have an upright posture and strut briskly, their short legs giving them a rapid gait. They feed with their heads held down or horizontally.

Within its range, the western jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are distinguishing features. From a distance, it can be confused with a rook (&quot;Corvus frugilegus&quot;), or when in flight, with a pigeon or chough. Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips. They also have shorter, thicker necks, much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks. They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs. The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology, behaviour, and calls to the Daurian jackdaw, with which its range overlaps in western Asia. Adults are readily distinguished, since the Daurian has a pied plumage, but immature birds are much more similar, both species having dark plumage and dark eyes. The Daurian tends to be darker, with a less contrasting nape than the Western.

===Vocalisations===

Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, frequently given in flight, is a metallic and squeaky &quot;chyak-chyak&quot; or &quot;kak-kak&quot;. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as &quot;kiaw&quot; or &quot;kyow&quot;. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as &quot;kyaay&quot;, &quot;tchaayk&quot; or &quot;giaaaa&quot;. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws also have a hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, &quot;arrrrr&quot; or &quot;kaaaarr&quot;, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft &quot;cheep&quot; at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.

==Distribution and habitat==
The western jackdaw is found from Northwest Africa through all of Europe, except for the subarctic north, and eastwards through central Asia to the eastern Himalayas and Lake Baikal. To the east, it occurs throughout Turkey, the Caucasus, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northwestern India. However, it is regionally extinct in Malta and Tunisia. The range is vast, with an estimated global extent between . It has a large global population, with an estimated 15.6 to 45 million individuals in Europe alone. Censuses of bird populations in marginal uplands in Great Britain show that western jackdaws greatly increased in numbers between the 1970s and 2010, although this increase may be related to recovery from previous periods when they were regarded as pests. The UK population was estimated at 2.5 million individuals in 1998, up from 780,000 in 1970.
Most populations are resident, but the northern and eastern populations are more migratory, relocating to wintering areas between September and November and returning between February and early May. Their range expands northwards into Russia to Siberia during summer and retracts in winter. They are vagrants to the Faroe Islands, particularly in the winter and spring, and occasionally to Iceland. Elsewhere, western jackdaws congregate over winter in the Ural Valley in northwestern Kazakhstan, the northern Caspian, and the Tian Shan region of western China. They are winter visitors to the Quetta Valley in western Pakistan, and are winter vagrants to Lebanon, where they were first recorded in 1962. In Syria, they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place. The subspecies &quot;soemmerringii&quot; occurs in south-central Siberia and extreme northwestern China and is accidental to Hokkaido, Japan. A small number of western jackdaws reached northeastern North America in the 1980s and have been found from Atlantic Canada to Pennsylvania. They have also occurred as vagrants in Gibraltar, Mauritania, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and one is reported to have been seen in Egypt.

Western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes, pastures, cultivated land, coastal cliffs, and towns. They thrive when forested areas are cleared and converted to fields and open areas. Habitats with a mix of large trees, buildings, and open ground are preferred; open fields are left to the rook, and more wooded areas to the Eurasian jay (&quot;Garrulus glandarius&quot;). Along with other corvids such as the rook, common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), and hooded crow (&quot;C. cornix&quot;), some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks; populations measured in three urban parks in Warsaw show increases from October to December, possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north. The same data from Warsaw, collected from 1977 to 2003, showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four-fold. The cause of the increase is unknown, but a reduction in the number of rooks may have benefited the species locally, or rooks overwintering in Belarus may have caused western jackdaws to relocate to Warsaw.

==Behaviour==
Generally wary of people in the forest or countryside, western jackdaws are much tamer in urban areas.

Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are generally seen in flocks of varying sizes, though males and females pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), Northern lapwing (&quot;Vanellus vanellus&quot;), and common gull (&quot;Larus canus&quot;) in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (&quot;Falco biarmicus&quot;), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (&quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.

In his book &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Ring&quot;, Konrad Lorenz described and analysed the complex social interactions in a western jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last to have access to food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.

===Social displays===
Social hierarchy in western jackdaw flocks is determined by supplanting, fighting, and threat displays—several of which have been described. In the &quot;bill-up posture&quot;, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A &quot;bill-down posture&quot; is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the &quot;forward-threat posture&quot;, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the &quot;defensive-threat posture&quot;, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. &quot;Supplanting&quot; is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.

Western jackdaws entreat their partners to preen them by showing their nape and ruffling their head feathers. Birds mainly preen each other&#x27;s head and neck. Known as &quot;allopreening&quot;, this behaviour is almost always done between birds of a mated pair.

===Breeding===


Western jackdaws become sexually mature in their second year. Genetic analysis of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra-pair copulation and there is little evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure. Some pairs do separate in the first few months, but almost all pairings of over six months&#x27; duration are lifelong, ending only when a partner dies. Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.

Western jackdaws usually breed in colonies with pairs collaborating to find a nest site, which they then defend from other pairs and predators during most of the year. They nest in cavities in trees or cliffs, in ruined or occupied buildings and in chimneys, the common feature being a sheltered site for the nest. The availability of suitable sites influences their presence in a locale. They may also use church steeples for nesting, a fact reported in verse by 18th century English poet William Cowper:
Nest platforms can attain a great size. A mated pair usually constructs a nest by improving a crevice by dropping sticks into it; it is then built on top of the platform formed. This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces, sometimes with birds still on them.

In his &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot;, Gilbert White notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the lintels of Stonehenge, and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting. The species has been recorded outcompeting the tawny owl (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;) for nest sites in the Netherlands. They can take over old nest sites of the black woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus martius&quot;) and stock dove (&quot;Columba oenas&quot;). Breeding colonies may also edge out those of the red-billed chough, but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as the carrion crow, rook or magpie.

Nests are lined with hair, wool, dead grass and many other materials. The eggs are a lighter colour than those of other corvids, being smooth, a glossy pale blue or blue-green with darker speckles ranging from dark brown to olive or grey-violet. Egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies; those of subspecies &quot;monedula&quot; average and in weight, those of subspecies &quot;soemmerringii&quot; in size and in weight, and those of subspecies &quot;spermologus&quot; in size and in weight. Clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs, although a Slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs. The eggs are incubated by the female for 17–18 days until hatching as naked altricial chicks, which are completely dependent on the adults for food. They fledge after 28–35 days, and the parents continue to feed them for another four weeks or so.

Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and incubation begins before clutch completion, which often leads to the death of the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure.

The great spotted cuckoo (&quot;Clamator glandarius&quot;) has been recorded as a brood parasite of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and least weasel (&quot;Mustela nivalis&quot;) in England, and brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) in Finland. The European pine marten (&quot;Martes martes&quot;) raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests are part of a colony.

===Feeding===

Foraging takes place mostly on the ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by dropping vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.

The western jackdaw tends to feed on small invertebrates up to in length that are found above ground, including various species of beetle (particularly cockchafers of the genus &quot;Melolontha&quot;, and weevil larvae and pupae.), &quot;Diptera&quot;, and &quot;Lepidoptera&quot; species, as well as snails and spiders. Also eaten are small rodents, bats, the eggs and chicks of birds, and carrion such as roadkill. Vegetable items consumed include farm grains (barley, wheat and oats), weed seeds, elderberries, acorns, and various cultivated fruits. Examination of the gizzards of western jackdaws shot in Cyprus in spring and summer revealed a diet of cereals (predominantly wheat) and insects (notably cicadas and beetles). The diet averages 84% plant material except when breeding, when the main food source is insects. A study in southern Spain examining western jackdaw pellets found that they contained significant amounts of silicaceous and calcareous grit to aid digestion of vegetable food and supply dietary calcium.

Opportunistic and highly adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet markedly depending on available food sources. They have been recorded taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;), Manx shearwater (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;), razorbill (&quot;Alca torda&quot;), common guillemot (&quot;Uria aalge&quot;), grey heron (&quot;Ardea cinerea&quot;), rock dove (&quot;Columba livia&quot;), and Eurasian collared dove (&quot;Streptopelia decaocto&quot;). A field study of a large city dump on the outskirts of León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.

Western jackdaws practice active food sharing – where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donor – with a number of individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it has been found to be detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.

==Parasites and diseases==
Western jackdaws have learned to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after delivery by the milkman. The bacterium &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds from pecking open bottles in the future.

An outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans has been linked to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with &quot;Salmonella&quot; and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.

==Pest control==
The western jackdaw has been hunted as vermin, though not as heavily culled as other species of corvid. After a series of poor harvests in the early 1500s,  introduced a Vermin Act in 1532 &quot;ordeyned to dystroye Choughes (i.e. jackdaws), Crowes and Rokes&quot; to protect grain crops from their predations. Western jackdaws were notorious as they also favoured fruit, especially cherries. This act was taken up in a piecemeal fashion, but  passed the &quot;Act for the Preservation of Grayne&quot; in 1566 that was taken up with more vigour. The species was hunted for its threat to grain crops and for propensity for nesting in belfries until the mid-20th century. Particularly large numbers were culled in the county of Norfolk. Western jackdaws were also culled on game estates as they raid nests of other birds for eggs. In a 2003 dissertation on public opinion of corvids, Antonia Hereth notes that the German naturalist Alfred Brehm considered the western jackdaw to be a lovable bird, and did not describe any negative impacts of this species on agriculture.

The western jackdaw is one of a very small number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be controlled by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.

==Cultural depictions and folklore==

An ancient Greek and Roman adage runs &quot;The swans will sing when the jackdaws are silent&quot;, meaning that educated or wise people will speak only after the foolish have become quiet. In Ancient Greek folklore, a jackdaw can be caught with a dish of oil. A narcissistic creature, it falls in while looking at its own reflection. The mythical Princess Arne Sithonis was bribed with gold by King Minos of Crete, and was punished by the gods for her greed by being transformed into an equally avaricious jackdaw, who still seeks shiny things. The Roman poet Ovid described jackdaws as harbingers of rain in his poetic work &quot;Amores&quot;. Pliny notes how the Thessalians, Illyrians, and Lemnians cherished jackdaws for destroying grasshoppers&#x27; eggs. The Veneti are fabled to have bribed the jackdaws to spare their crops.

In some cultures, a jackdaw on the roof is said to predict a new arrival; alternatively, a jackdaw settling on the roof of a house or flying down a chimney is an omen of death, and coming across one is considered a bad omen. A jackdaw standing on the vanes of a cathedral tower is said to foretell rain. The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury records the story of a woman who, upon hearing a jackdaw chattering &quot;more loudly than usual,&quot; grew pale and became fearful of suffering a &quot;dreadful calamity&quot;, and that &quot;while yet speaking, the messenger of her misfortunes arrived&quot;. Czech superstition formerly held that if jackdaws are seen quarreling, war will follow, and that jackdaws will not build nests at Sázava after being banished by Saint Procopius.

The jackdaw was considered sacred in Welsh folklore as it nested in church steeples – it was shunned by the Devil because of its choice of residence. Nineteenth century belief in the Fens held that seeing a jackdaw on the way to a wedding was a good omen for a bride.

The jackdaw is featured on the Ukrainian town of Halych&#x27;s ancient coat of arms, the town&#x27;s name allegedly being derived from the East Slavic word for the bird. In &quot;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&quot; (1979), Milan Kundera notes that Franz Kafka&#x27;s father Hermann had a sign in front of his shop with a jackdaw painted next to his name, since &quot;kavka&quot; means &quot;jackdaw&quot; in Czech.

In the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot;, the main character&#x27;s ship is named the Jackdaw.

<text>The New Seekers were a British pop group, formed in London in 1969 by Keith Potger after the break-up of his group, the Seekers. The idea was that the New Seekers would appeal to the same market as the original Seekers, but their music would have pop as well as folk influences. They achieved worldwide success in the early 1970s with hits including &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Find Another Fool Like Me&quot; and &quot;Beg, Steal or Borrow.&quot;

==Formation==
The group were formed after the disbanding of the successful 1960s Australian group the Seekers. Keith Potger, a member of the Seekers, put together the New Seekers in 1969, featuring Laurie Heath, Chris Barrington, Marty Kristian, and Eve Graham and Sally Graham (no relation), the latter of whom was a member of &quot;The Young Generation&quot;. Potger himself also performed and recorded with the group.

Despite their having released only one album with no commercial success, ITV&#x27;s Scottish Television gave the group their own TV series &quot;Finders, Seekers&quot;. The line-up for this version of the group hosting the series was Keith Potger, Eve Graham, Sally Graham, Laurie Heath, Marty Kristian and Chris Barrington. Produced in colour, the show was given a prime-time slot, starting on 27 March 1970 (Good Friday) and continuing for seven shows. The public did not take to the show, with several complaints seemingly targeted at the band. Despite the complaints, the series was shown on several ITV channels, sold to Canada, Australia and Sweden with interest from other countries as a result of being shown at the international television market in Cannes.

Following the series&#x27; failure, later in 1970, after one album release, the line-up was reworked to comprise Eve Graham, Kristian, Lyn Paul, Peter Doyle and Paul Layton. This line-up found instant success with their debut release, a cover of Melanie Safka&#x27;s &quot;What Have They Done to My Song, Ma&quot; (titled in the U.S. as &quot;Look What They&#x27;ve Done to My Song, Ma&quot;), which became a top 20 hit in the US, No. 3 in Canada, and a minor one in the UK.

== Mainstream success ==
Over the next year, the group released a number of singles to little recognition, but it was in June 1971 that they released their breakthrough hit, &quot;Never Ending Song of Love&quot; (the first of many hit songs to be produced by David Mackay, and a cover of the American hit by Delaney &amp; Bonnie). The song became a big hit in the UK, spending five weeks at No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, and was one of the biggest selling singles of the year. This was their last single released on the Philips Records label. The huge success of this single was mildly ironic in that prior to the single&#x27;s release, the group were dropped by Philips and had signed with Polydor Records. Their first single for Polydor was &quot;Good Old Fashioned Music&quot;, which they promoted on television (including an appearance on &quot;Top Of The Pops&quot;), but it failed to chart. Towards the end of 1971, the group recorded an adaptation of the Coca-Cola jingle, &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Buy the World a Coke&quot;, which had gained much interest. Reworked as &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;, the song became a worldwide success. It made No. 1 in the UK for four weeks and sold just under a million copies. In the US, the song was also a hit, reaching No. 7, and in Canada it reached No. 3. It became a No. 1 hit in many other countries and is the most recognised song by the group.

The group were chosen to represent the United Kingdom in the 1972 &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;. They entered with the song &quot;Beg, Steal or Borrow&quot;, which was chosen by viewers of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard!&quot; show from six shortlisted songs performed by the group on a weekly basis. They went on to finish in second place at the Eurovision final in Edinburgh, where the group received the biggest cheer of the night from the partisan audience. The song was a No. 2 hit in the UK and sold well in Europe. Around this time, they also charted highly with their most successful album, &quot;We&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart. Another top five hit came with the next single, &quot;Circles&quot; in mid 1972. At the end of the year, the group took part in the BBC&#x27;s anniversary TV show &quot;Fifty Years Of Music&quot;.

The following year the group saw a slight dip, although they did score a top 20 hit with an adaptation of &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;. Member Peter Doyle left the group this year and was replaced by Peter Oliver. The New Seekers had enjoyed a number of hits in the US by this time and toured there with Liza Minnelli in 1973. While there, they recorded the title track of the American Marlo Thomas&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;. In 1974, the album was made into a landmark television programme designed to teach children how to express themselves and be independent through a series of vignettes. Since the special was first broadcast, the song became a cult classic.

Up to now, the group&#x27;s biggest success had been as a five-piece harmony, but it was around this time that they began to favour lead singers for their songs with title credits given to Marty Kristian for &quot;Come Softly to Me&quot; and Eve Graham for &quot;Nevertheless&quot;, but it was in late 1973 that this formula found its biggest success when Lyn Paul took the lead on the new single, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Find Another Fool Like Me&quot;. The song became a big hit over Christmas and eventually peaked at No. 1 in January 1974, becoming their second biggest hit. This formula continued with the next single, &quot;I Get a Little Sentimental Over You&quot;, which also became a big hit, peaking at No. 5. However, despite this revival, the group announced their split amid much publicity. With allegations that the members were receiving little financial reward for their success, The New Seekers officially disbanded in May 1974.

The group&#x27;s two UK number one singles are listed as being in the top 30 best selling singles for the 1970s, with &quot;I&#x27;d Like To Teach The World To sing&quot; at No. 17 and &quot;You Won&#x27;t Find Another Fool Like Me&quot; at No. 27. &quot;We&#x27;ve Got To Do It Now&quot; was used in a public information film in both the United Kingdom and the United States about littering.

== Reformation ==
In 1976, the New Seekers reformed with Kathy Ann Rae and Danny Finn replacing Lyn Paul and Peter Oliver. Although they never replicated their earlier success, signed to CBS (Columbia in the US) the group did manage to score a few hits with &quot;It&#x27;s So Nice (To Have You Home)&quot; (1976), &quot;I Wanna Go Back&quot; (1977) and &quot;Anthem (One Day in Every Week)&quot; (1978). This line up remained intact until 1978, when Danny Finn and Eve Graham left the group to marry. Their final single for CBS was &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Music&quot; in 1979, with Kathy Ann Rae on lead vocal, but after it failed to chart, she left the band and the group signed their final contract with EMI.

In 1980, the group attempted to represent the UK again in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Tell Me&quot;, but it was disqualified shortly before the British heats were televised due to the fact the group had already performed the song on TV a year earlier.

Marty Kristian entered a song in the 1983 UK Eurovision finals, performed by a trio called &#x27;Audio&#x27;, which included Kathy Ann Rae in the line up.

Since then, there have been personnel changes which included Caitriona Walsh, Nicola Kerr and Vikki James (Grammy Winner Victoria Horn). Paul Layton remained with the band throughout this time. The final tour was 2010.

== Recent career ==
The New Seekers toured from 2006 with a line up of Paul Layton, Donna Jones, Francine Rees, Mick Flinn and Mark Hankins. A CD of the 2006 tour was released which includes the group&#x27;s hits and some cover versions. With a Royal Variety performance at St James&#x27;s Palace, London for Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and an appearance on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot;, they completed 2006. The New Seekers helped host a garden party in 2007 at Buckingham Palace. This was repeated the following year along with a show at The Tower of London and a return batch of concerts in British theatres. The 40th anniversary of the group in 2009 was celebrated by a 35-date UK concert tour, which began at London&#x27;s Shaw Theatre on 31 January and continued throughout the year. In July 2009, an album was released; &quot;It&#x27;s Been Too Long – Greatest Hits and More&quot;, comprising the group&#x27;s hits and some new recordings. It entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 17, their first album to enter that chart for 35 years.

In 2011 and 2012 Marty Kristian released two albums of demo recordings from the 1970s and 1980s.

<text>Packing problems are a class of optimization problems in mathematics that involve attempting to pack objects together into containers. The goal is to either pack a single container as densely as possible or pack all objects using as few containers as possible. Many of these problems can be related to real-life packaging, storage and transportation issues. Each packing problem has a dual covering problem, which asks how many of the same objects are required to completely cover every region of the container, where objects are allowed to overlap.

In a bin packing problem, people are given:
* A &quot;container&quot;, usually a two- or three-dimensional convex region, possibly of infinite size. Multiple containers may be given depending on the problem.
* A set of &quot;objects&quot;, some or all of which must be packed into one or more containers. The set may contain different objects with their sizes specified, or a single object of a fixed dimension that can be used repeatedly.

Usually the packing must be without overlaps between goods and other goods or the container walls. In some variants, the aim is to find the configuration that packs a single container with the maximal packing density. More commonly, the aim is to pack all the objects into as few containers as possible. In some variants the overlapping (of objects with each other and/or with the boundary of the container) is allowed but should be minimized.

==Packing in infinite space==
Many of these problems, when the container size is increased in all directions, become equivalent to the problem of packing objects as densely as possible in infinite Euclidean space. This problem is relevant to a number of scientific disciplines, and has received significant attention. The Kepler conjecture postulated an optimal solution for packing spheres hundreds of years before it was proven correct by Thomas Callister Hales. Many other shapes have received attention, including ellipsoids, Platonic and Archimedean solids including tetrahedra, tripods (unions of cubes along three positive axis-parallel rays), and unequal-sphere dimers.

===Hexagonal packing of circles===

These problems are mathematically distinct from the ideas in the circle packing theorem. The related circle packing problem deals with packing circles, possibly of different sizes, on a surface, for instance the plane or a sphere.

The counterparts of a circle in other dimensions can never be packed with complete efficiency in dimensions larger than one (in a one-dimensional universe, the circle analogue is just two points). That is, there will always be unused space if people are only packing circles. The most efficient way of packing circles, hexagonal packing, produces approximately 91% efficiency.

===Sphere packings in higher dimensions===
In three dimensions, close-packed structures offer the best &quot;lattice&quot; packing of spheres, and is believed to be the optimal of all packings. With &#x27;simple&#x27; sphere packings in three dimensions (&#x27;simple&#x27; being carefully defined) there are nine possible definable packings. The 8-dimensional E8 lattice and 24-dimensional Leech lattice have also been proven to be optimal in their respective real dimensional space.

===Packings of Platonic solids in three dimensions===
Cubes can easily be arranged to fill three-dimensional space completely, the most natural packing being the cubic honeycomb. No other Platonic solid can tile space on its own, but some preliminary results are known. Tetrahedra can achieve a packing of at least 85%. One of the best packings of regular dodecahedra is based on the aforementioned face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice.

Tetrahedra and octahedra together can fill all of space in an arrangement known as the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.

Simulations combining local improvement methods with random packings suggest that the lattice packings for icosahedra, dodecahedra, and octahedra are optimal in the broader class of all packings.

==Packing in 3-dimensional containers==

=== Different cuboids into a cuboid ===
Determine the minimum number of cuboid containers (bins) that are required to pack a given set of item cuboids. The rectangular cuboids to be packed can be rotated by 90 degrees on each axis.

===Spheres into a Euclidean ball===

The problem of finding the smallest ball such that disjoint open unit balls may be packed inside it has a simple and complete answer in -dimensional Euclidean space if formula_1, and in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space with no restrictions. It is worth describing in detail here, to give a flavor of the general problem. In this case, a configuration of pairwise tangent unit balls is available. People place the centers at the vertices formula_2 of a regular formula_3 dimensional simplex with edge 2; this is easily realized starting from an orthonormal basis. A small computation shows that the distance of each vertex from the barycenter is formula_4. Moreover, any other point of the space necessarily has a larger distance from &quot;at least&quot; one of the vertices. In terms of inclusions of balls, the open unit balls centered at formula_2 are included in a ball of radius formula_6, which is minimal for this configuration.

To show that this configuration is optimal, let formula_7 be the centers of disjoint open unit balls contained in a ball of radius centered at a point formula_8. Consider the map from the finite set formula_9 into formula_10 taking formula_11 in the corresponding formula_12 for each formula_13. Since for all formula_14, formula_15 this map is 1-Lipschitz and by the Kirszbraun theorem it extends to a 1-Lipschitz map that is globally defined; in particular, there exists a point formula_16 such that for all formula_17 one has formula_18, so that also formula_19. This shows that there are disjoint unit open balls in a ball of radius if and only if formula_20. Notice that in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space this implies that there are infinitely many disjoint open unit balls inside a ball of radius if and only if formula_21. For instance, the unit balls centered at formula_22, where formula_23 is an orthonormal basis, are disjoint and included in a ball of radius formula_24 centered at the origin. Moreover, for formula_25, the maximum number of disjoint open unit balls inside a ball of radius is formula_26.

===Spheres in a cuboid===

People determine the number of spherical objects of given diameter that can be packed into a cuboid of size formula_27.

===Identical spheres in a cylinder===

People determine the minimum height of a cylinder with given radius that will pack identical spheres of radius . For a small radius the spheres arrange to ordered structures, called columnar structures.

===Polyhedra in spheres===
People determine the minimum radius that will pack identical, unit volume polyhedra of a given shape.

==Packing in 2-dimensional containers==
Many variants of 2-dimensional packing problems have been studied.

=== Packing of circles ===
People are given unit circles, and have to pack them in the smallest possible container. Several kinds of containers have been studied:

* Packing circles in a circle - closely related to spreading points in a unit circle with the objective of finding the greatest minimal separation, , between points. Optimal solutions have been proven for , and .
* Packing circles in a square - closely related to spreading points in a unit square with the objective of finding the greatest minimal separation, , between points. To convert between these two formulations of the problem, the square side for unit circles will be formula_28. Optimal solutions have been proven for .
* Packing circles in a rectangle
* Packing circles in an isosceles right triangle - good estimates are known for .
* Packing circles in an equilateral triangle - Optimal solutions are known for , and conjectures are available for .

=== Packing of squares ===
People are given unit squares and have to pack them into the smallest possible container, where the container type varies:

* Packing squares in a square: Optimal solutions have been proven for from 1-10, 14-16, 22-25, 33-36, 62-64, 79-81, 98-100, and any square integer. The wasted space is asymptotically .
* Packing squares in a circle: Good solutions are known for .

===Packing of rectangles===
* Packing identical rectangles in a rectangle: The problem of packing multiple instances of a single rectangle of size , allowing for 90° rotation, in a bigger rectangle of size has some applications such as loading of boxes on pallets and, specifically, woodpulp stowage. For example, it is possible to pack 147 rectangles of size (137,95) in a rectangle of size (1600,1230).
* Packing different rectangles in a rectangle: The problem of packing multiple rectangles of varying widths and heights in an enclosing rectangle of minimum area (but with no boundaries on the enclosing rectangle&#x27;s width or height) has an important application in combining images into a single larger image. A web page that loads a single larger image often renders faster in the browser than the same page loading multiple small images, due to the overhead involved in requesting each image from the web server. The problem is NP-complete in general, but there are fast algorithms for solving small instances.

==Related fields==
In tiling or tessellation problems, there are to be no gaps, nor overlaps. Many of the puzzles of this type involve packing rectangles or polyominoes into a larger rectangle or other square-like shape.

There are significant theorems on tiling rectangles (and cuboids) in rectangles (cuboids) with no gaps or overlaps:
:An &quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot; rectangle can be packed with 1 × &quot;n&quot; strips if and only if &quot;n&quot; divides &quot;a&quot; or &quot;n&quot; divides &quot;b&quot;.
:de Bruijn&#x27;s theorem: A box can be packed with a harmonic brick &quot;a&quot; × &quot;a b&quot; × &quot;a b c&quot; if the box has dimensions &quot;a p&quot; × &quot;a b q&quot; × &quot;a b c r&quot; for some natural numbers &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; (i.e., the box is a multiple of the brick.)

The study of polyomino tilings largely concerns two classes of problems: to tile a rectangle with congruent tiles, and to pack one of each &quot;n&quot;-omino into a rectangle.

A classic puzzle of the second kind is to arrange all twelve pentominoes into rectangles sized 3×20, 4×15, 5×12 or 6×10.

==Packing of irregular objects==
Packing of irregular objects is a problem not lending itself well to closed form solutions; however, the applicability to practical environmental science is quite important. For example, irregularly shaped soil particles pack differently as the sizes and shapes vary, leading to important outcomes for plant species to adapt root formations and to allow water movement in the soil.

The problem of deciding whether a given set of polygons can fit in a given square container has been shown to be complete for the existential theory of the reals.

<text>Laurence Alma-Tadema (August 1865 – 12 March 1940), born Laurense Tadema, was a British writer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who worked in many genres.

==Early life==
Alma-Tadema was born in Brussels in 1865. She was the eldest daughter of the Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836–1912) and his first wife Marie-Pauline Gressin-Dumoulin de Boisgirard.
Laurence lived in the cottage &quot;The Fair Haven&quot;, Wittersham, Kent, and she involved herself with music and plays with the villagers and their children, going on to construct a building to seat a hundred people, used for musical concerts and plays, which she named &quot;Hall of Happy Hours&quot;. She mostly divided her time between a flat in Paris and her cottage in Wittersham. She never married, and died in a nursing home in London on 12 March 1940. Her stepmother, Lady Laura Theresa Alma-Tadema (1852–1909) and younger sister Anna Alma-Tadema (1867–1943) were noted visual artists.

==Literary work==
Alma-Tadema&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot;, was published in 1886. In addition to her own collections of stories and poems, which she often published herself, Alma-Tadema wrote two novels, songs and works on drama; she also made translations. The Orlando Project says about Alma-Tadema&#x27;s writing that the &quot;characteristic tone is one of intense emotion, but in prose and verse she has the gift of compression&quot;. She contributed widely to periodicals, notably &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, and also edited one herself. Some of Alma-Tadema&#x27;s plays were successfully produced in Germany.

Alma-Tadema&#x27;s poem &quot;If No One Ever Marries Me&quot;, written in 1897 and published in &quot;Realms of Unknown Kings&quot;, saw performances as a song in the 21st century by Natalie Merchant on her double album &quot;Leave Your Sleep&quot;. In 1900 it had been included in the musical score, &quot;The daisy chain, cycle of twelve songs of childhood&quot; by Liza Lehmann, and in 1922 in the musical score &quot;Little girls&quot; composed by Louise Sington.

==Political activities==
Alma-Tadema had a close association with Poland. She was secretary of the &quot;Poland and the Polish Victims Relief Fund&quot; from 1915 to 1939. She was an admirer and long-term associate of Ignacy Jan Paderewski both as far as his music and political activities were concerned, notably on Polish independence. Alma-Tadema maintained a correspondence with him from 1915 to the end of her life. Some of her papers are deposited with the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. She was appointed CBE in 1918

==American tour==
Alma-Tadema, who had socialist leanings, travelled to America in 1907 to tour the country widely. She gave a series of readings on the &quot;Meaning of Happiness&quot;, which proved exceedingly popular. She also spoke on the plight of the divided Poland and asked her audience to express their feelings for this cause.

<doc id="213008" wikidata="Q202994" url="?curid=213008" title="Carrion">
<text>Carrion (), also known as a carcass, is the decaying flesh of dead animals.

==Overview==
Carrion is an important food source for large carnivores and omnivores in most ecosystems. Examples of carrion-eaters (or scavengers) include crows, vultures, humans, hawks, eagles, hyenas, Virginia opossum, Tasmanian devils, coyotes and Komodo dragons. Many invertebrates, such as the carrion and burying beetles, as well as maggots of calliphorid flies (such as one of the most important species in &quot;Calliphora vomitoria&quot;) and flesh-flies, also eat carrion, playing an important role in recycling nitrogen and carbon in animal remains.

Carrion begins to decay at the moment of the animal&#x27;s death, and it will increasingly attract insects and breed bacteria. Not long after the animal has died, its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of cadaverine and putrescine.

Some plants and fungi smell like decomposing carrion and attract insects that aid in reproduction. Plants that exhibit this behavior are known as carrion flowers. Stinkhorn mushrooms are examples of fungi with this characteristic.

Sometimes carrion is used to describe an infected carcass that is diseased and should not be touched. An example of carrion being used to describe dead and rotting bodies in literature may be found in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (III.i):

&lt;poem&gt;Cry &#x27;Havoc,&#x27; and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.&lt;/poem&gt;

Another example can be found in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; when the title character kills an unknown bird for food but finds &quot;its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing&quot;.

==Consumption by humans==
===In Noahide law===

The thirty-count laws of Ulla (Talmudist) include the prohibition of humans consuming carrion. This count is in addition to the standard seven law count and has been recently published from the Judeo-Arabic writing of Shmuel ben Hophni Gaon after having been lost for centuries.

===In Islam===
Animals killed by strangling, a violent blow, a headlong fall, being gored to death, or from which a predatory animal has partially eaten are considered types of carrion, and are forbidden in Islam.

<doc id="213009" wikidata="Q276174" url="?curid=213009" title="The Roses of Heliogabalus">
<text>The Roses of Heliogabalus is an oil painting by the Anglo-Dutch artist Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, from 1888. It depicts the young Roman emperor Elagabalus (203–222 AD) hosting a banquet. It is held in a private collection.

==Subject==
The painting measures . It shows a group of Roman diners at a banquet, being swamped by drifts of pink rose petals falling from a false ceiling above. The youthful Roman emperor Elagabalus, wearing a golden silk robe and tiara, watches the spectacle from a platform behind them, with other garlanded guests. A woman plays the double pipes beside a marble pillar in the background, wearing the leopard skin of a maenad, with a bronze statue of Dionysus, based on the Ludovisi Dionysus, in front of a view of distant hills.

The painting depicts a (probably invented) episode in the life of the Roman emperor Elagabalus, also known as Heliogabalus, taken from the &quot;Augustan History&quot;. Although the Latin refers to &quot;violets and other flowers&quot;, Alma-Tadema depicts Elagabalus smothering his unsuspecting guests with rose petals released from a false ceiling. The original reference is this:

In his notes to the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, Magie notes that &quot;Nero did this also (Suetonius, Nero, xxxi), and a similar ceiling in the house of Trimalchio is described in Petronius, Sat., lx.&quot; (Satyricon).

==History==
The painting was commissioned by Sir John Aird, 1st Baronet for £4,000 in 1888. As roses were out of season in the United Kingdom, Alma-Tadema is reputed to have had rose petals sent from the south of France each week during the four months in which it was painted.

The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1888. Aird died in 1911, and the painting was inherited by his son Sir John Richard Aird, 2nd Baronet. After Alma-Tadema died in 1912, the painting was exhibited at a memorial exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1913, the last time it was seen at a public exhibition in the UK until 2014.

Alma-Tadema&#x27;s reputation declined markedly in the decades after his death. Following the death of the 2nd Baronet in 1934, the painting was sold by his son, the 3rd Baronet, in 1935 for 483 guineas. It failed to sell at Christie&#x27;s in 1960 and was &quot;bought in&quot; by the auction house for 100 guineas. Next, it was acquired by Allen Funt: he was the producer of &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and a collector of Alma-Tadema&#x27;s at a time when the artist remained very unfashionable. After Funt experienced financial troubles, he sold the painting along with the rest of his collection at Sotheby&#x27;s in London in November 1973, achieving a price of £28,000. The painting was sold again by American collector Frederick Koch at Christie&#x27;s in London in June 1993 for £1,500,000. It is currently owned by the Spanish-Mexican billionaire businessman and art collector Juan Antonio Pérez Simón.

== Exhibitions ==
* The painting was included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in March and April 1973 (when the owner was Allen Funt). 
* The painting is part of a private collection but was on display from 14 November 2014 to 29 March 2015 at the Leighton House Museum in London as part of the exhibition &quot;A Victorian Obsession: The Pérez Simón collection at Leighton House Museum&quot;, the first time since Alma-Tadema&#x27;s memorial exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1913, that it has been exhibited in London. It returned to the Leighton House Museum from 7 July to 29 October 2017 for the exhibition &quot;Alma-Tadema: At Home in Antiquity.&quot;
* The painting was a part of an exhibition of Lawrence Alma-Tadema&#x27;s paintings in Belvedere, Vienna, Austria from 24 February 2017 to 18 June 2017.
* &quot;La Pluie de roses D&#x27;Héliogabale&quot; is a separate yet similar painting, recorded to have been displayed at the 1880 Paris Salon, done by an artist under the name A. Heullant, likely Félix Armand Heullant. 
* Between 20 September 2024 and 12 January 2025 the painting is displayed at the cultural centre CentroCentro, inside the Cybele Palace, town hall of the Madrid, as a part of the exhibition &quot;Seventy Great Masters from the Pérez Simón Collection.&quot;

<doc id="213015" wikidata="Q2604288" url="?curid=213015" title="Ragtime (film)">
<text>Ragtime is a 1981 American drama film directed by Miloš Forman, based on the 1975 historical novel &quot;Ragtime&quot; by E. L. Doctorow. It is set in and around turn-of-the-century New York City, New Rochelle, and Atlantic City, and includes fictionalized references to actual people and events of the time. The film stars James Cagney, Mary Steenburgen, Howard Rollins, Brad Dourif, James Olson and Elizabeth McGovern.

&quot;Ragtime&quot; featured Cagney&#x27;s and Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s final film appearances, as well as early roles for Jeff Daniels, Fran Drescher, Samuel L. Jackson, Ethan Phillips, and John Ratzenberger.

== Plot ==
At the turn of the 20th century, architect Stanford White unveils a nude statue atop Madison Square Garden, modeled after former chorus girl Evelyn Nesbit. After learning of this, Nesbit&#x27;s husband, millionaire industrialist Harry Kendall Thaw, becomes convinced White has corrupted her and publicly shoots him dead.

An upper-class family resides in New Rochelle, New York, where the father owns a factory and his wife&#x27;s younger brother makes fireworks. An African American baby is abandoned in their garden, and upon learning the police intend to charge the child&#x27;s mother, Sarah, with child abandonment and attempted murder, Mother takes Sarah and her child into the home despite Father&#x27;s objections. Ragtime pianist Coalhouse Walker arrives in search of Sarah, driving a new Ford Model T, and realizing he is the baby&#x27;s father, announces his intention to marry Sarah.

The younger brother witnesses White&#x27;s murder and becomes obsessed with Evelyn. Thaw&#x27;s lawyer Delmas bribes Evelyn with a million-dollar divorce settlement to keep silent about Thaw&#x27;s mental instability and to testify that White abused her. Passing through the Lower East Side, Evelyn encounters street artist Tateh, who throws out his unfaithful wife. He leaves New York City with their daughter and sells the flip book he created. Evelyn and the younger brother begin an affair as she prepares her return to the stage, while he assumes they will eventually marry. After Thaw is the younger brother adrift.

In New Rochelle, Coalhouse is targeted by bigoted volunteer firemen led by Willie Conklin, who refuse to allow his automobile to pass by. Coalhouse finds a policeman and returns to find his car soiled with horse manure. Coalhouse attempts to force the policeman to intervene, but the policeman insists that Coalhouse should clean the manure off his car and move on, giving him the choice to do so or be arrested. Coalhouse refuses, and is hauled in to the local precinct. After Father arranges for Coalhouse&#x27;s release, they discover his car has been further vandalized. Coalhouse pursues legal action, but can find no lawyer willing to represent him. Father and the younger brother argue over Coalhouse&#x27;s legal recourse. At a presidential rally, Sarah attempts to tell President Roosevelt about Coalhouse&#x27;s case but is beaten by guards and dies.

After Sarah&#x27;s funeral, Coalhouse and his supporters kill several firemen. He threatens to attack other firehouses, demanding his car be restored and Conklin be turned over to him. Father is disgusted at the violence but the younger brother joins Coalhouse&#x27;s gang with his knowledge of explosives. Ostracized by their own white community and hounded by reporters, Father and Mother leave for Atlantic City. They encounter Tateh, now a film director on a photoplay with Evelyn. Mother is attracted to Tateh and she and Father quarrel. Coalhouse&#x27;s gang hold the Pierpont Morgan Library&#x27;s collection hostage. Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo sends for Coalhouse&#x27;s child as a bargaining chip but Mother refuses to give him up. Father demands she turn the child over and returns to New York City to assist Waldo and Mother leaves.

Booker T. Washington fails to persuade Coalhouse to surrender, as does Father. Conklin is captured by police and forced to apologize to Coalhouse. Waldo is disgusted by Conklin&#x27;s bigotry but cannot submit to terrorist demands and has him arrested. Coalhouse agrees to surrender if Waldo permits his supporters to depart in his restored car and Waldo agrees after Father volunteers to stay as a hostage. Coalhouse&#x27;s supporters escape and he drives Father out of the library.

Ready to blow himself up, Coalhouse instead surrenders but is shot dead on Waldo&#x27;s orders. The film ends with another newsreel: Evelyn dances in vaudeville and Thaw is released from an asylum. Houdini escapes from a straitjacket several stories above the ground, while newspapers announce that World War I has begun. The younger brother returns to his fireworks job and Father watches from the house in New Rochelle as Mother departs with Tateh and Coalhouse&#x27;s son.

== Cast ==

&quot;Ragtime&quot; is notable for the final film appearances of James Cagney and Pat O&#x27;Brien; Cagney had not acted in a film for nearly 20 years prior to his final movie role in &quot;Ragtime&quot;. The film also features early appearances by several actors who would later achieve greater fame. Among them are Samuel L. Jackson, Debbie Allen, Jeff Daniels, Elizabeth McGovern, Richard Griffiths, Fran Drescher, Andreas Katsulas, Ethan Phillips, Mandy Patinkin, John Ratzenberger, and Stuart Milligan.

== Production ==
=== Pre-production ===

&quot;Ragtime&quot; was adapted from E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s acclaimed novel that earned the National Book Critics Award and secured a spot in numerous critics&#x27; top-ten lists. Bantam Books acquired paperback rights for a record $1.8 million, recovering their investment after selling four million copies. An additional one million copies were sold, and half a million more were printed in conjunction with the film&#x27;s release.

In 1975, producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the film rights for $250,000, and Robert Altman joined the project as director. Altman and Doctorow rejected Joan Tewkesbury&#x27;s initial draft in 1976, as it focused primarily on Mother&#x27;s journey, deviating from their shared vision of the movie&#x27;s structure. Doctorow wrote a 1,000-page draft of the screenplay himself, which Altman envisioned filming in its entirety as two three-hour movies; De Laurentiis disagreed and Altman and Doctorow were both dismissed from the project. Miloš Forman and Michael Weller were hired as director and screenwriter, respectively, and streamlined the script by focusing primarily on Coalhouse Walker and omitting notable historical figures who had appeared in the novel, such as Henry Ford and Sigmund Freud.

=== Casting ===

Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, and Bruce Springsteen expressed interest in playing Younger Brother, while Redd Foxx, Muhammad Ali, and O. J. Simpson were considered to play Coalhouse Walker. Renowned actor James Cagney, who knew Forman socially, was enticed back to the screen after a two-decade retirement to play New York Police Commissioner Rheinlander Waldo. The role was significantly expanded from the novel to give Cagney more screentime. In preparation for her role as Evelyn Nesbit, Elizabeth McGovern gathered insights from a friend of her mother who knew Nesbit in the latter part of her life. Mariclare Costello was cast as radical feminist Emma Goldman and filmed scenes, but her entire part was ultimately cut by De Laurentiis.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography took place in 1980 over twenty weeks, divided between the U.S. and London. Ten days were spent filming in the Lower East Side of New York City, with additional days in uptown Manhattan. Seven weeks of filming covered various locations in Westchester, New York, the state of Connecticut, and along the New Jersey shore. Shepperton Studios in London constructed significant sets, including a meticulous reproduction of a six-and-a-half-acre stretch of Madison Avenue and the formal façade and lush interiors of the J. P. Morgan Library. St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Harlem, New York, served as the backdrop for Sarah&#x27;s funeral scene. The film&#x27;s budget amounted to $32 million. &quot;Ragtime&quot; was among thirty theatrical features that entered into an interim agreement with the Screen Actors Guild to avoid a production shutdown caused by an actors strike.

Art director Patrizia Von Brandenstein described the transformation of East 11th Street between Avenues A and B into the backdrop for Evelyn&#x27;s encounter with the street silhouette artist &quot;Tateh&quot; on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. Carpenters and painters worked on this location due to a blend of existing period architecture and moderate commercial activity, choosing it over the more familiar and bustling Orchard Street. The production altered storefronts, replacing Spanish signage with Hebrew writing to better suit the historical context. To secure this location, the production agreed to donate &quot;$5,000 to a community-sponsored project,&quot; along with the standard compensation for property owners. Additional arrangements included providing garage parking for contemporary cars and setting up a temporary &quot;Ragtime Summer Camp&quot; behind Kalish&#x27;s Shoestore for over forty children who could not play on the street during filming. One address on the street was reverted to its original function as a livery stable to accommodate the production&#x27;s fifteen horses, with inspection by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

In Mount Kisco, New York, Von Brandenstein spent three months converting a fifteen-room Victorian home to represent the film&#x27;s archetypical middle-class family setting. The transformation involved rebuilding porches, graveling the driveway, installing an antique kitchen, hanging hand-blocked period wallpaper, and adding a gazebo to evoke a turn-of-the-century ambiance. The production rented the home for $20,000 for a three-week shoot, investing an additional $40,000 in permanent improvements while accommodating the homeowners&#x27; preferences by removing any alterations they disliked.

=== Music ===

Composer Randy Newman crafted an original score to capture the mood of the film&#x27;s historical period, avoiding the use of music from that era. The decision was influenced by the perception that most original recordings from the early 1900s were &quot;too tinny or scratchy&quot; for practical use. Tracking down pristine recordings would have required extensive research, leading Newman to choose the option of recreating popular music from that time.

=== Marketing ===

To appeal to black audiences, Paramount Pictures launched a second print advertising campaign. The poster featured actors Howard E. Rollins, Moses Gunn, Debbie Allen, and James Cagney, accompanied by the statement: &quot;A black man said &#x27;Respect me or kill me!&#x27; They took away Coalhouse&#x27;s wife, child, and pride. He made them pay in a way America will never forget. It was a tough time... it was Ragtime.&quot;

== Reception ==
The film holds an aggregated score of 84% from Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews, and a 57/100 from Metacritic, indicating mixed or average reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing that &quot;&#x27;Ragtime&#x27; is a loving, beautifully mounted, graceful film that creates its characters with great clarity. We understand where everyone stands, and most of the time we even know why.&quot; Vincent Canby gave the film a more mixed review, praising the performances and cinematography but criticizing Forman&#x27;s narrative choices that created an unclear sense of time and prioritized certain storylines at the cost of others: &quot;[Ragtime] is sorrowful, funny and beautiful. It is also, finally, very unsatisfactory.&quot; Christopher Null gave the film a negative review, calling it &quot;a jumbled and largely uninteresting mess&quot;. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, though it did not win any.

<text>Isaac Casaubon (; ; 18 February 1559 – 1 July 1614) was a classical scholar and philologist, first in France and then later in England.

His son Méric Casaubon was also a classical scholar.

==Life==
===Early life===
He was born in Geneva to two French Huguenot refugees. The family returned to France after the Edict of Saint-Germain in 1562, and settled at Crest in Dauphiné, where Arnaud Casaubon, Isaac&#x27;s father, became minister of a Huguenot congregation. Until he was nineteen, Isaac had no education other than that given him by his father. Arnaud was away from home for long periods in the Calvinist camp, and the family regularly fled to the hills to hide from bands of armed Catholics who patrolled the country. It was in a cave in the mountains of Dauphiné, after the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day&#x27;s Massacre, that Isaac received his first lesson in Greek, based on Isocrates&#x27; &quot;Ad Demonicum&quot;.

At the age of nineteen Isaac was sent to the Academy of Geneva, where he read Greek under Franciscus Portus, a Cretan. Portus died in 1581, recommending Casaubon, then only twenty-two, as his successor. He remained at Geneva as professor of Greek until 1596. There he married twice, his second wife being Florence Estienne, daughter of the scholar-printer Henri Estienne. At Geneva, Casaubon lacked example, encouragement and assistance and struggled against the troops of the Catholic dukes of Savoy, but became a consummate Greek and classical scholar. He spent all the money he could spare on books, including copying classics that were not then in print. Even though Henri Estienne, Theodore de Beza (rector of the university and professor of theology), and Jacques Lect (Lectius), were men of superior learning, they often had no time for Casaubon.

Casaubon sought help by cultivating the acquaintance of foreign scholars, as Geneva, the metropolis of Calvinism, received a constant stream of visitors. He eventually met Henry Wotton, a poet and diplomat, who lodged with him and borrowed his money. More importantly, he met Richard Thomson (&quot;Dutch&quot; Thomson), fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, and through Thomson came to the attention of Joseph Scaliger. Scaliger and Casaubon first exchanged letters in 1594. They never met, but kept up a lengthy correspondence that shows their growing admiration, esteem and friendship. Influential French men of letters, the Protestant Jacques Bongars, the Catholic Jacques de Thou, and the Catholic convert Philippe Canaye (sieur de Fresnes) endeavoured to get Casaubon invited to France.

In 1596, they succeeded, and Casaubon accepted a post at the University of Montpellier, with the titles of &quot;conseiller du roi&quot; (king&#x27;s advisor) and &quot;professeur stipendié aux langues et bonnes lettres&quot; (salaried professor of languages and literatures). He stayed there for only three years, with several prolonged absences. He was badly treated and poorly paid by the university authorities. Casaubon began to see the editing of Greek books as a more suitable job for him. At Geneva he had produced some notes on Diogenes Laërtius, Theocritus and the New Testament. He debuted as an editor with a complete edition of Strabo (1587), of which he was so ashamed afterwards that he apologized to Scaliger for it. This was followed by the text of Polyaenus, an &quot;editio princeps&quot;, 1589; a text of Aristotle, 1590; and a few notes contributed to Estienne&#x27;s editions of Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Epistolae&quot;. His edition of Theophrastus&#x27;s &quot;Characteres&quot; (1592), is the first example of his peculiar style of illustrative commentary, at once apposite and profuse. When he left for Montpellier he was already engaged upon his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, his editing of and commentary on Athenaeus.

===Travels and tribulations===
In 1598 Casaubon was at Lyon, overseeing the printing of his &quot;Athenaeus&quot;. Here he lived in the house of Méric de Vicq, &quot;surintendant de la justice&quot; (Superintendent of Justice), a liberal-minded Catholic. Accompanied by de Vicq, Casaubon briefly visited Paris, where he was presented to King Henry IV of France. The king said something about employing Casaubon&#x27;s services in the &quot;restoration&quot; of the fallen University of Paris. In January 1599, he received a summons to return to Paris, but the terms of the letter were so vague that Casaubon hesitated to act on it. However, he resigned his chair at Montpellier. He stayed another year at Lyon with de Vicq, where he hoped to meet the king, who was expected to visit the south. Nothing more was heard about the professorship, but instead De Vicq summoned him to Paris for important business: the Fontainebleau Conference. Casaubon was persuaded to sit as a referee on the challenge sent to Du Plessis Mornay by Cardinal Duperron. By so doing he placed himself in a false position, as Joseph Scaliger said:

&quot;Non debebat Casaubon interesse colloquio Plessiaeano; erat asinus inter simias, doctus inter imperitos.&quot; 
&quot;Casaubon ought not to have been involved in the conference about Du Plessis; he was a donkey among monkeys, a learned man among the ignorant.&quot;

The issue was contrived that the Protestant party (Du Plessis Mornay) could not fail to lose. By concurring with this decision, Casaubon confirmed the Protestants&#x27; suspicions that, like his friend and patron, Philippe Canaye, he was contemplating abjuration. From then on, he became the object of the hopes and fears of the two religions; the Catholics lavishing promises and plying him with arguments; the Protestant ministers insinuating that he was preparing to forsake a losing cause, and only haggling about his price. Neither side could understand that Casaubon&#x27;s reading of the church fathers led him to adopt an intermediate position between Genevan Calvinism and Ultramontanism.

Meanwhile, the king repeated his invitation to Casaubon to settle in Paris, and gave him a pension. No more was said about the university. The recent reform of the University of Paris closed its doors to all but Catholics; and though the chairs of the were not governed by the statutes of the university, public opinion ran so violently against Protestants, that Henry IV dared not appoint a Calvinist to that position. When the king&#x27;s sub-librarian Jean Gosselin died of extreme old age in 1604, Casaubon succeeded him, with a salary of 400 &quot;livres&quot; in addition to his pension.

===Paris===
Casaubon remained in Paris until the assassination of Henry IV in 1610. These ten years were the brightest period of his life. He had attained the reputation of being a learned man, in an age in which learning formed the sole standard of literary merit. He had money, the ability to worship as a Huguenot (though he had to travel to Hablon, ten miles from the center of Paris, or Charenton to worship), and the society of men of letters, both domestic and foreign. Above all, he had ample facilities for using Greek books, both printed and in manuscript, the want of which he had felt painfully at Geneva and Montpellier, and which only Paris could supply at that time.

Despite all these advantages, Casaubon considered many schemes for leaving Paris and settling elsewhere. Offers came to him from various quarters, including Nîmes, Heidelberg and Sedan, France. His friends Lect and Giovanni Diodati wished, rather than hoped, to get him back to Geneva. In Paris, Casaubon was still uneasy about his religion: the life of a Parisian Huguenot was always insecure, for the police were likely not strong enough to protect them against a sudden mob uprising. Since the Fontainebleau Conference, an impression prevailed that Casaubon was wavering. The Catholics told him he could gain a professorship only if he renounced Protestantism. When it became clear that Casaubon could not be bought, Henry IV, who liked Casaubon personally, took it upon himself to try to convert him. (Henry himself had converted to Catholicism in order to rule France.) The king&#x27;s cardinal Duperron, in his capacity of &quot;aumonier&quot;, argued with Casaubon in the king&#x27;s library. On the other hand, the Huguenot theologians, especially Pierre du Moulin, chief pastor of the church of Paris, accused Casaubon of conceding too much, and of having departed already from the lines of strict Calvinistic orthodoxy.

===England===
When the assassination of Henry IV gave full rein to the Ultramontane party at court, Duperron became more importunate, even menacing. Casaubon began to pay attention to overtures from the bishops and the court of England. In October 1610 he came to England in the suite of the ambassador, Lord Wotton of Marley (brother of Casaubon&#x27;s early friend Henry Wotton), an official invitation having been sent him by Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury. He had the most flattering reception from King James I, who often sent for him to discuss theological matters. The English bishops were delighted to find that the great French scholar was a ready-made Anglican, who had arrived, by independent study of the Fathers, at the very &quot;via media&quot; (middle way) between Puritanism and Catholicism which was becoming the fashion in the English Church. Casaubon, though a layman, was collated to a prebendal stall in Canterbury, and a pension of £300 a year was assigned him from the exchequer. King James insisted that &quot;I will have Mr Casaubon paid before me, my wife, and my barnes.&quot; Casaubon still retained his appointments in France, and his office as librarian: he had obtained leave of absence for the visit to England, where he was not supposed to settle permanently. In order to retain their hold on him, the queen regent, Marie de Medici refused to allow his library to be sent over. It required a specific request from James himself to allow Madame Casaubon to bring him a part of his most necessary books. Casaubon continued to speak of himself as the servant of the regent, and to declare his readiness to return when summoned to do so.

Casaubon found great success in England. English Bishop John Overall received him and his whole family into the deanery of St Paul&#x27;s, and entertained him there for a year. Lancelot Andrewes, then Bishop of Ely, also became Casaubon&#x27;s friend, taking him to Cambridge, where he met with a most gratifying reception from the notabilities of the university. They went on together to the Bishop&#x27;s Palace at Little Downham near Ely, where Casaubon spent six weeks of the summer of 1611, in which year he became naturalized. He accompanied the bishop on visits to nearby towns including Doddington and Wisbech.
In 1613 he was taken to Oxford by Sir Henry Savile, where, amid the homage and feasting of which he was the object, his principal interest was for the manuscript treasures of the Bodleian Library. He declined the honorary degree which was offered him.

Still, Casaubon gradually discovered the serious inconveniences of his position. Having been taken up by the king and the bishops, he had to share in their rising unpopularity. The courtiers were jealous of a foreign pensioner who was so close to the king. Casaubon was especially mortified by Sir Henry Wotton&#x27;s behaviour towards him, so inconsistent with their former intimacy. His windows were broken by vandals, and his children were pelted in the streets. On one occasion he appeared at Theobalds with a black eye, having been assaulted in the street. These outrages seem to have arisen solely from the English antipathy to the Frenchman: Casaubon, though he could read an English book, could not speak English. This deficiency exposed him to insult and fraud, and restricted his social activity. It excluded him from the circle of the &quot;wits&quot;; and he was not accepted in the circle of the &quot;antiquaries&quot; like William Camden, Sir Robert Cotton and Henry Spelman.

Although Sir Henry Savile ostensibly patronized him, Casaubon could not help suspecting that it was Savile who had persuaded Richard Montagu to forestall Casaubon&#x27;s book on Baronius. An exception was John Selden who was close enough to Casaubon to lend him money. Besides the jealousy of the natives, Casaubon had now to suffer the open attacks of the Jesuit pamphleteers, who, after he committed to Anglicism, detested him. Not only Joannes Eudaemon, Heribert Rosweyd and Scioppius (Gaspar Schoppe), but a respectable writer, friendly to Casaubon, Andreas Schott of Antwerp, gave currency to the insinuation that Casaubon had sold his conscience for English gold.

The most serious cause of discomfort in England was that his time was no longer his own. He was continually being summoned to one or other of James&#x27;s hunting residences in order to converse. The king and the bishops compelled him to write pamphlets on the subject of the day, the royal supremacy. At last, ashamed of misappropriating Casaubon&#x27;s stores of learning, they asked him to refute the popular &quot;Annals of Baronius&quot;.

In 1614 he published &quot;De rebus sacris et ecclesiasticis exercitationes XVI&quot; which consisted of a philological analysis of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, a series of neo-platonic texts. He placed their origin in the third or fourth century AD, rather than in a much earlier &quot;hermetic&quot; period to which they had generally been ascribed.

He died in London of a congenital malformation of the bladder; but his end was hastened by an unhealthy life of over-study, and by his anxiety to acquit himself creditably in his criticism on Baronius. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. The monument by which his name is there commemorated was erected in 1632 by his friend Thomas Morton when Bishop of Durham.

==Scholarship and correspondence==
Besides the editions already mentioned, Casaubon published and commented upon Persius, Suetonius, Aeschylus, and the &quot;Scriptores Historiae Augustae&quot;. The edition of Polybius, on which he had spent vast labour, he left unfinished. His most ambitious work was his revision of the text of the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; of Athenaeus, with commentary. The Theophrastus perhaps exhibits his most characteristic excellences as a commentator. The &quot;Exercitationes in Baronium&quot; are but a fragment of the massive criticism which he contemplated; it failed in presenting the uncritical character of Baronius&#x27;s history, and had only a moderate success, even among Protestants. His analysis of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; overturned the previous general opinion in Europe that these texts dated from almost the time of Moses by locating them between 200 and 300 AD.

His correspondence (in Latin) was finally collected by Theodorus Janssonius van Almeloveen (Rotterdam, 1709), who prefixed to the letters a careful biography of Casaubon. But Almeloveen was acquainted with Casaubon&#x27;s diary only in extract. More recently, a complete edition of all the letters written by and to Casaubon during his stay in England was published with extensive cultural-historical notes and introduction (Geneva, 2018). Casaubon&#x27;s diary, &quot;Ephemerides&quot;, whose manuscript is preserved in the chapter library of Canterbury, was printed in 1850 by the Clarendon Press. It forms the most valuable record we possess of the daily life of a scholar, or man of letters, of the 16th century.

Casaubon corresponded with scholars all over Europe, including Johannes van den Driesche and, more surprisingly, one of the doctors of the Ambrosiana Library and eminent historian of Milan, Giuseppe Ripamonti.

He also corresponded with the translators of the King James Version of the Bible and helped resolve issues in the translation.

He also worked on Arabic and Turkish coins, one of the earliest Europeans to do so.

==Literary appearances==
The scholars in &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot; by Umberto Eco and &quot;Middlemarch&quot; by George Eliot are named Casaubon. Mary Gentle named a character in her novels &quot;Rats and Gargoyles and the Architecture of Desire&quot; Casaubon, as an homage to Isaac Casaubon. Ross King makes mention of Casaubon in his novel &quot;Ex-Libris&quot;, where he is said to have debunked the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; as a forgery (which he probably took from Frances Yates&#x27; &quot;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition&quot;, published in 1964).

In their book &quot;Isaac Casaubon, the Jews, and a Forgotten Chapter in Renaissance Scholarship&quot;, Anthony Grafton and Joanna Weinberg show that Casaubon was a Hebrew scholar too, taking serious interest in Jewish studies.

The Jewish bibliographer Isaac ben Jacob, in his Bibliography &quot;Otsar Hasefarim&quot; (1880), mentions notations on &quot;Michlol&quot;, the Hebrew book by David Kimhi on Hebrew grammar, which he attributes to one &quot;Rabbi Isaac Casaubon&quot;.

<text>The Evangelical Church in Germany (, EKD), also known as the Protestant Church in Germany, is a federation of twenty Lutheran, Reformed, and United Protestant regional Churches in Germany, collectively encompassing the vast majority of the country&#x27;s Protestants. In 2022, the EKD had a membership of 19,153,000 members, or 22.7% of the German population. It constitutes one of the largest Protestant bodies in the world. Church offices managing the federation are located in Herrenhausen, Hanover, Lower Saxony. Many of its members consider themselves Lutherans.

Historically, the first formal attempt to unify German Protestantism occurred during the Weimar Republic era in the form of the German Protestant Church Confederation, which existed from 1922 until 1933. Earlier, there had been successful royal efforts at unity in various German states, beginning with Prussia and several minor German states (e.g. Duchy of Nassau) in 1817. These unions resulted in the first united and uniting churches, a new development within Protestantism which later spread to other parts of the world. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, his administration tried to reorganize the old confederation into a unified German Evangelical Church as Hitler wanted to use a single Protestant church to further his own ambitions. However, a division emerged between the Reichskirche, led by the pro-government German Christians, and the Confessing Church, which opposed state control of the church. Other Protestant churches aligned themselves with one of these groups, or stayed neutral in this church strife. The postwar church council issued the Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt on 19 October 1945, confessing guilt and declaring remorse for indifference and inaction of German Protestants in the face of atrocities committed by Hitler&#x27;s regime. In 1948, the Protestant Church in Germany was organized in the aftermath of World War II to function as a new umbrella organization for German Protestant churches. As a result of tensions between West and East Germany, the regional churches in East Germany broke away from the EKD in 1969. In 1991, following German reunification, the East German churches re-joined the EKD.

The member churches (&quot;Gliedkirchen&quot;), while being independent and having their own theological and formal organisation, share full altar and pulpit fellowship, and are united in the EKD synod, but they act as individual members of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe (CPCE). Boundaries of EKD churches within Germany partially resemble those of the states of the Holy Roman Empire and successor forms of German statehood (to the most part 1815 borders), due to the historically close relationship between individual German states and churches. As for church governance, the Lutheran churches typically practise an episcopal polity, while the Reformed and the United ones a mixture of presbyterian and congregationalist polities. Most member churches are led by a (state) bishop. Only one member church, the Evangelical Reformed Church in Germany, is not restricted to a certain territory. In some ways, the other member churches resemble dioceses of the Catholic and Anglican churches, from an organisational point of view.

==Name==
Etymologically, the German word means &quot;of the Gospel&quot;, denoting a Reformation emphasis on , &quot;by scripture alone&quot;. Martin Luther encouraged the use of this term alongside &quot;Christian&quot;.

The German term corresponds to the broad English category of &quot;Protestant&quot; rather than to the narrower &quot;evangelical movement&quot; (in German called ), a subset of Protestantism distinct from the mainline. English speaking churches such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada likewise retain this use of the term.

==History==

From the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 to the end of the First World War and the collapse of the German Empire, some Protestant churches were state churches. Each (state or regional church) was the official church of one of the states of Germany, while the respective ruler was the church&#x27;s formal head (e.g. the King of Prussia headed the Evangelical Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces as supreme governor), similar to the British monarch&#x27;s role as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.

This changed somewhat with growing religious freedom in the 19th century, especially in the republican states of Bremen, Frankfurt (1857), Lübeck, and Hamburg (1860). The greatest change came after the German Revolution, with the formation of the Weimar Republic and the abdication of the princes of the German states. The system of state churches disappeared with the Weimar Constitution (1919), which brought about disestablishment by the separation of church and state, and there was a desire for the Protestant churches to merge. In fact, a merger was permanently under discussion but never materialised due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation into Lutheran, Reformed, and United and uniting churches.

During the Revolution, when the old church governments lost power, the People&#x27;s Church Union () was formed and advocated unification without respect to theological tradition and also increasing input from laymen. However, the People&#x27;s Church Union quickly split along territorial lines after the churches&#x27; relationship with the new governments improved.

It was realised that one mainstream Protestant church for all of Germany was impossible and that any union would need a federal model. The churches met in Dresden in 1919 and created a plan for federation, and this plan was adopted in 1921 at Stuttgart. Then in 1922 the then 28 territorially defined Protestant churches founded the German Evangelical Church Confederation (, DEK). At the time, the federation was the largest Protestant church federation in Europe with around 40 million members. Because it was a federation of independent bodies, the Church Union&#x27;s work was limited to foreign missions and relations with Protestant churches outside Germany, especially German Protestants in other countries.

In July 1933, the German Evangelical Church (, DEK) was formed under the influence of the German Christians, a pro-Nazi religious movement. They had much influence over the decisions of the first National Synod, via their unambiguous partisanship in successfully backing Ludwig Müller for the office of Reich bishop. He did not manage, however, to prevail over the in the long term. The Confessing Church arose in resistance to the Nazi regime&#x27;s ideology. After the installation of Hanns Kerrl as minister for church matters in a Führer-directive of 16 July 1935 and the foundation of the – in the end not materialising – Protestant Reich Church, the DEK played more or less no further role.
In 1948, freed from the German Christians&#x27; influence, the Lutheran, Reformed (including the German Reformed Church / &quot;Reformierte Kirche&quot;) and United churches came together as the Protestant Church in Germany at the Conference of Eisenach. In 1969, the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and East Berlin broke away from the EKD and formed the League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic (, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the Moravian Herrnhut District. In June 1991, following German reunification, the BEK merged with the EKD.

While the members are no longer state churches, they enjoy constitutional protection as statutory corporations, and they are still called , and some have this term in their official names. A modern English translation, however, would be &quot;regional church&quot;. Apart from some minor changes, the territories of the member churches today reflect Germany&#x27;s political organisation in the year 1848, with regional churches for states or provinces that often no longer exist or whose borders changed since. For example, between 1945 and 1948, the remaining six ecclesiastical provinces (), each territorially comprising one of the Old Prussia provinces, within the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union assumed independence as a consequence of the estrangement among them during the Nazi struggle of the churches. This turned the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union into a mere umbrella, being itself a member of EKD (and the BEK, 1969–1991) but covering some regional church bodies, which were again themselves members of EKD (and the BEK, 1969–1991).

Since 1973, when many Protestant churches in Europe, including the EKD members, concluded the Leuenberg Agreement, also the then 21 EKD members introduced full communion for their parishioners and ministry among each other.

Since also the regional Protestant churches in East Germany had signed the Leuenberg Agreement, thus the then ten members of the Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic practised full communion with the EKD members too. Ordination of women is practised in all 20 member churches with many women having been ordained in recent years. There are also several women serving as bishops. Margot Käßmann, former bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover and Chairperson of the Council of the EKD from 2009 until February 2010, was the first woman to head the EKD. Blessings of same-sex marriages is practised and allowed in 14 of 20 and Blessing of same-sex unions are allowed in all other member churches.
 The EKD opposes abortion in most situations but believes it should remain legal.

The EKD has undergone a split in the 20th century and lost a bulk of its adherents in East Germany due to state atheist policies of the former East German government. After 1990, membership was counted and amounted to around the same number as the Roman Catholic Church. In the 21st century, membership in both the Evangelical Church and the Roman Catholic Church stagnates as more people are becoming religious nones.

A 2019 study estimated that there were 114,000 unreported victims of sexual abuse in the EKD and the Catholic Church in Germany combined. The 95% confidence interval comprises 28,000 to 280,000 victims. According to a study published in 2024, pedophilic members of the EKD have sexually abused at least 9,355 minors since 1946. Putting this figure into context, the coordinator of the study clarified that this number of cases was only the tip of the iceberg. The average age of the victims is 11 years.

==Membership==
Protestantism is the major religion in Northern, Eastern and Middle Germany, with the Reformed branch predominating in the extreme northwest and Lippe, the Lutheran branch in the north and south, and the United branch in Middle and Western Germany. While the majority of Christians in Southern Germany are Catholic, some areas in Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria are predominantly Protestant, e.g. Middle Franconia and the government region of Stuttgart. The vast majority of German Protestants belong to a member church of the EKD. With 20,236,000 members in 2020, around 24.3 percent of all Germans belong to a member church of the EKD. Average church attendance is lower, however, with only around a million people (1.2 % of all Germans) attending a service on Sunday.

The regional Protestant church bodies accept each other as equals, despite denominational differences. No member church runs congregations or churches in the area of another member church, thus preventing competing with each other for parishioners. The only exception is the Evangelical Reformed Church, which combines Reformed congregations within the ambits of usually Lutheran member churches, which themselves do not include the eventual local Reformed congregations. Thus, for example, a Lutheran moving from a place where their parish belongs to a Lutheran member church, would be accepted in their new place of domicile by the locally competent congregation within another member church, even if this church and its local parish are Reformed or of united Protestant confession, with Lutheran being exchangeable with the two other respective Protestant confessions within the EKD. This is due to full altar and pulpit fellowship between all EKD member churches.

In this the ambits of the member churches resemble dioceses of the Anglican or Roman Catholic churches, however, else there is no common hierarchy supervising the member churches, who are legally independent equals with the EKD being their umbrella. Members of congregations within the member churches – like those of parishes within Catholic dioceses and those enrolled in Jewish congregations also enjoying statutory corporation status – are required to pay a church tax, a surcharge on their normal income tax collected by the states of Germany and passed on to the respective religious body.

<text>The Captains Regent (Italian: &quot;Capitani Reggenti&quot;; : &quot;Capitano Reggente&quot;) are the two heads of state of the Republic of San Marino. They are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, the country&#x27;s legislative body. Normally the Regents are chosen from opposing parties and they serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October every year. This tradition dates back at least to 1243.

The practice of dual heads of government (diarchy) is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic, equivalent to the consuls of ancient Rome.
