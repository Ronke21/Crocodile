<text>The Relapse, or, Virtue in Danger is a Restoration comedy from 1696 written by John Vanbrugh. The play is a sequel to Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift, or, The Fool in Fashion&quot;.

In Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, a free-living Restoration rake is brought to repentance and reform by the ruses of his wife, while in &quot;The Relapse&quot;, the rake succumbs again to temptation and has a new love affair. His virtuous wife is also subjected to a determined seduction attempt, and resists with difficulty.

Vanbrugh planned &quot;The Relapse&quot; around particular actors at Drury Lane, writing their stage habits, public reputations, and personal relationships into the text. One such actor was Colley Cibber himself, who played the luxuriant fop Lord Foppington in both &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; and &quot;The Relapse&quot;. However, Vanbrugh&#x27;s artistic plans were threatened by a cutthroat struggle between London&#x27;s two theatre companies, each of which was &quot;seducing&quot; actors from the other. &quot;The Relapse&quot; came close to being not produced at all, but the successful performance that was eventually achieved in November 1696 vindicated Vanbrugh&#x27;s intentions, and saved the company from bankruptcy as well.

Unlike &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, which never again performed after the 1690s, &quot;The Relapse&quot; has retained its audience appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, and the original play was for a century replaced on the stage by Sheridan&#x27;s moralised version &quot;A Trip to Scarborough&quot; (1777). On the modern stage, &quot;The Relapse&quot; has been established as one of the most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh&#x27;s light, throwaway wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington, a burlesque character with a dark side.

==&quot;The Relapse&quot; as sequel==
===Sexual ideology===
&quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; can be seen as an early sign of Cibber&#x27;s sensitivity to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see Colley Cibber). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and gender roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; is one of the first illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber&#x27;s opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of &quot;Fatgoose Living&quot;, has made some early 20th-century critics refer to &quot;The Relapse&quot; as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh&#x27;s play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley&#x27;s &quot;The Country Wife&quot; of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, &quot;The Relapse&quot; contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;: in the climactic scene of Cibber&#x27;s play, Amanda&#x27;s virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of &quot;The Relapse&quot;, it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.

===&quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; plot===
&quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; is the story of a last &quot;shift&quot; or trick that a virtuous wife, Amanda, is driven to reform and retain her rakish husband Loveless. Loveless has been away for ten years, dividing his time between the brothel and the bottle, and no longer recognises his wife when he returns to London. Acting the part of a high-class prostitute, Amanda lures Loveless into her luxurious house and treats him to the night of his dreams, confessing her true identity in the morning. Loveless is so impressed that he immediately reforms. A minor part that was a great hit with the première audience is the fop Sir Novelty Fashion, written by Cibber for himself to play. Sir Novelty flirts with all the women, but is more interested in his own exquisite appearance and witticisms, and Cibber would modestly write in his autobiography 45 years later, &quot;was thought a good portrait of the foppery then in fashion&quot;. Combining daring sex scenes with sentimental reconciliations and Sir Novelty&#x27;s buffoonery, &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; offered something for everybody, and was a great box-office hit.

===&quot;The Relapse&quot; plot===
Vanbrugh&#x27;s &quot;The Relapse&quot; is less sentimental and more analytical than &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, subjecting both the reformed husband and the virtuous wife to fresh temptations, and having them react with more psychological realism. Loveless falls for the vivacious young widow Berinthia, while Amanda barely succeeds in summoning her virtue to reject her admirer Worthy. The three central characters, Amanda, Loveless, and Sir Novelty (ennobled by Vanbrugh into &quot;Lord Foppington&quot;), are the only ones that recur in both plays, the remainder of the &quot;Relapse&quot; characters being new.

In the trickster subplot, young Tom tricks his elder brother Lord Foppington out of his intended bride and her large dowry. This plot takes up nearly half the play and expands the part of Sir Novelty to give more scope for the roaring success of Cibber&#x27;s fop acting. Recycling Cibber&#x27;s merely fashion-conscious fop, Vanbrugh lets him buy himself a title and equips him with enough aplomb and selfishness to weather all humiliations. Although Lord Foppington may be &quot;very industrious to pass for an ass&quot;, as Amanda remarks, he is at bottom &quot;a man who Nature has made no fool&quot; (II.i.148). Literary historians agree in esteeming him &quot;the greatest of all Restoration fops&quot; (Dobrée), &quot;brutal, evil, and smart&quot; (Hume).

==Background: theatre company split==
In the early 1690s, London had only one officially countenanced theatre company, the &quot;United Company&quot;, badly managed and with its takings bled off by predatory investors (&quot;adventurers&quot;). To counter the draining of the company&#x27;s income, the manager Christopher Rich slashed the salaries and traditional perks of his skilled professional actors, antagonising such popular performers as Thomas Betterton, the tragedienne Elizabeth Barry, and the comedian Anne Bracegirdle. Colley Cibber wrote in his autobiography that the owners of the United Company, &quot;who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presumed they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public… were inclined to support.&quot; Betterton and his colleagues set forth the bad finances of the United Company and the plight of the actors in a &quot;Petition of the Players&quot; submitted to the Lord Chamberlain. This unusual document is signed by nine men and six women, all established professional actors, and details a disreputable jumble of secret investments and &quot;farmed&quot; shares, making the case that owner chicanery rather than any failure of audience interest was at the root of the company&#x27;s financial problems. Barely veiled strike threats in the actors&#x27; petition were met with an answering lock-out threat from Rich in a &quot;Reply of the Patentees&quot;, but the burgeoning conflict was pre-empted by a suspension of all play-acting from December until March 1695 on account of Queen Mary&#x27;s illness and death. During this interval, a cooperative actors&#x27; company took shape under the leadership of Betterton and was granted a Royal &quot;licence to act&quot; on 25 March, to the dismay of Rich, who saw the threat too late.

The two companies that emerged from this labour/management conflict are usually known respectively as the &quot;Patent Company&quot; (the no-longer-united United Company) and &quot;Betterton&#x27;s Company&quot;, although Judith Milhous argues that the latter misrepresents the cooperative nature of the actors&#x27; company. In the following period of intense rivalry, the Patent Company was handicapped by a shortage of competent actors. &quot;Seducing&quot; actors (as the legal term was) back and forth between the companies was a key tactic in the ensuing struggle for position, and so were appeals to the Lord Chamberlain to issue injunctions against seductions from the other side, which that functionary was quite willing to do. Later Rich also resorted to hiring amateurs, and to tempting Irish actors over from Dublin. But such measures were not yet in place for the staging of &quot;The Relapse&quot; in 1696, Rich&#x27;s most desperate venture.

==Casting==
Vanbrugh is assumed to have attempted to tailor his play to the talents of particular actors and to what audiences would expect from them, as was normal practice (Holland), but this was exceptionally difficult to accomplish in 1695–96. &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; had been cast from the remnants of the Patent Company—&quot;learners&quot; and &quot;boys and girls&quot;—after the walkout of the stars. Following the surprising success of this young cast, Vanbrugh and Rich had even greater difficulty in retaining the actors needed for &quot;The Relapse&quot;. However, in spite of the continuous emergency in which the &quot;Relapse&quot; production was mounted, most of Vanbrugh&#x27;s original intentions were eventually carried out.

===&quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; cast===

To cast &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; in January 1696, the Patent Company had to make the best use of such actors as remained after the 1694 split (&quot;see cast list right&quot;). An anonymous contemporary pamphlet describes the &quot;despicable condition&quot; the troupe had been reduced to:
The disproportion was so great at parting, that it was almost impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a sufficient number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.
The only well-regarded performers available were the Verbruggens, John and Susanna, who had been re-seduced by Rich from Betterton&#x27;s company. They were of course used in &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, with John playing Loveless, the male lead, and his wife Susanna the flirtatious heiress Narcissa, a secondary character. The rest of the cast consisted of the new and untried (for instance Hildebrand Horden, who had just joined Rich&#x27;s troupe, playing a rakish young lover), the modest and lacklustre (Jane Rogers, playing Amanda, and Mary Kent, playing Sir Novelty&#x27;s mistress Flareit), and the widely disliked (the opportunist Colley Cibber, playing Sir Novelty Fashion); people who had probably never been given the option of joining Betterton. Betterton&#x27;s only rival as male lead, George Powell, had most likely been left behind by the rebels with some relief (Milhous); while Powell was skilled and experienced, he was also notorious for his bad temper and alcoholism. Throughout the &quot;seduction&quot; tug-of-war between Rich and Betterton in 1695–96, Powell remained at Drury Lane, where he was in fact not used for &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, but would instead spectacularly demonstrate his drinking problem at the première of &quot;The Relapse&quot;.

===&quot;The Relapse&quot; cast===

Vanbrugh planned &quot;The Relapse&quot;, too, round these limited casting resources and minor talents, which Peter Holland has argued explains the robust, farcical character of the play; Vanbrugh&#x27;s second comedy, &quot;The Provoked Wife&quot; (1697), written for the better actors of the cooperative company, is a much subtler piece. &quot;The Relapse&quot; was written in six weeks and offered to the Patent Company in March, but because of the problems with contracting and retaining actors, it did not première until November. It is known from Cibber&#x27;s autobiography that Vanbrugh had a decisive say in the ongoing casting changes made during these seven months; it is not known whether he altered his text to accommodate them.

To reinforce the connection with &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling the rest of the large &quot;Relapse&quot; cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.

John Verbruggen was one of the original rebels and had been offered a share in the actors&#x27; company, but became disgruntled when his wife Susanna, a popular comedian, was not. For Rich, it was a stroke of luck to get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John&#x27;s availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when &quot;The Relapse&quot; had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about &quot;his&quot; availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his employment situation, even getting into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void and at the same time order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of &quot;The Relapse&quot;. Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna&#x27;s services were also assured.

The Verbruggens were essential to the play, not least because Vanbrugh had customised the sprightly temptress Berinthia to Susanna&#x27;s talents and reputation for witty, roguish, sexually enterprising characters, most recently Mrs Buxom in Thomas D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (a success thanks to &quot;the extraordinary well acting of Mrs Verbruggen&quot;, wrote D&#x27;Urfey). Although John was less well known, his acting skills were considerable and would flourish after January 1697 in the cooperative company, where commentators even started to compare him with the great Betterton. Verbruggen was considered a more natural, intuitive or &quot;careless&quot; actor, with &quot;a negligent agreeable wildness in his action and his mien, which became him well.&quot; Anthony Aston vividly described Verbruggen as &quot;a little in-kneed, which gave him a shambling gait, which was a carelessness, and became him.&quot; Modern critics do not find the Loveless part very lively or irresistible, but Vanbrugh was able to count on Verbruggen&#x27;s shambling male magnetism and &quot;agreeable wildness&quot; to enrich the character. This would originally have worked even in print, since cast lists were included in the published plays: most 1690s play readers were playgoers also, and aware of the high-profile Verbruggens. Happily married in private life and playing the secret lovers Loveless and Berinthia, the Verbruggens have left traces of their charisma and erotic stage presences in Vanbrugh&#x27;s dialogue. &quot;The Relapse&quot; even alludes to their real-life relationship, in meta-jokes such as Berinthia&#x27;s exclamation, &quot;Well, he is a charming man! I don&#x27;t wonder his wife&#x27;s so fond of him!&quot;

Hildebrand Horden, who had played a &quot;wild&quot; young lover in &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, was the only young, handsome, potential romantic lead Rich had. He was presumably cast by Vanbrugh as Tom Fashion, Lord Foppington&#x27;s clever younger brother (Holland), and it was a blow to the Patent Company when he was killed in a tavern brawl (more glamorously referred to as a &quot;duel&quot; in older sources) in May. At the première in November, Tom Fashion was instead played as a breeches role by Mary Kent, an unusual piece of emergency casting that puts a different face on a uniquely frank homosexual scene where Tom keeps skipping nimbly out of the way of the matchmaker Coupler&#x27;s lecherous groping.

Colley Cibber was a rather unsuccessful young actor at the time of the split, with a squeaky voice and without any of the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton&#x27;s company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of &quot;The Relapse&quot; could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber&#x27;s performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh&#x27;s Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh&#x27;s play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber&#x27;s by all accounts inspired performance in &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;. Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh&#x27;s best-known character.

Vanbrugh&#x27;s preface to the first edition preserves a single fleeting concrete detail about the première performance: George Powell was drunk. He played Amanda&#x27;s worldly and sophisticated admirer Worthy, the &quot;fine gentleman of the play&quot;, and apparently brought an unintended hands-on realism to his supposedly suave seduction attempt:

One word more about the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, but it was not my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, drinking his mistress&#x27;s health in Nantes brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.

==Stage history==

The desperate straits of the United Company, and the success of &quot;The Relapse&quot; in saving it from collapse, are attested in a private letter from 19 November 1696: &quot;The other house [Drury Lane] has no company at all, and unless a new play comes out on Saturday revives their reputation, they must break.&quot; The new play is assumed to have been &quot;The Relapse&quot;, and it turned out the success Rich needed. &quot;This play&quot;, notes Colley Cibber in his autobiography, &quot;from its new and easy turn of wit, had great success, and gave me, as a comedian, a second flight of reputation along with it.&quot; Charles Gildon summarises: &quot;This play was received with mighty applause.&quot;

&quot;The Relapse&quot; is singled out for particular censure in the Puritan clergyman Jeremy Collier&#x27;s anti-theatre pamphlet &quot;Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage&quot; (1698), which attacks its lack of poetic justice and moral sentiment. Worthy and Berinthia, complains Collier, are allowed to enact their wiles against the Lovelesses&#x27; married virtue without being punished or losing face. The subplot is an even worse offence against religion and morality, as it positively rewards vice, allowing the trickster hero Tom to keep the girl, her dowry, and his own bad character to the end. Vanbrugh failed to take &quot;Short View&quot; seriously and published a joking reply, but Collier&#x27;s censure was to colour the perception of the play for centuries. While it remained a popular stage piece through the 18th century, much praised and enjoyed for its wit, attitudes to its casual sexual morality became increasingly ambivalent as public opinion became ever more restrictive in this area, and more at odds with the permissive ethos of Restoration comedy. From 1777 Vanbrugh&#x27;s original was replaced on the stage by Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;A Trip to Scarborough&quot;, a close adaptation but with some &quot;covering&quot;, as the prologue explains, drawn over Vanbrugh&#x27;s &quot;too bare&quot; wit:

:As change thus circulates throughout the nation,
:Some plays may justly call for alteration;
:At least to draw some slender covering o&#x27;er,
:That graceless wit which was too bare before.

Sheridan does not allow Loveless and Berinthia to consummate their relationship, and he withdraws approval from Amanda&#x27;s admirer Worthy by renaming him &quot;Townly&quot;. Some frank quips are silently deleted, and the matchmaker Coupler with the lecherous interest in Tom becomes decorous Mrs Coupler. A small-scale but notable loss is of much of the graphic language of Hoyden&#x27;s nurse, who is earthy in Vanbrugh&#x27;s original, genteel in Sheridan. However, Sheridan had an appreciation of Vanbrugh&#x27;s style, and retained most of the original text unaltered.

In the 19th century, &quot;A Trip to Scarborough&quot; remained the standard version, and there were also some ad hoc adaptations that sidelined the Lovelesses&#x27; drawing-room comedy in favour of the Lord Foppington/Hoyden plot with its caricatured clashes between exquisite fop and pitchfork-wielding country bumpkins. &quot;The Man of Quality&quot; (1870) was one such robust production, &quot;Miss Tomboy&quot; (1890) another. Vanbrugh&#x27;s original &quot;Relapse&quot; was staged once, in 1846, at the Olympic Theatre in London.

During the first half of the 20th century &quot;The Relapse&quot; was relatively neglected, along with other Restoration drama, and experts are uncertain about exactly when Vanbrugh&#x27;s original again resurged to prominence on the stage and thereby marginalised Sheridan&#x27;s version. These experts now believe the play may have been first brilliantly rehabilitated by Anthony Quayle&#x27;s 1947 production at the Phoenix Theatre, starring Cyril Ritchard as Lord Foppington and brought to Broadway by Ritchard in 1950. A musical version, &quot;Virtue in Danger&quot; (1963), by Paul Dehn with music by James Bernard, opened to mixed reviews. John Russell Taylor in &quot;Plays and Players&quot; praised the cast, which included Patricia Routledge as Berinthia and John Moffatt as Lord Foppington, but complained that the production was &quot;full of the simpering, posturing and sniggering which usually stand in for style and sophistication in Restoration revivals.&quot; Following Donald Sinden&#x27;s outstanding and award-winning performance at the Aldwych Theatre in the mid-1960s Vanbrugh&#x27;s original play is now again a favourite of the stage. A 2001 revival by Trevor Nunn at the National Theatre was described by Sheridan Morley as &quot;rare, loving and brilliantly cast.&quot; As so often with commentary on &quot;The Relapse&quot;, Morley focused on the role of Lord Foppington and its different interpretations: &quot;Alex Jennings superbly inherits the role of Lord Foppington which for 20 years or so belonged to Donald Sinden, and for another 20 before that to Cyril Ritchard.&quot;

&quot;Restoration Comedy&quot;, a play by Amy Freed that draws on both &quot;The Relapse&quot; and its predecessor, Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot;, premiered at Seattle Repertory Theatre in 2005, starring Stephen Caffrey as Loveless, Caralyn Kozlowski as Amanda, and Jonathan Freeman as Lord Foppington, and directed by Sharon Ott.

<text>Agroecosystems are the ecosystems supporting the food production systems in farms and gardens. As the name implies, at the core of an agroecosystem lies the human activity of agriculture. As such they are the basic unit of study in Agroecology, and Regenerative Agriculture using ecological approaches.

Like other ecosystems, agroecosystems form partially closed systems in which animals, plants, microbes, and other living organisms and their environment are interdependent and regularly interact. They are somewhat arbitrarily defined as a spatially and functionally coherent unit of agricultural activity.

An agroecosystem can be seen as not restricted to the immediate site of agricultural activity (e.g. the farm). That is, it includes the region that is impacted by this activity, usually by changes to the complexity of species assemblages and energy flows, as well as to the net nutrient balance. Agroecosystems, particularly those managed intensively, are characterized as having simpler species composition, energy and nutrient flows than &quot;natural&quot; ecosystems. Likewise, agroecosystems are often associated with elevated nutrient input, much of which exits the farm leading to eutrophication of connected ecosystems not directly engaged in agriculture.

==Utilization==
Forest gardens are probably the world&#x27;s oldest and most resilient agroecosystem.

Some major organizations are hailing farming within agroecosystems as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the International Water Management Institute and the United Nations Environment Programme, there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests, as well addressing inequities that sometimes result when such measures are adopted, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.

One of the major efforts of disciplines such as agroecology is to promote management styles that blur the distinction between agroecosystems and &quot;natural&quot; ecosystems, both by decreasing the impact of agriculture (increasing the biological and trophic complexity of the agricultural system as well as decreasing the nutrient inputs/outflow) and by increasing awareness that &quot;downstream&quot; effects extend agroecosystems beyond the boundaries of the farm (e.g. the Corn Belt agroecosystem includes the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico). In the first case, polyculture or buffer strips for wildlife habitat can restore some complexity to a cropping system, while organic farming can reduce nutrient inputs. Efforts of the second type are most common at the watershed scale. An example is the National Association of Conservation Districts&#x27; Lake Mendota Watershed Project, which seeks to reduce runoff from the agricultural lands feeding into the lake with the aim of reducing algal blooms.

<text>The French colonial empire () comprised the overseas colonies, protectorates, and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the &quot;First French colonial empire&quot;, that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the &quot;Second French colonial empire&quot;, which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. On the eve of World War I, France&#x27;s colonial empire was the second-largest in the world after the British Empire.

France began to establish colonies in the Americas, the Caribbean, and India in the 16th century but lost most of its possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The North American possessions were lost to Britain and Spain, but Spain later returned Louisiana to France in 1800. The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803. France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly in Africa as well as Indochina and the South Pacific. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the metropole, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Especially after the disastrous Franco-Prussian War, which saw Germany become the leading economic and military power of the continent of Europe. Acquiring colonies and rebuilding an empire was seen as a way to restore French prestige in the world. It was also to provide manpower during the world wars.

A major goal was the or &quot;Civilizing Mission&quot;. In 1884, the leading proponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry, declared: &quot;The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior races.&quot; Full citizenship rights – – were offered, although in reality &quot;assimilation was always receding [and] the colonial populations treated like subjects not citizens.&quot; France sent small numbers of settlers to its empire, with the notable exception of Algeria, where the French settlers took power while being a minority.

In World War II, Charles de Gaulle and the Free French took control of the overseas colonies one-by-one and used them as a base from which they prepared to liberate France. Historian Tony Chafer argues that: &quot;In an effort to restore its world-power status after the humiliation of defeat and occupation, France was eager to maintain its overseas empire at the end of the Second World War.&quot; However, after 1945, anti-colonial movements began to challenge European authority. Revolts in Indochina and Algeria proved costly and France lost both colonies. After these conflicts, a relatively peaceful decolonization took place elsewhere after 1960. The French Constitution of 27 October 1946 (Fourth French Republic) established the French Union, which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as overseas departments and territories within the French Republic. These now total altogether 119,394 km2 (46,098 sq. miles), with 2.8 million people in 2021. Links between France and its former colonies persist through La francophonie, the CFA franc, and joint military operations such as Operation Serval.

== First French colonial empire (16th century to 1814) ==
=== The Americas ===


During the 16th century, the French colonization of the Americas began. Excursions of Giovanni da Verrazzano and Jacques Cartier in the early 16th century, as well as the frequent voyages of French boats and fishermen to the Grand Banks off Newfoundland throughout that century, were the precursors to the story of France&#x27;s colonial expansion. But Spain&#x27;s defense of its American monopoly, and the further distractions caused in France itself in the later 16th century by the French Wars of Religion, prevented any constant efforts by France to settle colonies. Early French attempts to found colonies in Brazil, in 1555 at Rio de Janeiro (&quot;France Antarctique&quot;) and in Florida (including Fort Caroline in 1562), and in 1612 at São Luís (&quot;France Équinoxiale&quot;), were not successful, due to a lack of official interest and to Portuguese and Spanish vigilance.

The story of France&#x27;s colonial empire truly began on 27 July 1605, with the foundation of Port Royal in the colony of Acadia in North America, in what is now Nova Scotia, Canada. A few years later, in 1608, Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec, which was to become the capital of the enormous, but sparsely settled, fur-trading colony of New France (also called Canada).

New France had a rather small population, which resulted from more emphasis being placed on the fur trade rather than agricultural settlements. Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.

Through alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent. Areas of French settlement were generally limited to the St. Lawrence River Valley. Prior to the establishment of the 1663 Sovereign Council, the territories of New France were developed as mercantile colonies. It is only after the arrival of intendant Jean Talon in 1665 that France gave its American colonies the proper means to develop population colonies comparable to that of the British. Acadia itself was lost to the British in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Back in France, there was relatively little interest in colonialism, which concentrated rather on dominance within Europe, and for most of its history, New France was far behind the British North American colonies in both population and economic development.

In 1699, French territorial claims in North America expanded still further, with the foundation of Louisiana in the basin of the Mississippi River. The extensive trading network throughout the region connected to Canada through the Great Lakes, was maintained through a vast system of fortifications, many of them centred in the Illinois Country and in present-day Arkansas.

As the French empire in North America grew, the French also began to build a smaller but more profitable empire in the West Indies. Settlement along the South American coast in what is today French Guiana began in 1624, and a colony was founded on Saint Kitts in 1625 (the island had to be shared with the English until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, when it was ceded outright). The current isle of the Commonwealth of Dominica in the eastern Caribbean also fell under increasing French settlement from the early 1630s. The &quot;Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique&quot; founded colonies in Guadeloupe and Martinique in 1635, and a colony was later founded on Saint Lucia by (1650). The food-producing plantations of these colonies were built and sustained through slavery, with the supply of slaves dependent on the African slave trade. Local resistance by the indigenous peoples resulted in the Carib Expulsion of 1660. France&#x27;s most important Caribbean colonial possession was established in 1664, when the colony of Saint-Domingue (today&#x27;s Haiti) was founded on the western half of the Spanish island of Hispaniola. In the 18th century, Saint-Domingue grew to be the richest sugar colony in the Caribbean. The eastern half of Hispaniola (today&#x27;s Dominican Republic) also came under French rule for a short period, after being given to France by Spain in 1795.

=== Asia ===

With the end of the French Wars of Religion, in 1598, King Henry IV encouraged various enterprises to establish trade with the Africa and Asia due to their relations at the time. In December 1600, a company was formed through the association of Saint-Malo, Laval, and Vitré to trade with the Moluccas and Japan. Two ships, the &quot;Croissant&quot; and the &quot;Corbin&quot;, were sent around the Cape of Good Hope in May 1601. One was wrecked in the Maldives, leading to the adventure of François Pyrard de Laval, who managed to return to France in 1611. The second ship, carrying François Martin de Vitré, reached Ceylon and traded with Aceh in Sumatra, but was captured by the Dutch on the return leg at Cape Finisterre. François Martin de Vitré was the first Frenchman to write an account of travels to the Far East in 1604, at the request of Henry IV, and from that time numerous accounts on Asia would be published.

From 1604 to 1609, following the return of François Martin de Vitré, Henry developed a strong enthusiasm for travel to Asia and attempted to set up a French East India Company on the model of England and the Netherlands. On 1 June 1604, he issued letters patent to Dieppe merchants to form the first French East Indies Company, giving them exclusive rights to Asian trade for 15 years. No ships were sent, however, until 1616. In 1609, another adventurer, Pierre-Olivier Malherbe, returned from a circumnavigation of the globe and informed Henry of his adventures. He had visited China and India and had an encounter with Akbar.

Colonies were established in India&#x27;s Chandernagore (1673) and Pondichéry in the south east (1674), and later at Yanam (1723), Mahe (1725), and Karikal (1739) (see French India).

In 1664, the French East India Company was established to compete for trade in the east.

=== Africa ===
Although initial French colonization primarily occurred in the Americas and in Asia, the French did establish a few colonies and trading posts on the African continent. Initial French colonization in Africa began in modern-day Senegal, Madagascar, and along the Mascarene Islands. Initial French colonial projects, partially administered by the French East India Company, prioritized plantation economies and slave labor. These economies were based on monoculture agriculture and forced African labor. Poor living conditions, famines, and disease made enslaved labor conditions particularly lethal across French colonies. French presence in Senegal began in 1626, although formal colonies and trading posts were not established until 1659 with the founding of Saint-Louis, and 1677 with the founding of Gorée. Additionally, the first settlement of Madagascar began in 1642 with the establishment of Fort Dauphin.

Initial French colonial expansion in Senegal and Madagascar was primarily motivated by desires to secure access to natural resources including gum arabic, groundnuts (or peanuts) and other raw materials. In addition they were further motivated by desires throughout the 17th and 19th century to secure access to and to control the slave trade. Through an emphasis on controlling seaports, the French sought to forcibly extract enslaved people to send them abroad for profit.

Colonial development prioritized export oriented production while local industry remained very underdeveloped. There was high development of production for export oriented production, notably of ground nuts in Senegal. In additional coastal areas, the French set up slave plantations. Initial French development prioritized the building of roads to connect natural resources to harbors and ports.

Additional initial French settlements were established on the Mascarene Islands which include Reunion Island, Mauritius, and Rodrigues. Reunion Island was first settled in 1642 and was administered by the French East India Company starting in 1665.

After initial settlement by the Netherlands, France took control of Mauritius, which it renamed the Island of France in 1721. Furthermore, France took control of Rodrigues in 1735 and Seychelles in 1756.

On Reunion Island (Bourbon Island), the French East India Company first introduced the slave trade in the 1730s. The French East India Company additionally introduced coffee and sought to create a plantation economy centered around forced labor.

Characteristic of plantation colonies, the French colonists were a minority on Reunion Island. In 1763 there were only 4,000 French colonists while there were over 18,000 African enslaved people. The majority of enslaved people on Reunion Island worked on coffee plantations. They primarily came from Madagascar, Mozambique, and Senegal.

The economy of the Mauritius (Island of France) was similarly based on an exploitative plantation system dependent on forced African labor. The monoculture plantations farmed sugar cane, cotton, indigo, rice, and wheat. Around 2,000 colonists and enslaved people from Reunion Island migrated to Mauritius.

Conditions for enslaved people on the Mascarene Island plantations were very poor. Enslaved labor was highly lethal because of poor living conditions and famines. After a series of crop failures from 1725 to 1737, as much as 10% of the islands&#x27; enslaved populations died due to famine and disease.

=== Collapse of First French colonial empire ===

==== Colonial conflict with Britain ====


In the middle of the 18th century, a series of colonial conflicts began between France and Britain, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of most of the first French colonial empire and the near-complete expulsion of France from the Americas. These wars were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), the American Revolution (1775–1783), the French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the French and Indian Wars. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the Second Hundred Years&#x27; War.

Although the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive – despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General Joseph François Dupleix and Europe under Marshal Saxe – the Seven Years&#x27; War, after early French successes in Menorca and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only New France (excluding the small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon), but also most of France&#x27;s West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the French Indian outposts.

While the peace treaty saw France&#x27;s Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost – most of New France was taken by Britain (also referred to as British North America), except Louisiana, which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain&#x27;s late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain&#x27;s annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were Grenada and Saint Lucia in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.

Some recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the French intervention in the American Revolution, with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention.

==== Haitian Revolution ====

True disaster came to what remained of France&#x27;s colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola), France&#x27;s richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island&#x27;s elite, which had resulted from the French Revolution of 1789.

The slaves, led eventually by Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, held their own against French and British opponents. The French launched a failed expedition in 1802, and were up against a crippling Royal Naval blockade the following year. As a result, the Empire of Haiti ultimately achieved independence in 1804 (becoming the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847). The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804. About 80,000 Haitians died in the 1802–03 campaign alone. Of the 55,131 French soldiers dispatched to Haiti in 1802–03, 45,000, including 18 generals, died, along with 10,000 sailors, the great majority from disease. Captain [first name unknown] Sorrell of the British navy observed, &quot;France lost there one of the finest armies she ever sent forth, composed of picked veterans, the conquerors of Italy and of German legions. She is now entirely deprived of her influence and her power in the West Indies.&quot;

Meanwhile, France&#x27;s newly resumed war with Britain resulted in the British capture of practically all remaining French colonies. These were restored at the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, but when war resumed in 1803, the British soon recaptured them. France&#x27;s 1800 recovery of Louisiana from Spain in the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso came to nothing, as the success of the Haitian Revolution convinced Napoleon that holding Louisiana would not be worth the cost, leading to its sale to the United States in 1803.

==== Failed invasion of Egypt ====
The French attempt to establish a colony in Egypt in 1798–1801 was not successful. Battle casualties for the campaign were at least 15,000 killed or wounded and 8,500 prisoners for France; 50,000 killed or wounded and 15,000 prisoners for Turkey, Egypt, other Ottoman lands, and Britain.

== Second French colonial empire (post-1830) ==

At the close of the Napoleonic Wars, most of France&#x27;s colonies were restored to it by Britain, notably Guadeloupe and Martinique in the West Indies, French Guiana on the coast of South America, various trading posts in Senegal, the &quot;Île Bourbon&quot; (Réunion) in the Indian Ocean, and France&#x27;s tiny Indian possessions; however, Britain finally annexed Saint Lucia, Tobago, the Seychelles, and the &quot;Isle de France&quot; (now Mauritius).

In 1825 Charles X sent an expedition to Haïti, resulting in the Haiti indemnity controversy.

The beginnings of the second French colonial empire were laid in 1830 with the French invasion of Algeria, which was fully conquered by 1903. Historian Ben Kiernan estimates that 825,000 Algerians died during the conquest by 1875.

=== Africa ===

==== Morocco ====
The French Colonial Empire established a protectorate in Morocco between the years of 1912 to 1956. France&#x27;s general approach to governing the protectorate of Morocco was a policy of in-direct rule where they co-opted existing governance systems to control the protectorate. Specifically, the Moroccan elite and Sultan were both left in control while being strongly influenced by the French government.

French colonialism in Morocco was discriminatory against native Moroccans and highly detrimental to the Moroccan economy. Moroccans were treated as second class citizens and discriminated against in all aspects of colonial life. Infrastructure was discriminatory in colonial Morocco. The French colonial government built 36.5 kilometers of sewers in the new neighborhoods created to accommodate new French settlers while only 4.3 kilometers of sewers were built in indigenous Moroccan communities. Additionally, land in Morocco was far more expensive for Moroccans than for French settlers. For example, while the average Moroccan had a plot of land 50 times smaller than their French settler counterparts, Moroccans were forced to pay 24% more per hectare. Moroccans were additionally prohibited from buying land from French settlers.

Colonial Morocco&#x27;s economy was designed to benefit French businesses at the detriment of Moroccan laborers. Morocco was forced to import all of its goods from France despite higher costs. Additionally, improvements to agriculture and irrigation systems in Morocco exclusively benefited colonial agriculturalists while leaving Moroccan farms at a technological disadvantage. 

Between the years of 1914 to 1921 the Zaian Confederation of Berber Tribes, primarily from the Atlas Mountain region of Morocco, staged an armed resistance against French colonial control. The outbreak of World War One prevented the French from committing fully to the conflict, and thus the French forces suffered high losses. For example, at the Battle of El Herri in 1914, 600 French soldiers were killed. The fighting was primarily characterized by Guerrilla warfare. The Zaian forces additionally received military and economic support from the Central Powers.

The Berber independence leader Abd el-Krim (1882–1963) organized armed resistance against the Spanish and French for control of Morocco. The Spanish had faced unrest off and on from the 1890s, but in 1921 Spanish forces were massacred at the Battle of Annual. El-Krim founded an independent Rif Republic that operated until 1926 but had no international recognition. Paris and Madrid agreed to collaborate to destroy it. They sent in 200,000 soldiers, forcing el-Krim to surrender in 1926; he was exiled in the Pacific until 1947. Morocco became quiet, and in 1936 became the base from which Francisco Franco launched his revolt against Madrid.

==== Tunisia ====
The French protectorate of Tunisia lasted from 1881 to 1956. The protectorate was initially established after the successful invasion of Tunisia in 1881. The groundwork for occupation was laid on April 24, 1881, when the French deployed 35,000 troops from Algeria to invade several Tunisian cities.

As in Morocco, the French governed indirectly and preserved the existing government structure. The bey remained an absolute monarch, Tunisian ministers were still appointed, although they were both subject to French authority. Over time, the French gradually weakened the existing structures of power and centralized power into a French colonial administration.

==== French West Africa ====
French West Africa was a confederation of eight other French colonial territories including French Mauritania, French Senegal, French Guinea, French Ivory Coast, French Niger, French Upper Volta, French Dahomey, French Togoland, and French Sudan.

At the beginning of Napoleon III&#x27;s reign, the presence of France in Senegal was limited to a trading post on the island of Gorée, a narrow strip on the coast, the town of Saint-Louis, and a handful of trading posts in the interior. The economy had largely been based on the slave trade, carried out by the rulers of the small kingdoms of the interior, as well as elite families, until France abolished slavery in its colonies in 1848. In 1854, Napoleon III named an enterprising French officer, Louis Faidherbe, to govern and expand the colony, and to give it the beginning of a modern economy. Faidherbe built a series of forts along the Senegal River, formed alliances with leaders in the interior, and sent expeditions against those who resisted French rule. He built a new port at Dakar, established and protected telegraph lines and roads, followed these with a rail line between Dakar and Saint-Louis and another into the interior. He built schools, bridges, and systems to supply fresh water to the towns. He also introduced the large-scale cultivation of Bambara groundnuts and peanuts as a commercial crop. Reaching into the Niger valley, Senegal became the primary French base in West Africa and a model colony. Dakar became one of the most important cities of the French Empire and of Africa.

==== French Equatorial Africa ====
French Equatorial Africa was a confederation of French colonial possessions in the Sahel and Congo River regions of Africa. Colonies included in French Equatorial Africa include French Gabon, French Congo, Ubangui-Shari, and French Chad.

==== Cameroon ====
Cameroon was initially colonized by the German Empire in 1884. The indigenous people of Cameroon refused to work on German related projects, which turned into force labor. However, after World War One, the colony was partitioned by France and Britain. The French colony lasted from 1916 to until self-rule was achieved in 1960.

==== Madagascar ====

French colonialism in Madagascar began in 1896 when France established a protectorate by force and ended in the 1960s with the beginning of self-rule. Under French control, the colony of Madagascar included the dependencies of Comoros, Mayotte, Réunion, Kerguelen, Île Saint-Paul, Amsterdam Island, Crozet Islands, Bassas da India, Europa Island, Juan de Nova Island, Glorioso Islands, and Tromelin.

==== Algeria ====
The French conquest of Algeria began in 1830 with the invasion of Algiers, and was mostly completed by 1852. Not until 1903 was the conquest fully complete. French colonization of Algeria was undertaken through military conquest and the overthrow of existing structures of government. French colonial rule lasted until Algerian independence in 1962. French colonization of Algeria was defined by its lethality for indigenous Algerians, the dissolution of the Algerian government, and the creation of oppressive and segregationist structures which discriminated against the indigenous population.

The French military invasion of Algeria began in 1830 with a naval blockade around Algeria followed by the landing of 37,000 French soldiers in Algeria. The French captured the strategic port of Algiers in 1830 deposing Hussein Dey, the ruler of the Deylik of Algiers. They also seized other coastal communities. Around 100,000 French soldiers were deployed in the conquest of Algeria. Algerian armed resistance against the French invasion was mainly divided between forces of Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Chérif at Constantine in the east, who was seeking to reinstate the Deylik of Algiers, and nationalist forces in the west and center. Treaties with the nationalists under Emir Abdelkader enabled the French to focus on the defeating of the remnants of the Deylik during the 1837 Siege of Constantine. Abdelkader continued to fight the French in the west until 1847. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Algerians, out of a total of 3 million, were killed during the French conquest as a result of war, massacres, disease and famine. Famines and disease epidemics were partially caused by French confiscation of farmland from Algerians and the &quot;scorched earth&quot; tactics of razing farms and villages to quell Algerian resistance. French losses from 1830 to 1851 were 3,336 killed in action and 92,329 dead in the hospital.

There were about 100,000 European settlers in the country in 1852, at that time, about half of them French. Under the Second Republic the country was ruled by a civilian government, but Louis Napoleon re-established a military government, much to the annoyance of the colonists. By 1857 the army had conquered Kabyle Province, and pacified the country. By 1860 the European population had grown to 200,000, and lands of native Algerians were being rapidly bought and farmed by the new arrivals.

In the first eight years of his rule Napoleon III paid little attention to Algeria. In September 1860, however, he and Empress Eugénie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eugénie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. In February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: &quot;Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.&quot; He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.

Compared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians. He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader Abd al Qadir (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious Sharia courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.

More importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.

His attempted reforms were interrupted in 1864 by an Arab insurrection, which required more than a year and an army of 85,000 soldiers to suppress. Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle in 1866 and 1868, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, drought and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign. Up to 500,000 people died from the famine and epidemics.

In 1871, in response to prolonged famine and the French authorities&#x27; discriminatory treatment of Algerians, the Mokrani Revolt in the Kabylia erupted, which spread through much of Algeria. By April 1871, 250 tribes were rebelling. The uprising was defeated in 1872. There were roughly 130,000 colonists in Algeria in 1871 and by 1900, there were one million. In 1902, a French military expedition entered Hoggar Mountains and defeated the kingdom of Kel Ahaggar. The conquest of Algeria was fully completed in 1903 with the French in control of all Saharan lands in Algeria.

====Summary of additional colonization in Africa====

France also extended its influence in North Africa after 1870, establishing a protectorate in Tunisia in 1881 with the Bardo Treaty. Gradually, French control crystallised over much of North, West, and Central Africa by around the start of the 20th century (including the modern states of Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast, Benin, Niger, Chad, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, the east African coastal enclave of Djibouti (Obock Territory), and the island of Madagascar.

Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza helped to formalise French control in Gabon and on the northern banks of the Congo River from the early 1880s. The explorer Colonel Parfait-Louis Monteil traveled from Senegal to Lake Chad in 1890–1892, signing treaties of friendship and protection with the rulers of several of the countries he passed through, and gaining much knowledge of the geography and politics of the region.

The Voulet–Chanoine Mission, a military expedition, set out from Senegal in 1898 to conquer the Chad Basin and to unify all French territories in West Africa. This expedition operated jointly with two other expeditions, the Foureau–Lamy and Gentil Missions, which advanced from Algeria and Middle Congo respectively. With the death (April 1900) of the Muslim warlord Rabih az-Zubayr, the greatest ruler in the region, and the creation of the Military Territory of Chad (September 1900), the Voulet–Chanoine Mission had accomplished all its goals. The ruthlessness of the mission provoked a scandal in Paris.

As a part of the Scramble for Africa, France aimed to establish a continuous west–east axis across the continent, in contrast with the proposed British north–south axis. Tensions between Britain and France heightened in Africa. At several points war seemed possible, but no outbreak occurred. The most serious episode was the Fashoda Incident of 1898. French troops tried to claim an area in the Southern Sudan, and a British force purporting to act in the interests of the Khedive of Egypt arrived to confront them. Under heavy pressure, the French withdrew, implicitly acknowledging Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. An agreement between the two states recognised the &quot;status quo&quot;. The British were to maintain control over Egypt, while France remained the dominant power in Morocco. Still, it is commonly believed that France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.

During the Agadir Crisis in 1911, Britain supported France against Germany, and Morocco became a French protectorate.

The French made their last major colonial gains after World War I, when they gained mandates over the former territories of the Ottoman Empire that make up what is now Syria and Lebanon, as well as most of the former German colonies of Togo and Cameroon.

=== Pacific Islands ===

In 1838, the French naval commander Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars responded to complaints of the mistreatment of French Catholic missionary in the Kingdom of Tahiti ruled by Queen Pōmare IV. Dupetit Thouars forced the native government to pay an indemnity and sign a treaty of friendship with France respecting the rights of French subjects in the islands including any future Catholic missionaries. Four years later, claiming the Tahitians had violated the treaty, a French protectorate was forcibly installed and the queen made to sign a request for French protection.

Queen Pōmare left her kingdom and exiled herself to Raiatea in protest against the French and tried to enlist the help of Queen Victoria. The Franco-Tahitian War broke out between the Tahitian people and the French from 1844 to 1847 as France attempted to consolidate their rule and extend their rule into the Leeward Islands where Queen Pōmare sought refuge with her relatives. The British remained officially neutral during the war but diplomatic tensions existed between the French and British. The French succeeded in subduing the guerilla forces on Tahiti but failed to hold the other islands. In February 1847, Queen Pōmare IV returned from her self-imposed exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate. Although victorious, the French were not able to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency Moorea continued to be ruled under the protectorate. A clause to the war settlement, known as the Jarnac Convention or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847, was signed by France and Great Britain, in which the two powers agreed to respect the independence of Queen Pōmare&#x27;s allies in Leeward Islands. The French continued the guise of protection until the 1880s when they formally annexed Tahiti with the abdication of King Pōmare V on 29 June 1880. The Leeward Islands were annexed through the Leewards War which ended in 1897. These conflicts and the annexation of other Pacific islands formed French Oceania.

On 24 September 1853, Admiral Febvrier Despointes took formal possession of New Caledonia and Port-de-France (Nouméa) was founded 25 June 1854. A few dozen free settlers settled on the west coast in the following years, but New Caledonia became a penal colony and, from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897, about 22,000 criminals and political prisoners were sent to New Caledonia.
In contravention of the Jarnac Convention of 1847, the French placed the Leeward Islands under a provisional protectorate by falsely convincing the ruling chiefs that the German Empire planned to take over their island kingdoms. After years of diplomatic negotiation, Britain and France agreed to abrogate the convention in 1887 and the French formally annexed all the Leeward Islands without official treaties of cession from the islands&#x27; sovereign governments. From 1888 to 1897, the natives of the kingdom of Raiatea and Tahaa led by a minor chief, Teraupo&#x27;o, fought off French rule and the annexation of the Leeward Islands. Anti-French factions in the kingdom of Huahine also attempted to fight off the French under Queen Teuhe while the kingdom of Bora Bora remained neutral but hostile to the French. The conflict ended in 1897 with the capture and exile of rebel leaders to New Caledonia and more than one hundred rebels to the Marquesas. These conflicts and the annexation of other Pacific islands formed French Polynesia.

At this time, the French also established colonies in the South Pacific, including New Caledonia, the various island groups which make up French Polynesia (including the Society Islands, the Marquesas, the Gambier Islands, the Austral Islands and the Tuamotus), and established joint control of the New Hebrides with Britain.

====Napoleon III: 1852–1870====

Napoleon III doubled the area of the French overseas Empire; he established French rule in New Caledonia, and Cochinchina, established a protectorate in Cambodia (1863); and colonized parts of Africa.

To carry out his new overseas projects, Napoleon III created a new Ministry of the Navy and the Colonies and appointed an energetic minister, Prosper, Marquis of Chasseloup-Laubat, to head it. A key part of the enterprise was the modernization of the French Navy; he began the construction of 15 powerful new battle cruisers powered by steam and driven by propellers; and a fleet of steam-powered troop transports. The French Navy became the second most powerful in the world, after Britain&#x27;s. He also created a new force of colonial troops, including elite units of naval infantry, Zouaves, the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique, and Algerian sharpshooters, and he expanded the Foreign Legion, which had been founded in 1831 and won fame in the Crimea, Italy and Mexico. By the end of Napoleon III&#x27;s reign, the French overseas territories had tripled in the area; in 1870 they covered a , with more than 5 million inhabitants.

=== Asia ===

Napoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.

French missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest Alexandre de Rhodes opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the Nguyen dynasty felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under Charles Rigault de Genouilly, to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of Da Nang, and then in February 1859 moved south and captured Saigon. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in Annam and Tonkin, and all of Cochinchina became a French territory in 1864.

In 1863, the ruler of Cambodia, King Norodom, who had been placed in power by the government of Thailand, rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai king granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of Laos, which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.
It was only after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 and the founding of the Third Republic (1871–1940) that most of France&#x27;s later colonial possessions were acquired. From their base in Cochinchina, the French took over Tonkin (in modern northern Vietnam) and Annam (in modern central Vietnam) and made them become French protectorates with the Treaty of Hue between France and Vietnam&#x27;s Nguyen dynasty in 1883. These, together with Cambodia and Cochinchina, formed French Indochina in 1887 (to which Laos was added in 1893 and Guangzhouwanin 1900).

In 1849, the French Concession in Shanghai was established, and in 1860, the French Concession in Tientsin (now called Tianjin) was set up. Both concessions lasted until 1946. The French also had smaller concessions in Guangzhou and Hankou (now part of Wuhan).

The Third Anglo-Burmese War, in which Britain conquered and annexed the hitherto independent Upper Burma, was in part motivated by British apprehension at France advancing and gaining possession of territories near to Burma.

=== Middle East ===
In the spring of 1860, a war broke out in Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire, between the Druze population and the Maronite Christians. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring Syria, with the massacre of many Christians. In Damascus, the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Louis Napoleon&#x27;s dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.

Despite the signing of the 1860 Cobden–Chevalier Treaty, a historic free trade agreement between Britain and France, and the joint operations conducted by France and Britain in the Crimea, China and Mexico, diplomatic relations between Britain and France never became close during the colonial era. Lord Palmerston, the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and prime minister from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France. In 1859 there were even briefly fears that France might try to invade Britain. Palmerston was suspicious of France&#x27;s interventions in Lebanon, Southeast Asia and Mexico. Palmerston was also concerned that France might intervene in the American Civil War (1861–65) on the side of the South. The British also felt threatened by the construction of the Suez Canal (1859–1869) by Ferdinand de Lesseps in Egypt. They tried to oppose its completion by diplomatic pressures and by promoting revolts among workers.

The Suez Canal was successfully built by a French-backed company, which was to remain under French control even after the British government acquired almost half of the shares. Both nations saw it as vital to maintaining their influence and respective empire in East Africa and Asia. In 1882, ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt prompted Britain to intervene, extending a hand to France. France&#x27;s leading expansionist Jules Ferry was out of office, and Paris allowed London to take effective control of Egypt.

===Evolution in the use of the term Empire between the years of 1870–1939===
After the downfall of Napoleon III, few writers used the word &#x27;empire&#x27;, which had become associated with despotism, decadence, and weakness, preferring the word &#x27;colonies&#x27;. However, by the 1880s and 1890s, as Republicans consolidated their control over the political system, increasing numbers of politicians, intellectuals and writers began using the phrase &quot;colonial empire&quot;, linking it to republicanism and the French nation.

Most Frenchmen ignored foreign affairs and colonial issues. In 1914 the chief pressure group was the &quot;Parti colonial&quot;, a coalition of 50 organizations with a combined total of only 5,000 members.

===Causes and justifications for colonialism===

==== Civilizing Mission ====

A hallmark of the French colonial project in the late 19th century and early 20th century was the civilising mission (&quot;mission civilisatrice&quot;), the principle that it was Europe&#x27;s duty to bring civilisation to benighted peoples. As such, colonial officials undertook a policy of Franco-Europeanisation in French colonies, most notably French West Africa and Madagascar. During the 19th century, French citizenship along with the right to elect a deputy to the French Chamber of Deputies was granted to the four old colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyanne and Réunion as well as to the residents of French India and the &quot;Four Communes&quot; in Senegal. In most cases, the elected deputies were white Frenchmen, although there were some blacks, such as the Senegalese Blaise Diagne, who was elected in 1914. 

Racism and notions of white supremacy were integral to justifying the concept of the civilizing mission. French colonialists viewed non-European societies as uncivilized, and their colonial subjects as needing European re-education. Racial darwinists like Arthur de Gobineau, justified this ideology by falsely claiming that people of color were biologically inferior to white people.

Elsewhere, in the largest and most populous colonies, a strict separation between &quot;sujets français&quot; (&quot;french subjects&quot;, natives) and &quot;citoyens français&quot; (&quot;french citizens&quot;, people of European extraction) with different rights and duties was maintained until 1946. As was pointed out in a 1927 treatise on French colonial law, the granting of French citizenship to natives &quot;was not a right, but rather a privilege&quot;. Two 1912 decrees dealing with French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa enumerated the conditions that a native had to meet in order to be granted French citizenship (they included speaking and writing French, earning a decent living and displaying good moral standards). From 1830 to 1946, only between 3,000 and 6,000 Muslim native Algerians were granted French citizenship. In French West Africa, outside of the Four Communes, there were 2,500 &quot;citoyens indigènes&quot; out of a total population of 15 million.
French conservatives had been denouncing the assimilationist policies as products of a dangerous liberal fantasy. In the Protectorate of Morocco, the French administration attempted to use urban planning and colonial education to prevent cultural mixing and to uphold the traditional society upon which the French depended for collaboration, with mixed results. After World War II, the segregationist approach modeled in Morocco had been discredited by its connections to Vichyism, and assimilationism enjoyed a brief renaissance.

David P. Forsythe wrote: &quot;From Senegal and Mauritania in the west to Niger in the east (what became French Africa), there was a parallel series of ruinous wars, resulting in tremendous numbers of people being violently enslaved. At the beginning of the twentieth century there may have been between 3 and 3.5 million slaves, representing over 30 percent of the total population, within this sparsely populated region.&quot; In 1905, the French abolished slavery in most of French West Africa. From 1906 to 1911, over a million slaves in French West Africa fled from their masters to earlier homes. In Madagascar over 500,000 slaves were freed following French abolition in 1896.

====Education====
French colonial officials, influenced by the revolutionary ideal of equality, standardized schools, curricula, and teaching methods as much as possible. They did not establish colonial school systems with the idea of furthering the ambitions of the local people, but rather simply exported the systems and methods in vogue in the mother nation. Having a moderately trained lower bureaucracy was of great use to colonial officials. The emerging French-educated indigenous elite saw little value in educating rural peoples. After 1946 the policy was to bring the best students to Paris for advanced training. The result was to immerse the next generation of leaders in the growing anti-colonial diaspora centered in Paris. Impressionistic colonials could mingle with studious scholars or radical revolutionaries or so everything in between. Ho Chi Minh and other young radicals in Paris formed the French Communist party in 1920.

Tunisia was exceptional. The colony was administered by Paul Cambon, who built an educational system for colonists and indigenous people alike that was closely modeled on mainland France. He emphasized female and vocational education. By independence, the quality of Tunisian education nearly equalled that in France.

African nationalists rejected such a public education system, which they perceived as an attempt to retard African development and maintain colonial superiority. One of the first demands of the emerging nationalist movement after World War II was the introduction of full metropolitan-style education in French West Africa with its promise of equality with Europeans.

In Algeria, the debate was polarized. The French set up schools based on the scientific method and French culture. The Pied-Noir (Catholic migrants from Europe) welcomed this. Those goals were rejected by the Moslem Arabs, who prized mental agility and their distinctive religious tradition. The Arabs refused to become patriotic and cultured Frenchmen and a unified educational system was impossible until the Pied-Noir and their Arab allies went into exile after 1962.

===Critics of French colonialism===

Critics of French colonialism gained an international audience in the 1920s, and often used documentary reportage and access to agencies such as the League of Nations and the International Labour Organization to make their protests heard. The main criticism was the high level of violence and suffering among the natives. Major critics included Albert Londres, Félicien Challaye, and Paul Monet, whose books and articles were widely read.

== Decolonization ==

The French colonial empire began to fall during the Second World War, when various parts were occupied by foreign powers (Japan in Indochina, Britain in Syria, Lebanon, and Madagascar, the United States and Britain in Morocco and Algeria, and Germany and Italy in Tunisia). However, control was gradually reestablished by Charles de Gaulle. The French Union, included in the Constitution of 1946, nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets. There emerged a group of elites, known as &quot;evolués&quot;, who were natives of the overseas territories but lived in metropolitan France.

===World War II===

During World War II, allied Free France, often with British support, and Axis-aligned Vichy France struggled for control of the colonies, sometimes with outright military combat. By 1943, all of the colonies, except for Indochina under Japanese control, had joined the Free French cause.

The overseas empire helped liberate France as 300,000 North African Arabs fought in the ranks of the Free French. However Charles de Gaulle had no intention of liberating the colonies. He assembled the conference of colonial governors (excluding the nationalist leaders) in Brazzaville in January 1944 to announce plans for postwar Union that would replace the Empire. The Brazzaville manifesto proclaimed:
: the goals of the work of civilization undertaken by France in the colonies exclude all idea of autonomy, all possibility of development outside the French block of the Empire; the possible constitutional self-government in the colonies is to be dismissed.

The manifesto angered nationalists across the Empire, and set the stage for long-term wars in Indochina and Algeria that France would lose in humiliating fashion.

===Conflict===
France was immediately confronted with the beginnings of the decolonisation movement. In Algeria demonstrations in May 1945 were repressed with an estimated 6,000 to 45,000 Algerians killed. Unrest in Haiphong, Indochina, in November 1945 was met by a warship bombarding the city. Paul Ramadier&#x27;s (SFIO) cabinet repressed the Malagasy Uprising in Madagascar in 1947. The French blamed education. French officials estimated the number of Malagasy killed from a low of 11,000 to a French Army estimate of 89,000.

Also in Indochina, Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Minh, which was backed by the Soviet Union and China, declared Vietnam&#x27;s independence, which started the First Indochina War. The war dragged on until 1954, when the Viet Minh decisively defeated the French at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ in northern Vietnam, which was the last major battle between the French and the Vietnamese in the First Indochina War.

Following the Vietnamese victory at Điện Biên Phủ and the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords, France agreed to withdraw its forces from all its colonies in French Indochina, while stipulating that Vietnam would be temporarily divided at the 17th parallel, with control of the north given to the Soviet-backed Viet Minh as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh, and the south becoming the State of Vietnam under former Nguyen-dynasty Emperor Bảo Đại, who abdicated following the 1945 August Revolution under pressure from Ho. However, in 1955, the State of Vietnam&#x27;s Prime Minister, Ngô Đình Diệm, toppled Bảo Đại in a fraud-ridden referendum and proclaimed himself president of the new Republic of Vietnam. The refusal of Ngô Đình Diệm, the US-supported president of the first Republic of Vietnam [RVN], to allow elections in 1956 – as had been stipulated by the Geneva Conference – in fear of Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s victory and subsequently a total communist takeover, eventually led to the Vietnam War.

In France&#x27;s African colonies, the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon&#x27;s insurrection, which started in 1955 and headed by Ruben Um Nyobé, was violently repressed over a two-year period, with perhaps as many as 100 people killed. However, France formally relinquished its protectorate over Morocco and granted it independence in 1956.

French involvement in Algeria stretched back a century. The movements of Ferhat Abbas and Messali Hadj had marked the period between the two world wars, but both sides radicalised after the Second World War. In 1945, the Sétif massacre was carried out by the French army. The Algerian War started in 1954. Atrocities characterized both sides, and the number killed became highly controversial estimates that were made for propaganda purposes. Algeria was a three-way conflict due to the large number of &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; (Europeans who had settled there in the 125 years of French rule). The political crisis in France caused the collapse of the Fourth Republic, as Charles de Gaulle returned to power in 1958 and finally pulled the French soldiers and settlers out of Algeria by 1962.

The French Union was replaced in the Constitution of 1958 by the French Community. Only Guinea refused by referendum to take part in the new organisation. However, the French Community ceased to operate before the end of the Algerian War. Almost all of the other former African colonies achieved independence in 1960. The French government refused to allow the populations of the former colonies the right they had in the new French Constitution of 1958, as French citizens with equal rights, to choose for their territories to become full &quot;départements&quot; of France. The French government had ensured that a constitutional law (60-525) was passed which removed the need for a referendum in a territory to confirm a change in status towards independence or départementalisation, so the voters who had rejected independence in 1958 were not consulted about it in 1960. There are still a few former colonies that chose to remain part of France, under the status of overseas &quot;départements&quot; or territories.

Critics of neocolonialism claimed that the had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was maintaining French dominance through the operations of Jacques Foccart, his counsellor for African matters. Foccart supported in particular Biafra in the Nigerian Civil War during the late 1960s.

Robert Aldrich argues that with Algerian independence in 1962, it appeared that the Empire practically had come to an end, as the remaining colonies were quite small and lacked active nationalist movements. However, there was trouble in French Somaliland (Djibouti), which became independent in 1977. There also were complications and delays in the New Hebrides Vanuatu, which was the last to gain independence in 1980. New Caledonia remains a special case under French suzerainty. The Indian Ocean island of Mayotte voted in referendum in 1974 to retain its link with France and not become independent like the other three islands of the Comoro archipelago.

==Demographics==

French census statistics from 1936 show an imperial population, outside of Metropolitan France itself, of 69.1 million people. Of the total population, 16.1 million lived in North Africa, 25.5 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 3.2 million in the Middle East, 0.3 million in the Indian subcontinent, 23.2 million in East and South-East Asia, 0.15 million in the South Pacific, and 0.6 million in the Caribbean.

The largest colonies were the general governorate of French Indochina (grouping five separate colonies and protectorates), with 23.0 million, the general governorate of French West Africa (grouping eight separate colonies), with 14.9 million, the general governorate of Algeria (grouping three departments and four Saharan territories), with 7.2 million, the protectorate of Morocco, with 6.3 million, the general governorate of French Equatorial Africa (grouping four separate colonies), with 3.9 million, and Madagascar and Dependencies (incl. the Comoro Islands), with 3.8 million.

2.7 million Europeans (French and non-French citizens) and assimilated natives (non-European French citizens) lived in the French colonial empire in 1936 besides 66.4 million non-assimilated natives (French subjects but not citizens). The majority of Europeans lived in North Africa. Non-European French citizens lived essentially in the four &quot;old colonies&quot; (Réunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French Guiana), as well as in the Four Communes of Senegal (Saint-Louis, Dakar, Gorée, and Rufisque) and in the colonies of the South Pacific.

===French settlers===

Unlike elsewhere in Europe, France experienced relatively low levels of emigration to the Americas, except for the Huguenots in British or Dutch colonies. France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly Roman Catholic French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of Acadia, Canada, and Louisiana, both (at the time) French possessions, and colonies in the West Indies, Mascarene islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the Quiet Revolution. The current French Canadian population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France&#x27;s small settler population.

On 31 December 1687 a community of French Huguenots settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but have since been quickly absorbed into the Afrikaner population. After Champlain&#x27;s founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of New France. Encouraging settlement was difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1763 New France only had a population of some 65,000.

In 1787, there were 30,000 white colonists on France&#x27;s colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1804 Dessalines, the first ruler of an independent Haiti (St. Domingue), ordered the massacre of whites remaining on the island. Out of the 40,000 inhabitants on Guadeloupe, at the end of the 17th century, there were more than 26,000 blacks and 9,000 whites. Bill Marshall wrote, &quot;The first French effort to colonize Guiana, in 1763, failed utterly when tropical diseases and climate killed all but 2,000 of the initial 12,000 settlers.&quot;

French law made it easy for thousands of &quot;colons&quot;, ethnic or national French from former colonies of North and West Africa, India and Indochina, to live in mainland France. It is estimated that 20,000 &quot;colons&quot; were living in Saigon in 1945. 1.6 million European &quot;pieds noirs&quot; migrated from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 French Algerians left Algeria in the largest relocation of population in Europe since World War II. In the 1970s, over 30,000 French &quot;colons&quot; left Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime as the Pol Pot government confiscated their farms and land properties. In November 2004, several thousand of the estimated 14,000 French nationals in Ivory Coast left the country after days of anti-white violence.

Apart from French-Canadians (Québécois and Acadians), francophone Louisianians (Cajuns and Louisiana Creoles), and Métis, other populations of French ancestry outside metropolitan France include the &quot;Caldoches&quot; of New Caledonia, the so-called &quot;Zoreilles&quot;, &quot;Petits-blancs&quot; with the Franco-Mauritian of various Indian Ocean islands and the Beke people of the French West Indies.

<text>Schwalm-Eder-Kreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the north of Hesse, Germany. Neighbouring districts are Kassel, Werra-Meißner, Hersfeld-Rotenburg, Vogelsberg, Marburg-Biedenkopf, and Waldeck-Frankenberg.

==History==
In 1821 districts were created in Hesse. They included the districts of Fritzlar, Homberg, Melsungen, and Ziegenhain. In 1932 the districts of Fritzlar and Homberg were merged; in 1974 the three districts of Fritzlar-Homberg, Melsungen, and Ziegenhain were merged into the Schwalm-Eder district.

The district is twinned with the Finnish city of Kajaani, the British district of Sedgemoor, and the Polish district of Piła.

==Geography==
The Schwalm and Eder rivers give the district its name. After they merge close to Felsberg, the Eder enters the Fulda to the north at Edermunde. The southeast of the district includes a portion of the Knüllgebirge range of low mountains; the highest elevation is . In the north are the hills of the &quot;Homberger Hochland&quot;. The centre of the district is largely rural, and is surrounded by the mountains of the Knüll, the Stölzinger Gebirge, and the Kellerwald with the 675 metre-high Wüstegarten mountain, the highest peak in the district.
== Geology ==
In the east, the geology of the Knüllgebirge is dominated by the clastic Triassic strata of the Middle Buntsandstein, as is the western region around the Gilserberg.

Soils of weathered Buntsandstein are generally acidic to slightly basic and nutrient-poor. For the most part the land is forested.
In the district of Fritzlar there are outcrops of younger Upper Buntsandstein, known as the Röt Formation, because of its red colour. These strata consist of clay beds and various kinds of calcareous beds, interbedded with clayey marls.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the lion of Hesse (azure a lion rampant crowned, barry of six argent and gules, armed or). Below are wavy lines (three bars wavy argent) that symbolise the three main rivers in the district, the Schwalm, the Eder, and the Fulda.

<text>&quot;The Market for &#x27;Lemons&#x27;: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism&quot; is a widely cited seminal paper in the field of economics which explores the concept of asymmetric information in markets. The paper was written in 1970 by George Akerlof and published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot;. The paper&#x27;s findings have since been applied to many other types of markets. However, Akerlof&#x27;s research focused solely on the market for used cars. 
Akerlof examines how the quality of goods traded in a market can degrade in the presence of information asymmetry between buyers and sellers, which ultimately leaves goods that are found to be defective after purchase in the market, noted by the term &#x27;lemon&#x27; in the title of the paper. In American slang, a lemon is a car that is found to be defective after it has been bought.

Akerlof&#x27;s theory of the &quot;Market for Lemons&quot; paper applies to markets with information asymmetry, focusing on the used car market. Information asymmetry within the market relates to the seller having more information about the quality of the car as opposed to the buyer, creating adverse selection. Adverse selection is a phenomenon where sellers are not willing to sell high quality goods at the lower prices buyers are willing to pay, with the result that buyers get lower quality goods. This can lead to a market collapse due to the lower equilibrium price and quantity of goods traded in the market than a market with perfect information.

Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a &quot;peach&quot;) and a &quot;lemon&quot;. Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a &quot;peach&quot; and &quot;lemon&quot; together (&quot;p&quot;avg). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold &quot;lemons&quot; (since &quot;p&quot;lemon &lt; &quot;p&quot;avg) and they will leave the market when they hold &quot;peaches&quot; (since &quot;p&quot;peach &gt; &quot;p&quot;avg). Eventually, as enough sellers of &quot;peaches&quot; leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive feedback loop. Thus the uninformed buyer&#x27;s price creates an adverse selection problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse.

Akerlof&#x27;s paper shows how prices can determine the quality of goods traded on the market. Low prices drive away sellers of high-quality goods, leaving only lemons behind. In 2001, Akerlof, along with Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz, jointly received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for their research on issues related to asymmetric information.

==The paper==

===Thesis===

Akerlof&#x27;s paper uses the market for used cars as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty. A used car is one in which ownership is transferred from one person to another, after a period of use by its first owner and its inevitable wear and tear. There are good used cars (&quot;peaches&quot;) and defective used cars (&quot;lemons&quot;), normally as a consequence of several not-always-traceable variables, such as the owner&#x27;s driving style, quality and frequency of maintenance, and accident history. Because many important mechanical parts and other elements are hidden from view and not easily accessible for inspection, the buyer of a car does not know beforehand whether it is a peach or a lemon. So the buyer&#x27;s best guess for a given car is that the car is of average quality; accordingly, the buyer will be willing to pay the price of a car of known average quality. This means that the owner of a carefully maintained, never-abused, good used car will not be able to get a high enough price to make selling that car worthwhile.

Therefore, owners of &#x27;peaches&#x27; will not place their cars on the used market as they believe their car is worth more than the market price. The withdrawal of good cars reduces the average quality of cars on the market, causing buyers to revise downward their expectations for any given car. This, in turn, motivates the owners of moderately good cars not to sell, and so on. The result is that a market in which there is asymmetric information with respect to quality shows characteristics similar to those described by Gresham&#x27;s law: the bad drives out the good. (Although Gresham&#x27;s principle applies more specifically to exchange rates, modified analogies can be drawn.) 

===Statistical abstract of the problem===
Akerlof considers a situation in which demand &quot;D&quot; for used cars depends on the cars price &quot;p&quot; and quality &quot;μ&quot; = &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) and the supply &quot;S&quot; depends on price alone. Economic equilibrium is given by &quot;S&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;μ&quot;) and there are two groups of traders with utilities given by:

: formula_1

: formula_2

where &quot;M&quot; is the consumption of goods other than automobiles, &quot;x&quot; the car&#x27;s quality and &quot;n&quot; the number of automobiles. Let &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;S&quot;&quot;i&quot; be income, demand and supply for group &quot;i&quot;. Assuming that utilities are linear, that the traders are Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility maximizers and that the price of other &quot;M&quot; goods is unitary, the demand &quot;D&quot;1 for cars is &quot;Y&quot;1/&quot;p&quot; if &quot;μ&quot;/&quot;p&quot; &gt; 1, otherwise null. The demand &quot;D&quot;2 is &quot;Y&quot;2/&quot;p&quot; if 3&quot;μ&quot;/&quot;2&quot; &gt; &quot;p&quot;, otherwise null. Market demand is given by:

: formula_3

Group 1 has &quot;N&quot; cars to sell with quality between 0 and 2 and group 2 has no cars to sell, therefore &quot;S&quot;1 = &quot;pN&quot;/2 and &quot;S&quot;2 = 0. For a given price &quot;p&quot;, average quality is &quot;p&quot;/2, and therefore &quot;D&quot; = 0. The market for used cars collapses when there is asymmetric information.

===Asymmetric information===
The paper by Akerlof describes how the interaction between quality heterogeneity and asymmetric information can lead to the disappearance of a market where guarantees are indefinite. In this model, as quality is indistinguishable beforehand by the buyer (due to the asymmetry of information), incentives exist for the seller to pass off low-quality goods as higher-quality ones. The buyer, however, takes this incentive into consideration, and takes the quality of the goods to be uncertain. Only the average quality of the goods will be considered, which in turn will have the side effect that goods that are above average in terms of quality will be driven out of the market. This mechanism is repeated until a no-trade equilibrium is reached.

As a consequence of the mechanism described in this paper, markets may fail to exist altogether in certain situations involving quality uncertainty. Examples given in Akerlof&#x27;s paper include the market for used cars, the dearth of formal credit markets in developing countries, and the difficulties that the elderly encounter in buying health insurance. However, not all players in a given market will follow the same rules or have the same aptitude of assessing quality. So there will always be a distinct advantage for some vendors to offer low-quality goods to the less-informed segment of a market that, on the whole, appears to be of reasonable quality and have reasonable guarantees of certainty. This is part of the basis for the idiom buyer beware.

This is likely the basis for the idiom that an informed consumer is a better consumer. An example of this might be the subjective quality of fine food and wine. Individual consumers know best what they prefer to eat, and quality is almost always assessed in fine establishments by smell and taste before they pay. That is, if a customer in a fine establishment orders a lobster and the meat is not fresh, he can send the lobster back to the kitchen and refuse to pay for it. However, a definition of &#x27;highest quality&#x27; for food eludes providers. Thus, a large variety of better-quality and higher-priced restaurants are supported.

==Critical reception==
George E. Hoffer and Michael D. Pratt state that the &quot;economic literature is divided on whether a lemons market actually exists in used vehicles&quot;. The authors&#x27; research supports the hypothesis that &quot;known defects provisions&quot;, used by US states (e.g., Wisconsin) to regulate used car sales, have been ineffectual, because the quality of used vehicles sold in these states is not significantly better than the vehicles in neighboring states without such consumer protection legislation.

Both the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; and the &quot;Review of Economic Studies&quot; rejected the paper for &quot;triviality&quot;, while the reviewers for &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; rejected it as incorrect, arguing that, if this paper were correct, then no goods could be traded. Only on the fourth attempt did the paper get published in &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot;. Today, the paper is one of the most-cited papers in modern economic theory and most downloaded economic journal paper of all time in RePEC (more than 39,275 citations in academic papers as of February 2022). It has profoundly influenced virtually every field of economics, from industrial organisation and public finance to macroeconomics and contract theory.

==Conditions for a lemon market==
A lemon market will be produced by the following:

# Asymmetry of information, in which no buyers can accurately assess the value of a product through examination before sale is made and all sellers can more accurately assess the value of a product prior to sale
# An incentive exists for the seller to pass off a low-quality product as a higher-quality one
# Sellers have no credible disclosure technology (sellers with a great car have no way to disclose this credibly to buyers)
# Either a continuum of seller qualities exists or the average seller type is sufficiently low (buyers are sufficiently pessimistic about the seller&#x27;s quality)
# Deficiency of &quot;effective&quot; public quality assurances (by reputation or regulation and/or of &quot;effective&quot; guarantees/warranties)

=== A more general mathematical model of market collapse ===
It is possible to generalize the reasoning in Akerlof&#x27;s paper. Suppose that there are two populations of cars: the peaches formula_4 and the lemons formula_5, where we assume that the quality formula_6 of peaches is always greater than the quality of lemons:formula_7Accordingly, the utility formula_8 and the price formula_9 of the peaches will also always be greater than that of the lemons. Let formula_10 be the probability of a buyer encountering a peach in the used car market. Then the expected utility for the buyer formula_11 from purchasing a used car is:formula_12where formula_13 and formula_14 represent the mean peach and lemon respectively. The expected utility for the buyer will always increase - for a monotonic, positive utility function - as the probability of encountering a peach increases.formula_15Furthermore, the equation for a buyer&#x27;s expected utility implies that the equilibrium price in an informationally symmetric market is:formula_16However, the used car market is not a symmetric market: the sellers know which cars are peaches and lemons, while the buyers cannot distinguish between the two. Depending on the type of car he owns, the seller has a differing decision rule based on the offer price formula_17:formula_18with formula_19 by definition. It is also assumed that, for both peaches and lemons, sellers are willing to accept a price lower than the full value of the car:formula_20However, if formula_21, then the sellers possessing peaches will not put them on the market and the equilibrium price will drop. This occurs when:formula_22with the associated asymmetric information price equilibrium:formula_23where formula_24 is the indicator function. Once lemons saturate the market, the peaches are driven out of the market because their sellers cannot be matched with buyers to meet their selling price in equilibrium. The beauty of this example is that it illustrates how product quality can collapse in a market with asymmetric information.

==Laws in the United States==
Five years after Akerlof&#x27;s paper was published, the United States enacted a federal &quot;lemon law&quot; (the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act) that protects citizens of all states. There are also state laws regarding &quot;lemons&quot; which vary by state and may not necessarily cover used or leased vehicles. The rights afforded to consumers by &quot;lemon laws&quot; may exceed the warranties expressed in purchase contracts. These state laws provide remedies to consumers for automobiles that repeatedly fail to meet certain standards of quality and performance. &quot;Lemon law&quot; is the common nickname for these laws, but each state has different names for the laws and acts, which may also cover more than just automobiles. In California and federal law, &quot;Lemon Laws&quot; cover anything mechanical.

The federal &quot;lemon law&quot; also provides that the warrantor may be obligated to pay the attorney fees of the party prevailing in a lemon , as do most state lemon laws. If a car has to be repaired for the same defect four or more times and the problem is still occurring, the car may be deemed to be a &quot;lemon&quot;. The defect must substantially hinder the vehicle&#x27;s use, value, or safety. Dealers and manufacturers are required by branding the title as &quot;Lemon Law Buyback&quot; of such vehicles after their reacquiring them due to any defect, malfunctioning or failure under the federal statute or typically nonconformities under state &quot;lemon laws&quot;; dealers may not withhold the lemon branding of such vehicles and an &quot;as is&quot; or &quot;with all defects&quot; labeling does not protect a dealer from legal recourse should they not disclose the &quot;lemon law buyback&quot; status of such vehicles.

==Developments of the model==
Akerlof&#x27;s original model has been developed by adjusting certain parameters to better represent the real world markets. Akerlof limited the market to fixed buyers and sellers, disregarding the possibility that agents are able to interchange their position, with low transaction costs. This would be valid for other markets with asymmetric information; however, the used car market is unique in that a buyer can purchase a car and become a seller. Kim incorporates a variability of agents in the market. Moreover, in this model, sellers are differentiated unlike the Akerlof model where sellers are heterogeneous apart from the cars they sell and therefore their behaviors are dependent on the car they own. By changing the parameters of the model this study&#x27;s findings conclude that the lemon principle does not hold.

Daley and Green elaborate the model by segmenting the market equilibrium into intervals of no trade periods and trade periods. Whereby, trade periods are facilitated by the arrival of &quot;news&quot;, categorized as stochastic information. The onset of bad news instigates trade as buyers are more pessimistic, whereas good news establishes confidence in the market. At the equilibrium the following states occur:
* A positive perspective of the seller results in an efficient market, whereby the price is the expected value of the asset
* A negative perspective of the seller results in a partially selling off of the asset
* An indifferent perspective of the seller results in a no trade period, whereby consumers wait for more information.
Both sellers with a positive and negative perspective eventually trade in equilibrium, thus mitigating the trade breakdown inefficiency prevalent in Akerlof&#x27;s model. However, by integrating news into the model, a new inefficiency arises. This is where delays occur when more news is introduced in the market. Theoretically, more news would reduce market inefficiencies caused by information asymmetry. The dynamic market model constructed shows that this is only partially true.

Zavolokina, Schlegel and Schwabe incorporate the benefits of modern technology into the model as blockchain is able to solve issues relating to the asymmetry of information. The reliability of the information would improve accuracy of the valuation of cars, however, the advantages of the information stored is limited to the interpretation of the buyer. The information would have to be understandable to consumers with no car expertise to be an effective mechanism for decision making.

== Empirical applications ==
Although Akerlof&#x27;s &quot;Market for Lemons&quot; paper was written solely focusing on the used car market, there are many other applications of this theory in other types of markets beyond the used car market. Examples of applications include health insurance, vehicle related insurance and also within the labour market which, similarly to Akerlof&#x27;s theory these examples can all lead to market failures through adverse selection.

Beyond the used car market, insurance companies charge excessive premiums to those who are distinguished as high-risk individuals as people under this term are likely to file more claims to the insurance company. As a result, high risk individuals are likely to cost insurance companies more as they are likely to pay the individual out more money due to the increased claims. Akerlof&#x27;s theory has been used to explain this scenario where insurance companies charge higher premiums to individuals who they believe carry out more risk in attempt to compensate for the greater chance that claims are filed under the individual&#x27;s policy.

Another example of an empirical application is within the labour market where, wage discrimination could be a factor as the employer is likely to have more information of the skills and experience of the employee than the employee themself. This is also applicable when employees apply for jobs as employers may be hesitant or decide not to hire workers with previous work experience in the specific field, resulting in those who do not have prior experience or are new to the workforce to be denied by employers.

Health insurance also falls into the consideration of adverse selection where healthy individuals with no family history of medical concerns may choose not to purchase health insurance as they don&#x27;t feel the need to pay the premium, where other individuals with pre-existing conditions or a family history of medical issues are likely to purchase health insurance. As result, healthy individuals are pushed out of the market, creating a smaller group of policy holders, which drives up the price/premium of health insurance for other individuals who decide to purchase the insurance.

==Health insurance industry==
A major concern for the health insurance industry is adverse selection, where asymmetric information existing between consumers and insurers has potential to lead to market failure.

Think of it this way: A young healthy individual with no knowledge of hereditary illnesses is far less likely to take up insurance than another individual who knows that cancer runs in their family or knows they have started to feel a pain in their chest. If all &#x27;healthy&#x27; individuals decided that they did not need health insurance, then the health insurance market would be dominated by all of these high-risk &#x27;unhealthy&#x27; consumers. Insurance companies, being unaware of this adverse selection, would start paying out absurd amounts of health insurance claims. This would force the companies to drive up health insurance premiums for everyone. This would further discourage healthy individuals from entering the market and creates further adverse selection in the health insurance market. This would ultimately lead to market failure.

Insurance companies have extensive application processes in place to protect themselves against the market asymmetric information. This can include examinations of previous medical history, blood samples, medical tests and signed questionnaires to ensure consumers are being transparent and truthful when it comes to their health. Insurance companies also have the option to decline applicants due to their ill-health, spike up the premium for high-risk individuals, and also add exclusions (e.g. cancer, mental health) to health insurance policies. Health concerns and age-related illnesses will likely develop as an individual gets older, so insurance premiums are increased with age.

<text>Ali Ahmad Jalali (Pashto/) is an Afghan politician, diplomat, and academic. Jalali served as the Minister of Interior from January 2003 to September 2005. He has also been a distinguished professor at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies (NESA) at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C. In August 2021, amid the collapse of the US-backed Afghan government, Jalali was rumored to become the leader of the Taliban-controlled interim Afghan government, which he has denied on Twitter as &quot;fake news.&quot;

== Early life and education==
Jalali was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1940, the son of the late Professor G. Jelani Jalali. He has been involved in politics and media for most of his life. He previously served with the Voice of America for over 20 years covering Afghanistan, South and Central Asia, and the Middle East, including assignments as Director of the Afghan Radio Network Project and chief of the Dari and Pashto services.

== Career ==
===Military and politics===
Jalali is a former colonel in the Afghan National Army and was a top military planner with the Afghan resistance following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He attended higher command and staff colleges in Afghanistan, the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia, and has lectured widely.

As Interior Minister of post-Taliban Afghanistan, he created a trained force of 50,000 Afghan National Police (ANP) and 12,000 Border Police to work effectively in counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, and criminal investigation to fight against organized crime and illegal border crossings. He successfully led the country-wide operations to protect the constitutional grand assembly (Loya Jirga) in 2003, the nationwide voters’ registration drive and landmark 2004 Presidential election, and the parliamentary elections in 2005.

Prior to assuming the ministerial post in Kabul, Jalali served in executive broadcast positions at Voice of America in Washington, D.C. from 1982 to 2003. During this period he, directed broadcasts in Pashto, Dari, Persian languages to Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia. As a journalist, he covered the war in Afghanistan from 1982 to 1993 and the former Soviet Central Asia from 1993 to 2000 and traveled extensively across the region.
During his military service in Afghanistan army (1961–81), Jalali served in command, staff and educational posts with a final rank of colonel. He attended higher educational institutions in Afghanistan, United States, United Kingdom and Russia.

A U.S. citizen since 1987, Jalali left his job as a broadcaster for VOA to become the Interior Minister of Afghanistan.
Jalali replaced Taj Mohammad Wardak in January 2003.

In January 2009 an article by Ahmad Majidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included Jalali on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the 2009 Afghan Presidential election.
However, according to Chapter Three, Article Sixty Two of Afghanistan Constitution an Afghan citizen shall be the president of Afghanistan. Since Afghanistan has not signed any dual citizenship accords, it would have been necessary for him to renounce his U.S. citizenship and gain Afghan citizenship before seeking the office.
Jalali did not complete these steps, and was not listed on the ballot in August 2009.

=== Author ===

A reputed multi-lingual military and political analyst, Jalali has extensive academic, managerial, journalistic and writing experience. A published writer in three languages (English, Pashto, Dari), Jalali is the author of numerous books and articles on political, military and security issues in Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia including topics related to Islamic movements in the region. His works are published in the United States, Great Britain, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.

He has written extensively about the military of Afghanistan for scholarly journals and the mass media, in addition to reporting on Afghanistan and Central Asia for VOA for almost two decades.

Jalali is the author of several books, including a three-volume military history of Afghanistan. His most recent book, &quot;The Other Side of the Mountain&quot; (2002), co-authored with Lester Grau, is an analytical review of the Mujahedin war with the Soviet forces in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.

Jalali wrote an influential critique in the spring of 2002 of the U.S. military role in Afghanistan, arguing that the way the United States used local chieftains in the War on Terrorism &quot;enhanced the power of the warlords and encouraged them to defy the central authorities.&quot; He later softened his criticism but pointed out that local militias still play a significant role in working with the U.S. military.

He is a frequent commentator on Afghan and regional security and developmental at U.S. major TV networks (including CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, FOX News, PBS, NPR) as well as Australian National TV (ABC) and Canadian CBC.

Jalali&#x27;s articles and comments are also published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; and many other major U.S. and European papers. Many of his scholarly articles are published by the Parameters, the senior professional journal of the U.S. Army, from 2001 to 2010.

=== Teaching ===

Jalali has taught at higher education institutions of Afghanistan and the United States and extensively lectured at U.S. Army War College, U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, the Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the British Army Staff College, Camberley, England.

== Personal life ==

Jalali is married to Homaira Jalali and the couple has a son and daughter.

<text>Thomas Arnold (13 June 1795 – 12 June 1842) was an English educator and historian. He was an early supporter of the Broad Church Anglican movement. As headmaster of Rugby School from 1828 to 1841, he introduced several reforms that were widely copied by other noted public schools. His reforms redefined standards of masculinity and achievement.

==Early life and education==
Arnold was born on the Isle of Wight, the son of William Arnold, a Customs officer, and his wife Martha Delafield (sister to John Delafield). William Arnold was related to the Arnold family of gentry from Lowestoft. Thomas was educated at Lord Weymouth&#x27;s Grammar School, Warminster, at Winchester, and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He excelled in Classics and was made a fellow of Oriel in 1815. He became headmaster of a school in Laleham before moving to Rugby.

==Career as an educator==
===Rugby School===
Arnold&#x27;s appointment to the headship of Rugby School in 1828, after some years as a private tutor, turned the school&#x27;s fortunes around. His force of character and religious zeal enabled him to make it a model for other public schools and exercise a strong influence on the education system of England. Though he introduced history, mathematics and modern languages, he based his teaching on the classical languages. &quot;I assume it as the foundation of all my view of the case, that boys at a public school never will learn to speak or pronounce French well, under any circumstances,&quot; and so it would be enough if they could &quot;learn it grammatically as a dead language.&quot; Physical science was not taught because, in Arnold&#x27;s view, &quot;it must either take the chief place in the school curriculum, or it must be left out altogether.&quot; Arnold was also opposed to the materialistic tendency of physical science, a view deriving from his Christian idealism. He wrote that &quot;rather than have physical science the principal thing in my son&#x27;s mind, I would gladly have him think that the sun went round the earth, and that the stars were so many spangles set in the bright blue firmament. Surely the one thing needful for a Christian and an Englishman to study is Christian and moral and political philosophy.&quot;

Arnold developed the &quot;praepostor&quot; (prefect) system, in which sixth-form students were given powers over every part of the school (managed by himself) and kept order in the establishment. The 1857 novel by Thomas Hughes, &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, portrays a generation of boys &quot;who feared the Doctor with all our hearts, and very little besides in heaven or earth; who thought more of our sets in the School than of the Church of Christ, and put the traditions of Rugby and the public opinion of boys in our daily life above the laws of God.&quot;

Arnold was no great enthusiast for sport, which was permitted only as an alternative to poaching or fighting with local boys and did not become part of Rugby&#x27;s curriculum until 1850. He described his educational aims as being the cure of souls first, moral development second, and intellectual development third. However, this did not prevent Baron de Coubertin from considering him the father of the organized sport he admired when he visited English public schools, including Rugby in 1886. When looking at Arnold&#x27;s tomb in the school chapel he recalled that he felt suddenly as if he were looking on &quot;the very cornerstone of the British empire&quot;. Coubertin is thought to have exaggerated the importance of sport to Thomas Arnold, whom he viewed as &quot;one of the founders of athletic chivalry&quot;. The character-forming influence of sport, with which Coubertin was so impressed, is more likely to have originated in the novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; than exclusively in the ideas of Arnold himself. &quot;Thomas Arnold, the leader and classic model of English educators,&quot; wrote Coubertin, &quot;gave the precise formula for the role of athletics in education. The cause was quickly won. Playing fields sprang up all over England.&quot;

===Oxford University===
Arnold was involved in not a few controversies, educational and religious. As a churchman he was a decided Erastian and strongly opposed to the High Church party. His 1833 &quot;Principles of Church Reform&quot; is linked with the beginnings of the Broad Church movement. In 1841, he was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford.

===The Catholic University===

In Ireland, Arnold&#x27;s one-time Oxford University colleague, John Henry Newman, appointed Arnold to Professor of English at the Catholic University, now known as University College Dublin.

==Works== 
Arnold&#x27;s chief literary works are his unfinished &quot;History of Rome&quot; (three volumes, 1838–1842) and his &quot;Lectures on Modern History&quot;. Far more often read were his five books of sermons, which were admired by a wide circle of pious readers, including Queen Victoria.

==Family==
Arnold married Mary Penrose, daughter of the Rev. John Penrose of Penryn, Cornwall. They had five daughters and five sons:
* Jane Martha Arnold (1821–1899), married William Edward Forster 
* Matthew Arnold (1822–1888), poet and schools inspector
* Thomas Arnold (1823–1900), literary scholar and Catholic convert
* Mary Arnold (1825–1888), married (1) Alfred Twining, (2) Rev. John Simeon Hiley, (3) Rev. Robert Hayes
* Rev. Edward Penrose Arnold (1826–1878), clergyman and schools inspector
* William Delafield Arnold (1828–1859), author and colonial administrator
* Susanna Elizabeth Lydia Arnold (1830–1911), married John Wakefield Cropper
* Frances Trevenen Arnold (1832), died in infancy
* Frances Bunsen Trevenen Whateley Arnold (1833–1923)
* Walter Thomas Arnold (1835–1893)

W. E. Forster and Jane both enjoyed mountaineering; they climbed Mont Blanc in 1859 and in 1860 Jane was one of the first women to stand on the summit of Monte Rosa, which had not been climbed by a woman until 1857. When William Delafield Arnold died in 1859 leaving four orphans, the Forsters adopted them as their own, adding their name to the children&#x27;s surname. One of them was Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster, a Liberal Unionist MP, who eventually became a member of Balfour&#x27;s cabinet. Another was Florence Vere O&#x27;Brien, a diarist, philanthropist and craftswoman who lived in Ireland. Frances Bunsen Trevenen Whateley Arnold, the youngest daughter, never married and died at Fox How in 1923.

Arnold had bought the small estate of Fox How near Ambleside in the Lake District in 1832, and spent many holidays there. On Sunday, 12 June 1842, he died there suddenly of a heart attack &quot;at the height of his powers&quot;, a day before his 47th birthday. He is buried in Rugby School chapel. Thomas the Younger&#x27;s daughter Mary Augusta Arnold, became a well-known novelist under her married name, Mrs. Humphry Ward. His other daughter, Julia, married Leonard Huxley, the son of Thomas Huxley. Their sons were Julian and Aldous Huxley. Julia Arnold founded in 1902 Prior&#x27;s Field School for girls in Godalming, Surrey.

==Reputation==
&quot;The Life of Doctor Arnold&quot;, published two years after his death by one of Arnold&#x27;s former pupils, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, is seen as one of the best works of its class in the language and added to his growing reputation. A popular life of Arnold by the novelist Emma Jane Guyton also appeared. In 1896 his bust was unveiled in Westminster Abbey alongside that of his son, Matthew. &quot;The Times&quot; asserted, &quot;As much as any who could be named, Arnold helped to form the standard of manly worth by which Englishmen judge and submit to be judged.&quot; However, his reputation suffered as one of the &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; in Lytton Strachey&#x27;s book of that title published in 1918.

A more recent public-school headmaster, Michael McCrum of Tonbridge School and Eton College in the 1960s to 1980s, also a churchman and Oxbridge academic (Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and Vice-Chancellor), wrote a biography and reappraisal of Arnold in 1991. He had briefly been a master at Rugby and was married to the daughter of another former headmaster. More recently, a biography entitled &quot;Black Tom&quot; was written by Terence Copley. Both McCrum and Copley seek to restore some lustre to the Arnold legacy, which had been under attack since Strachey&#x27;s sardonic appraisal.

A. C. Benson once observed of Arnold, &quot;A man who could burst into tears at his own dinner-table on hearing a comparison made between St. Paul and St. John to the detriment of the latter, and beg that the subject might never be mentioned again in his presence, could never have been an &quot;easy&quot; companion.&quot;

==Depictions on screen==
Arnold has been played several times in adaptations of &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, including by Sir Cedric Hardwicke in the 1940 film version, Robert Newton in the 1951 film version, Iain Cuthbertson in the 1971 television version, and Stephen Fry in the 2005 television version.

<text>Mentor Graphics Corporation was a US-based electronic design automation (EDA) multinational corporation for electrical engineering and electronics, headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon. Founded in 1981, the company distributed products that assist in electronic design automation, simulation tools for analog mixed-signal design, VPN solutions, and fluid dynamics and heat transfer tools. The company leveraged Apollo Computer workstations to differentiate itself within the computer-aided engineering (CAE) market with its software and hardware.

Mentor Graphics was acquired by Siemens in 2017. The name was retired in 2021 and renamed Siemens EDA, a segment of Siemens Digital Industries Software.

== History ==
Mentor Graphics was founded in 1981 by Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler, and Dave Moffenbeier, all formerly of Tektronix. The company raised $55 million in funding through an initial public offering in 1984. 

Mentor initially wrote software that ran only in Apollo workstations. 

When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.

After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.

Mentor Graphics was purchased by Siemens in 2017. The name was retired in 2021 and renamed Siemens EDA, a segment of Siemens Digital Industries Software.

== Acquisitions ==

=== Timeline ===
=== Related ===

* In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics&#x27; Board and management to discuss the offer. 
*In February 2011, activist investor Carl Icahn offered to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
*In November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor&#x27;s closing price on the previous Friday. The acquisition was completed in March 2017. At this time, this represented Siemen&#x27;s biggest deal in the industrial software sector. Mentor Graphics started to operate as &quot;Mentor, a Siemens Business&quot;. Under the terms of the acquisition, Mentor Graphics kept its headquarters in Wilsonville with workforce intact, and operated as an independent subsidiary.
*In January 2021, Mentor became a division of Siemens and was renamed as Siemens EDA.

== Locations ==
Mentor product development was located in the US, Taiwan, Egypt, Poland, Hungary, Japan, France, Canada, Pakistan, UK, Armenia, India and Russia.

*QuestaSim is a simulator with advanced debug capabilities targeted at complex FPGA&#x27;s and SoC&#x27;s. QuestaSim can be used by users who have experience with ModelSim as it shares most of the common debug features and capabilities. One of the main differences between QuestaSim and Modelsim (besides performance/capacity) is that QuestaSim is the simulation engine for the Questa Platform which includes integration of Verification Management, Formal based technologies, Questa Verification IP, Low Power Simulation and Accelerated Coverage Closure technologies. QuestaSim natively supports SystemVerilog for Testbench, UPF, UCIS, OVM/UVM where ModelSim does not.

<doc id="216877" wikidata="Q279859" url="?curid=216877" title="A1 road (Great Britain)">
<text>The A1, also known as the Great North Road, is the longest numbered road in the United Kingdom, at . It connects London, the capital of England, with Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. The numbering system for A-roads, devised in the early 1920s, was based around patterns of roads radiating from two hubs at London and Edinburgh. The first number in the system, A1, was given to the most important part of that system: the road from London to Edinburgh, joining the two central points of the system and linking the UK&#x27;s two mainland capital cities. It passes through or near north London, Hatfield, Stevenage, Baldock, Biggleswade, Peterborough, Stamford, Grantham, Newark-on-Trent, Retford, Doncaster, Pontefract, York, Wetherby, Ripon, Darlington, Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, Morpeth, Alnwick, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Dunbar, Haddington, Musselburgh, and east Edinburgh.

It was designated by the Ministry of Transport in 1921, and for much of its route it followed various branches of the historic Great North Road, the main deviation being between Boroughbridge and Darlington. The course of the A1 has changed where towns or villages have been bypassed, and where new alignments have taken a slightly different route. Between the North Circular Road in London and Morpeth in Northumberland, the road is a dual carriageway, several sections of which have been upgraded to motorway standard and designated A1(M). Between the M25 (near London) and the A720 (near Edinburgh) the road is part of the unsigned Euroroute E15 from Inverness to Algeciras.

==History==
The A1 is the latest in a series of routes north from London to York and beyond. It was designated in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. The earliest documented northern routes are the roads created by the Romans during the period from AD 43 to AD 410, which consisted of several &quot;itinera&quot; (plural of &quot;iter&quot;) recorded in the Antonine Itinerary. A combination of these were used by the Anglo-Saxons as the route from London to York, and together became known as Ermine Street. Ermine Street later became known as the Old North Road. Part of this route in London is followed by the current A10. By the 12th century, because of flooding and damage by traffic, an alternative route out of London was found through Muswell Hill, and became part of the Great North Road. A turnpike road, New North Road and Canonbury Road (A1200 road), was constructed in 1812 linking the start of the Old North Road around Shoreditch with the Great North Road at Highbury Corner. While the route of the A1 outside London mainly follows the Great North Road route used by mail coaches between London and Edinburgh, within London the coaching route is only followed through Islington.

The Ferryhill Cut was opened in 1923. A number of bypasses were built from 1926 onwards, including around Barnet and Hatfield in 1927, but it was not until that they were renumbered A1. The Chester-le-Street bypass, opened in 1931, was the first bypass to be built as a dual carriageway. In 1960 Stamford, Biggleswade and Doncaster were bypassed, as was Retford in 1961. Baldock, Eaton Socon and Buckden were bypassed in 1967. During the early 1970s plans to widen the A1 along Archway Road in London were abandoned after considerable opposition and four public inquiries during which road protesters disrupted proceedings. The scheme was finally dropped in 1990. The Hatfield cut-and-cover was opened in 1986.

A proposal to upgrade the whole of the A1 to motorway status was investigated by the government in 1989 but was dropped in 1995, along with many other schemes, in response to road protests against other road schemes (including the Newbury Bypass and the M3 extension through Twyford Down).

==Inns==

The inns on the road, many of which still survive, were staging posts on the coach routes, providing accommodation, stabling for the horses and replacement mounts. Few of the surviving coaching inns can be seen while driving on the A1, because the modern route now bypasses the towns with the inns.

==Route==

The A1 runs from New Change in the City of London at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral to the centre of Edinburgh. It shares its London terminus with the A40, in the City area of Central London. It runs out of London via St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand and Aldersgate Street, through Islington (where Goswell Road and Upper Street form part of its route), up Holloway Road, through Highgate, and Barnet.

The road enters Hertfordshire just before Potters Bar, near the junction with the M25 at the South Mimms Services. The route here becomes the A1(M) and subsequently passes through Hatfield, Welwyn, Stevenage, Baldock. But it once again becomes a dual carriageway from Baldock Junction 10 through Biggleswade, Sandy, several small villages to Buckden then on to Alconbury Junction 14. Junctions 11, 12 and 13 are still to be planned/built. Several groups along this non motorway stretch are actively campaigning for an upgrade to modern standards.

Continuing north, the A1 runs on modern bypasses around Stamford, Grantham, Newark-on-Trent, Retford, Bawtry, Doncaster, Knottingley, Garforth, Wetherby, Knaresborough, Boroughbridge, Scotch Corner, Darlington, Newton Aycliffe, Durham and Chester-le-Street, past the Angel of the North sculpture and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, through the western suburbs of Newcastle upon Tyne, Morpeth, Alnwick, Berwick-upon-Tweed, into Scotland at Marshall Meadows, past Haddington and Musselburgh before arriving in Edinburgh at the East End of Princes Street near Waverley Station, at the junction of the A7, A8 and A900 roads.

Scotch Corner, in North Yorkshire, marks the point where before the M6 was built, the traffic for Glasgow and the west of Scotland diverged from that for Edinburgh. As well as a hotel there have been a variety of sites for the transport café, now subsumed as a motorway services.

There are five roundabouts north of the Sterling corner junction: Biggleswade south, Biggleswade north, Sandy A603, Black Cat A428/A4211, lastly Buckden, after which there are no more roundabouts for until the Berwick A1167. The Black Cat roundabout is due to be removed in 2025.

==Overview and post-First World War developments==

A section of the road in North Yorkshire, from Walshford to Dishforth, was upgraded to motorway standard in 1995. Neolithic remains and a Roman fort were discovered.

A section of the road from Alconbury to Peterborough was upgraded to motorway standard at a cost of £128 million (£ as of 2025), which opened in 1998 requiring moving the memorial to Napoleonic prisoners buried at Norman Cross.

A number of sections between Newcastle and Edinburgh were dualled between 1999 and 2004, including a section from Spott Wood to Oswald Dean in 1999, sections from Bowerhouse to Spott Road and from Howburn to Houndwood in 2002–2003 and the &quot;A1 Expressway&quot;, from Haddington and Dunbar in 2004. The total cost of these works was £50 million.

Plans to dual the single carriageway section of road north of Newcastle upon Tyne were shelved in 2006 as they were not considered a regional priority by central government. The intention was to dual the road between Morpeth and Felton and between Adderstone and Belford.

In 1999 a section of A1(M) between Bramham and Hook Moor opened to traffic along with the extension of the M1 from Leeds. Under a DBFO contract, sections from Wetherby to Walshford and Darrington to Hook Moor were opened in 2005 and 2006.

==Recent developments==
===A1 Peterborough to Blyth grade separated junctions===
Between September 2006 and October 2009 six roundabouts on the A1 and the A1(M) to Alconbury were replaced with grade-separated junctions. These provide a fully grade-separated route between the Buckden roundabout (just north of St Neots and approximately north of the Black Cat roundabout) and just north of Morpeth. This project cost £96 million.

===A1(M) Bramham to Wetherby motorway===
Upgrading the of road to dual three-lane motorway standard between the Bramham/A64 junction to north of Wetherby to meet the section of motorway at a cost of £70 million began in 2006, including a road alongside for non-motorway traffic. The scheme&#x27;s public inquiry began on 18 October 2006 and the project was designed by James Poyner. Work began in May 2007, the motorway section opened in July 2009 and remaining work on side roads was still ongoing in late August and was expected to be completed by the end of 2009.

===A1(M) Dishforth to Leeming motorway===
Upgrading of the existing dual carriageway to dual three-lane motorway standard, with a local road alongside for non-motorway traffic, between Dishforth (A1(M)/A168 junction) and Leeming Bar, began in March 2009 and opened to traffic on or about the scheduled date of 31 March 2012.

===A1(M) Leeming to Barton motorway===
It had originally been proposed that the road would be upgraded to motorway from Dishforth to Barton (between Scotch Corner and Darlington), which was the start of current northernmost section of A1(M). In 2010 the section between Leeming and Barton was cancelled as part of government spending cuts but it was reinstated in December 2012. Work began on 3 April 2014 and was expected to be completed by Spring 2017, but only reached completion in March 2018 due in part to significant Roman-era archaeological finds along the route of the motorway. Completion has provided a continuous motorway-standard road between Darrington (south of M62 junction) and Washington, and given the North East and North Yorkshire full motorway access to London (via the M1 at Darrington and Hook Moor).

Councils in the north east have called for the section from Hook Moor in Yorkshire (where the M1 link road joins the A1(M)) to Washington to be renumbered as the M1. They maintain that this would raise the profile of the north-east and be good for business.

===A1 (Gateshead Western Bypass)===
In his Autumn Statement on 5 December 2012, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Government would upgrade a section of road from two to three lanes in each direction within the highway boundary at Lobley Hill (between Coal House and the Metro Centre), Gateshead at a cost of £64 million and create parallel link roads between the Lobley Hill and Gateshead Quay junctions. The same Road investment strategy announcement said that the remaining section of road between Birtley and Coal House will also be widened to three lanes each way, alongside the replacement of the Allerdene Bridge. A modified scheme commenced in August 2014 and was open to traffic in June 2016. The road is now three lanes each way with lane 3 narrower than lanes 1 and 2 so that all existing bridges remained as originally built.

The A1 around Durham, Gateshead and Newcastle has seen a number of incarnations, following routes through, to the east and to the west of both Gateshead and Newcastle. See A1 (Newcastle upon Tyne) for more information.

===Ellington to Fen Ditton scheme===
The A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton scheme, also known as the Huntingdon Bypass required a redesigned interchange at Brampton. As a result the A1 was widened to a D3 standard from the current end of the A1(M) to the slip roads connecting directly onto the A14. South of the new Interchange the A1 was realigned but kept as a 2 lane dual carriageway. This scheme was meant to result in the A1 becoming the A1(M) along the upgraded sections, however the legal proceedings for this did not take place, and instead features a large amount of restrictions, similar to a motorway. This scheme was opened in December 2019.
===A52 Grantham Southern Relief Road===
The new junction is now complete on the A1 south of Grantham, Highways England constructed 4 new slip roads to connect the A1 Trunk Road to the new Grantham Southern Relief Road (A52) being constructed by Lincolnshire County Council. This will create a southern entry to Grantham and also to the site known as the &#x27;King 31 Development&#x27;. The Grade Separated Junction on the A1 was opened to traffic in December 2022. The on-going phase three is the Southern Quadrant Link Road (SQLR), which will complete the relief road and is expected to be completed in 2025.

A1 Scotswood to North Brunton Upgrade

The A1 road, a key route in Great Britain, has seen several major developments in recent years. Notably, the A1 Scotswood to North Brunton upgrade, completed in November 2022, represents a significant enhancement of the route. This project, valued at approximately £110 million, added an additional lane in each direction between junctions 74 and 79, covering a distance of five miles. It was expected to boost economic activity in the North East by improving access to services, businesses, and housing. The upgrade also had a positive environmental impact, reducing carbon emissions by over 8,000 tonnes, thanks to methods such as reusing materials and employing sustainable drainage systems.

==Ongoing developments==

=== A1 Birtley to Coal House Widening ===
The A1 between Junctions 65 (Birtley) &amp; 67 (Coal House) on the Newcastle Bypass is currently being widened to a D4 cross section from the existing D2 cross section, this includes replacing the existing bridge over the East Coast Main Line. Works started in December 2021 and are due to be completed in 2025. Currently, the A1 Birtley to Coal House widening project is still ongoing. In recent developments, a contraflow system was installed on the A1 between junctions 65 (Birtley) and 66 (Eighton Lodge) in May 2024. This shift to a contraflow will help improve safety and reduce congestion while widening bridges and constructing new lanes.

Additionally, the project has seen the successful opening of the new Allerdene bridge for northbound traffic in September 2023. The North Dene footbridge, designed to enhance pedestrian and cyclist journeys, is also expected to open later in 2024. These improvements aim to increase capacity and support the regional economy by making travel safer and more efficient.

===Black Cat roundabout replacement===
In December 2014 a scheme was announced to dual the A428 from the A1/A421 Black Cat roundabout to Cambourne. This would include significant works to the A1/A421 Black Cat roundabout. The existing traffic signal controlled roundabout would be replaced with a grade-separated junction. The new Grade Separated Junction would allow the A1 and A421 traffic to pass over each other, with a middle level roundabout connecting them together including links to local roads. Many direct accesses on the A1 would be stopped up and diverted onto new local access roads. The scheme started construction in late 2023, the works currently underway along the A1. When completed this will remove one of the last 5 roundabouts on the A1 from Sterling corner to the Berwick bypass. The replacement of the Black Cat Roundabout as part of the A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet improvements project is currently ongoing. The £1 billion infrastructure scheme aims to significantly improve traffic flow and connectivity across the region. The project will upgrade the Black Cat roundabout into a modern, free-flowing junction, with work set to continue until 2027. As of 2024, National Highways has made substantial progress, including the installation of key infrastructure such as bridges and slip roads. Recent developments include the completion of major bridge installations, with several closures planned to accommodate large-scale construction activities, such as the installation of steel beams for the Roxton Road bridge.

The A1 continues to undergo significant improvement as part of the broader effort to modernise the UK’s transport infrastructure. National Highways, responsible for overseeing roadworks on motorways and major A roads, has outlined plans for continued investment in the A1 to support both local traffic and freight transport. These upgrades are expected to alleviate congestion, improve safety, and support the economy by enhancing the accessibility of key business and service hubs across the North East.

These projects are part of an ongoing effort to expand the A1 from its current dual carriageway sections into full motorway status in certain areas, a development that is expected to improve traffic flow and reduce accidents.

==Proposed developments==
===A1(M) Red House to Darrington motorway===
In the &quot;Road investment strategy&quot; announced to Parliament by the Department for Transport and Secretary of State for Transport on 1 December 2014, planning will begin to upgrade the road in South Yorkshire to raise the last non-motorway section from Red House to Darrington to motorway standard. Once completed, it will provide a continuous motorway-standard road between Blyth, Nottinghamshire and Washington, Tyne and Wear and will provide the North East and Yorkshire with full motorway access to London via the M1, M62 and M18. It will also improve safety along this route, as well as creating a new corridor to the North East, and reducing congestion on the M1 around Sheffield and Leeds. This is the only missing link of motorway on the strategic M1/M18/A1(M) route London to Washington. 

===A1 Morpeth to Ellingham===
The announcement then said that the road from Morpeth to Ellingham would be upgraded to dual carriageway. The selection of the preferred route was scheduled for the year 2017, with construction due to begin in 2019. In response to questions regarding transport in the north, Highways England stated that a new dual carriageway section between Morpeth and Felton and also that of Alnwick to Ellingham would start in 2021 with full opening in 2023. However in June 2022 UK government minister Grant Shapps delayed a decision about a Development Consent Order signing off on National Highways&#x27; plans until December 2022.

===A1 North of Ellingham===
Measures were also announced to enhance the performance and safety of the A1 north of Ellingham to include three sections of climbing lanes, five junctions with improved right turn refuges, and better crossing facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. Start of construction is scheduled for 2018.

===A46 Newark northern bypass scheme===

It was then also announced that planning would begin to upgrade the Newark northern bypass to dual carriageway, and the A46 junction with the A1 will be replaced to support nearby housing growth and improve links from the A1 to Newark and Lincoln. The DCO is due to be submitted in early 2024, with construction likely to start in 2026 if approved.

===A1(M) Doncaster By-pass===
It was also announced that the Doncaster By-pass, which is the oldest stretch of two-lane motorway still in service, would be upgraded to dual three lanes. This will relieve local congestion and provide the capacity needed to make the A1 an alternative (and better) strategic route to the north east.

===Sandy-Beeston By-pass===

In 2003 a proposal for a bypass of Sandy and Beeston, Bedfordshire, was put forward as a green-lighted scheme as part of a government multi-modal study, with a cost of £67 million. However, the Highways Agency was unwilling to confirm the information as the study was preliminary and intended for future publication. In 2008 the proposal was submitted for consideration in the pre-2013/14 Regional Funding Advice 2 Programme of the East of England Development Agency.

===A1(M) technology enhancements and upgrades; A1 East of England feasibility study===
It was also announced in 2014 that new technology would be implemented to bring the road to motorway standards, including detection loops, CCTV cameras and variable message signs to provide better information for drivers and active traffic management across Tyne and Wear, while Junction 6 (Welwyn North) to Junction 8 (Hitchin) would be upgraded to smart motorway, including widening of a two-lane section to dual three lanes and hard shoulder running. This plan to upgrade to smart motorway has now been cancelled.

A strategic study will examine how to improve the safety and performance of the A1 between Peterborough and the M25, including whether to upgrade the old dual carriageway section to motorway standard.

== A1(M) ==

Some sections of the A1 have been upgraded to motorway standard. These are known as the A1(M) and include:

===M25 to Stotfold===

The M25 to Stotfold section is , and was constructed between 1962 and 1986. The main destinations are Hatfield, Welwyn Garden City, Stevenage, and Letchworth. It opened in five stages: junctions 1 to 2 in 1979; 2 to 4 in 1986; 4 to 6 in 1973; 6 to 8 in 1962; and 8 to 10 in 1967.

===Alconbury to Peterborough===

The Alconbury to Peterborough section is , and opened in 1998.

===Doncaster Bypass===

The Doncaster By-pass opened in 1961 and is one of the oldest sections of motorway in Britain. It is long, and runs from Blyth to Carcroft.

===Darrington to Gateshead===

The Darrington to Gateshead section was constructed between 1965 and 2018. It is , and opened in sections:
* Junctions 56 to 59 in 1965
* Junctions 59 to 63 in 1969
* Junctions 63 to 65 in 1970
* Walshford to 49 in 1995
* Junctions 43 to 44 in 1999
:When this section opened it ended at a temporary terminus south of the M1. There was a final exit into Micklefield Village for non-motorway traffic onto what is now the access road. During the first week of June 2009, Junctions 44 and 45 were renumbered 43 and 44. At the same time the A1/A659 Grange Moor junction became A1(M) Junction 45. As a result many atlases show incorrect junction numbering for this stretch of motorway.
* Junction 46 to temporary junction at Walshford opened in 2005
* Junction 40 to south of 43 opened in 2005 &amp; 2006
:The northern section of the upgrade, bypassing Fairburn village opened in April 2005 with a temporary connection with the A1 between Fairburn and Brotherton. The southern section, with a free-flow interchange with the M62 motorway opened on 13 January 2006.
* Junctions 44 to 46 opened in 2009
* Junctions 49 to 51 opened as of 31 March 2012. Work began in March 2009 to upgrade the Dishforth to Leeming section to dual three-lane motorway standard with existing connections being replaced by two new junctions. This work was completed on 31 March 2012.
* Junctions 51 to 56 opened in 2017 &amp; 2018.

<text>Northrop Corporation was an American aircraft manufacturer from its formation in 1939 until its 1994 merger with Grumman to form Northrop Grumman. The company is known for its development of the flying wing design, most successfully the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.
==History==
Jack Northrop founded 3 companies using his name. The first was the Avion Corporation in 1928, which was absorbed in 1929 by the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation as a subsidiary named &quot;Northrop Aircraft Corporation&quot; (and later became part of Boeing). The parent company moved its operations to Kansas in 1931, and so Jack, along with Donald Douglas, established a &quot;Northrop Corporation&quot; located in El Segundo, California, which produced several successful designs, including the Northrop Gamma and Northrop Delta. However, labor difficulties led to the dissolution of the corporation by Douglas in 1937, and the plant became the El Segundo Division of Douglas Aircraft.

Northrop still sought his own company, and so in 1939 he established the &quot;Northrop Corporation&quot; in nearby Hawthorne, California, a site located by co-founder Moye Stephens. The corporation ranked 100th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. It was there that the P-61 Black Widow night fighter, the B-35 and YB-49 experimental flying wing bombers, the F-89 Scorpion interceptor, the SM-62 Snark intercontinental cruise missile, and the F-5 Freedom Fighter economical jet fighter (and its derivative, the successful T-38 Talon trainer) were developed and built.

The F-5 was so successful that Northrop spent much of the 1970s and 1980s attempting to duplicate its success with similar lightweight designs. Their first attempt to improve the F-5 was the N-300, which featured much more powerful engines and moved the wing to a higher position to allow for increased ordnance that the higher power allowed. The N-300 was further developed into the P-530 with even larger engines, this time featuring a small amount of &quot;bypass&quot; (turbofan) to improve cooling and allow the engine bay to be lighter, as well as much more wing surface. The P-530 also included radar and other systems considered necessary on modern aircraft. When the Light Weight Fighter program was announced, the P-530 was stripped of much of its equipment to become the P-600, and eventually the YF-17 Cobra, which lost the competition to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.

Nevertheless, the YF-17 Cobra was modified with help from McDonnell Douglas to become the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet in order to fill a similar lightweight design competition for the US Navy. Northrop intended to sell a de-navalized version as the F-18L, but the basic F-18A continued to outsell it, leading to a long and fruitless lawsuit between the two companies. Northrop continued to build much of the F-18 fuselage and other systems after this period, but also returned to the original F-5 design with yet another new engine to produce the F-20 Tigershark as a low-cost aircraft. This garnered little interest in the market, and the project was dropped.

In 1985, Northrop bought northrop.com, the sixth .com domain created.

Based on the experimentation with flying wings the company developed the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber of the 1990s.

In 1994, partly due to the loss of the Advanced Tactical Fighter contract to Lockheed Corporation and the removal of their proposal from consideration for the Joint Strike Fighter competition, the company bought Grumman to form Northrop Grumman.

<text>Electronic design automation (EDA), also referred to as electronic computer-aided design (ECAD), is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems such as integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. The tools work together in a design flow that chip designers use to design and analyze entire semiconductor chips. Since a modern semiconductor chip can have billions of components, EDA tools are essential for their design; this article in particular describes EDA specifically with respect to integrated circuits (ICs).

== History ==

=== Early days ===
The earliest electronic design automation is attributed to IBM with the documentation of its 700 series computers in the 1950s.

Prior to the development of EDA, integrated circuits were designed by hand and manually laid out. Some advanced shops used geometric software to generate tapes for a Gerber photoplotter, responsible for generating a monochromatic exposure image, but even those copied digital recordings of mechanically drawn components. The process was fundamentally graphic, with the translation from electronics to graphics done manually; the best-known company from this era was Calma, whose GDSII format is still in use today. By the mid-1970s, developers started to automate circuit design in addition to drafting and the first placement and routing tools were developed; as this occurred, the proceedings of the Design Automation Conference catalogued the large majority of the developments of the time.

The next era began following the publication of &quot;Introduction to VLSI Systems&quot; by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway in 1980, and is considered the standard textbook for chip design. The result was an increase in the complexity of the chips that could be designed, with improved access to design verification tools that used logic simulation. The chips were easier to lay out and more likely to function correctly, since their designs could be simulated more thoroughly prior to construction. Although the languages and tools have evolved, this general approach of specifying the desired behavior in a textual programming language and letting the tools derive the detailed physical design remains the basis of digital IC design today.

The earliest EDA tools were produced academically. One of the most famous was the &quot;Berkeley VLSI Tools Tarball&quot;, a set of UNIX utilities used to design early VLSI systems. Widely used were the Espresso heuristic logic minimizer, responsible for circuit complexity reductions and Magic, a computer-aided design platform. Another crucial development was the formation of MOSIS, a consortium of universities and fabricators that developed an inexpensive way to train student chip designers by producing real integrated circuits. The basic concept was to use reliable, low-cost, relatively low-technology IC processes and pack a large number of projects per wafer, with several copies of chips from each project remaining preserved. Cooperating fabricators either donated the processed wafers or sold them at cost, as they saw the program as helpful to their own long-term growth.

===Commercial birth===

1981 marked the beginning of EDA as an industry. For many years, the larger electronic companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, Tektronix and Intel, had pursued EDA internally, with managers and developers beginning to spin out of these companies to concentrate on EDA as a business. Daisy Systems, Mentor Graphics and Valid Logic Systems were all founded around this time and collectively referred to as DMV. In 1981, the U.S. Department of Defense additionally began funding of VHDL as a hardware description language. Within a few years, there were many companies specializing in EDA, each with a slightly different emphasis.

The first trade show for EDA was held at the Design Automation Conference in 1984 and in 1986, Verilog, another popular high-level design language, was first introduced as a hardware description language by Gateway Design Automation. Simulators quickly followed these introductions, permitting direct simulation of chip designs and executable specifications. Within several years, back-ends were developed to perform logic synthesis.

=== Modern day ===

Current digital flows are extremely modular, with front ends producing standardized design descriptions that compile into invocations of units similar to cells without regard to their individual technology. Cells implement logic or other electronic functions via the utilisation of a particular integrated circuit technology. Fabricators generally provide libraries of components for their production processes, with simulation models that fit standard simulation tools.

Most analog circuits are still designed in a manual fashion, requiring specialist knowledge that is unique to analog design (such as matching concepts). Hence, analog EDA tools are far less modular, since many more functions are required, they interact more strongly and the components are, in general, less ideal.

EDA for electronics has rapidly increased in importance with the continuous scaling of semiconductor technology. Some users are foundry operators, who operate the semiconductor fabrication facilities (&quot;fabs&quot;) and additional individuals responsible for utilising the technology design-service companies who use EDA software to evaluate an incoming design for manufacturing readiness. EDA tools are also used for programming design functionality into FPGAs or field-programmable gate arrays, customisable integrated circuit designs.
== Software focuses ==
=== Design ===

Design flow primarily remains characterised via several primary components; these include:
* High-level synthesis (additionally known as behavioral synthesis or algorithmic synthesis) – The high-level design description (e.g. in C/C++) is converted into RTL or the register transfer level, responsible for representing circuitry via the utilisation of interactions between registers.
*Logic synthesis – The translation of RTL design description (e.g. written in Verilog or VHDL) into a discrete netlist or representation of logic gates.
*Schematic capture – For standard cell digital, analog, RF-like Capture CIS in Orcad by Cadence and ISIS in Proteus.
*Layout – usually schematic-driven layout, like Layout in Orcad by Cadence, ARES in Proteus

=== Simulation ===
* Transistor simulation – low-level transistor-simulation of a schematic/layout&#x27;s behavior, accurate at device-level.
* Logic simulation – digital-simulation of an RTL or gate-netlist&#x27;s digital (Boolean 0/1) behavior, accurate at Boolean-level.
* Behavioral simulation – high-level simulation of a design&#x27;s architectural operation, accurate at cycle-level or interface-level.
* Hardware emulation – Use of special purpose hardware to emulate the logic of a proposed design. Can sometimes be plugged into a system in place of a yet-to-be-built chip; this is called in-circuit emulation.
* Technology CAD simulate and analyze the underlying process technology. Electrical properties of devices are derived directly from device physics

=== Analysis and verification ===
* Functional verification: ensures logic design matches specifications and executes tasks correctly. Includes dynamic functional verification via simulation, emulation, and prototypes.
* RTL Linting for adherence to coding rules such as syntax, semantics, and style.
*Clock domain crossing verification (CDC check): similar to linting, but these checks/tools specialize in detecting and reporting potential issues like data loss, meta-stability due to use of multiple clock domains in the design.
* Formal verification, also model checking: attempts to prove, by mathematical methods, that the system has certain desired properties, and that some undesired effects (such as deadlock) cannot occur.
* Equivalence checking: algorithmic comparison between a chip&#x27;s RTL-description and synthesized gate-netlist, to ensure functional equivalence at the &quot;logical&quot; level.
* Static timing analysis: analysis of the timing of a circuit in an input-independent manner, hence finding a worst case over all possible inputs.
* Layout extraction: starting with a proposed layout, compute the (approximate) electrical characteristics of every wire and device. Often used in conjunction with static timing analysis above to estimate the performance of the completed chip.
* Electromagnetic field solvers, or just field solvers, solve Maxwell&#x27;s equations directly for cases of interest in IC and PCB design. They are known for being slower but more accurate than the layout extraction above.
* Physical verification, PV: checking if a design is physically manufacturable, and that the resulting chips will not have any function-preventing physical defects, and will meet original specifications.

=== Manufacturing preparation ===
* Mask data preparation or MDP - The generation of actual lithography photomasks, utilised to physically manufacture the chip.
** &quot;Chip finishing&quot; which includes custom designations and structures to improve manufacturability of the layout. Examples of the latter are a seal ring and filler structures. 
** Producing a &quot;reticle layout&quot; with test patterns and alignment marks. 
**&quot;Layout-to-mask preparation&quot; that enhances layout data with graphics operations, such as resolution enhancement techniques (RET) – methods for increasing the quality of the final photomask. This also includes optical proximity correction (OPC) or inverse lithography technology (ILT) – the up-front compensation for diffraction and interference effects occurring later when chip is manufactured using this mask.
** &quot;Mask generation&quot; – The generation of flat mask image from hierarchical design.
** &quot;Automatic test pattern generation&quot; or ATPG – The generation of pattern data systematically to exercise as many logic-gates and other components as possible.
** &quot;Built-in self-test&quot; or BIST – The installation of self-contained test-controllers to automatically test a logic or memory structure in the design

=== Functional safety ===
* Functional safety analysis, systematic computation of failure in time (FIT) rates and diagnostic coverage metrics for designs in order to meet the compliance requirements for the desired safety integrity levels.
* Functional safety synthesis, add reliability enhancements to structured elements (modules, RAMs, ROMs, register files, FIFOs) to improve fault detection / fault tolerance. This includes (not limited to) addition of error detection and / or correction codes (Hamming), redundant logic for fault detection and fault tolerance (duplicate / triplicate) and protocol checks (interface parity, address alignment, beat count)
* Functional safety verification, running of a fault campaign, including insertion of faults into the design and verification that the safety mechanism reacts in an appropriate manner for the faults that are deemed covered.

=== Acquisitions ===
Many EDA companies acquire small companies with software or other technology that can be adapted to their core business. Most of the market leaders are amalgamations of many smaller companies and this trend is helped by the tendency of software companies to design tools as accessories that fit naturally into a larger vendor&#x27;s suite of programs on digital circuitry; many new tools incorporate analog design and mixed systems. This is happening due to a trend to place entire electronic systems on a single chip.

<doc id="216884" wikidata="Q1663799" url="?curid=216884" title="Inline expansion">
<text>In computing, inline expansion, or inlining, is a manual or compiler optimization that replaces a function call site with the body of the called function. Inline expansion is similar to macro expansion, but occurs during compilation, without changing the source code (the text), while macro expansion occurs prior to compilation, and results in different text that is then processed by the compiler.

Inlining is an important optimization, but has complicated effects on performance. As a rule of thumb, some inlining will improve speed at very minor cost of space, but excess inlining will hurt speed, due to inlined code consuming too much of the instruction cache, and also cost significant space. A survey of the modest academic literature on inlining from the 1980s and 1990s is given in Peyton Jones &amp; Marlow 1999.

==Overview==
Inline expansion is similar to macro expansion as the compiler places a new copy of the function in each place it is called. Inlined functions run a little faster than the normal functions as function-calling-overheads are saved, however, there is a memory penalty. If a function is inlined 10 times, there will be 10 copies of the function inserted into the code. Hence inlining is best for small functions that are called often. In C++ the member functions of a class, if defined within the class definition, are inlined by default (no need to use the &quot;inline&quot; keyword); otherwise, the keyword is needed. The compiler may ignore the programmer’s attempt to inline a function, mainly if it is particularly large.

Inline expansion is used to eliminate the time overhead (excess time) when a function is called. It is typically used for functions that execute frequently. It also has a space benefit for very small functions, and is an enabling transformation for other optimizations.

Without inline functions, the compiler decides which functions to inline. The programmer has little or no control over which functions are inlined and which are not. Giving this degree of control to the programmer allows for the use of application-specific knowledge in choosing which functions to inline.

Ordinarily, when a function is invoked, control is transferred to its definition by a branch or call instruction. With inlining, control drops through directly to the code for the function, without a branch or call instruction.

Compilers usually implement statements with inlining. Loop conditions and loop bodies need lazy evaluation. This property is fulfilled when the code to compute loop conditions and loop bodies is inlined. Performance considerations are another reason to inline statements.

In the context of functional programming languages, inline expansion is usually followed by the beta-reduction transformation.

A programmer might inline a function manually through copy and paste programming, as a one-time operation on the source code. However, other methods of controlling inlining (see below) are preferable, because they do not precipitate bugs arising when the programmer overlooks a (possibly modified) duplicated version of the original function body, while fixing a bug in the inlined function.

==Effect on performance==
The direct effect of this optimization is to improve time performance (by eliminating call overhead), at the cost of worsening space usage (due to duplicating the function body). The code expansion due to duplicating the function body dominates, except for simple cases, and thus the direct effect of inline expansion is to improve time at the cost of space.

However, the primary benefit of inline expansion is to allow further optimizations and improved scheduling, due to increasing the size of the function body, as better optimization is possible on larger functions. The ultimate impact of inline expansion on speed is complicated, due to multiple effects on performance of the memory system (primarily instruction cache), which dominates performance on modern processors: depending on the specific program and cache, inlining particular functions can increase or decrease performance.

The impact of inlining varies by programming language and program, due to different degrees of abstraction. In lower-level imperative languages such as C and Fortran it is typically a 10–20% speed boost, with minor impact on code size, while in more abstract languages it can be significantly more important, due to the number of layers inlining removes, with an extreme example being Self, where one compiler saw improvement factors of 4 to 55 by inlining.

The direct benefits of eliminating a function call are:
* It eliminates instructions required for a function call, both in the calling function and in the callee: placing arguments on stack or in registers, the function call itself, the function prologue, then at return the function epilogue, the return statement, and then getting the return value back, and removing arguments from stacks and restoring registers (if necessary).
* Due to not needing registers to pass arguments, it reduces register spilling.
* It eliminates having to pass references and then dereference them, when using call by reference (or call by address, or call by sharing).

The primary benefit of inlining, however, is the further optimizations it allows. Optimizations that cross function boundaries can be done without requiring interprocedural optimization (IPO): once inlining has been performed, additional &quot;intra&quot;procedural optimizations (&quot;global optimizations&quot;) become possible on the enlarged function body. For example:
* A constant passed as an argument can often be propagated to all instances of the matching parameter, or part of the function may be &quot;hoisted out&quot; of a loop (via loop-invariant code motion).
* Register allocation can be done across the larger function body.
* High-level optimizations, such as escape analysis and tail duplication, can be performed on a larger scope and be more effective, particularly if the compiler implementing those optimizations is primarily relying on intra-procedural analysis.
These can be done without inlining, but require a significantly more complicated compiler and linker (in case caller and callee are in separate compilation units).

Conversely, in some cases a language specification may allow a program to make additional assumptions about arguments to procedures that it can no longer make after the procedure is inlined, preventing some optimizations. Smarter compilers (such as Glasgow Haskell Compiler) will track this, but naive inlining loses this information.

A further benefit of inlining for the memory system is:
* Eliminating branches and keeping code that is executed close together in memory improves instruction cache performance by improving locality of reference (spatial locality and sequentiality of instructions). This is smaller than optimizations that specifically target sequentiality, but is significant.

The direct cost of inlining is increased code size, due to duplicating the function body at each call site. However, it does not always do so, namely in case of very short functions, where the function body is smaller than the size of a function call (at the caller, including argument and return value handling), such as trivial accessor methods or mutator methods (getters and setters); or for a function that is only used in one place, in which case it is not duplicated. Thus inlining may be minimized or eliminated if optimizing for code size, as is often the case in embedded systems.

Inlining also imposes a cost on performance, due to the code expansion (due to duplication) hurting instruction cache performance. This is most significant if, prior to expansion, the working set of the program (or a hot section of code) fit in one level of the memory hierarchy (e.g., L1 cache), but after expansion it no longer fits, resulting in frequent cache misses at that level. Due to the significant difference in performance at different levels of the hierarchy, this hurts performance considerably. At the highest level this can result in increased page faults, catastrophic performance degradation due to thrashing, or the program failing to run at all. This last is rare in common desktop and server applications, where code size is small relative to available memory, but can be an issue for resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. One way to mitigate this problem is to split functions into a smaller hot inline path (fast path), and a larger cold non-inline path (slow path).

Inlining hurting performance is primarily a problem for large functions that are used in many places, but the break-even point beyond which inlining reduces performance is difficult to determine and depends in general on precise load, so it can be subject to manual optimization or profile-guided optimization. This is a similar issue to other code expanding optimizations such as loop unrolling, which also reduces number of instructions processed, but can decrease performance due to poorer cache performance.

The precise effect of inlining on cache performance is complicated. For small cache sizes (much smaller than the working set prior to expansion), the increased sequentiality dominates, and inlining improves cache performance. For cache sizes close to the working set, where inlining expands the working set so it no longer fits in cache, this dominates and cache performance decreases. For cache sizes larger than the working set, inlining has negligible impact on cache performance. Further, changes in cache design, such as load forwarding, can offset the increase in cache misses.

==Compiler support==
Compilers use a variety of mechanisms to decide which function calls should be inlined; these can include manual hints from programmers for specific functions, together with overall control via command-line options. Inlining is done automatically by many compilers in many languages, based on judgment of whether inlining is beneficial, while in other cases it can be manually specified via compiler directives, typically using a keyword or compiler directive called codice_1. Typically this only hints that inlining is desired, rather than requiring inlining, with the force of the hint varying by language and compiler.

Typically, compiler developers keep the above performance issues in mind, and incorporate heuristics into their compilers that choose which functions to inline so as to improve performance, rather than worsening it, in most cases.

== Implementation ==
Once the compiler has decided to inline a particular function, performing the inlining operation itself is usually simple. Depending on whether the compiler inlines functions across code in different languages, the compiler can do inlining on either a high-level intermediate representation (like abstract syntax trees) or a low-level intermediate representation. In either case, the compiler simply computes the arguments, stores them in variables corresponding to the function&#x27;s arguments, and then inserts the body of the function at the call site.

Linkers can also do function inlining. When a linker inlines functions, it may inline functions whose source is not available, such as library functions (see link-time optimization). A run-time system can inline function as well. Run-time inlining can use dynamic profiling information to make better decisions about which functions to inline, as in the Java Hotspot compiler.

Here is a simple example of inline expansion performed &quot;by hand&quot; at the source level in the C programming language:

int pred(int x)
 if (x == 0)
 return 0;
 else
 return x - 1;


&quot;Before inlining:&quot;

int func(int y) 
 return pred(y) + pred(0) + pred(y+1);


&quot;After inlining:&quot;

int func(int y) 
 int tmp;
 if (y == 0) tmp = 0; else tmp = y - 1; /* (1) */
 if (0 == 0) tmp += 0; else tmp += 0 - 1; /* (2) */
 if (y+1 == 0) tmp += 0; else tmp += (y + 1) - 1; /* (3) */
 return tmp;


Note that this is only an example. In an actual C application, it would be preferable to use an inlining language feature such as parameterized macros or inline functions to tell the compiler to transform the code in this way. The next section lists ways to optimize this code.

=== Inlining by assembly macro expansion ===
Assembler macros provide an alternative approach to inlining whereby a sequence of instructions can normally be generated inline by macro expansion from a single macro source statement (with zero or more parameters). One of the parameters might be an option to alternatively generate a one-time separate subroutine containing the sequence and processed instead by an inlined call to the function.
Example:
 MOVE FROM=array1,TO=array2,INLINE=NO

=== Heuristics ===

A range of different heuristics have been explored for inlining. Usually, an inlining algorithm has a certain code budget (an allowed increase in program size) and aims to inline the most valuable callsites without exceeding that budget. In this sense, many inlining algorithms are usually modeled after the Knapsack problem. To decide which callsites are more valuable, an inlining algorithm must estimate their benefit—i.e. the expected decrease in the execution time. Commonly, inliners use profiling information about the frequency of the execution of different code paths to estimate the benefits.

In addition to profiling information, newer just-in-time compilers apply several more advanced heuristics, such as:

* Speculating which code paths will result in the best reduction in execution time (by enabling additional compiler optimizations as a result of inlining) and increasing the perceived benefit of such paths.
* Adaptively adjusting the benefit-per-cost threshold for inlining based on the size of the compilation unit and the amount of code already inlined.
* Grouping subroutines into clusters, and inlining entire clusters instead of singular subroutines. Here, the heuristic guesses the clusters by grouping those methods for which inlining just a proper subset of the cluster leads to a worse performance than inlining nothing at all.

== Benefits ==
Inline expansion itself is an optimization, since it eliminates overhead from calls, but it is much more important as an enabling transformation. That is, once the compiler expands a function body in the context of its call site—often with arguments that may be fixed constants—it may be able to do a variety of transformations that were not possible before. For example, a conditional branch may turn out to be always true or always false at this particular call site. This in turn may enable dead code elimination, loop-invariant code motion, or induction variable elimination.
In the C example in the previous section, optimization opportunities abound. The compiler may follow this sequence of steps:
* The codice_2 statements in the lines marked (2) and (3) do nothing. The compiler can remove them.
* The condition codice_3 is always true, so the compiler can replace the line marked (2) with the consequent, codice_2 (which does nothing).
* The compiler can rewrite the condition codice_5 to codice_6.
* The compiler can reduce the expression codice_7 to codice_8.
* The expressions codice_8 and codice_10 cannot both equal zero. This lets the compiler eliminate one test.
* In statements such as codice_11 the value of codice_8 is known in the body, and can be inlined.
The new function looks like:
int func(int y) 
 if (y == 0)
 return 0;
 if (y == -1)
 return -2;
 return 2*y - 1;


== Limitations ==
Complete inline expansion is not always possible, due to recursion: recursively inline expanding the calls will not terminate. There are various solutions, such as expanding a bounded amount, or analyzing the call graph and breaking loops at certain nodes (i.e., not expanding some edge in a recursive loop). An identical problem occurs in macro expansion, as recursive expansion does not terminate, and is typically resolved by forbidding recursive macros (as in C and C++).

== Comparison with macros ==
Traditionally, in languages such as C, inline expansion was accomplished at the source level using parameterized macros. Use of true inline functions, as are available in C99, provides several benefits over this approach:
* In C, macro invocations do not perform type checking, or even check that arguments are well-formed, whereas function calls usually do.
* In C, a macro cannot use the return keyword with the same meaning as a function would do (it would make the function that asked the expansion terminate, rather than the macro). In other words, a macro cannot return anything which is not the result of the last expression invoked inside it.
* Since C macros use mere textual substitution, this may result in unintended side-effects and inefficiency due to re-evaluation of arguments and order of operations.
* Compiler errors within macros are often difficult to understand, because they refer to the expanded code, rather than the code the programmer typed. Thus, debugging information for inlined code is usually more helpful than that of macro-expanded code.
* Many constructs are awkward or impossible to express using macros, or use a significantly different syntax. Inline functions use the same syntax as ordinary functions, and can be inlined and un-inlined at will with ease.
Many compilers can also inline expand some recursive functions; recursive macros are typically illegal.

Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer of C++, likes to emphasize that macros should be avoided wherever possible, and advocates extensive use of inline functions.

== Selection methods ==
Many compilers aggressively inline functions wherever it is beneficial to do so. Although it can lead to larger executables, aggressive inlining has nevertheless become more and more desirable as memory capacity has increased faster than CPU speed. Inlining is a critical optimization in functional languages and object-oriented programming languages, which rely on it to provide enough context for their typically small functions to make classical optimizations effective.

== Language support ==
Many languages, including Java and functional languages, do not provide language constructs for inline functions, but their compilers or interpreters often do perform aggressive inline expansion. Other languages provide constructs for explicit hints, generally as compiler directives (pragmas).

In the Ada programming language, there exists a pragma for inline functions.

Functions in Common Lisp may be defined as inline by the codice_1 declaration as such:
 (declaim (inline dispatch))
 (defun dispatch (x)
 (funcall
 (get (car x) &#x27;dispatch) x))
The Haskell compiler GHC tries to inline functions or values that are small enough but inlining may be noted explicitly using a language pragma:
key_function :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; (Bool, Double)
{-# INLINE key_function #-}
=== C and C++ ===
C and C++ have an codice_1 keyword which serves as a hint that inlining may be beneficial; however, in newer versions, its primary purpose is instead to alter the visibility and linking behavior of the function.

<text>Luleå University of Technology is a public research university in Norrbotten County, Sweden. The university has four campuses located in the Arctic Region in the cities of Luleå, Kiruna, Skellefteå, and Piteå.

With more than 19,000 students and about 1,500 employees, Luleå University of Technology is a middle-sized academic institution in Sweden and Scandinavia&#x27;s northernmost Institute of technology.

The university was originally established in 1971 under the name Luleå University College and had its first campus in the suburbs of Porsön in Luleå. But was a couple of years later merged with the Teacher&#x27;s Training College of Luleå and the School of Music of Piteå. In 1997, the institution was granted full university status by the Swedish government and became then thereafter renamed as Luleå University of Technology.

==Research ==
Since 2023 research at Luleå University of Technology has been organized into 11 research areas:

* Built Environment and Infrastructure
* Architecture and Design
* Mines and Minerals
* Mechanical Engineering and Materials
* Energy
* Digitalisation, Automation and Artificial Intelligence
* Space
* Business Administration and Social Sciences
* Health
* Education
* Music and Theatre

The university&#x27;s strategic research foundation lies within the technical field, but most areas are interdisciplinary. A significant part of the research is applied and conducted in close collaboration with industry, other universities, and organizations at regional, national, and international levels.

== Campuses ==

=== Campus Kiruna ===
Campus Kiruna is part of Umeå University and Luleå University of Technology. It is home to space-related research conducted by the Division of Space Technology in close collaboration with the Swedish Institute of Space Physics.

=== Campus Luleå ===
The university campus in Luleå is located in the Porsön area and consists of several main buildings.

* A Building houses education and research in computer science, economics, and social sciences.
* B Building contains the university library, main reception, and administrative offices.
* C Building serves as a central meeting place for students, hosting student union offices and student sports facilities.
* E Building is dedicated to research and education in physics and mechanical engineering.
* F Building accommodates activities in geosciences, civil engineering, and work sciences.

D Building was dismantled in 2024, and according to the university’s future campus plan, a new building will be constructed on the site. Currently, parts of the teacher education and health sciences programs are housed in temporary pavilions due to ongoing renovations.

Nearby, there are amenities such as a grocery store, dental care services, housing, and the science center &quot;Teknikens Hus&quot;.

=== Campus Piteå ===
Campus Piteå focuses on research and education in music and media. Located at the Piteå campus, Orgel Acusticum was built by the renowned European firm Orgelbauwerkstatt Woehl under the direction of Gerald Woehl. The organ consists of 9,000 pipes distributed across 140 registers, with plans to expand to a total of 206 registers.

During its inauguration in October 2012, Luleå University of Technology’s honorary doctor Benny Andersson premiered a specially composed piece, &quot;En skrift i snön&quot; (&quot;A Writing in the Snow&quot;), with lyrics by Kristina Lugn. The organ is owned by the university and partially funded by donors, with the Kempestiftelserna foundation being the largest contributor.

=== Campus Skellefteå ===
Campus Skellefteå is a center for higher education, offering research and education in areas such as wood technology, computer graphics, game development, electrical power engineering, nursing, and social work.

=== Theatre Academy in Luleå ===
The Theatre Academy in Luleå is the acting program at Luleå University of Technology. The program is based in the same building as &quot;Norrbottensteatern&quot; in central Luleå and was established in 1996 as a collaboration between the university and the theater. It educates actors for theater, television, film, and radio.

<text>Northrop Grumman Corporation is an American multinational aerospace and defense company. With 97,000 employees and an annual revenue in excess of $40 billion, it is one of the world&#x27;s largest weapons manufacturers and military technology providers. Formed in 1994 through Northrop Corporation&#x27;s purchase of Grumman Aerospace, Northrop Grumman ranked as the third-largest defense contractor in the world as of 2022. The firm ranked on the 2022 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of America&#x27;s largest corporations.

Northrop Grumman and its industry partners have won the Collier Trophy nine times, most recently for the development and production of the James Webb Space Telescope, an orbiting observatory launched in 2021.

Northrop Grumman leads the development of the B-21 Raider, a long-range, stealth strategic bomber that can drop conventional and nuclear weapons; it will replace Northrop&#x27;s own B-2 Spirit, the world&#x27;s only known stealth bomber. Among its other projects are the production of the solid rocket boosters for NASA&#x27;s Space Launch System program. It was the sole bidder on the Air Force&#x27;s Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, which aims to develop and build a new intercontinental ballistic missile.

==History==

Northrop Grumman can trace its lineage back to the beginning of the 20th century when the Grumman Corporation was founded on Long Island, New York. Here, Leroy R. Grumman established the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation in December 1929. By 1939, the company has expanded and relocated to Bethpage, New York. During World War II the company built most US Navy aircraft. After the war it branched out into making the first aluminum canoes using left-over materials no longer needed for aircraft. Later the firm created a myriad of products such as ballistic missiles, all-weather radars, the Apollo Lunar Module, land and sea-based fighter aircraft and Stealth bombers.

Founded in California in 1939 by Jack Northrop, the Northrop Corporation was reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Northrop made a series of light-weight fighter aircraft such as the F-5, YF-17, and F-20. However, Northrop was best known for it experimental flying wing aircraft, the XB-35 and YB-49 of the late 1940s and early 1950s. These flying wing aircraft, while unsuccessful, would pave the way for the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, on which Northrop was the prime contractor. After the end of the Cold War, Northrop made a series of acquisitions, buying Grumman Aerospace, Westinghouse and TRW Inc. in addition to a number of other enterprises. In 2018, Northrop Grumman completed the purchase of Orbital ATK, which has since been renamed to Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. Northrop Grumman is one of the largest defense contractors in the world.

===1990s===
In 1994, Northrop Aircraft bought Grumman Aerospace, which built the Apollo Lunar Module to create Northrop Grumman (NG) at a cost of $2.1 billion. The company purchased the remaining 51% interest in &quot;Vought Aircraft Company&quot; (Vought) in August 1994 for $130 million taking full control of the company after it had purchased an initial 49% interest in September 1992 for $45 million.

In 1996, the new company acquired substantially all of the defense and electronics systems business of &quot;Westinghouse Electric Corporation,&quot; Westinghouse Electronic Systems, a major manufacturer of radar systems, for $2.9 billion, and Xetron Corporation. In 1997, the defense computer contractor Logicon was added, which had acquired Geodynamics Corporation in March 1996 and Syscon Corporation in February 1995.

Northrop was the prime contractor on the radical YF-23 which was one of two candidates for the Advanced Tactical Fighter but would eventually lose to the F-22 Raptor. Northrop later partnered with Lockheed on the F-35 and serves as a principal member of the Lockheed Martin industry led team.

In 1998, a merger between Northrop Grumman and competitor Lockheed Martin was considered but abandoned after resistance from the Department of Defense and Department of Justice. That same year, it acquired Inter-National Research Institute Inc. In 1999, the company acquired Teledyne Ryan, developer of surveillance systems and unmanned aircraft, California Microwave, Inc., and the Data Procurement Corporation. On March 19, 1999, Northrop Grumman revised its fourth-quarter results to a net loss because of problems related to its dealings with start-up satellite launch company Kistler Aerospace Corp. In 1999, Northrop Grumman and SAIC created AMSEC LLC as a joint venture, which grew &quot;from $100 million in revenue in 2000 to approximately $500 million in fiscal year 2007.&quot;

===2000s===
In 2000, NG acquired Federal Data Corporation, Navia Aviation As, Comptek Research, Inc., and Sterling Software, Inc.

In 2001, the company acquired Litton Industries, a shipbuilder and defense electronics systems provider for the U.S. Navy. During the acquisition process, a new Delaware holding company, NNG, Inc., was formed, which merged with Northrop Grumman through a one-for-one common shares exchange in April 2001. Both Northrop Grumman and Litton became subsidiaries of the new holding company. The original Northrop Grumman Corporation then changed its name to &quot;Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation&quot;; the holding company, NNG, Inc., changed its name to &quot;Northrop Grumman Corporation&quot;. Later that year, Newport News Shipbuilding was added.

On November 1, 2001, Northrop Grumman restated its third-quarter profit after halting work on two ships for American Classic Voyages, which filed for bankruptcy protection.

In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc., which had acquired Braddock Dunn &amp; McDonald (BDM) in 1997, and became the Space Technology sector based in Redondo Beach, California, and the Mission Systems sector based in Reston, Virginia, with sole interest in their space systems and laser systems manufacturing. The Aeronautical division was sold to Goodrich, and the automotive divisions were spun off and retained the TRW name.

There were 15 acquisitions from 1994 to 2003.

Northrop Grumman partnered with EADS from the mid-2000s to offer the KC-30 Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft in the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s KC-X tanker competition. In February 2008 the U.S. Air Force chose KC-30, but in September 2008 the Defense Department suspended the tanker program and in March 2010, Northrop Grumman announced it was withdrawing from the competition, deeming the revised requirements to be weighted in favor of the Boeing KC-46.

On January 1, 2006, Northrop Grumman opened its business sector called &#x27;Technical Services&#x27;. Northrop Grumman and Boeing collaborated on a design concept for NASA&#x27;s upcoming Orion spacecraft (previously the Crew Exploration Vehicle), but the contract went to rival Lockheed Martin on August 31, 2006.

In 2006, Northrop Grumman had intended to bid for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Next-Generation Bomber. Though it has not built a large manned aircraft since wrapping up B-2 Spirit production in the 1990s, the company has &quot;been working hard to turn that perception around, with the skills and capabilities that back it up.&quot; However, by 2009, the teams working on that project were dispersed, as USAF&#x27;s focus turned to a long-range strike instead. Northrop Grumman was one of two teams competing for the Long Range Strike Bomber, and in October 2015 won the contract for the Long Range Strike Bomber.

On July 20, 2007, Northrop Grumman became the sole owner of Burt Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites.

In 2007, Northrop Grumman created &#x27;National Workforce Centers&#x27; as an alternative to offshoring. Locations are Auburn, Alabama; Corsicana, Texas; Fairmont, West Virginia; Helena, Montana; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; and Lebanon, Virginia. The Rapid City, South Dakota location closed in January 2012.

In July 2008, three of four Northrop Grumman employees (Thomas Howes, Marc Gonsalves and Keith Stansell) were freed during Operation Jaque after five years of captivity following their aircraft crash in the Colombian jungle. The fourth employee, Tom Janis, had been killed by the FARC shortly after the crash in 2003.
In January 2008, Northrop Grumman combined its Newport News and Ship Systems sectors into a new business unit named Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding. On March 31, 2011, this was spun off as Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. ().

===2010s===
In November 2010, NASA selected Northrop Grumman for consideration of potential contract awards for heavy lift launch vehicle system concepts, and propulsion technologies.

From 2013, Northrop Grumman participates in the DARPA Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program, and received $2.9 million for Phase 1 and $19 million for Phase 2. The TERN program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.

In July 2013, Northrop Grumman won a training-simulation contract potentially worth $490 million to support the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s next-generation aerial warfare virtual-training network.

As of 2018, Northrop Grumman became the primary contractor for the James Webb Space Telescope.

In October 2015, the US Military announced it had awarded Northrop Grumman the contract for the successor to the B-1 and B-52, subsequently identified as the B-21. The initial value is $21.4 billion, and could eventually be worth up to $80 billion.

In September 2017, Northrop announced its intention to acquire missile and rocket manufacturer Orbital ATK Inc for $9.2 billion: $7.8 billion in cash plus $1.4 billion in net debt. On November 29, 2017, the acquisition was approved by Orbital ATK stockholders and on June 6, 2018, the merger closed after final FTC approval. The acquired company assets and naming were absorbed and become a division named Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.

===2020s===

In June 2020, NASA granted a $935 million contract to Northrop Grumman for the Lunar Gateway Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module, based on its Cygnus cargo spacecraft. In July 2022, Northrop subcontracted Solstar to provide the wireless-enabling technology to enable a Wi-Fi access for employees and equipment in the module.

In September 2020, Northrop Grumman won a $298 million sole-source contract for the Evolved Strategic Satcom program, an anti-jam communications satellite program intended to replace the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite program where Northrop Grumman was a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin.

In December 2020, Northrop sold its federal IT and mission support business to Veritas Capital for $3.4 billion in cash. Veritas placed the group into its Peraton subsidiary. The sale closed in February 2021.

The Mars Ascent Propulsion System for Mars sample-return mission Ascent Vehicle contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman on March 5, 2021. For this Northrop Grumman to make a 3–meter long, two-stage, solid-fueled Mars ascent rocket for the Mars Sample Return mission. This mission is to collect Perseverance&#x27;s samples for return to Earth.

In August 2022, Northrop Grumman announced it was moving production of the engines and structures for its Antares rockets to the U.S. from Russia and Ukraine. The move of Antares production fully to the U.S. will happen through a partnership with Texas-based Firefly Aerospace. Northrop Grumman had purchased Russian RD-181 engines to power the Antares 230+ series, and the rocket’s main body was manufactured by Ukraine’s Yuzhmash State Enterprise.

Northrop Grumman&#x27;s B-21 Raider is forecasted to enter test flights as early as late 2023, with the United States Air Force forecasted to acquire operational aircraft as early as 2030. It was reported in October 2023 that taxi tests for the B-21 Raider were underway.

On September 15, 2023, Northrop Grumman was sanctioned by the Chinese government due to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.

In May 2024, Northrop Grumman unveiled the Manta Ray, an underwater drone developed for the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA). The drone, which resembles its namesake sea creature, was designed to carry out long-duration, long-range military missions, including extended loitering on the sea bottom. The development of the Manta Ray posed several technical challenges, including overcoming the corrosive nature of seawater, preventing sea life from interfering with moving components, and operating under conditions where electromagnetic radiation, including sunlight, does not propagate well. The craft uses two four-bladed propellers on the wings to enhance the propulsion provided by its gliding system, which glides forward while moving up and down in the water column by changing its buoyancy. With an emphasis on minimal human oversight, the creation of the Manta Ray represents a significant advancement in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) technology.

In September 2024, Northrop Grumman won the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) competition to develop and build the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI).

===Aeronautics Systems===
Aeronautics Systems, headquartered in Redondo Beach, California, at the historic Space Park, produces aircraft, spacecraft, high-energy laser systems and microelectronics for the U.S. and other nations. This includes surveillance and reconnaissance, protected communications, intelligence, battle management, strike operations, electronic warfare, to missile defense, Earth observation, space science and space exploration. The B-2 Spirit strategic bomber, the E-8C Joint STARS surveillance aircraft, the RQ-4 Global Hawk, and the T-38 Talon supersonic trainer are used by the US Air Force. The US Army uses Northrop Grumman&#x27;s RQ-5 Hunter unmanned air vehicle, which has been in operational use since 1995. The U.S. Navy uses Northrop Grumman-built aerial vehicles such as the BQM-74 Chukar, RQ-4 Global Hawk-based MQ-4C Triton, MQ-8 Fire Scout, Grumman C-2 Greyhound, Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, and the EA-6B Prowler. Northrop Grumman provides major components and assemblies for different aircraft, such as the F/A-18 Hornet, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the EA-18G Growler, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. Aerospace systems also serves as the contractor for numerous space payloads and is the prime contractor for the James Webb Space Telescope.

===Mission Systems===
Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, headquartered in Linthicum, Maryland, creates military radar, sensors, and related products, including C4I radar systems for air defense, Airspace Management radar systems such as AMASS, and battlefield surveillance systems like the Airborne Reconnaissance Low (ARL). Tactical aircraft sensors include the AN/APG-68 radar, the AN/APG-80 AESA radar, and the AN/APG-83 AESA radar upgrade for the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the AN/APG-77 AESA radar for the F-22 Raptor, and the AN/APG-81 AESA radar for the F-35 Lightning II, and the AN/AAQ-37 electro-optical Distributed Aperture System (DAS) for the F-35, and the APQ-164 Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar for the B-1 Lancer.

Mission Systems produces and maintains the AWACS aerial surveillance systems for the U.S., the United Kingdom, NATO, Japan, and others. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor for the development and integration of the Air Force&#x27;s $2-billion Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program. Northrop Grumman also supports the U.S. ballistic missile program, integrates various command, control and intelligence systems, and provides technical and management services, to governmental and military customers, all with an emphasis on cybersecurity. Many other smaller products are made by Northrop Grumman, such as night vision goggles and secure communications equipment.

===Defense Systems===
The Defense Systems sector, headquartered in McLean, Virginia (with a Herndon mailing address), works on &quot;the entire life cycle of civil and defense platforms and capabilities through a range of services&quot;. Vinnell, a Northrop Grumman subsidiary, provides training and communications for the military. In 2003, it landed a $48 million contract to train the Iraqi Army. In 2005, the company won a $2 billion contract with Virginia to overhaul most of the state&#x27;s IT operations. Later that year, the United Kingdom paid $1.2 billion in a contract with the company to provide maintenance of its AWACS radar.

===Space Systems===
On June 7, 2018, the acquisition of Orbital ATK was completed, and the former company was absorbed in Northrop Grumman as a new business sector called Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. With this acquisition, Northrop Grumman got more involved in the space industry, including the construction and launch of the Cygnus spacecraft. Until 2020 the firm was developing the OmegA space launch vehicle, intended to carry the U.S. government&#x27;s national security satellites into space.

With Northrop Grumman&#x27;s reorganization of its divisions effective January 1, 2020, NGIS was split, with most of the sector merging with other Northrop Grumman businesses into a new Space Systems sector.

On August 8, 2022, Northrop Grumman announced it was moving production of the engines and structures for its Antares rockets to the U.S. from Russia and Ukraine. The move of Antares production fully to the U.S. will happen through a partnership with Texas-based Firefly Aerospace. Northrop Grumman had purchased Russian RD-181 engines to power the Antares 230+ series, and the rocket&#x27;s main body was manufactured by Ukraine&#x27;s Yuzhmash State Enterprise. The new arrangement mainly resolves the break in Antares manufacturing caused by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But in addition to salvaging the Antares rocket series, the cost-sharing deal also helps ensure NASA&#x27;s cargo missions to the International Space Station keep flying regularly and brings muscle to Firefly&#x27;s plan to build a larger rocket called Medium Launch Vehicle (MLV).

Northrop Grumman and Firefly Aerospace will jointly produce an upgraded version of the Antares rocket, which will be known as the Antares 330. Northrop will provide the A330s upper stage, avionics, software and launch site operations. Firefly will supply seven engines and build the A330s largest structure, the first stage booster. Northrop and Firefly will also jointly develop the MLV.

===Affiliated companies and partners===
Remotec, a Tennessee-based subsidiary, is a manufacturer of remote control vehicles for explosive ordnance disposal and hazardous material handling. A UK-based subsidiary, Park Air Systems, provides VHF and UHF ground-to-air communications systems for the civil and defense markets. Northrop Grumman has also worked closely with Antenna Associates, Inc., a manufacturer of Identification friend or foe (IFF)/Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) antennas located in Massachusetts.

In August 2007, Northrop Grumman acquired Scaled Composites in which it had previously owned a 40% stake.

In 2008, Northrop Grumman began working with DHS Systems LLC, manufacturer of the Deployable Rapid Assembly Shelter (DRASH) in New York, as part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Standard Integrated Command Post System program.

== Finances ==
== Corporate governance ==
From 1990 to 2003, before the merger with Grumman in 1994, Kent Kresa was the CEO of the company, who led the serial-acquisition strategy with a total of 15 additional acquisitions from 1994 to 2003, including Litton, Logicon, Westinghouse&#x27;s defense electronics business, Ryan Aeronautical and Newport News Shipbuilding, and TRW. He then retired in 2003 at age 65.

In 2003 Ronald Sugar, the former chief operating officer, took over as CEO. Effective October 1, 2003, Sugar also served as the company chairman of the board.

In January 2010, Wes Bush succeeded as CEO and became company president.

In November 2015, Gloria Flach was named COO. She is the former president of the company&#x27;s electric services sector.

On July 12, 2018, Wes Bush announced that he would step down as CEO effective January 1, 2019, and would remain chairman of the board until July 2019. His successor is Kathy J. Warden, who has served in numerous roles at the company, most recently president and COO.

===Board of directors===
As of July 22, 2022:
* Kathy J. Warden, CEO and president of Northrop Grumman
* David Abney, former chairman and CEO of UPS
* Marianne C. Brown, COO of Sungard
* Donald E. Felsinger, former chairman and CEO of Sempra Energy
* Ann M. Fudge, former chairman and CEO of VMLY&amp;R
* William Hernandez, former CFO of PPG
* Madeleine Kleiner, former general counsel of Hilton
* Karl Krapek, former president and COO of United Technologies
* Graham N. Robinson, president of Stanley Industrial, a business segment of Stanley Black &amp; Decker
* Gary Roughead, former Chief of Naval Operations
* Thomas Schoewe, former CFO of Wal-Mart
* Jim Turley, former chairman and CEO of Ernst &amp; Young
* Mark Welsh, former Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force

==Corporate headquarters==
Since 2011, Northrop Grumman&#x27;s headquarters are in West Falls Church, Virginia (previously Jefferson), unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia.

Prior to 2010, the company was headquartered in Century City, Los Angeles, but announced plans on January 4, 2010, to move to the Washington Metropolitan Area by 2011 to be closer to government customers. CEO Wesley Bush stated that the company needed to be located close to Capitol Hill lawmakers and officials from intelligence and military communities. Northrop Grumman considered sites in Washington, D.C., and in suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. The &quot;Los Angeles Business Journal&quot; wrote &quot;In a way, the announcement was not a surprise&quot; due to the trend of aerospace companies moving to the DC area, the fact that the new CEO is from West Virginia and that CEOs often move corporate headquarters to places that they want the headquarters located. A Los Angeles area economic development consultant described the move announcement as a &quot;structural failure at all levels for Los Angeles County.&quot;

District of Columbia economic development officials were &quot;pitching the city&#x27;s urban hipness and proximity to Capitol Hill power brokers&quot; to Northrop Grumman. Maryland promoted its highly educated workforce and its large number of federal facilities, while Virginia marketed itself as a state with relatively low taxes.

In July 2010, the company announced its purchase of an existing building in Fairfax County and its move in summer 2011. It planned to consolidate its Century City headquarters and its existing Arlington County, Virginia, offices into the new headquarters. It employed about 40,000 in the Washington DC metropolitan area, including DC and surrounding Maryland and Virginia.

==Accolades and criticism==

Northrop Grumman was named Forbes&#x27;s Company of the Year in 2002. Forbes&#x27;s announcement credited the company with &quot;master[ing] the art of innovation.&quot; As of 2019, the company is included on Forbes&#x27; list of &quot;America&#x27;s Best Large Employers&quot;.

Since 2005 Northrop Grumman credits itself with sponsoring educational programs and donating thousands of dollars to various charities.

Many members of the U.S. government have attended company events and spoken highly of the company and its contributions, for example John McCain. In December 2007, Northrop Grumman Corporation was awarded the Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership, the only presidential award recognizing companies for outstanding achievement in employee and community relations.

===Environmental record===
In 2000, Northrop Grumman was designated a Primary Responsible Party under federal Superfund laws at 13 hazardous waste sites and under state Superfund laws at eight sites. The corporation has also been linked to 52 superfund toxic waste sites. Based on 2008 data, Northrop Grumman was the 62nd-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, per the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Northrop Grumman facilities released more than 23,798 pounds of toxic chemicals into the air in that year.

In 2002, the Bethpage Community Park in Bethpage, New York, owned by the company until the 1960s, was closed due to soil contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The company dumped cadmium, arsenic, chromium-tainted sludge, solvents, paints and PCBs at the site between 1949 and 1962. Additionally, two toxic chemical plumes centered under Bethpage Community Park and other surrounding land formerly owned by Grumman or Northrop Grumman have spread to under neighboring houses. In November 2013, the Bethpage Water District filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Northrop Grumman in Federal Court for the Eastern District of New York for contaminating the groundwater in Bethpage.

In 2003, the company was among 84 parties with which the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the state of New York reached an estimated US$15 million settlement for the rehabilitation of the Mattiace Petrochemical Company Superfund site in Glen Cove, Long Island. In the same year, Northrop Grumman agreed to pay $33,214 after EPA inspectors found hazardous waste violations at the Capistrano test site.

As a response to many of the previous claims, the company has stood up as an organization for social responsibility. In 2008, Northrop Grumman launched its Environmental Sustainability program and an EHS Leadership Council, to advance its commitment to environmental performance both internally and externally. The Greenhouse Gas Inventory Project was launched to accurately quantify company-wide greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce the carbon footprint of Northrop Grumman operations, in anticipation of upcoming regulations.

In October 2010, the company was named one of Computerworld&#x27;s Top 12 Green-IT Organizations for its large-scale data center migration effort.

In 2019, Northrop Grumman was named the US&#x27;s largest corporate contributor to water pollution by the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

===Political contributions and governmental ties===
From 1990 to 2002, Northrop Grumman contributed $8.5 million to federal campaigns. According to PAC summary data compiled by Source Watch, the company gave US$1,011,260 to federal candidates in the 2005–2006 election cycle, compared to $10,612,837 given by all defense contractors in the same cycle. This donation amount was only behind that of General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin in the defense industry. The majority of the contributions, 63%, went to Republicans. Former Northrop Grumman Electronics Systems chief James G. Roche served as Secretary of the Air Force for two years under George W. Bush. Roche would eventually be nominated to head the Army, but withdrew his nomination among accusations of mismanaging a contract with Boeing and of failing to properly handle the Air Force sexual assault scandals of 2003. According to CorpWatch, &quot;at least seven former officials, consultants, or shareholders of Northrop Grumman&quot; have held posts &quot;in the Bush administration...including Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Vice-Presidential Chief of Staff I. Lewis Libby, Pentagon Comptroller Dov S. Zakheim, and Sean O&#x27;Keefe, director of NASA.&quot; Wolfowitz and Libby have both since left the government amid scandals.

The company engages third-party lobbying firms in jurisdictions where it has interests. For example, in South Australia it works with lobbying firm CMAX Communications.

===Controversies===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Northrop was the target of several high-profile criminal and civil cases.

In 1995, Robert Ferro, an employee for TRW Inc., a company Northrop Grumman acquired in 2002, discovered that satellite components manufactured for the U.S. Air Force (USAF) were faulty and likely to fail in operation. TRW suppressed Ferro&#x27;s report of the problem and hid the information from the USAF, even after a satellite in space equipped with the faulty components experienced serious anomalies. Ferro later sued Northrop Grumman in federal court under the federal whistle-blower law.

In 1999, the company was sued for knowingly giving the Navy defective aircraft. This suit sought $210 million in damages. Ten years later, on April 2, 2009, Northrop Grumman agreed to pay $325 million to settle the suit. Ferro was awarded $48.8 million of the settlement. Northrop Grumman stated, &quot;it believed that TRW had &#x27;acted properly under its contracts&#x27; and that the company had substantive defenses against the claims.&quot;

In 2001, federal investigators probed NG for fraud of more than $100 million, systematic overcharging for radar jammers and other high-tech devices used in the B-1 bomber, the F-15 fighter and the B-2 Stealth bomber.
In 2003, the company was sued for overcharging the U.S. government for space projects in the 1990s. Northrop Grumman paid $111.2 million to settle out of court.

From August 25 to September 2, 2010, Virginia&#x27;s computer system operated by NG, under a $2.4 billion contract, experienced an outage which resulted in around 45,000 citizens not being able to renew their drivers licenses prior to their expiration. Computer systems for 26 of the state&#x27;s 89 agencies were affected and Governor Bob McDonnell announced that some data may have been permanently lost. In 2010 Northrop Grumman apologized for the outage, and agreed to fund an investigation.

In 2012, controversy began over Northrop Grumman&#x27;s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS), when it missed its first deadline. Since then, the system has had a number of controversial developments. In 2016, a Director, Operational Test and Evaluation found a number of major faults with the system, concluding it was &quot;neither mature nor stable&quot;.

Northrop Grumman&#x27;s supply of weapons to Israel led to protests against the company during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, including blocking the entrances at facilities in San Diego and Plymouth, Minnesota. Students on hunger strike at Brown University named Northrop Grumman as a company to divest from.

===International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) violations===
U.S. State Department investigators found that Litton Industries, a subsidiary acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2000, had provided portions of source code used by guidance and navigation system interfaces aboard Air Force One to a company in Russia in 1998. Northrop Grumman agreed to pay a $15 million fine for 110 violations, occurring between September 1998 and November 1998, of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

Additionally, documents filed by the State Department state that between 1994 and 2003, Northrop Grumman failed to notify the U.S. State Department about the computer guidance systems also being transferred to Angola, Indonesia, Israel, China, Ukraine and Yemen.

<text>Edirne (, ), historically known as Adrianople, is a city in Turkey, in the northwestern part of the province of Edirne in Eastern Thrace. Situated from the Greek and from the Bulgarian borders, Edirne was the second capital city of the Ottoman Empire from 1360s to 1453, before Constantinople became its capital.

The city is a commercial centre for woven textiles, silks, carpets and agricultural products and has a growing tourism industry. It is the seat of Edirne Province and Edirne District. Its population is 180,002 (2022).

In the local elections on March 31, 2024, lawyer Filiz Gencan Akin was elected as the new mayor of the city of Edirne, succeeding Recep Gürkan, who had been mayor for 10 years and did not stand for re-election.

==Names and etymology==

The city was founded and named after the Roman emperor Hadrian as &quot;Hadrianopolis&quot; ( in English, ; in Greek) on the site of the Greek city of Orestias, which was itself founded on an earlier Thracian settlement named &quot;Uskudama.&quot; The Ottoman name &quot;Edirne&quot; (ادرنه) is derived from the Greek name. The name &quot;Adrianople&quot; was used in English until the Turkish adoption of the Latin alphabet in 1928, after which &quot;Edirne&quot; became the internationally recognised name. In Bulgarian the city is known as Одрин (Odrin).

==History==

The area around Edirne has been the site of numerous major battles and sieges starting from the days of the Roman Empire. The vagaries of the border region between Asia and Europe gave rise to Edirne&#x27;s claim to be the most frequently contested spot on earth.

===Antiquity===

The city was reestablished by the Roman Emperor Hadrian on the site of Orestias (named after its mythological founder Orestes), which was itself built on a previous Thracian settlement known as &quot;Uskadama&quot;, &quot;Uskudama&quot;, &quot;Uskodama&quot; or &quot;Uscudama&quot;. Hadrian developed it, adorned it with monuments, and changed its name to &quot;Hadrianopolis&quot; (which would later be pronounced &quot;Adrianopolis&quot; and Anglicised as &quot;Adrianople&quot;). Licinius was defeated here by Constantine I in 324, and Emperor Valens was killed by the Goths here during the Battle of Adrianople in 378.
===Medieval and early Ottoman periods===
In 813, the city was temporarily seized by Khan Krum of Bulgaria who moved its inhabitants to the Bulgarian lands north of the Danube.

During the period of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, the Crusaders were defeated by the Bulgarian Emperor Kaloyan at the Battle of Adrianople in 1205. In 1206 the Latin regime gave Adrianople and the surrounding area to the Byzantine aristocrat Theodore Branas as a hereditary fief. Theodore Komnenos, Despot of Epirus, took possession of it in 1227, but three years later was defeated at Klokotnitsa by Emperor Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria.

In 1362, the Ottomans under Sultan Murad I invaded Thrace and Murad captured Adrianople, probably in 1369 (the date is disputed). The city became &quot;Edirne&quot; in Turkish, reflecting the Turkish pronunciation and Murad moved the Ottoman capital here from Bursa. Mehmed the Conqueror (Sultan Mehmed II) was born in Adrianople, where he came under the influence of Hurufis dismissed by Taşköprüzade in the &quot;Şakaiki Numaniye&quot; as &#x27;certain accursed ones of no significance&#x27;, who were burnt as heretics by Mahmud Pasha.

The city remained the seat of Ottoman power until 1453, when Mehmed II took Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) and moved the capital there. The importance of Edirne to the early Ottomans explains the plethora of early Ottoman mosques, medreses and other monuments that have survived until today although the Eski Sarayı (Old Palace) was largely destroyed, leaving only relatively slight remains. Also, there is evidence of a &quot;scriptorium&quot; in the Ottoman&#x27;s Edirne palace during this period.

Uzunköprü Bridge, the world&#x27;s longest medieval stone bridge, connects Anatolia with the Balkans on the Ergene River and was erected between 1426 and 1443 by the primary architect, Müslihiddin, during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat II.

===Later Ottoman period===
That Adrianople/Edirne continued to hold an important place in Ottoman hearts is reflected in the fact that Sultan Mehmed IV left the Topkapı Palace in Constantinople to die here in 1693.
The wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, spent six weeks in Edirne (then Adrianople) in the spring of 1717 and left an account of her experiences there in her &quot;The Turkish Embassy Letters&quot;. Wearing Turkish dress, Montagu witnessed the passage of Sultan Ahmed III to the mosque, visited the young wife-to-be of his vizier, Damad Ibrahim Pasha and was shown around the Selimiye Mosque.
Adrianople was briefly occupied by imperial Russian troops in 1829 during the Greek War of Independence and in 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. The city suffered a fire in 1905. At that time it had about 80,000 inhabitants, of whom 30,000 were Turks; 22,000 Greeks; 10,000 Bulgarians; 4,000 Armenians; 12,000 Jews; and 2,000 more citizens of unclassified ethnic/religious backgrounds.
Adrianople was a vital fortress defending Constantinople and Eastern Thrace during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. It was briefly occupied by the Bulgarians in 1913, following the Siege of Adrianople. The Great Powers – Britain, Italy, France and Russia – attempted to coerce the Ottoman Empire into ceding Adrianople to Bulgaria during the temporary winter truce of the First Balkan War. The belief that the government was willing to give up the city created a scandal for the Ottoman government in Constantinople (as Adrianople was a former capital of the Empire), leading to the 1913 Ottoman coup d&#x27;état led by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) under Enver Pasha. Although it was victorious in the coup, the CUP was unable to stop the Bulgarians from capturing the city after fighting resumed in the spring. Despite relentless pressure from the Great Powers, the Ottoman empire never officially ceded the city to Bulgaria.

Edirne was swiftly reconquered by the Ottomans during the Second Balkan War under the leadership of Enver Pasha (who proclaimed himself the &quot;second conqueror of Adrianople&quot; after Murad I) following the collapse of the Bulgarian army in the region.

The entire Armenian population of the city was deported to Syria and Mesopotamia during the Armenian genocide on 27–28 October 1915 and 17–18 February 1916. Their property and businesses were sold at low prices to Turkish Muslims.

During the Greek War of Independence, the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) and the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), Balkan-Muslims fled to Edirne and became known as Muhacir.

==== Administrative arrangements ====
Adrianople was a sanjak centre during the Ottoman period and was bound to, successively, the Rumeli Eyalet and Silistre Eyalet before becoming a provincial capital of the Eyalet of Edirne at the beginning of the 19th century; until 1878, the Eyalet of Adrianople comprised the sanjaks of Edirne, Tekfurdağı, Gelibolu, Filibe, and İslimye. After land reforms in 1867, the Eyalet of Adrianople became the Vilayet of Adrianople.

===Turkish Republic===
Adrianople/Edirne was ceded to Greece by the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920, but recaptured and annexed by Turkey after the Greek defeat at the end of the Greco-Turkish War, also known as the Western Front of the larger Turkish War of Independence, in 1922. Under the Greek administration, Edirne (officially known as Adrianople) was the capital of the Adrianople Prefecture.

From 1934 onwards Edirne was the seat of the Second Inspectorate General, in which an Inspector General governed the provinces of Edirne, Çanakkale, Tekirdaĝ and Kırklareli. The Inspectorate Generals governmental posts were abandoned in 1948, but the legal framework for them was only abolished in 1952 during the government of the Democrat Party.

==Ecclesiastical history==

Adrianople was made the seat of a Greek metropolitan and of an Armenian bishop. It is also the centre of a Bulgarian diocese but this is not recognised and has been deprived of a bishop. The city also had some Protestants. The few, mainly foreign Latin Catholics were dependent on the vicariate-apostolic of Constantinople. Adrianople also contained the parish of St. Anthony of Padua (Minors Conventual) and a school for girls conducted by the Sisters of Charity of Agram. The suburb of Karaağaç contained a church (Minor Conventuals), a school for boys (Assumptionists) and a school for girls (Oblates of the Assumption). Each of its mission stations, at Tekirdağ and Alexandroupoli, had a school (Minor Conventuals), and there was one at Gallipoli (the Assumptionists).

Around 1850, from the standpoint of the Eastern Catholic Churches, Adrianople was the residence of a Bulgarian vicar-apostolic for the 4,600 Eastern Catholics of the Ottoman vilayet (province) of Thrace and after 1878 - of the principality of Bulgaria. They had eighteen parishes or missions, six of which were in the principality, with twenty churches or chapels, thirty-one priests, of whom six were Assumptionists and six were Resurrectionists; and eleven schools with 670 pupils. In Adrianople itself there were only a few United Bulgarians, with an Episcopal church of St. Elias, and the churches of St. Demetrius and Sts. Cyril and Methodius. The last is served by the Resurrectionists, who also have a college with ninety pupils. In the suburb of Karaağaç, the Assumptionists have a parish and a seminary with fifty pupils. Besides the Eastern Catholic Bulgarians, the above statistics included the Greek Catholic missions of Malgara (now Malkara) and Daoudili (now Davuteli village in Malkara), with four priests and 200 faithful, because from the civil point of view belonged to the Bulgarian Vicariate.

Later however, the Roman Catholic diocese was discontinued, and exists only in name as a titular metropolitan archbishopric, under the full name &quot;Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto&quot; to distinguish it from several other titular sees named Hadrianopolis.

In 2018, archaeologists discovered remains of a Byzantine church. The church was built around 500 AD and it was an early Byzantine period building.

==Attractions==

Edirne is famed for its many mosques, medreses and other Ottoman monuments.

=== Mosques ===
The Selimiye Mosque, built in 1575 and designed by Turkey&#x27;s greatest architect, Mimar Sinan (c. 1489/1490–1588), is the most important monument in the city and became a UNESCO world heritage site in 2011. It used to have the highest minarets in Turkey, at before the completion of the Çamlıca Mosque in 2019 which features minarets standing at tall. Sinan himself believed the dome to be higher than that of Hagia Sophia, the former Byzantine Orthodox Cathedral in Istanbul, but modern measuring methods seem to suggest otherwise. Named after Sultan Selim II (r. 1566–1574) who commissioned it but did not live to see its completion, the mosque is decorated with Turkish marble and magnificent İznik tiles. It is the centre of a considerable complex of contemporary buildings.

Work started on the Eski Cami (Old Mosque) in1403 but was not completed until 1422. It was designed in what is usually thought of as the Bursa style. Even finer is the Üç Şerefli Mosque (Three-Balconied Mosque) which was built between 1437 and 1447 for Sultan Murad II. It was the largest mosque built in the Ottoman provinces before the conquest of Constantinople. Both these mosques are in the centre of Edirne.

Further away from the centre, the complex of Sultan Beyazid II, built between 184 and 1488, and has a lovely semi-rural location. It is the most complete surviving mosque complex in Edirne, consisting of an &quot;imaret&quot; (soup kitchen), &quot;darüşşifa&quot; (hospital), &quot;timarhane&quot; (asylum), hospice, &quot;tıp medrese&quot; (medical school), &quot;tabhane&quot; (accommodation for dervishes) bakery and assorted depots. Some parts of the complex now house a museum to the history of Islamic medicine.

=== Edirne Palace ===
Edirne Palace ( for &quot;New Imperial Palace&quot;) in the Sarayiçi quarter, was built in the reign of Murad II (r. 1421–1444) but was destroyed in 1877, during the Russo-Turkish War. The palace gate and kitchen have since been restored. The &quot;Kasr-ı Adalet&quot; (&quot;Justice Castle&quot;), originally built as part of the palace complex, stands intact next to the small Fatih Bridge over the Tunca river. The splendid appearance of the palace in the late 1460s when it glistened with gold, silver and marble was described by Kritovoulos of İmbros in his &quot;History of Mehmed the Conqueror.&quot;

=== Other religious monuments ===
Dating back to 1909, the Grand Synagogue of Edirne was restored and re-opened in March 2015. A Roman Catholic and two Bulgarian Orthodox churches are also to be found in the city.

=== Other historic monuments ===
Edirne has three historic covered bazaars: the Kavaflar Arastası (Cobblers Arcade), next to the Selimiye Mosque and constructed to bring in an income to support the külliye; the Bedesten next to the Eski Cami which was supported by the income from the shops; and the Semiz Ali Paşa Çarşısı (Ali Pasha Bazaar, AKA Kapalı Çarşı), another work of Sinan dating back to 1568. The Kavaflar Arastası is the place to come to buy miniature versions of the handmade brooms with mirrors set into them that used to play a part in marriage ceremonies as well as to buy soap in the shape of fruits.

Of the original Roman Hadrianopolis only slight remains of the fortifications survive near the so-called Macedonian Tower, itself probably a part of the defences although much patched-up and altered over the ensuing centuries.

Edirne Museum (Edirne Müzesi) contains collections of local archaeology and ethnography. In the grounds outside can be seen an example of the sort of dolmen to be seen at nearby Lalapaşa.

In the town centre stand the Rüstem Pasha (1560–61) and Ekmekcioğlu Ahmed Pasha caravanserais, designed to accommodate travellers - in the case of the Rüstem Pasha by Mimar Sinan - in the 16th century. The Rüstem Pasha Caravanserai now serves as the Kervansaray Hotel.

The Balkan Wars Memorial Cemetery is located close to the ruins of the Edirne Palace, with an Unknown Soldier monument featuring an Ottoman soldier in front of its entrance.

The Meriç and Tunca rivers, which flow around west and south of the city, are crossed by elegant arched bridges dating back to early Ottoman times.

The historic Karaağaç railway station has been restored to house Trakya University&#x27;s Faculty of Fine Arts. The Treaty of Lausanne Monument and Museum are in the surrounding park.

==Cuisine==
The town is famous in Turkey for the Edirne fried liver. &quot;Ciğer tava&quot; (breaded and deep-fried liver) is often served with a side of cacık, a dish of diluted strained yogurt with chopped cucumber.

==Festivals==

The Kırkpınar oil-wrestling tournament is held every year in late June or early July.

Kakava, an international festival celebrated by the Romani people in Turkey is held on 5–6 May each year.

Bocuk Gecesi is a festival of Balkan origin celebrated in mid-January on what is expected to be the coldest day of the year. It is a sort of Turkish take on Halloween.

== Economy ==

Edirne&#x27;s economy largely depends on agriculture. 73% of the working population work in agriculture, fishing, forests and hunting. The lowlands are productive. Corn, sugar beets and sunflowers are the leading crops. Melons, watermelons, rice, tomatoes, eggplants and viniculture are important.

The through highway that connects Europe to Istanbul, Anatolia and the Middle East passes through Edirne.

Industry is developing. Agriculture-based industries (agro-industries) are especially important for the city&#x27;s economy.

<text>The Faculty of Engineering is one of the eight faculties at Lund University in Lund, Sweden, commonly called LTH (after its Swedish name &quot;Lunds Tekniska Högskola&quot;). LTH has (2022) about 1,500 employees and nearly 10,000 students, of which about 650 graduate annually. LTH currently offers 16 engineering programmes, 5 higher engineering programmes and 19 international master&#x27;s programmes. LTH trains civil engineers, fire engineers, architects, industrial designers and doctors of technology. LTH&#x27;s higher education engineering programmes take place at Campus Helsingborg. LTH also offers a unique education in risk management and professional training in food technology. Since 2010, LTH has also been responsible for the bachelor&#x27;s programme for airline pilots. The civil engineering programmes were changed in autumn 2007 as a step in the Bologna process and are now 5 years long, equivalent to 300 credits. First-cycle courses are as a rule offered in Swedish, while higher-level courses are often taught in English with English literature.

== History ==
Lund University of Technology, LTH, was founded in 1961 and incorporated in 1969 as part of Lund University. The university originally consisted of six sections, Engineering Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Architecture. Carin Boalt became Lunds first female professor on her appointment as a professor of Building Function Analysis in 1964.

The range of courses has developed over time and now includes Computer Engineering and Biotechnology as well as Fire Engineering, Ecosystem Engineering, Industrial Economics and Industrial Design. LTH is located on its own campus where most of the buildings were designed by Klas Anshelm. Since 1995, LTH has also been running higher education engineering programmes in Building Technology and Computer/Electrical Engineering at Campus Helsingborg. LTH has its own dean since 1990. These have been Bertil Törnell (1990–1993), Sven Lindblad (1993–1996), Thomas Johannesson (1996–2001), Gunilla Jönson (2002–2007), Anders Axelsson (2008–2014), Viktor Öwall (2015–2020) and Annika Olsson (2021- ).

<text>The Umeå Institute of Technology or &quot;Tekniska högskolan i Umeå&quot; is part of the Faculty of Science and Technology at Umeå University. The Institute offers a wide range of study programmes, some of them not to be found in any other part of Sweden. Research in engineering is gradually being expanded. The faculty&#x27;s traditionally strong position in natural sciences form a base on which new technology research is built.

Umeå Institute of Technology three main areas in research are Information and Interaction Technologies, Life Sciences, and Sustainable Society.

==History==
The 1964/65 academic year saw the beginning of what was to become the current Faculty of Sciences and Technology with the creation of a Faculty of Philosophy, which was later divided into a Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science and a Faculty of Social Science in 1968/69.

There was already talk in 1964 of establishing a technical college in Umeå. Nothing definite came out of these discussions until 1 July 1997 when the Umeå Institute of Technology was established.

Engineering programmes were gradually developed at the university during the 1980s in the form of two engineering programmes. The first master&#x27;s programmes at Umeå University were in engineering physics in 1988. Central to the development of Master&#x27;s programmes in engineering has always been strong basic sciences, e.g. chemistry, physics, biology and computing science.

==Education==

Master&#x27;s programmes in Computing Science and Engineering, Engineering Chemistry and Engineering Biology were introduced during the nineties. At the end of the eighties and beginning of the nineties a series of two-year engineering programmes were started. These later developed into three-year university engineering programmes. The newest of the engineering programmes is the Master&#x27;s Programme in Energy Engineering.

The 1990s have seen the establishment of a number of centres for research. The goal has been to create centres where researchers from different fields are able to collaborate on common issues.

==Departments==

*Applied Physics and Electronics 
*Chemistry
*Computing Science
*Ecology and Environmental Science
*Institute of Design
*Space Science
*Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics
*Molecular Biology
*Physics
*Plant Physiology

==Research Centres==

The Faculty of Science and Technology at Umeå University has over 5,500 students and more than 350 research students. Research and education is gathered under ten different departments. Several centres have also been established to ensure even more effective research.

The Faculty of Medicine and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) are two of the Faculty of Science and Technology&#x27;s most important partners. Collaboration also takes place with a number of universities in Sweden. Interfaces naturally extend beyond Sweden&#x27;s borders; there are for instance established collaborations with INRA, the National Institute for Agricultural Research in France, and Oxford University.

<doc id="216894" wikidata="Q11762" url="?curid=216894" title="Jürgen Trittin">
<text>Jürgen Trittin (born 25 July 1954) is a German Green politician who served as Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder from 1998 to 2005.

== Early life and education ==
Trittin was born in Bremen, as son of Helene and Klaus Trittin. He earned a university degree in social economy in Göttingen and worked as journalist.

==Political career==
===Early beginnings===
Trittin&#x27;s political career started in 1982 as Secretary of the Alternative-Greens-Initiative List (AGIL) Group in the Göttingen City Council (until 1984). From 1984 to 1985, he worked as press spokesman for the Green Party&#x27;s group in the Lower Saxony State Assembly, which he joined in 1985 as member of the state parliament.

===Career in state politics, 1990–1998===
From 1990 to 1994, Trittin was the Minister for Federal and European Affairs in a coalition government with the SPD, led by Minister-President of Lower Saxony Gerhard Schröder (SPD). In his capacity as minister, he also served as the Head of the Lower Saxony State Mission to the Federal Government in Bonn.

After Schröder&#x27;s SPD won an absolute majority in the state elections in 1994, the coalition with the Greens was ended. Trittin subsequently served as Member of the Lower Saxony State Assembly and as Deputy Chairman of the Alliance 90/The Greens group in that parliament. 

Also in 1994, Trittin was elected spokesman (chairman) of the national Green Party, serving alongside Krista Sager (1994–1996) and later Gunda Röstel (1996–1998).

===Minister for the Environment, 1998–2005===
In the federal red–green coalition, the federal red–green coalition government under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Trittin was appointed Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, a role which he held from October 1998 until the Grand Coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel took power in 2005. 

In his capacity as minister, Trittin was responsible for the decision to abandon the use of nuclear power by 2020, called the nuclear power phase-out (see Nuclear power in Germany). He also pushed the 2000 Renewable Energy Act through parliament. He was appointed Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a role which he held from October 1998 until the Grand coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel took power in 2005.

===Member of the German Parliament, 1998–2023===
In the 1998 national elections, Trittin was elected as Member of the German Bundestag. Upon entering parliament, he discontinued his work as party chairman, because its statutes did not allow concurrently being a member of parliament and a member of the party executive.
After having lost against Fritz Kuhn in the vote on the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary group leadership in 2005, Trittin served as vice-chairman group in charge of foreign, security and European policy from 2005 to 2009.

Alongside Renate Künast, Trittin led the Green Party&#x27;s campaign for the 2009 elections. In the following years, both chaired the party&#x27;s parliamentary group. In addition, Trittin served as alternate member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

For the 2013 elections, the Greens under lead candidates Trittin and Katrin Göring-Eckardt centered their campaign on a call for tax increases for the wealthy, a strategy that many in the party later blamed for its losses in the polls. As part of the campaign, Trittin strengthened his profile as foreign policy expert by making a five-day trip to the United States in May 2013, including meetings with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and officials from the International Monetary Fund.

Following his party&#x27;s defeat in the elections, Trittin became a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and of the German delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. He also served as deputy chairman of the German-Russian Parliamentary Friendship Group and of the German-Iranian Parliamentary Friendship Group.

In late 2015, Trittin was named co-chairman (alongside Ole von Beust and Matthias Platzeck) of a government-appointed commission tasked with recommending by early 2016 how to safeguard the funding of fulfilling Germany&#x27;s exit from nuclear energy. By April 2016, the commission agreed to ask the power firms to pay €23.3 billion ($26.4 billion) into a state fund to cover the costs of nuclear waste storage.

In the negotiations to form a so-called traffic light coalition of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) following the 2021 federal elections, Trittin was part of his party&#x27;s delegation in the working group on climate protection and energy policy, co-chaired by Matthias Miersch, Oliver Krischer and Lukas Köhler.

In December 2023, Trittin announced that he would not stand in the 2025 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the year. He was replaced in the Bundestag by Ottmar von Holtz.

==Political positions==
===Human rights===
In August 2012, Trittin was one of 124 members of the Bundestag to sign a letter that was sent to the Russian ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin, expressing concern over the trial against the three members of Pussy Riot. &quot;Being held in detention for months and the threat of lengthy punishment are draconian and disproportionate,&quot; the lawmakers said in the letter. &quot;In a secular and pluralist state, peaceful artistic acts – even if they can be seen as provocative – must not lead to the accusation of serious criminal acts that lead to lengthy prison terms.&quot;

===Environment policy===
At the time of Hurricane Katrina in August/September 2005, Trittin wrote an opinion piece in the newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot; associating the US failure to sign the Kyoto protocol with the hurricane and its devastation.

In August 2005, Trittin responded to a question on how best to react to the 2005 petrol prices crisis with &quot;leave the car at home from time to time.&quot; The media, in particular the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper, attacked these comments.

==Controversy==
In 1981, Trittin approved an election platform for the Alternative Green Initiative List, a precursor of the Green Party, which called for the legalization of sexual relations between adults and minors.

Already by 1999, shortly after Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s coalition government, Trittin told &quot;Stern&quot; magazine that &quot;Red-Green as a reform project is dead,&quot; adding that he saw the Social Democrats as virtually indistinguishable now from the Christian Democrats of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He added that the Greens might even consider future political alliances with the Christian Democrats.

In 2001, Trittin compared a prominent Christian Democrat, Laurenz Meyer, to a &quot;skinhead&quot; for declaring that he was proud to be a German. A vigorous debate on the legitimacy of German patriotism has ensued, with most Germans appearing sharply critical of Trittin. The minister justified his remark by noting that extreme-right parties in Germany often use the badge, &quot;I am proud to be a German.&quot; However, Trittin came under considerable pressure to quit after making the remark and was openly reprimanded by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. The Greens&#x27; voting results subsequently fell significantly – to 7.8 percent, from 12.1 percent in the 1996 state election, in Baden-Württemberg, and to 5.3 percent, from 6.9 percent, in Rhineland-Palatinate.

In 2010, Trittin attended an event to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Free Republic of Wendland in Hannover where someone threw a pie at him during a panel discussion.

<text>Grub was an open source distributed search crawler platform.

Users of Grub could download the peer-to-peer client software and let it run during their computer&#x27;s idle time. The client fetched a list of URLs from the main grub server, indexed them and sent them back to the main grub server in a compressed form.

== History ==
Grub, Inc. was founded in 2000 by Kord Campbell in Oklahoma City. Intellectual property rights were acquired from Grub in January 2003 for $1.3 million in cash and stock by LookSmart. For a short time the original team continued working on the project, releasing several new versions of the software, albeit under a closed license.

Operations of Grub were shut down in late 2005. On July 27, 2007, Jimmy Wales announced that Wikia, then developing an open-source search engine called Wikia Search, had acquired Grub from LookSmart. Wikia, now called Fandom, released the Grub source under an open-source license.

<doc id="216900" wikidata="Q15616389" url="?curid=216900" title="Green jay">
<text>The green jay (Cyanocorax luxuosus) is a species of the New World jays, found in Central America, Mexico, and South Texas. Adults are about long and variable in color across their range; they usually have blue and black heads, green wings and mantle, bluish-green tails, black bills, yellow or brown eye rings, and dark legs. The basic diet consists of arthropods, vertebrates, seeds, and fruit. The nest is usually built in a thorny bush; the female incubates the clutch of three to five eggs. This is a common species of jay with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

Seven subspecies are accepted; listed from north to south:
*&quot;Cyanocorax luxuosus glaucescens&quot; – Southern Texas, northeast Mexico
*&quot;Cyanocorax luxuosus luxuosus&quot; – East-central Mexico
*&quot;Cyanocorax luxuosus speciosus&quot; – Western Mexico
*&quot;Cyanocorax luxuosus vividus&quot; – Southwestern Mexico
*&quot;Cyanocorax luxuosus maya&quot; – Yucatan Peninsula
*&quot;Cyanocorax luxuosus confusus&quot; – Southeastern Mexico to western Guatemala
*&quot;Cyanocorax luxuosus centralis&quot; – Honduras

It differs from the related Inca jay of the Andes most obviously in lacking the large nasal bristles that form a distinct tuft at the base of the bill in that species, and also tends to show more blue on the rear crown. Despite its separation from the Inca jay by a 1,600 km range gap, some ornithologists treat the green jay and Inca jay as conspecific, with the green jay as &quot;C. yncas luxuosus&quot; and the Inca jay as &quot;C. yncas yncas&quot;. 

==Description==
Green jays are in length. Weight ranges from . They have feathers of yellowish-white with blue tips on the top of the head, cheeks and nape. The breast and underparts range from bright yellow in the south (e.g. &quot;C. l. maya&quot; in the Yucatan) to pale green in the north (e.g. &quot;C. l. glaucescens&quot; in Texas). The upper parts are rich green. The color of the iris depends on the subspecies, ranging from dark brownish in the north to bright yellow in the south.

==Behavior==
Green jays feed on a wide range of insects and other invertebrates and various cereal grains. They take ebony (&quot;Ebenopsis&quot; spp.) seeds where these occur, and also any oak species&#x27; acorns, which they will cache. Meat and human scraps add to the diet when opportunity arises. Green jays have been observed using sticks as tools to extract insects from tree bark.

===Breeding===
Green jays usually build a nest in a tree or in a thorny bush or thicket, and the female lays three to five eggs. Only the female incubates, but both parents take care of the young.

===Voice===
As with most of the typical jays, this species has a very extensive voice repertoire. The bird&#x27;s most common call makes a &quot;&quot; sound, but many other unusual notes also occur. One of the most distinctive calls sounds like an alarm bell.

==Distribution and habitat==
The green jay occurs from southern Texas to Honduras. The similar Inca jay has a disjunct home range in the northern Andes of South America.

==Status==
The green jay is a common species throughout most of its wide range. It is an adaptable species and the population is thought to be increasing as clearing of forests is creating new areas of suitable habitat. No particular threats have been identified, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>LookSmart is an American search advertising, content management, online media, and technology company. It provides search, machine learning and chatbot technologies as well as pay-per-click and contextual advertising services.

LookSmart also licenses and manages search ad networks as white-label products. It abides by the click measurement guidelines of the Interactive Advertising Bureau.

LookSmart also owns several subsidiaries, including Clickable Inc., LookSmart AdCenter, Novatech.io, ShopWiki and Syncapse.

The current CEO of LookSmart is Michael Onghai and the company is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;LookSmart&quot; is a double entendre, referring to both its selective, editorially compiled directory and as a compliment to users whom the company thinks &quot;look smart&quot;.

==History==
=== 1995–1998 ===
LookSmart was founded as Homebase in 1995 in Melbourne, Australia by husband and wife Evan Thornley and Tracy Ellery, executives of McKinsey &amp; Company. Reader&#x27;s Digest invested $5 million in the company for an 80% stake. The original concept of Homebase was to build a female and family-friendly web portal to supplement the Reader&#x27;s Digest magazine. After leadership and strategy changes at Reader&#x27;s Digest, which reduced RD&#x27;s focus on its online business, RD wanted to shut down Homebase, which would have cost $4 million in payouts and other termination costs. The founders and former McKinsey&#x27;s employee Martin Hosking instead proposed a cheaper leveraged buyout of Homebase.

On 28 October 1996, the company launched its LookSmart search engine. At launch, the search engine listed more than 85,000 sites and had a &quot;Java-enhanced&quot; interface. In June 1997, the search engine underwent a major redesign, dropping its original Java-based browsing system.

LookSmart was sold back to the founders as well as Martin Hosking through a leveraged buyout in 1998, with Reader&#x27;s Digest providing a $1.5 million loan and retaining about a 10% equity stake. Also in 1998, a search box was added to the LookSmart search engine along with People Search, Yellow pages, Discussions and shopping search. In May 1998, the company raised $2.3 million from Amwin and $6.0 million from Cox Media Group and Macquarie Bank and was valued at $23.3 million. On 21 December 1998, LookSmart stopped accepting pornographic advertisements.

=== 1999–2001 ===
By 1999, the company had 500 employees and LookSmart was the twelfth most visited website worldwide with 10 million users, behind AltaVista and ahead of Snap. In early-1999, the company reached an agreement to provide directory and listing services for Microsoft for 5 years. The deal provided the company with $30 million upfront and guaranteed payments of $5 million per year. In late-March 1999, the company raised $59.6 million based on a post-money valuation of $430 million from Amerindo Investment Advisors, Citicorp Equity Capital, Cox Interactive Media, Hambrecht &amp; Quist and others. In May 1999, LookSmart formed a strategic partnership with direct-response marketing company Guthy-Renker and acquired some of their assets from their e-commerce division for $3 million. 

On 20 August 1999, during the dot-com bubble, the company became a public company via an initial public offering on the NASDAQ, debuting at $12 per share and raising $92.4 million based on a $1 billion valuation for the company. LookSmart used the money it made from its IPO to open offices in Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands. By October 1999, the stock price reached $30 per share, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. The founders&#x27; 15% stake was worth $375 million. On 10 November 1999, LookSmart and BT Group founded joint venture BT LookSmart. In December 1999, LookSmart purchased FutureCorp and its free email service Start for more than $5 million from its co-founders Michael Mak and Bardia Housman. Also in December, LookSmart acquired 14.5% of the voting stock of Dstore Pty Ltd. for $300,000.

In 2000, FindArticles, a website which provided access to articles previously published in magazines, journals, and other sources, was founded as a partnership between LookSmart, which authored the search technology, and the Gale Group, which provided the articles for a fee.

In March 2000, LookSmart&#x27;s stock price briefly peaked at $72 per share. On 28 March 2000, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) signed a sponsorship deal with LookSmart by adding a custom-built LookSmart directory to the Olympic Games&#x27; website. On 30 May 2000, Juno Online Services reached an agreement with LookSmart to provide Juno&#x27;s subscribers access to LookSmart&#x27;s directory and LookSmart&#x27;s stock jumped 8%. On 26 July 2000, AltaVista reached an agreement with LookSmart for it to be their exclusive directory provider. In October 2000, the company acquired Zeal for $20 million.

As a result of the dot-com bubble bursting in late 2000, the company fired 172 employees or 31% of its staff in January 2001 to cut costs. Also in January, LookSmart shut down Inside The Web and LookSmart Live! due to them being unrelated to their core business model. On 17 January 2001, the company reached a deal to provide product categories from its directory to Amazon.

Also after the dot-com bubble burst, LookSmart paid $90,000 to transfer 52.8% of its ownership of FutureCorp back to its founders.

On 9 July 2003, LookSmart announced that they had reached an agreement to provide listing services in the United States for web portal Terra Lycos.

In August 2003, LookSmart stated in a financial report that Microsoft, which accounted for 64% of the company&#x27;s listing revenues in the last 6 months and 70% of the company&#x27;s overall revenue, started testing its own search technology without LookSmart&#x27;s listings on some of its websites in the United Kingdom and LookSmart&#x27;s stock dropped more than 20% on 15 August and continued dropping on 18 August. Also in August, William Lonergan became the new CFO of LookSmart. In October 2003, LookSmart reintroduced its bid-for-placement ads in order to compete with Google and Yahoo!, which were previously offered through LookSmart&#x27;s UK division. On 6 October 2003, Microsoft announced that it would not renew its agreement with LookSmart and the company&#x27;s stock price plunged 52.3% in a day and its stock fell to $1.44 per share. In response to this, LookSmart fired half of its employees in December 2003.

In September 2003, the company settled a lawsuit filed in May 2002 by Legal Staffing Partners after the company converted thousands of websites that originally had paid a onetime submission fee into a cost-per-click payment model.

In 2003, LookSmart had a net income of $5.8 million and made $140.9 million in revenue.

<text>The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, or Swedish Agricultural University (, SLU) is a public research university in Sweden. Although its main campus and head office is located in Ultuna, Uppsala, the university has several campuses in different parts of Sweden; the other main facilities being Alnarp in Lomma Municipality, Skara, and Umeå. 

Unlike other state-owned universities in Sweden, SLU is funded through the budget for the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation (previously the Ministry for Rural Affairs). In 2020, the university had 3,155 full-time staff, 4,216 full-time students, 559 research students and 191 professors.

SLU is a founding member of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS), established in 2001.
==History==

The university was formed in 1977 by combining three existing separate colleges for veterinary medicine, forestry and agriculture, as well as some smaller units into one organisation in order to improve the efficiency by sharing resources between departments. At the same time, the Veterinary college and Forestry college were moved from Stockholm to Ultuna, which already was the main campus of the Agricultural college. The locations used by the two relocated colleges are today used by the Stockholm University.

These colleges had a long history as separate institutions. The Veterinary Institution in Skara was founded in 1775 and was headed by Peter Hernqvist, a student of both Carl von Linné and of Claude Bourgelat, who founded the first veterinary college in Lyon in 1762. From 1821 a new veterinary institution in Stockholm took over the training of veterinarians from Skara. The Institute of Forestry was founded in Stockholm in 1828 to provide higher education to those who had gone through practical forestry schools, and was made into a college 1915. An agricultural institute was founded in Ultuna in 1848 and in Alnarp in 1862, under the supervision of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture, founded in 1813. These institutes, and the experimental activities conducted by the academy from 1814, were the basis of the Agricultural College, which was created in 1932.

Founded by Sören Wibe, the &quot;Journal of Forest Economics&quot; () was published by Elsevier, in affiliation with the Department of Forest Economics. In 2019, the journal was acquired by Now Publishers.

==Organization and administration==

SLU is organized into four faculties: 

# Faculty of Landscape Planning, Horticulture and Agricultural Sciences
# Faculty of Natural Resources and Agriculture Sciences
# Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science
# Faculty of Forest Sciences

== Rankings ==

SLU is a small and highly specialized research university ranking among the world&#x27;s top universities in many of its areas of focus, most notably in agricultural and veterinary sciences, as well as ecology: 

* In the 2023 &quot;QS World Ranking by Subject&quot;, SLU places 3rd in Agriculture and Forestry, 25 in Veterinary Science, and 74 in Environmental Science.

<text>The Karolinska Institute (KI; ; sometimes known as the (Royal) Caroline Institute in English) is a research-led medical university in Solna within the Stockholm urban area of Sweden and one of the foremost medical research institutes globally. The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The assembly consists of fifty professors from various medical disciplines at the university. The current vice-chancellor of Karolinska Institute is Annika Östman Wernerson, who took office in March 2023.

The Karolinska Institute was founded in 1810 on the island of Kungsholmen on the west side of Stockholm; the main campus was relocated decades later to Solna, just outside Stockholm. A second campus was established more recently in Flemingsberg, Huddinge, south of Stockholm. The institute also has a Centre for Reparative Medicine, consisting of two nodes, one in Stockholm and one in Hong Kong.

The Karolinska Institute is Sweden&#x27;s third oldest medical school, after Uppsala University (founded in 1477) and Lund University (founded in 1666). It is one of Sweden&#x27;s largest centres for training and research, accounting for 30% of the medical training and more than 40% of all academic medical and life science research conducted in Sweden. It receives around a third of Sweden&#x27;s public funding for medical research.

The Karolinska University Hospital, located in Solna and Huddinge, is associated with the university as a research and teaching hospital. Together they form an academic health science centre. While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish, the bulk of the PhD projects are conducted in English. The institute&#x27;s name is a reference to the Caroleans.

==Seal&#x27;s symbolism==

===Rod of Asclepius===
The rod of Asclepius is named after the god of medicine, Aesculapius or Asclepius. This ancient god was the son of Apollo and was generally accompanied by a snake. Over time, the snake became coiled around the staff borne by the god.

===Snake bowl===

The snake bowl was originally depicted together with Asclepius&#x27; daughter, the virgin goddess of health Hygieia or Hygiea. The snake ate from her bowl, which was considered to bring good fortune. There is nothing to support the notion that the snake would secrete its venom into the bowl.

===Cockerel===

The cockerel symbolises new life and was sacrificed to Asclepius by those who had recovered from illness. This is the meaning behind the Greek philosopher Socrates&#x27; last words after he drank the poisoned cup: &quot;Crito, we owe a cockerel to Asclepius. Do pay it. Don&#x27;t forget.&quot;

==Education==

The Karolinska Institute offers the widest range of medical education under one roof in Sweden. Several of the programmes include clinical training or other training within the healthcare system. The close proximity of the Karolinska University Hospital and other teaching hospitals in the Stockholm area thus plays an important role during the education.
Approximately 6,000 full-time students are taking educational and single subject courses at Bachelor and Master levels at the Karolinska Institute. Annually, 20 upper high school students from all over Sweden get selected to attend Karolinska&#x27;s 7-week long biomedical summer research school, informally named &quot;SoFo&quot;.

==Rankings and controversies==
The Karolinska Institute is not listed in the overall QS World University Rankings since it only ranks multi-faculty universities. However, QS does rank the Karolinska Institute in the category of Medicine, placing it as the best in Sweden, 3rd in Europe and 5th worldwide in 2020. In 2015, the QS ranked the Department of Dental Medicine 1st in the world.

According to the 2021 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the Karolinska Institute is ranked 10th worldwide and 5th in Europe in clinical, pre-clinical and other health subjects.

The 2021 U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking placed KI as 11th worldwide in Psychiatry and Psychology.

In 2019, the Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked the Karolinska Institute in 4th place worldwide for pharmacy, 5th for public health, 6th for nursing, and 21st for clinical medicine.

The university was a founding member of the League of European Research Universities.

=== Hong Kong donation controversy ===
In February 2015, the KI announced it had received a record $50 million donation from Lau Ming-wai, who chairs Hong Kong property developer Chinese Estates Holdings, and would establish a research centre in the city. Within a few days, &quot;Next Magazine&quot; revealed that Chuen-yan – son of Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung – had recently been awarded a fellowship to research heart disease therapeutics at the institute in Stockholm beginning that year, and raised questions about the &quot;intricate relationship between the chief executive and powerful individuals&quot;. CY Leung had visited KI when in Sweden in 2014, and subsequently introduced KI president, Anders Hamsten, to Lau. The Democratic Party urged the ICAC to investigate the donation, suggesting that Leung may have abused his public position to further his son&#x27;s career. The Chief Executive&#x27;s Office strenuously denied suggestions of any quid pro quo, saying that &quot;the admission of the [Chief Executive&#x27;s] son to post-doctoral research at KI is an independent decision by KI having regard to his professional standards. He [the son] plays no role and does not hold any position at the [proposed] Ming Wai Lau Center for Regenerative Medicine.&quot; This accusation has also been questioned by the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;&#x27;s Canadian-based pro-Beijing and pro-government opinion columnist, Alex Lo: &quot;The insinuation is that Leung Chuen-yan with a doctorate from Cambridge doesn&#x27;t deserve his job at the Karolinska Institute... Leung the son probably could get similar junior posts in many other prestigious-sounding – at least to brand-obsessed Hongkongers – research institutes; it&#x27;s not that big a deal.&quot;

===Scientific misconduct===
The institute received unfavorable attention in the 2010s for its failure to prevent the deaths of seven patients at the hands of one of their star surgeons, Paolo Macchiarini, who was ultimately found to have repeatedly falsified medical data in order to perform experimental surgeries that were unsuccessful and led to the deaths of the patients, where diseased tracheas were replaced with prosthetic implants. The institute was accused of engaging in targeted retribution against the whistleblowers rather than conducting a full, impartial and appropriate review.

This scientific misconduct scandal occurred in 2014, and involved one of the institute&#x27;s star surgeons, Paolo Macchiarini. Macchiarini was accused by four former colleagues and co-authors of having falsified claims in his research.

After its unsuccessful effort to avoid unfavorable publicity by silencing whistleblowers, media coverage and public opinion finally forced the institute to act. In April 2015, the ethics committee of the institute issued a response to one set of allegations with regard to research ethics and peer review at the &quot;Lancet&quot;, and found them to be groundless.

The Karolinska Institute later appointed an external expert, Bengt Gerdin, to review the charges, comparing the results reported by Macchiarini and his collaborators to the medical record of the hospital. Gerdin&#x27;s report was released by Karolinska in May 2015. Gerdin found that Macchiarini had committed research misconduct in seven out of seven papers: The findings showed he had not obtained ethical approval for the some of his operations (as claimed), and had misrepresented the result of some of those operations, as well as work he had done with animals.

In August 2015, after considering the findings and a rebuttal provided by Macchiarini, vice-chancellor of Karolinska Institute Anders Hamsten found that Macchiarini had acted &quot;without due care&quot; but had not committed misconduct. The journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;, which published Macchiarini&#x27;s work, also published an article defending Macchiarini.

On 5 January 2016, the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published a story about Macchiarini romancing a journalist while making numerous false statements about his personal life; the article also questioned the accuracy of statements he had made on his CV.

On 13 January 2016the same day that the first part of a three-part documentary about Macchiarini would air on Swedish televisionGerdin criticized the vice-chancellor&#x27;s dismissal of the allegations in an interview on Swedish television.

Later that day, Sveriges Television investigative TV show started airing a three-part series, titled &quot;Experimenten&quot;, in which Macchiarini&#x27;s work was investigated. The documentary showed Macchiarini continuing operations with the new method even after it showed little or no promise, seeming to exaggerate the health of patients following the experimental surgery despite the ultimate deaths of those patients. While Macchiarini admitted that the synthetic trachea did not work in the current state, he did not agree that trying it on several additional patients without further testing had been inappropriate. Allegations were also made that patients&#x27; medical conditions both before and after the operations, as reported in academic papers, were inconsistent with patient records. Macchiarini also claimed that the synthetic trachea had been tested on animals before using it on humans, something that could not be verified.

On 28 January, Karolinska issued a statement saying that the documentary made claims of which it was unaware, and that it would consider re-opening the investigations. These concerns were echoed by the chairman of the Karolinska Institute, Lars Leijonborg, and the chairman of the Swedish Medical Association, Heidi Stensmyren, calling for an independent investigation that would also review the actions of the university and hospital management in responding to allegations of scientific misconduct.

In February 2016, the Karolinska Institute published a review of Macchiarini&#x27;s CV that identified discrepancies.
In March 2016. the institute terminated Macchiarini&#x27;s contract.

In October 2016, the BBC broadcast a three-part &quot;Storyville&quot; documentary, &quot;Fatal Experiments: The Downfall of a Supersurgeon&quot;, directed by Bosse Lindquist and based on the earlier Swedish programmes about Macchiarini.

After the special aired, the Karolinska Institute requested Sweden&#x27;s national scientific review board to review six of Macchiarini&#x27;s publications about the procedures. The board published its findings in October 2017, and concluded that all six demonstrated scientific misconduct, in particular by failing to report the surgical complications and deaths that occurred after the interventions; and that one of the articles falsely claimed that the procedure had been approved by an ethics committee, when this had not happened. The board called for all six of the papers to be retracted. It also reported that all of the papers&#x27; co-authors had committed scientific misconduct as well.

==Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute==
The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute is a body at the Karolinska Institute that awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Nobel Assembly consists of fifty professors in medical subjects at the Karolinska Institute, appointed by the faculty of the institute, and is a private organisation which is formally not part of the Karolinska Institute. The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which consists of members appointed by the Nobel Assembly for a period of three years, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.

In the early history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was first awarded in 1901, the laureates were decided upon by the entire faculty of the Karolinska Institute. The reason for creating a special body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed.

The other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation&#x27;s regulations.

<text>Moshe Sharett (; born Moshe Chertok (); 15 October 1894 – 7 July 1965) was the second prime minister of Israel and the country’s first foreign minister. He signed the Israeli Declaration of Independence and was a principal negotiator in the cease-fire agreements that concluded the 1948 War of Independence. Beginning in 1933, he headed the political department of the Jewish Agency. He also founded the Jewish Brigade, which fought with the British Army during World War II.

A member of Mapai, Sharett&#x27;s term was both preceded and succeeded by the premiership of David Ben-Gurion.

==Biography==
Moshe Sharett was born in Kherson in the Russian Empire (today in Ukraine) to the family of and Fanya née Lev (). In 1906 the immigrated to Ottoman Palestine. For two years, 1906–1907, the family lived in a rented house in the village of Ein-Sinya, north of Ramallah. In 1910 his family moved to Jaffa, then became one of the founding families of Tel Aviv.

He graduated from the first class of the Herzliya Hebrew High School, even studying music at the Shulamit Conservatory. He then went to Constantinople to study law at Istanbul University, the same university at which Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and David Ben-Gurion studied. However, his time there was cut short due to the outbreak of World War I. He served a commission as First Lieutenant in the Ottoman Army, working as an interpreter.

In 1922, Sharett married Tzippora Meirov, with whom he had two sons, Ya&#x27;akov and Haim, and a daughter, Yael.

==Political career==

After the war, he worked as an Arab affairs and land purchase agent for the Assembly of Representatives of the Yishuv. He also became a member of Ahdut Ha&#x27;Avoda, and later of Mapai.

In 1922, he attended the London School of Economics, and worked for the British Poale Zion and actively edited the &quot;Workers of Zion&quot;. One of the people he met while in London was Chaim Weizmann. He then worked on the &quot;Davar&quot; newspaper from 1925 until 1931.

In 1931, after returning to Mandatory Palestine, he became the secretary of the Jewish Agency&#x27;s political department. After the assassination of Haim Arlosoroff in 1933 he became its head.

During World War II, via his wife Zipporah, Sharett became embroiled in the question of emigration of refugee Jews stranded in Europe and the East. Some Polish refugees, children with and without parents, were deported to Tehran with Soviet agreement.

The success of these negotiations and others was a hallmark of Sharett&#x27;s more cerebral approach to practical problems. He met with Tel Aviv-bound Hungarian Jewish refugee representative Joel Brand, fresh off the plane from Budapest. Yishuv leadership mistrusted Brand, and the British thought him a criminal.

Sharett&#x27;s response was to hand the self-appointed liberator over to the British authorities, who drove Brand to prison in Egypt. Sharett&#x27;s General Zionism was deeply concerned in making Palestine a commercially viable home land; secondary was the deep emotional concerns of the murder in the Diaspora, which, by 1942, was in German hands.

Like Weizmann, whom he admired, Sharett was a principled Zionist, an implacable opponent of fascism, and a practical realist, prepared to co-operate fully with the Mandate authorities.

Sharett, as Ben-Gurion&#x27;s ally, denounced Irgun&#x27;s assassination squads on 13 December 1947, accusing them of playing to public feelings. Sharett held the foreign policy post under the Jewish Agency until the establishment of Israel in 1948.
==Independence==
Sharett was one of the signatories of Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence. Sharett was elected to the Knesset in the first Israeli election in 1949, and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On 10 March he was made part of the first cabinet. An armistice was signed with Lebanon that led to Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from southern Lebanon on 23 March. International negotiations hosted by Britain took place on the Greek island of Rhodes at Suneh, King Abdullah&#x27;s residence when Israel&#x27;s emissaries, Yigael Yadin and Walter Eytan signed with Transjordan. Knowing the Jordanian position on the Hebron Hills, Yadin told Sharett that surrounded by hostile Arab states, Israel had to sign the Transjordan over to Iraq. American Dr. Ralph Bunche, who drafted the United Nations (UN) treaty for Sharett&#x27;s office, received the Nobel Peace Prize. The final agreement was signed at the &quot;Grande Albergo delle Rose&quot; in Rhodes (now the Casino Rodos) on 3 April 1949.

Ominous violence lay ahead for the new state, warned Sharett during a debate on 15 June, in which he reminded the Jewish people of their vital interests. A fourth and final agreement was signed with Syria on 17 July; the 1947–1949 Palestine war had lasted one year and seven months. In the elections that followed, Mapai formed a coalition, deliberately excluding Herut and the Communists at Ben-Gurion&#x27;s behest. 

As Foreign Minister, Sharett established diplomatic relations with many nations, and helped to bring about Israel&#x27;s admission to the UN. He continuously held this role until he retired in June 1956, including during his tenure as Prime Minister.

Sharett met with Pius XII in 1952 in an attempt to improve relations with the Holy See, although this was to no avail.

==Prime minister==
David Ben-Gurion withdrew from politics in 1953, and Sharett was chosen by the party to take his place. During his time as Prime Minister (the fifth and sixth governments of Israel), the Arab-Israeli conflict intensified, particularly with Nasser&#x27;s Egypt. The Lavon Affair, which resulted in the resignation of Pinhas Lavon, the Defense Minister, and brought down the government. When Ben-Gurion returned to the cabinet, Lavon was a civilian adviser to Prime Minister Sharett. But when he returned from the war, he was presented with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;; it had been the convention, but no longer for a career diplomat, to be chosen to become a Minister of Defense, a portfolio once controlled by the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, now taken by Ben-Gurion.

=== Lavon Affair ===

In 1954, three cells of local Jews living in Egypt and one from Israel proper were activated as terror groups to sabotage in Alexandria and Cairo on the orders of a secretive Unit 131 of Israeli Intelligence. The Israelis welcomed the British presence in Nasser&#x27;s Egypt. Israel had formed an alliance with the European powers Britain and France. Britain had helped found the State of Israel, encouraged socialism, and fostered a sense of accountable democracy. Israel viewed Britain&#x27;s historic role in Cairo as a convenient buffer against potential threatening incursions into Israel&#x27;s borders.

A group of Israeli youths were ardent Zionist military trainees, but had little real experience of war. They were influenced by their charismatic leader and handler, Avri Elad. In July 1954 they threw firebombs into the American libraries of Cairo and Alexandria, with little damage, and cinemas in Cairo. But 13 youths were arrested, and then tortured by the Egyptians. Two of the prisoners, including the Israeli agent Meir Max Bineth, committed suicide, and three were sent to prison. Sharett soon discovered that operations were being prepared for execution in other Arab capitals. When the news broke over Cairo Radio in summer 1954, Sharett turned to Minister for Labour Golda Meir for help. The Minister of Defense, Pinchas Lavon, and his Head of Military Intelligence, Benjamin Gibli, both declared each other as the responsible party. The real orders were transmitted in code over the radio in the form of housewives cookery recipes.

Mapai was split over the crisis. Sharett called for a Public Inquiry led by a Judge of the Supreme Court, Yitzhak Olshan, and a former Chief of Staff, Ya&#x27;akov Dori. Sharett had wanted to appoint Moshe Dayan as Minister of Defense but was aware that he was a controversial figure. There were those who defended his stubbornness as a military genius, and those who saw him as divisive. But criticism of Lavon was mounting. Mapai demanded the resignation of Dayan, Gibli and Lavon. Sharett appealed to a sense of fairness from Colonel Nasser, but to no avail. A guilty verdict was entered over the heads of the prisoners in Cairo. On 31 January 1955 two of the defendants, Moshe Marzouk and were hanged, found guilty of spying.

Lavon offered to resign from the Defense Ministry on 2 February 1955, the same day Sharett and Golda Meir traveled to Sde Boker to see Ben-Gurion. Lavon&#x27;s resignation was accepted on 18 February. Ben-Gurion agreed to come out of retirement to fill the defense portfolio, and four months later he replaced Sharett as PM, while Sharett stayed as Foreign Minister. Olshan-Dori&#x27;s final judicial report exposed the difficulty of political management in the Defense Ministry with the cabinet conflicts emerging from Ben-Gurion&#x27;s stewardship.

Sharett&#x27;s efforts to unblock the diplomatic impasse had failed. Nasser still prevented access to the Suez Canal. Israeli shipments of arms to defend the state dried up at a time when Arab belligerency was rising. Sharett might have learned from Weizmann&#x27;s experience at befriending the consummate politician Ben-Gurion; Sharett also believed he could install him as his subordinate. Ben-Gurion had been out of office for a year, but returned to demand that Dayan be reappointed. Ben-Gurion spoke regularly with socialist leaders Dayan and Shimon Peres. A few weeks later an Israeli was murdered by infiltrators near the border. Ben-Gurion and Dayan immediately demanded approval of the planned Operation Black Arrow, which involved attacking Gaza. Sharett had attempted to be pacifistic and restrained during his premiership, but was overtaken by the vocal elements in Mapai and their growing electoral support in the run-up to a General election.

After the military disaster at Qibya, in which Dayan had caused civilians to be killed, he was forced to change Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) policy towards targeting military installations on 28 February 1955. Sharett was concerned that casualties should be kept to an absolute minimum; 8 Israelis and 37 Egyptians died in an operation that was the most bloody since the armistice of 1949. An adjutant at the ministry, Nehemia Argov, wrote to Foreign Minister and PM Sharett to report the Gaza Raid as 8 dead and 8 wounded. The wounded were sent to Kaplan Hospital.

=== Principles of moderation===
Sharett&#x27;s diary included passages in which he bewailed the senseless denigration of duty lacking credibility. He harked back to the days of &quot;Havlagah&quot; when in the 1930s both he, Sharett and Ben-Gurion had pursued a policy of self-restraint in matters military. Sharett abhorred vengeful killing, he regarded these acts as emotional over-wrought responses in which involuntary killing was devoid of moral sentiment. A policy of reprisal merely sought to justify the excessive use of force. Sharett&#x27;s pacific doctrine was diluted by both Ben-Gurion and Minister of Defense Dayan, and Operational commander of the Paratroop Brigade, Sharon. Sharett opposed any move that would attract moral outcry of European powers and an arms trade embargo.

== Last months as foreign minister==
At the next elections in November 1955, Ben-Gurion replaced Sharett as head of the list and became prime minister again. Sharett retained his role as Foreign Minister under the new government of Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion justified much of his policy on the siege mentality of a minority of Jews living within 57 times as many Arabs living in 215 times the land area. Sharett came to see Nasser as &quot;suffering from delusions of grandeur&quot; with an almost Hitlerite ambition to export revolution abroad.

Shimon Peres was sent to London and Paris to drum up arms. He made a significant deal with France for jets and artillery. Peres, later a Prime Minister of Israel, was praised from the Knesset for handling the complexities of the 4th Republic. The uneasy diplomatic language between Nasser and Israel that had characterised the post-1949 period turned into open hostility. Nasser ended even secretive clandestine contacts. Within days of the Gaza Raid Iraq aligned in a Baghdad Pact with Turkey.

Ben-Gurion decided to replace Sharett as Foreign Minister with someone more sympathetic to his views, Golda Meir. The cabinet voted 35 to 7 in favour of resignation, but 75 members of the Central Committee abstained. The British and French would provide a shield for Israel against sanctions. Nasser proclaimed a determination to set the Palestinians free. The Egyptian army was very certain of success; the Syrians announced a &quot;war against imperialism, Zionism and Israel&quot;. According to Ben-Gurion, the Soviet Encyclopaedia now declared the Arab-Israeli War of Independence in 1948 &quot;was caused by American Imperialism&quot;.

==Retirement==
After stepping down as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 18 June 1956, in protest at the new government&#x27;s bellicose policy which he thought dangerously precipitate, Sharett decided to retire. During his retirement he became chairman of Am Oved publishing house, Chairman of Beit Berl College, and Chairman of the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency. He died in Jerusalem in 1965, and was buried in Tel Aviv&#x27;s Trumpeldor Cemetery.

== Commemoration ==

Sharett&#x27;s personal diaries, first published by his son Yaakov in 1978, have proved to be an important source for Israeli history. In 2007, the Moshe Sharett Heritage Society, the foundation that Yaakov established to care for Sharett&#x27;s legacy, discovered a file of thousands of passages that had been omitted from the published edition. They included &quot;shocking revelations&quot; about defense minister Pinhas Lavon. A new edition published was complete, apart from a few words still classified.

Many cities have named streets, schools, or other landmarks in his honor, including streets in Tel Aviv, Bat Yam, Ramat Gan, Rishon LeZion, Herzliya, Holon.

From 1988 to 2017, Sharett appeared on the 20 NIS bills. The bill first featured Sharett, with the names of his books in small print, and with a small image of him presenting the Israeli flag to the United Nations in 1949. On the back of the bill, there was an image of the Herzliya Hebrew High School, from which he graduated. In 1998, the bill went through a graphic revision, with the list of Sharett&#x27;s books on the front side being replaced by part of his 1949 speech to the UN. The back side then featured an image of Jewish Brigade volunteers, part of a speech by Sharett on the radio after visiting the Brigade in Italy, and the list of his books in small print. In November 2017, Sharett&#x27;s portrait was replaced with that of Rachel Bluwstein.

<doc id="216915" wikidata="Q5641895" url="?curid=216915" title="Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)">
<text>The British pre-decimal halfpenny (pronounced ), once abbreviated &quot;ob.&quot; (from the Latin &#x27;obulus&#x27;), is a discontinued denomination of sterling coinage worth of one pound, of one shilling, or of one penny. Originally the halfpenny was minted in copper, but after 1860 it was minted in bronze. In the run-up to decimalisation, it ceased to be legal tender from 31 July 1969 (although halfpennies dated 1970 were minted as part of a final pre-decimal commemorative set). The halfpenny featured two different designs on its reverse during its years in circulation. From 1672 until 1936 the image of Britannia appeared on the reverse, and from 1937 onwards the image of the Golden Hind appeared. Like all British coinage, it bore the portrait of the monarch on the obverse.

&quot;Halfpenny&quot; was colloquially written &quot;ha&#x27;penny&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; was spoken as &quot;a penny ha’penny&quot; or &quot;three ha&#x27;pence&quot; . &quot;Halfpenny&quot; is a rare example of a word in the English language that has a silent &#x27;f&#x27;.

Before Decimal Day in 1971, sterling used the Carolingian monetary system, under which the largest unit was a pound divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. Each penny was further divided into 4 farthings, thus a pound contained 480 halfpennies and a shilling contained 24 halfpennies.

==Design==

The original reverse of the bronze version of the coin, designed by Leonard Charles Wyon, is a seated Britannia, holding a trident, with the words to either side. Issues before 1895 also feature a lighthouse to Britannia&#x27;s left and a ship to her right. Various minor adjustments to the level of the sea depicted around Britannia, and the angle of her trident were also made over the years. Some issues feature toothed edges, while others feature beading.

Over the years, various different obverses were used. Edward VII, George V, George VI and Elizabeth II each had a single obverse for halfpennies produced during their respective reigns. Over the long reign of Queen Victoria two different obverses were used, but the short reign of Edward VIII meant no halfpennies bearing his likeness were ever issued.

During Victoria&#x27;s reign, the halfpenny was first issued with the so-called &#x27;bun head&#x27;, or &#x27;draped bust&#x27; of Queen Victoria on the obverse. The inscription around the bust read . This was replaced in 1895 by the &#x27;old head&#x27;, or &#x27;veiled bust&#x27;. The inscription on these coins read .
Coins issued during the reign of Edward VII feature his likeness and bear the inscription . Similarly, those issued during the reign of George V feature his likeness and bear the inscription .

A halfpenny of King Edward VIII (1936) does exist, dated 1937, but technically it is a pattern coin i.e. one produced for official approval; it would probably have been due to receive this approval at about the time that the King abdicated. The obverse shows a left-facing portrait of the king (who considered this to be his better side, and consequently broke the tradition of alternating the direction in which the monarch faces on coins – some viewed this as indicating bad luck for the reign); the inscription on the obverse is .

The pattern coin of Edward VIII and regular issue halfpennies of George VI and Elizabeth II feature a redesigned reverse displaying Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s ship the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;.
George VI issue coins feature the inscription before 1949, and thereafter. Unlike the penny, halfpennies were minted throughout the early reign of Elizabeth II, bearing the inscription in 1953, and thereafter.

==Terminology==
: British English i.e. &#x27;halfpenny-worth&#x27; or &#x27;halfpennyworth&#x27; pronounced .

&quot;In literal use&quot; usually written out in full although still &quot;never pronounced phonetically&quot;: e.g. &quot;A halfpennyworth of chips.&quot;&quot; In figurative use&quot; usually said disparagingly: e.g. &quot;I&#x27;ve been dying for somebody with a ha’porth of wit and intelligence to talk to.&quot; &quot;…and saying it doesn&#x27;t make a halfpennyworth of difference!&quot; (from Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;A lady of Letters&quot;, written and produced in 1987, some sixteen years after decimalisation and three years after the New Halfpenny—(i.e. the decimal p)—had been demonetised and withdrawn from circulation, thus further illustrating the continued traditional or idiomatic &quot;two-syllable pronunciation&quot;). Also used in the once common phrase: &quot;daft ha’porth.&quot;

<text>Sekaninaite ((Fe+2,Mg)2Al4Si5O18) is a silicate mineral, the iron-rich analogue of cordierite.

It was first described in 1968 for an occurrence in Dolní Bory, Vysočina Region, Moravia, Czech Republic, and is now known also from Ireland, Japan, and Sweden. It was named after a Czech mineralogist, Josef Sekanina (1901–1986). In Brockley on Rathlin Island, Ireland sekaninaite occurs in bauxitic clay within the contact aureole of a diabase intrusive plug.

==Structure and composition==
The chemical formula of sekaninaite is: &lt;chem&gt;(Fe^2+, Mg^2+)2[Al4Si5O18]*\mathit{n}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;. Grapes et al. (2010) calculated the percentage weights of the sample from Dolni Bory,
This compound exists in nature in the form of two polymorphs: one having a disordered hexagonal structure and the other arranged in an ordered orthorhombic structure. As an aluminosilicate, the repeated and ordered structure is based on polymerization of one or the other&#x27;s tetrahedral framework of Si, Al tetrahedra (Yakubovich et al., 2003). Nearly all analyses show excess of Al and deficiency in Si with respect to tetrahedral components. The overall substitution of alkalis causes excess in cations found in (K2O, Na2O, CaO), implying that sekaninaite is essentially anhydrous (Grapes et al., 2010).
The atomic structures of cordierites are interpreted as a continuous series of structures that vary based on the content of octahedrally coordinated Mg and Fe cations. The varying content of atoms in the octahedral M position has an effect on the orthorhombic unit cell&#x27;s parameters. The wide range of isomorphism of Mg and Fe(4–96%) suggest the existence of a continuous isomorphic series cordierite &lt;chem&gt;(Mg,Fe)2[Al4Si4O18]*\mathit{n}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;-sekaninaite &lt;chem&gt;(Fe,Mg)2[Al4Si4O18]*\mathit{n}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;. It is shown via crystallographic data that a shift in the iron content leads to a corresponding variance in a and b unit cell parameters (Yakubovich et al., 2003). As an aluminosilicate/cyclosilicate, the octahedral M-O distances consist of 5 independent tetrahedra form a 3-dimensional anionic framework of ordered and distributed Al3+ and Si4+ cations. One independent AlO4 and two SiO4 vortex-sharing tetrahedra share oxygen atoms to form six-member rings along the c axis of the unit cell. Mg, Fe octahedra share edges with SiO4 to form rings from alternating octahedra and tetrahedra. Thus, the framework can be described as a semi-layered structure formed of layers of tetrahedra linked into rings by sharing vertices and octahedra and tetrahedra sharing edges, alternating along the c axis. The distortion of the orthorhombic unit cell is determined by the chemical composition rather than the degree of ordering in the tetrahedral framework (Yakubovich et al., 2003). The temperature at which the liquidous phases crystallize in a sequence: mullite + tridymite, followed by sekaninaite and finally fayalite + clinoferrosilite (Grapes et al., 2010). Similar trends are observed for amphiboles, clinopyroxenes, olivines, and others. The increase in the Fe mole fraction of minerals was not related with iron input, but was caused by its redistribution during contact metamorphism (Korchak et al., 2010).

==Physical properties==
Stanek and Miskovsky (1975) first identified and diagnosed sekaninaite as a new mineral in the cordierite series. They sampled the poorly developed crystals of the Dolni Bory region, Czechoslovakia, where specimen did not exceed 70 cm. Dolni Bory samples are very different from samples found in the Kuznetsk paralavas. They are very close analogues with respect to Mg/Fe ratios but vastly different a-, b- and c- parameters (Grapes et al., 2010). Grapes and colleagues calculated cell dimension to be a 17.230(5), b 9.835(3), c 9.314(3) A. The colour of sekaninaite is bright blue and distinctly pleochroic with X = colourless; Y = blue; Z = pale blue; absorption occurs in the sequence Y &gt; Z &gt; X. Sekaninaite has a hardness of 7–7.5; it cleaves imperfectly along {100} and exhibits parting on {001} (Fleischer and Jambor, 1977). Majority of crystals show zonation (Fe increasing from core to rim). It common twinned on {110} and {310}, simulating hexagonal symmetry. Sekaninaite is classified under the space group Cccm; it is an orthorhombic crystal that is found in series with cordierite (Stanek et al., 1975).

==Geologic occurrence and location==
Sekaninaite was first discovered in the Dolni Bory region of the Czech Republic. Its occurrence is in the albite zone of pegmatite in granulites and gneisses (Fleischer and Jambor, 1977). Sekaninaite is found in pyrometamorphic rocks, extensively rocks formed via process of ancient combustion metamorphism; paralavas, clinkers and buchites. These combustion metamorphic rocks occur in clinker beds and breccias of vitrified sandstone-siltstone clinker fragments cemented by paralava. These partially baked and oxidized psammitic-pelitic sediments are associated with burnt coal seams, belonging to places like the Kuznetsk coal basin, Siberia (Grapes et al., 2010). Sekaninaite-Fe-cordierite exists in series and is largely dependent upon variations in solid solution. These minerals are more prevalent in paralavas found in: Power River, Wyoming, Ravat area, Tajikistan, Kenderlyk Basin, eastern Kazakhstan and the Djhar basin in India; each differ in sedimentary mineral assemblage and results depend on high-temperature fusion of mixtures of sandstone-siltstone and minor ferruginous components (Grapes et al., 2010). These Fe-rich paralavas are composed of Fe-olivine, esseneite, dorite, melilite, Fe-cordierite, anorthite, spinel, tridymite, fayalite, magnetite, quartz etc. (Novikova, 2009).

<doc id="216924" wikidata="Q2533572" url="?curid=216924" title="Go Ask Alice">
<text>Go Ask Alice is a 1971 book about a teenage girl who develops a drug addiction at age 15 and runs away from home on a journey of self-destructive escapism. Attributed to &quot;Anonymous&quot;, the book is in diary form, and was originally presented as being the edited actual diary of the unnamed teenage protagonist. Questions about the book&#x27;s authenticity and true authorship began to arise in the late 1970s, and Beatrice Sparks is now generally viewed as the author of the found manuscript–styled fictional document. Sparks went on to write numerous other books purporting to be real diaries of troubled teenagers. Some sources have also named Linda Glovach as a co-author of the book. Nevertheless, its popularity has endured, and, as of 2014, it had remained continuously in print since its publication over four decades earlier.

Intended for a young adult audience, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; became a widely popular bestseller. It is praised for conveying a powerful message about the dangers of drug abuse. &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; has also ranked among the most frequently challenged books for several decades due to its use of profanity and explicit references to sex and rape, as well as drugs. The book was adapted into the 1973 television film &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;, starring Jamie Smith-Jackson and William Shatner. In 1976, a stage play of the same name, written by Frank Shiras and based on the book, was also published.

==Title==
The title was taken from a line in the 1967 Grace Slick-penned Jefferson Airplane song &quot;White Rabbit&quot; (&quot;go ask Alice/ when she&#x27;s ten feet tall&quot;); the lyrics in turn reference scenes in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures In Wonderland&quot;, in which the title character Alice eats and drinks various substances, including a mushroom, that make her grow larger or smaller. Slick&#x27;s song is understood as using Carroll&#x27;s story as a metaphor for a drug experience.

==Plot summary==
In 1968, a 15-year-old girl begins keeping a diary, in which she records her thoughts and concerns about issues such as crushes, weight loss, sexuality, social acceptance, and relating to her parents. The dates and locations mentioned in the book place its events as occurring between 1968 and 1970 in California, Colorado, Oregon, and New York City. The two towns in which the diarist&#x27;s family reside during the story are unidentified, the only indications being that universities are situated in both.

The diarist&#x27;s father, a college professor, accepts a dean position at a new college, requiring the family to relocate. The diarist has difficulty adjusting to her new school, but soon becomes best friends with a girl named Beth. When Beth leaves for summer camp, the diarist returns to her hometown, where she meets an old school acquaintance, who invites her to a party where glasses of cola—some of which are laced with LSD—are served. The diarist unwittingly ingests LSD and has an intense and pleasurable trip. Over the following days the diarist socializes with the other teens from the party, willingly uses more drugs, and loses her virginity while on acid. She worries that she may be pregnant, and her grandfather has a minor heart attack. Overwhelmed by her worries, the diarist begins to take sleeping pills, first stolen from her grandparents, then later prescribed. Her friendship with Beth ends, as both girls have moved in new directions.

The diarist befriends a hip girl, Chris, with whom she continues to use drugs. They date college students Richie and Ted, who deal drugs and persuade the two girls to help them by selling drugs at schools. When the girls walk in on Richie and Ted stoned and having sex with each other, they realize that their &quot;boyfriends&quot; were just using them to make money. The girls report Richie and Ted to the police and flee to San Francisco, Chris gets a job in a boutique with a glamorous older woman, Shelia, who invites both girls to lavish parties, where they resume taking drugs. One night Shelia and her new boyfriend introduce the girls to heroin and brutally rape them while they are under the influence of the drug. Traumatized, the diarist and Chris move to Berkeley where they open a jewelry shop. Although the shop is a success, they quickly grow tired of it and miss their families; they return home for a happy Christmas.

Back at home, the diarist encounters social pressure from her drug scene friends, and has problems getting along with her parents. Chris and the diarist try to stay away from drugs, but their resolve lapses and they end up on probation after being caught in a police raid. The diarist gets high one night and runs away. She travels to several cities, hitchhiking part way with a girl named Doris, who is a victim of child sexual abuse. The diarist continues to use drugs, running out of money. She thinks she has hit the jackpot when she goes to a hippie festival where &quot;drugs are as free as the air&quot;, only to catch the eye of the event&#x27;s drug kingpin, who demands the diarist fellate him or else her supply will be cut off. The diarist hits rock bottom when she experiences homelessness. In desperation, she seeks out a Catholic priest, who helps her and contacts her parents. The diarist runs out of space in her diary and says that the decision to buy a fresh one is synonymous with turning over a new leaf.

Now determined to avoid drugs, she faces hostility from her former friends. When one girl shows up high for a babysitting job, the diarist informs the girl&#x27;s parents who beg her not to tell their daughter&#x27;s parole officer. The diarist&#x27;s former friends harass her at school and threaten her and her family. They eventually drug her against her will; she has a bad trip resulting in physical and mental damage, and is sent to a psychiatric hospital. The diary goes through passages of nonsense until the diarist can write clearly again, believing her body is being eaten by worms, which she eventually stops imagining. There she bonds with a younger girl named Babbie, who has also been a drug addict and child prostitute.

Released from the hospital, the diarist returns home, finally free of drugs. She now gets along better with her family, makes new friends, and is romantically involved with Joel, a man attending her father&#x27;s college on the GI Bill. She is worried about starting school again, but feels stronger with the support of her new friends and Joel. In an optimistic mood, the diarist decides to stop keeping a diary and instead discuss her problems and thoughts with other people.

The epilogue states that the subject of the book died three weeks after the diarist&#x27;s decision not to keep a third diary. The diarist was found dead in her home by her parents when they returned from a movie. She died from a drug overdose, either premeditated or accidental. The epilogue says that while the precise cause of death was never determined, it is but one of thousands of drug overdoses every year.

==Diarist&#x27;s name==

The anonymous diarist&#x27;s name is never revealed in the book. In an episode where the diarist describes having sex with a drug dealer, she quotes an onlooker&#x27;s remark indicating that her name may be Carla. Although a girl named Alice appears very briefly in the book, she is not the diarist, but a fellow runaway whom the diarist meets on the street in Coos Bay, Oregon.

Despite the lack of any evidence in the book that the diarist&#x27;s name is Alice, the covers of various editions have suggested that her name is Alice by including blurb text such as &quot;This is Alice&#x27;s true story&quot; and &quot;You can&#x27;t ask Alice anything anymore. But you can do something—read her diary.&quot; Reviewers and commentators have also frequently referred to the anonymous diarist as &quot;Alice&quot;, sometimes for convenience.

In the 1973 television film based on the book, the protagonist played by Jamie Smith-Jackson is named &quot;Alice&quot;. The protagonist is also named &quot;Alice Aberdeen&quot; in the 1976 stage play adaptation.

==Production==
The manuscript that later became &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was initially prepared for publication by Beatrice Sparks, a Mormon youth counselor then in her early 50s, who had previously done various forms of writing. Sparks had reportedly noted that the general public at that time lacked knowledge about youth drug abuse, and she likely had both educational and moral motives for publishing the book. Sparks later claimed that the book was based on a real diary she received from a real teenage girl, although this claim was never substantiated and the girl has never been identified (see Authorship and veracity controversies). In the 1982 Avon paperback version of &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; the Library of Congress lists the book as &quot;fiction.&quot;

With the help of Art Linkletter, a popular talk show host for whom Sparks had worked as a ghostwriter, the manuscript was passed on to Linkletter&#x27;s literary agent, who sold it to Prentice Hall. Linkletter, who had become a prominent anti-drug crusader after the 1969 suicide of his daughter Diane, also helped publicize the book. Even before its publication, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; had racked up large advance orders of 18,000 copies.

==Reception==

===Public reception===
Upon its 1971 publication, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; quickly became a publishing sensation and an international bestseller, being translated into 16 languages. Its success has been attributed to the timing of its publication at the height of the psychedelic era, when the negative effects of drug use were becoming a public concern. Alleen Pace Nilsen has called it &quot;the book that came closest to being a YA phenomenon&quot; of its time, although saying it was &quot;never as famous as [the later] &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Twilight&quot;, and &quot;Hunger Games&quot; series&quot;. In addition to being very popular with its intended young adult audience, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; also attracted a significant number of adult readers.

Libraries had difficulty obtaining and keeping enough copies of the book on the shelves to meet demand. The 1973 television film based on the book heightened reader interest, and librarians reported having to order additional copies of the book each time the film was broadcast.

By 1975, more than three million copies of the book had reportedly been sold, and by 1979 the paperback edition had been reprinted 43 times. The book remained continuously in print over the ensuing decades, with reported sales of over four million copies by 1998, and over five million copies by 2009. The actual number of readers probably surpassed the sales figures, as library copies and even personal copies were likely circulated to more than one reader. &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; has been cited as establishing both the commercial potential of young adult fiction in general, and the genre of young adult anti-drug novels, and has been called &quot;one of the most famous anti-drug books ever published.&quot;

===Critical response===
&quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; received positive initial reviews, including praise from Webster Schott in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who called it an &quot;extraordinary work&quot;, a &quot;superior work&quot; and a &quot;document of horrifying reality [that] possesses literary quality&quot;. It was also recommended by &quot;Library Journal&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, and ranked number 1 on the American Library Association&#x27;s 1971 list of Best Books for Young Adults. Some reviews focused on the realism of the book&#x27;s material, without further addressing the literary merit of the book. According to Nilsen and Lauren Adams, the book was not subjected to the regular forms of literary criticism because it was presumed to be the real diary of a dead teenager. Lina Goldberg has suggested that the publishers were motivated to list the author as &quot;Anonymous&quot; partly to avoid such criticism.

Years after its publication, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; continued to receive some good reviews, often in the context of defending the book against censors (see Censorship). In a 1995 &quot;Village Voice&quot; column for Banned Books Week, Nat Hentoff described it as &quot;an extraordinarily powerful account of what it&#x27;s actually like to get hooked on drugs&quot; that &quot;doesn&#x27;t preach&quot;.

However, starting in the 1990s, the book began to draw criticism for its heavy-handedness, melodramatic style and inauthenticity, in view of the growing evidence that it was fiction rather than a real teenager&#x27;s diary (see Authorship and veracity controversies). Reviewing the book again for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1998, Marc Oppenheimer called it &quot;poorly written&quot;, &quot;laughably written&quot;, and &quot;incredible&quot;, although some other writers have pointed to the material as being plausible or even appealing to young readers. The portrayal of the diarist&#x27;s drug use, progressing from unwittingly ingesting LSD to injecting speed within a few days, and making a similar quick transition from her first use of marijuana to heroin, has been deemed unrealistic. The book has been criticized for equating homosexuality with &quot;degradation&quot;, illness, sin, and guilt. More recent analyses have expressed ethical concerns with the book&#x27;s presentation of fiction to young readers as a true story. Despite all these criticisms, the book is frequently called a young adult classic.

===Educational use===
Although school boards and committees reached varying conclusions about whether &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; had literary value, educators generally viewed it as a strong cautionary warning against drug use. It was recommended to parents and assigned or distributed in some schools as an anti-drug teaching tool. However, some adults who read the book as teens or pre-teens have written that they paid little attention to the anti-drug message and instead related to the diarist&#x27;s thoughts and emotions, or vicariously experienced the thrills of her rebellious behavior. Reading the book for such vicarious experience has been suggested as a positive alternative to actually doing drugs. &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; has also been used in curricula dealing with mood swings and death.
==Authorship and veracity controversies==
Although &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; has been credited to an anonymous author since its publication, and was originally promoted as the real, albeit edited, diary of a teenage girl, over time the book has come to be regarded by researchers as a fake memoir written by Beatrice Sparks, possibly with the help of one or more co-authors. Despite significant evidence of Sparks&#x27; authorship, a percentage of readers and educators have continued to believe that the book is a true-life account of a teenage girl.

===Beatrice Sparks authorship controversy===
&quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was originally published by Prentice Hall in 1971 as the work of an unnamed author &quot;Anonymous&quot;. The original edition contained a note signed by &quot;The Editors&quot; that included the statements, &quot;&quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; is based on the actual diary of a fifteen-year-old drug user...Names, dates, places and certain events have been changed in accordance with the wishes of those concerned.&quot; The paperback edition first published in 1972 by Avon Books contained the words &quot;A Real Diary&quot; on the front cover just above the title, and the same words were included on the front covers of some later editions. 

Upon its publication, almost all contemporary reviewers and the general public accepted it as primarily authored by an anonymous teenager. According to Lauren Adams, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; magazine was the only source to question the book&#x27;s authenticity on the grounds that it &quot;seem[ed] awfully well written&quot;. Reviews described the book as either the authentic diary of a real teenage girl, or as an edited or slightly fictionalized version of her authentic diary. Some sources claimed that the girl&#x27;s parents had arranged for her diary to be published after her death. However, according to Alleen Pace Nilsen, a &quot;reputable source in the publishing world&quot; allegedly said that the book was published anonymously because the parents had initiated legal action and threatened to sue if the published book could be traced back to their daughter.

Not long after &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;″s publication, Beatrice Sparks began making public appearances presenting herself as the book&#x27;s editor. (Ellen Roberts, who in the early 1970s was an editor at Prentice Hall, was also credited at that time with having edited the book; a later source refers to Roberts as having &quot;consulted&quot; on the book.) According to Caitlin White, when Sparks&#x27; name became public, some researchers discovered that copyright records listed Sparks as the sole author—not editor—of the book, raising questions about whether she had written it herself. Suspicions were heightened in 1979 after two newly published books about troubled teenagers (&quot;Voices&quot; and &quot;Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot;) advertised Sparks&#x27; involvement by calling her &quot;the author who brought you &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;&quot;.

In an article by Nilsen, based in part on interviews with Sparks and published in the October 1979 issue of &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, Sparks said that she had received the diaries that became &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; from a girl she had befriended at a youth conference. The girl allegedly gave Sparks her diaries in order to help Sparks understand the experiences of young drug users and to prevent her parents from reading them. According to Sparks, the girl later died, although not of an overdose. Sparks said she had then transcribed the diaries, destroying parts of them in the process (with the remaining portions locked in the publisher&#x27;s vault and unavailable for review by Nilsen or other investigators), and added various fictional elements, including the overdose death. Although Sparks did not confirm or deny the allegations that the diarist&#x27;s parents had threatened a lawsuit, she did say that in order to get a release from the parents, she had only sought to use the diaries as a &quot;basis to which she would add other incidents and thoughts gleaned from similar case studies,&quot; according to Nilsen.

Nilsen wrote that Sparks now wanted to be seen as the author of the popular &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; in order to promote additional books in the same vein that she had published or was planning to publish. (These books included &quot;Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot;, another alleged diary of a real teenager that Sparks was later accused of mostly authoring herself.) Nilsen concluded, &quot;The question of how much of &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was written by the real Alice and how much by Beatrice Sparks can only be conjectured.&quot; Journalist Melissa Katsoulis, in her 2009 history of literary hoaxes &quot;Telling Tales&quot;, wrote that Sparks was never able to substantiate her claim that &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was based on the real diary of a real girl and that copyright records continued to list her as the sole author of the work.

Urban folklore expert Barbara Mikkelson of snopes.com has written that even before the authorship revelations, ample evidence indicated that &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was not an actual diary. According to Mikkelson, the writing style and content—including a lengthy description of an LSD trip but relatively little about &quot;the loss of [the diarist&#x27;s] one true love&quot;, school, gossip, or ordinary &quot;chit-chat&quot;—seems uncharacteristic of a teenage girl&#x27;s diary. The sophisticated vocabulary of the diary suggested that it had been written by an adult rather than a teen. Mikkelson also noted that in the decades since the book&#x27;s publication, no one who knew the diarist had ever been tracked down by a reporter or otherwise spoken about or identified the diarist.

In hindsight, commentators have suggested various motivations for the publishers to present &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; as the work of an anonymous deceased teenager, such as avoiding literary criticism, lending validity to an otherwise improbable story, and stimulating young readers&#x27; interest by having the book&#x27;s anti-drug advice come from a teenager rather than an adult. Sparks said that while there were &quot;many reasons&quot; for publishing the book anonymously, her main reason was to make it more credible to young readers. Although the book has been classified as fiction (see Treatment of book as fiction and non-fiction), the publisher has continued to list its author as &quot;Anonymous&quot;.

===Controversies involving other works by Sparks===
Sparks was involved in a similar controversy regarding the veracity of her second diary project, the 1979 book &quot;Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot;. It was allegedly the real diary, edited by Sparks, of a teenage boy who died by suicide after becoming involved with the occult. The publisher&#x27;s initial marketing of the book raised questions about whether Sparks had edited a real teenager&#x27;s diary or written a fictional diary, and recalled the same controversy with respect to &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;. Later, the family of real-life teenage suicide Alden Barrett contended that &quot;Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot; used 21 entries from Barrett&#x27;s real diary that the family had given to Sparks, but that the other 191 entries in the published book had been fictionalized or fabricated by Sparks, and that Barrett had not been involved with the occult or &quot;devil worship&quot;.

Sparks went on to produce numerous other books presented as diaries of anonymous troubled teens (including &quot;Annie&#x27;s Baby: The Diary of Anonymous, a Pregnant Teenager&quot; and &quot;It Happened to Nancy: By an Anonymous Teenager&quot;) or edited transcripts of therapy sessions with teens (including &quot;Almost Lost: The True Story of an Anonymous Teenager&#x27;s Life on the Streets&quot;). Some commentators have noted that these books use writing styles similar to &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; and contain similar themes, such as tragic consequences for spending time with bad companions, a protagonist who initially gets into trouble by accident or through someone else&#x27;s actions, and portrayal of premarital sex and homosexuality as always wrong. Although Sparks was typically listed on these books as editor or preparer, the number of similar books that Sparks published, making her &quot;arguably the most prolific Anonymous author in publishing&quot;, fueled suspicions that she wrote &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;.

===Linda Glovach authorship claims===
In a 1998 &quot;New York Times&quot; book review, Mark Oppenheimer suggested that &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; had at least one author besides Sparks. He identified Linda Glovach, an author of young-adult novels, as &quot;one of the &#x27;preparers&#x27;—let&#x27;s call them forgers—of &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;&quot;, although he did not give his source for this claim. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, in a review of Glovach&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Beauty Queen&quot; (which told the story, in diary form, of a 19-year-old girl addicted to heroin), also stated that Glovach was &quot;a co-author of &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;&quot;.

==Treatment of book as fiction and non-fiction==
Following Sparks&#x27; statements that she had added fictional elements to &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;, the book was classified by its publishers as fiction (and remains so classified as of 2016) and a disclaimer was added to the copyright page: &quot;This book is a work of fiction. Any references to historical events, real people, or real locales are used fictitiously. Other names, characters, places, and incidents are the product of the author&#x27;s imagination, and any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.&quot;

Despite the classification and the disclaimer, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; has frequently been taught as non-fiction in schools and sold as non-fiction in bookstores. The publishers also continued to suggest that the book was true by including the &quot;Editors&#x27; Note&quot; stating that the book was based on an actual diary, and listing the author as &quot;Anonymous&quot;, with no mention of Sparks. As of 2011, a UK paperback edition published and marketed by Arrow Books contained the statement &quot;This Is Alice&#x27;s True Story&quot; on the front cover.

==Censorship==
&quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; has been a frequent target of censorship challenges due to its inclusion of profanity and references to runaways, drugs, sex, and rape. Alleen Pace Nilsen wrote that in 1973, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was &quot;&quot;the&quot; book that teens wanted to read and that adults wanted to censor&quot; and that the censors &quot;felt the book did more to glorify sex and drugs than to frighten kids away from them.&quot; Challenges began in the early 1970s following the initial publication of the book, and continued at a high rate through the ensuing decades.

Some challenges resulted in the removal of the book from libraries, or in parental permission being required for a student to check the book out of a library. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in the 1970s it became common practice for school libraries to keep &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; off library shelves and make it available to students only upon request, a practice that was criticized as being a form of censorship. A 1982 survey of school librarians across the United States, co-sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English, found that &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was the most frequently censored book in high school libraries.

Decades after its original publication, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; became one of the most challenged books of the 1990s and 2000s. On the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of the 1990s, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; was ranked at number 25; on the ALA list compiled for the 2000s, it rose to position 18.

The likely authoring of the book by one or more adults rather than by an unnamed teenage girl has not been an issue in censorship disputes. Nilsen and others have criticized this on the basis that the dishonesty of presenting a probable fake memoir to young readers as real should raise greater concerns than the content.

==Adaptations==
The ABC television network broadcast a made-for-television movie, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;, based on the book. It starred Jamie Smith-Jackson, William Shatner, Ruth Roman, Wendell Burton, Julie Adams, and Andy Griffith. Also among the cast were Robert Carradine, Mackenzie Phillips, and Charles Martin Smith. The film was promoted as an anti-drug film based on a true story.

The film was first aired as the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot; on January 24, 1973. It was subsequently rebroadcast on October 24, 1973, and the network also made screening copies available to school, church and civic groups upon request. The film drew generally good reviews (with one critic calling it &quot;the finest anti-drug drama ever presented by TV&quot;), but was also criticized for lacking the complexity of the book and for not offering any solutions to the problem of teen drug addiction. The adaptation by Ellen Violett was nominated for an Emmy Award.

In 1976, a stage play version of the book, adapted by Frank Shiras, was published by The Dramatic Publishing Company. The play has been produced by various high school and community theatre groups.

A 2012 novel called &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot; was published anonymously, featuring the story of a preppy Santa Monica student who falls into drug addiction and alcoholism. Critics compared the book with &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; and viewed the 2012 book negatively, considering it a modernized copy of &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; rather than its own story.

== In popular culture ==

Stand-up comedian Paul F. Tompkins&#x27; 2009 comedy album &quot;Freak Wharf&quot; contains a track titled &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; in which he derides the book as &quot;the phoniest of balonies&quot; and jokingly suggests it was authored by the writing staff of the police drama series &quot;Dragnet&quot;. The album title comes from a passage in the book in which the diarist refers to a mental hospital as a &quot;freak wharf&quot;.

American band Ice Nine Kills drew inspiration from the book for their song &quot;Alice&quot; on the 2015 album &quot;Every Trick in the Book&quot;.

Musical artist Melanie Martinez based her unreleased track, &quot;Birthing Addicts&quot;, on the book in 2011. The song was originally written for an extra credit assignment at her school. It was meant to be on her unreleased EP, &quot;Take Me to the Moon&quot;, but was scrapped upon completion.

<text>Cyanocorax is a genus of New World jays, passerine birds in the family Corvidae. It contains several closely related species that primarily are found in wooded habitats, chiefly in lowland tropical rainforest but in some cases also in seasonally dry forest, grassland and montane forest. They occur from Mexico through Central into southern South America, with the green jay and brown jay just entering the United States in southernmost Texas, ad the Azure and Plush-crested jays occurring southwards to the lower Paraná River basin. This genus is considered especially close to &quot;Cyanolyca&quot;, an upland radiation occurring throughout the American Cordillera from Mexico to Peru and Bolivia, who look very similar to the blue-and-black species of &quot;Cyanocorax&quot; except for being a bit smaller. The North American blue jay genera &quot;Aphelocoma, Cyanocitta&quot; and &quot;Gymnorhinus&quot; seem to be slightly less closely related.

&quot;Cyanocorax&quot; jays are generally black-and-blue, often with considerable amounts of white plumage, but brown or yellow to green in a few species. Some species have elongated neck plumes, some others have crests or bristle tufts on the forehead; a few have patches of bare skin on the face. The eyes are bright yellow in just over half the species, the bills black in adults (yellow to pinkish in juveniles), and the feet usually black, but brown or yellow in a few species.

The genus &quot;Cyanocorax&quot; was described by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826, with the plush-crested jay as the type species. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words κυανος (&quot;kuanos&quot;), meaning &quot;dark blue&quot;, and κοραξ (&quot;korax&quot;), meaning &quot;raven&quot;.

==Systematics and evolution==
With the merge of the formerly separate genera &quot;Calocitta&quot; (the two magpie-jays) and &quot;Psilorhinus&quot; (brown jay) into &quot;Cyanocorax&quot;, the genus now contains around 20 species:

The expanded genus &quot;Cyanocorax&quot; can be neatly divided into two clades, the first containing the former &quot;Calocitta&quot; and &quot;Psilorhinus&quot;, as well as the South American lineage which was historically treated as genus &quot;Uroleucus&quot;. The other clade unites the remaining South American species with the group formerly separated as &quot;Cissilopha&quot;, as well as the Inca jay group which are the only members of the genus to have conspicuous carotenoid (yellow/green) pigments in their plumage; some ornithologists treat the two taxa of the Inca jay group as conspecific, though there is deep genetic divergence between the two taxa as well as differences in their plumage, habitat, behaviour, and calls.

The origin of the genus seems to be the Isthmus of Panama region or the northern Andes. An initial split resulted on one hand in a triple radiation along the Caribbean (&quot;Psilorhinus&quot;) and Pacific (&quot;Calocitta&quot;) coasts of Central America, as well as into South America (&quot;Uroleuca&quot;). Concurrently, the ancestors of the White-tailed jay became separated west of the northern Andes, on the Pacific coast of northwestern South America, while the &quot;Xanthoura&quot; radiation expanded along the foothills of the main Andes chain and adjacent mountain ranges, as well as into the Central American lowlands. From the same stock as the preceding two, a second multi-pronged radiation expanded into Central America (the former &quot;Cissilopha&quot; species) as well as into South America (in two branches, a northern and a southeastwards one). The Tufted jay, the northwesternmost member of this genus, seems to be a distinct fourth and ancient branch of this radiation, perhaps a remnant of an early expansion that largely went extinct as the &quot;Cissilopha&quot; lineage displaced it.

===Species===
The fossil corvid &quot;Protocitta dixi&quot;, described from Middle Pleistocene (Illinoian, Penultimate Glacial Period, roughly 150.000 years ago) remains found in a former cave near Reddick, Florida, was described as similar to both &quot;Calocitta&quot; and &quot;Psilorhinus&quot; lineages. Although no cladistic analysis was conducted, at least qualitatively it was assessed as less closely related to the Holarctic magpies, who are a member of the &quot;monochrome&quot; radiation of crows and ravens, so it is very likely that &quot;Protocitta&quot; was indeed a prehistoric American blue jay. No &quot;Cyanocorax&quot; is attested from anywhere near Florida however, and since &quot;Protocitta&quot; was not compared to the North American radiation of blue jays, it is at least as likely to belong with the latter group.

<text>Wastewater (or waste water) is water generated after the use of freshwater, raw water, drinking water or saline water in a variety of deliberate applications or processes. Another definition of wastewater is &quot;Used water from any combination of domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities, surface runoff / storm water, and any sewer inflow or sewer infiltration&quot;. In everyday usage, wastewater is commonly a synonym for sewage (also called domestic wastewater or municipal wastewater), which is wastewater that is produced by a community of people.

As a generic term, wastewater may also describe water containing contaminants accumulated in other settings, such as:
* Industrial wastewater: waterborne waste generated from a variety of industrial processes, such as manufacturing operations, mineral extraction, power generation, or water and wastewater treatment.
* Cooling water, is released with potential thermal pollution after use to condense steam or reduce machinery temperatures by conduction or evaporation.
* Leachate: precipitation containing pollutants dissolved while percolating through ores, raw materials, products, or solid waste.
* Return flow: the flow of water carrying suspended soil, pesticide residues, or dissolved minerals and nutrients from irrigated cropland.
* Surface runoff: the flow of water occurring on the ground surface when excess rainwater, stormwater, meltwater, or other sources, can no longer sufficiently rapidly infiltrate the soil. 
* Urban runoff, including water used for outdoor cleaning activity and landscape irrigation in densely populated areas created by urbanization.
* Agricultural wastewater: animal husbandry wastewater generated from confined animal operations.

<text>Throughout the history of literature, since the creation of bound texts in the forms of books and codices, various works have been published and written anonymously, often due to their political or controversial nature, or merely for the purposes of the privacy of their authors, among other reasons. This article provides a list of literary works [[anonymous work|published anonymously]], either explicitly attributed to &quot;Anonymous&quot;, or published with no specific author&#x27;s name given.

A work that is published anonymously differs from works published under a pseudonym.

Not included in this list are works which predate the advent of publishing and general attribution of authorship, such as ancient written inscriptions (such as hieroglyphic or pictographical, transcribed texts), certain historical folklore and myths of oral traditions now published as text, and reference or plain texts (letters, notes, graffiti) recovered archaeologically, which are otherwise unimportant to literary studies. Religious texts and grimoires, which are often written anonymously, may appear, along with works initially written anonymously whose authors are now known.

This list is ordered alphabetically by title.

<text>In a number of countries, a university college is a college institution that provides tertiary education but does not have full or independent university status. A university college is often part of a larger university. The precise usage varies from country to country.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the term &quot;university college&quot; was used to refer to educational institutions that were like universities, but lacked full autonomy. The &quot;La Trobe University College of Northern Victoria&quot; was one such college. University colleges existing today generally cater for specific subjects (such as theology or the arts). UNSW@ADFA was previously known as the University College, ADFA, and it provides the tertiary education component of officer cadet training at the Australian Defence Force Academy . It is a branch of the University of New South Wales.

Additionally, some residential colleges associated with universities are named &quot;University College&quot;. These halls of residence are common in Australian universities and primarily provide accommodation to students. They may also provide academic support (such as tutorials) and social activities for residents. University College, Melbourne, formerly University Women&#x27;s College, is one such residential college. It is affiliated with the University of Melbourne. In December 2023, SAE Institute became designated as a university college. 

== Belgium ==

In Belgium, the term &quot;university college&quot; is used to refer to state-funded institutions of higher education belonging to one of the three communities of Belgium, that are specifically not universities. They can issue academic or non-academic bachelor&#x27;s degrees or academic master&#x27;s degrees, and they are performing practice-oriented and artistic research. Even if they are at the same level, academic degrees issued from university colleges are different from university degrees.

In the Dutch-speaking Flemish community, university colleges are called &quot;Hogescholen,&quot; while in the French community they are called &quot;Hautes écoles&quot;. However, the French community makes a difference between &quot;Hautes écoles&quot; and &quot;Écoles supérieures des arts,&quot; which are specialised art schools authorized to select incoming students. Both count as university colleges.

== Canada ==
In Canada, &quot;university college&quot; has three meanings: a degree-granting institution; an institution that offers university-level coursework; or a constituent organization (college) of a university, such as University College at the University of Toronto or University College Residences at Laurentian University.

The title &quot;University College&quot; is extensively used by institutions that do not have full university status, but which do extensive teaching at degree level. The title &quot;university&quot; is protected by regulations of the Canada Corporations Act, but the title &quot;college&quot; is only regulated in some Canadian provinces. Some Canadian university colleges are public institutions, some are private; some are regulated by government agencies, others are not. The Council of Ministers of Education maintains a list of accredited institutions through the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials (CICIC). Institutions that are members of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada are full universities.

&quot;University College&quot; is also the name of a Canadian educational institution. University College is the name of a constituent college of the University of Toronto.

The Ontario College of Art &amp; Design University is sometimes referred to as a university college due to its history as a college prior to 2002 when it was designated as a university under the Ontario College of Art and Design University Act.

There are a total of 30 affiliated and federated university colleges in Ontario, Canada.

== Finland ==
A classical university with several colleges is called &quot;yliopisto&quot; in Finnish. However, some specialized universities are called &quot;korkeakoulu&quot;, because unlike classical universities, they focus only on one discipline, even though they have the same status as an &quot;yliopisto&quot;; for example, Teatterikorkeakoulu, a theatre school, can be considered a single &quot;theater college&quot;. The vocational universities, however, are called &quot;ammattikorkeakoulu&quot;. The potential for confusion has led some &quot;korkeakoulu&quot;s to change their name to &quot;yliopisto&quot;, abandoning the distinction between the terms &quot;yliopisto&quot; and &quot;korkeakoulu&quot;. Additionally three Greater Helsinki-based &quot;korkeakoulu&quot;s, Helsinki University of Technology, University of Art and Design Helsinki and Helsinki School of Economics, have opted to merge to form the Aalto University, &quot;Aalto-yliopisto&quot;.

== Germany ==
University College Freiburg is the central institution for international and interdisciplinary teaching at the University of Freiburg. Its main project is hosting the first public English-language Liberal Arts and Sciences program in Germany. It serves as a lab for innovative teaching approaches and instructional design. Students follow a four-year bachelor program consisting of 240 ECTS credits, and graduate with either a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts.

== Ireland ==
The National University of Ireland and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast were based on the UK university college system, and were both set up in 1908 before the establishment of the Republic of Ireland and having roots in the earlier Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland which was also a university college-type system. The university colleges of the National University have since been raised to the status of universities—as they were considered for many years before statute recognition—but the system still maintains its overall federal status. Queen&#x27;s University Belfast initially had no university colleges and the first university college was created in 1985 (St Mary&#x27;s) and second in 1999 (Stranmillis), these two institutions previously were associated with the university, offering its degrees since 1968.

== Malaysia ==

The term &quot;university college&quot; in Malaysia denotes institutions that are granted the authority to issue degrees in their own names within specialised fields and disciplines. In contrast, an institution granted the status of &quot;university&quot; provides courses of training in multiple disciplines. The empowering legislations governing the establishment and governance of university colleges in Malaysia include the University and University Colleges Act 1971, Universiti Teknologi MARA Act 1976, the Education Act 1995, and the Private Higher Education Act 1996, the National Council of Higher Education Act 1996.

== Netherlands ==
In the Netherlands, the term &quot;university college&quot; refers to special programmes at several universities which are similar to United States liberal arts colleges in providing a broad tertiary education; students at Dutch universities normally study one subject only. The first university college to be founded was University College Utrecht at the University of Utrecht (1998); later, the universities of Amsterdam, Leiden (in the Hague), Middelburg (Roosevelt), Maastricht, Rotterdam, Enschede (Twente), Groningen University of Groningen, and Tilburg followed. University colleges are different from what is called a &quot;Hogeschool&quot;. While university colleges provide a broad liberal arts, often interdisciplinary education, similar to American small liberal arts colleges, a hogeschool is higher education context that focuses on vocational or applied training.

== New Zealand ==
Nearly all New Zealand universities were originally described as &quot;university colleges&quot; and were constituent parts of a federal body, the University of New Zealand. All of these are now fully independent; for example, the former Canterbury University College is now the University of Canterbury.

There is a specific university hall of residence named &quot;University College&quot; at the Otago University.

== Pakistan ==
In Pakistan, the term &quot;University College&quot; is infamous. Rather, the term &quot;Constituent College&quot; is widely used, which is quite similar to the &quot;University College&quot;. Just like many universities throughout Pakistan has constituent colleges. University of the Punjab has many constituent colleges like 

* College of Art and Design (PUCAD)
* Punjab University Law College (PULC)
* Hailey College of Banking &amp; Finance
* Hailey College of Commerce (HCC)
* Punjab University College of Pharmacy (PUCP)
* Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT)
* College of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences
* College of Engineering &amp; Emerging computing
* College of Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES)
* University Oriental College lahore (PUOC)

== Philippines ==
In the 1950s, new academic units and degree programs were established at the University of the Philippines; the General Education (GE) Program, a series of core courses prescribed for all students at the undergraduate level were being taught at the then-&quot;College of Liberal Arts&quot; (now the College of Arts and Letters ), was introduced in 1959. As a result, University President Vicente Sinco saw fit to reorganize the college into a &quot;university college&quot;, which would offer the core subjects to be taken during the first two years of the undergraduate program.

In 2000, retired educators from the University of the Philippines, led by Dr. José Abueva (president of the university from 1987 to 1993), sought to provide the quality of education offered by UP&#x27;s &quot;University College&quot; to individuals who could not get into the UP System due to its limited quotas. Together with similarly minded individuals, all former UP educators and administrators, Dr. Abueva formed Kalayaan College. Under a memorandum of agreement between KC and UP, &#x27;UP-quality education&#x27; is made possible by active members of the UP academic community being given teaching stints in KC, as well as the adoption of the same GE Program and grading system offered in UP. The college aims to develop the critical and creative faculties of its students in the basic fields of knowledge; particularly in the natural and physical sciences, the social sciences and the humanities to help them compete in a fast-changing environment.

== Spain ==
In Spain, a &quot;escuela universitaria&quot; is the name given to some higher education teaching centers where both undergraduate and postgraduate studies are taught. Together with the faculties, they are the centers in charge of organizing the teachings and academic, administrative and management processes of the universities. They can receive different denominations, such as &quot;escuela técnica&quot;, &quot;escuela técnica superior&quot;, &quot;escuela universitaria politécnica&quot;, &quot;escuela politécnica superior&quot; or &quot;escuela universitaria&quot;, depending on the nature of the university studies taught and the university to which they belong.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, the use of the word &quot;university&quot; (including &quot;university college&quot;) in the name of an institution is protected by law and must be authorised by an act of parliament, a royal charter, or by the privy council. Regulations governing the award of the title are drawn up by the government or devolved administration, and specify (in England) that an institution must hold taught degree awarding powers. However, it is permissible for an institute to be described as a university college without such permission as long as it does not use the term in its name.

As &quot;university college&quot; is a less prestigious title than &quot;university&quot;, institutes that meet the (stricter) criteria for university title normally apply for the latter. In 2005 a number of large university colleges became universities after the requirement to hold research-degree awarding powers was dropped, the only remaining difference between the criteria for university and university college title being the requirement for a university to have 4,000 students. From 2012 the requirement on the number of students needed for university title reduced to 1,000, allowing ten more university colleges to become universities. a further review of the criteria was under way.

Historically, the term &quot;university college&quot; denoted colleges (as opposed to universities) that delivered university-level teaching – particularly those in receipt of the parliamentary grants to universities and university colleges from 1889 until the formation of the University Grants Committee in 1919 – but, unlike in the modern usage of the term, did not hold their own degree-awarding powers. Instead, university colleges were associated with universities and thus formed a larger institutional unit while being physically independent. In most cases students at university colleges took the external exams of the University of London, but the colleges of the University of Wales and the Victoria University took degrees of those institutes while the university colleges in Newcastle and Dundee were associated with the universities of Durham and St Andrews respectively. Not all of these university colleges used &quot;university college&quot; in their name.

With the exception of colleges in London that remain part of the University of London, all have gone on to become independent civic universities. Examples include the University of Nottingham (which was University College Nottingham when D. H. Lawrence attended), the University of Southampton (associated with the University of London until 1952), and the University of Exeter, which until 1955 was the University College of the South West of England; Keele University was founded in 1949 as the University College of North Staffordshire until it was granted its royal charter in 1962 and transformed into a university. This was the recognised route for establishing new universities in the United Kingdom during the first half of the 20th century, prior to the founding of the plate-glass universities.

A related, but slightly different, use of the term existed in the federal University of Wales in the late 20th century; some of its constituent colleges took titles such as &quot;University College Aberystwyth&quot;. These colleges were to all intents and purposes independent universities (the University of Wales&#x27; powers being largely restricted to the formal awarding of degrees). In 1996 the University of Wales was reorganised to admit two former higher-education institutions and the older members became &quot;Constituent Institutions&quot; rather than colleges, being renamed along the lines of &quot;University of Wales, Aberystwyth&quot;.

Northern Ireland has two institutions using the title &quot;university college&quot;: St Mary&#x27;s University College, Belfast and Stranmillis University College. The usage here is closer to the older usage in England, as neither have their own degree-awarding powers but are instead listed bodies associated with Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

There are several specific British institutions named &quot;university college&quot;, including, but not limited to:
* University College, Oxford is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford; founded in 1249, it claims to be the oldest Oxbridge college.
* University College London (often known as UCL) is one of the original constituent colleges of the federal University of London. While remaining part of the University of London, it has awarded its own degrees since 2008 and is, like other large London colleges, effectively an independent university.
* University College Hospital is a teaching hospital in London founded as part of, and still closely associated with, UCL.
* University College, Durham is one of the constituent colleges of Durham University; founded in 1832, it is the foundation Durham college.
* Wolfson College, Cambridge is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge which was named University College from its foundation in 1965 until its endowment by the Wolfson Foundation in 1972.
* University College Birmingham is a former university college of the University of Birmingham (in the modern sense) that now has university status but has continued using &quot;university college&quot; in its name.

== United States ==
Universities such as Washington University in St. Louis, Arizona State University, Rutgers University, the University of Denver, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the University of Maine, Syracuse University, the University of Toledo, and Virginia Wesleyan University use &quot;University College&quot; for the name of the division dedicated to continuing education and the needs of the non-traditional student. The University of Maryland System used this term as well for a separate institution within its system; it is now the University of Maryland Global Campus.

The University of Rhode Island, the University of North Carolina Wilmington, Illinois State University, Arizona State University, Ball State University, and the University of Oklahoma enroll all of their new students into their programs under the name of &quot;University College&quot;, which does not grant degrees, but instead provides orientation, academic advising, and support for honors students, probationary students, student athletes, or students undecided in their choice of academic major. Appalachian State University uses University College to refer to the general education and first-year seminar programs.

<doc id="216933" wikidata="Q5163368" url="?curid=216933" title="Consortium for Functional Glycomics">
<text>The Consortium for Functional [[Glycomics]] (CFG) is a large research initiative funded in 2001 by a glue grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) to “define paradigms by which protein-carbohydrate interactions mediate cell communication”. To achieve this goal, the CFG studies the functions of:
* the three major classes of mammalian glycan-binding proteins (GBPs): C-type lectin, galectin, and SIGLEC
* immune receptors that bind carbohydrates: CD1, T cell receptor, and anti-carbohydrate antibodies
* GBPs of microorganisms that bind to host cell glycans as receptors.

The CFG comprises eight core facilities and 500+ participating investigators that work together to develop resources and services and make them available to the scientific community free of charge. The data generated by these resources are captured in databases accessible through the Functional Glycomics Gateway, a web resource maintained through a partnership between the CFG and Nature Publishing Group.

==Organization==
The CFG is composed of three main components: the participating investigators, the cores, and the steering committee.

===Participating investigators===
Progress towards the CFG&#x27;s overall goal is driven by the research of more than 500 participating investigators] (PIs) around the world, whose laboratories utilize resources, services, and data produced by the CFG scientific cores.

The PIs are the largest component of the program, continuing to grow with new members each year. Each PI also has a program of research within the scope of the CFG, supported by non-CFG funds. Investigators apply for membership and must have a funded grant within the scope of the CFG, but they are not required to join the CFG to access resources. Several PIs also have CFG-funded bridging grants that are primarily tied to and enable the goals of the scientific cores, for the benefit of all PIs.

The PIs are organized into 10 subgroups led by subgroup leaders:
* Microorganism recognition of host glycans
* Immune recognition of glycans
* Glycans in immune cell communication
* Glycans in development and physiology
* Glycans in cancer biology
* Glycans in protein conformation and function
* Analytical glycomics
* Chemical synthesis and glycan microarrays
* 3-D Structural glycobiology
* Bioinformatics

The subgroups hold at least three workshops per year, where they have formed several working groups to leverage CFG funding in their efforts to define GBP biology. PI contributions toward elucidating paradigms that define GBP function are captured in the CFG&#x27;s databases, as well as research publications and review articles.

===Cores===
The majority of CFG funds are invested in the scientific cores, which are responsible for generating novel resources, new technologies, and a platform of information that investigators use in their research. The eight CFG cores are described below:
* &quot;Administrative Core (A)&quot;, located at The Scripps Research Institute, supports the CFG steering committee, cores, and participating investigators, plans meetings and workshops, publishes a quarterly newsletter, facilitates resource requests, tracks CFG-related publications, and writes progress reports to NIGMS. Core A also works closely with Core B to update and develop new content for the Functional Glycomics Gateway site.
* &quot;Bioinformatics Core (B)&quot;, located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is responsible for acquiring, storing, and disseminating all CFG-related data and information. For this purpose, Core B works with Nature Publishing Group to develop the CFG&#x27;s Functional Glycomics Gateway site. Here, Core B has constructed complex relational databases to integrate diverse data sets generated by the CFG scientific cores and participating investigators, as well as data sets from other public databases. To increase the usability of these databases, Core B collaborates with the scientific cores to develop bioinformatics tools for data mining and prediction
* &quot;Analytical Glycotechnology Core (C)&quot;, located at Imperial College London, offers mass spectrometry profiling of protein N- and O-linked glycans from mammalian cells, with highest priority given to pure populations of human or murine immune cells.
* &quot;Glycan Array Synthesis Core (D)&quot;, located at The Scripps Research Institute, produces and collects carbohydrate compounds (monosaccharides, disaccharides, etc.), glycan-binding proteins, and anti-glycan antibodies for distribution to investigators. Many of these reagents were generously contributed by participating investigators. Core D also synthesizes glycans for and prints the CFG glycan array (see Core H below)
* &quot;Gene Microarray Core (E)&quot;, located at The Scripps Research Institute, screens RNA samples provided by investigators on a custom-designed glycogene chip array developed using Affymetrix technology. The chip contains probe sets designed to monitor the expression of approximately 2000 human and mouse genes, including glycosyltransferases, glycan-binding proteins, glycan degradation proteins, intercellular protein transport proteins, sugar transporters, adhesion molecules, interleukins, mucins, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and more.
* &quot;Mouse Transgenics Core (F)&quot;, formerly located at The Scripps Research Institute, is now closed. From 2001 to 2009, Core F generated 26 total and conditional knockout mouse lines deficient in glycan-binding proteins or glycosyltransferases. All Core F strains are now archived at the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) at the University of California, Davis or The Jackson Laboratory (Jax). As a service to the community, the CFG still maintains a site in the Functional Glycomics Gateway to help investigators locate potential sources of glycogene knockout mouse lines.
* &quot;Mouse Phenotype Core (G)&quot;, located at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, works with participating investigator “mentors” to assess the histology, hematology, metabolism, immunological function, and behavior of Core F-generated mouse lines in order to describe the phenotypic results of deleting one or more glycogenes. At the discretion of the Mouse Subcommittee, Core G also occasionally evaluates mouse lines provided by investigators.
* &quot;Protein-Glycan Interaction Core (H)&quot;, located at Emory University, analyzes investigator-generated lectins, antibodies, antisera, microorganisms, or suspected glycan-binding proteins of human, animal, and microbial origins on a mammalian glycan array to determine carbohydrate specificity and identify specific ligands. The current version of the array (v4.1), developed and printed by Core D, contains 465 different glycans.

===Steering Committee===
The CFG is managed by a steering committee chaired by James C. Paulson, Ph.D., professor at The Scripps Research Institute and Principal Investigator of the CFG glue grant. Eleven additional glycomics experts and one NIGMS scientific officer make up the rest of the committee.

Five subcommittees oversee the cores and make recommendations to the steering committee regarding resource priorities and technology development: Bioinformatics Subcommittee, Glycan Array/Carbohydrate Library Subcommittee, Glycan Analysis Subcommittee, Mouse Subcommittee, and Nomenclature Subcommittee.

==Resources==
The CFG resources and services described above are free for the use of investigators studying the complex biology that governs the interactions of glycan-binding proteins and their ligands in mediating cell communication.

Resources can be requested by submitting a form at the Functional Glycomics Gateway website. Once a request is received, the appropriate core director reviews it and contacts the investigator if more information is needed. Once the core director finalizes a request and determines whether or not the core is capable of fulfilling it, the CFG Steering Committee reviews the request for final approval.

Membership in the CFG is not a requirement for receiving resources, but an investigator&#x27;s institution must endorse the CFG&#x27;s data sharing agreement to complete the resource request process.

==Databases==
Data obtained by CFG scientific cores with samples submitted by PIs, and data obtained by investigators in their own labs using CFG resources, are uploaded into the CFG databases for dissemination to investigators and to the scientific community. Specialty databases for GBPs, glycan structures, and glycosyltransferases are designed to help integrate data and assess progress against the overall goal.

The easiest way to search through all CFG-related information is to enter a keyword (e.g. “galectin-1”, “sialic acid”, etc.) or IUPAC carbohydrate nomenclature in the search box at the top of the Functional Glycomics Gateway.

==Funding==
In 2001, the CFG was awarded a five-year, $34 million glue grant] from NIGMS. In 2006, the CFG glue grant was renewed for another five years with an additional $40.7 million. Glue grant funding ended August 31, 2011. The CFG is seeking alternate funding to continue many aspects of the CFG beyond the glue grant funding period.

<text>The Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH; ) is a public, state funded Swedish institute of technology in Blekinge with 5,900 students (part-time, full-time) and offers about 30 educational programmes in 11 departments at two campuses located in Karlskrona and Karlshamn.

BTH was granted university status in engineering in 1999. Among the many programmes and courses taught in Swedish, BTH offers 12 Master&#x27;s programmes in English.

The university focuses on ICT information technology and sustainable development; additionally also offers programmes in industrial economics, health sciences and spatial planning.

Blekinge Institute of Technology is located in the Telecom City area and works with telecommunications and software companies including Telenor, Ericsson AB and Wireless Independent Provider (WIP).

==Campuses==

The university has two Campuses in Blekinge:
*Campus Gräsvik in Karlskrona, from 1989
*Campus Karlshamn, from 2000

The Soft Center Campus in Ronneby existed from 1989 and was integrated in 2010 in the Campus Gräsvik, Karlskrona.

The university had been between 2006 and 2008 included in a strategic alliance with Växjö University and University of Kalmar under the common name of the Academy of the Southeast. The Board, however, decided February 15, 2008 not to join in the fusion the other two parties, which resulted in the founding of Linnaeus University.

Blekinge Institute of Technology is a member of the European University Association, the European Society of Engineering Education and the Association of Technical Universities in Scandinavia (NORDTEK).

==Academics==

===Applied Information Technology===
The institute offers Bachelor, Master and PhD programmes oriented towards applied Informatics. BTH has been ranked 6th in the world in Systems and Software Engineering research. Admission to graduate programs is among the most competitive in Sweden due to having the highest number of international applicants. The faculty of the School of Computing consists of 11 full professors and 50 PhD students, among those are high-profile researchers such as
*Claes Wohlin,
*Nail H. Ibragimov, widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s foremost experts in the field of symmetry analysis of differential equations.

A European Master on Software Engineering program is given in collaboration with Technical University of Madrid (Spain), University of Kaiserslautern (Germany) and Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Italy).

===Sustainable Development===
The Institute uniquely offers two Masters programs and a PhD program in Strategic Sustainable Development (SSD), a scientifically robust and strategic framework to systematically contribute to sustainable development through trust-building, purposeful practices. The Blekinge Institute of Technology contributed significantly to the development of Strategic Sustainable Development. Leading figures of the Scandinavian sustainability movement, such as Karl-Henrik Robèrt, teach and research at the institute. In cooperation with Lund University the Centre for Innovation, Research and Competence in the Learning Economy (CIRCLE) was established in 2004. Today CIRCLE is the largest national research Centre of Excellence by the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems.

The latest (2008) report from the Engineering Education for Sustainable Development Observatory (EESD-Observatory) ranked Blekinge Institute of Technology&#x27;s programme on Strategic Sustainable Development as the best among Swedish technical universities and third among the 56 evaluated European universities, with a grade of 8.4 out of 10.

Through a planning grant from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), BTH and NJU explored the possibilities for cooperation in the field of sustainable development.

<doc id="216942" wikidata="Q1940803" url="?curid=216942" title="Mid Sweden University">
<text>Mid Sweden University () is a Swedish state university located in the region around the geographical center of Sweden. It has two campuses: one in Östersund and one in Sundsvall. The University was founded in 1993 as the result of a merger. A third campus in Härnösand was active from founding to the summer of 2016, but has since closed.

==History==
Created on 1 July 1993, the institution was originally called Mid Sweden University College (Mitthögskolan) and was the result of a merger between the University College of Sundsvall/Härnösand (&quot;Högskolan i Sundsvall/Härnösand&quot;) and the University College of Östersund (&quot;Högskolan i Östersund&quot;). The two university colleges had been founded in 1977, with roots in the School of social work that started in 1971 in the city of Östersund, and in the Folk high school teachers&#x27; seminary and the nautical training/naval school that were launched in 1842 in the city of Härnösand. On 1 July 1995, the Sundsvall/Örnsköldsvik and Östersund Colleges of Health Sciences (&quot;Vårdhögskolor&quot;) were also incorporated.

In 2001 Mid Sweden University was awarded university status in the natural sciences area of research including IT, and was thus entitled to issue doctoral degrees. Employees that were carrying out doctoral studies before then were enrolled at other universities, where they had their main supervisor, but were also locally supervised at Mid Sweden University College. Effective 1 January 2005, the government of Sweden granted the institution the right to call itself a university and the school&#x27;s name changed to Mid Sweden University (Mittuniversitetet).

==Organization==
Mid Sweden University has two authorised areas of research (&quot;vetenskapsområden&quot;), organized under the Faculty of Science, Technology and Media (since 2001), and the Faculty of Human Sciences (since 2005), respectively. Education and research is also organized under the Faculty of Educational Sciences (&quot;lärarutbildningsnämnden&quot;).

The university was organized into eight departments, of which four are multi-campus departments:

*Faculty of Human Sciences:
**Department of Humanities
**Department of Social Sciences
**Department of Social Work
**Department of Health Sciences
**Department of Economics, Geography, Law and Tourism 
*Faculty of Science, Technology and Media:
**Department of Information Technology and Media
**Department of Natural Sciences
**Department of Engineering, Physics and Mathematics
*Faculty of Educational Sciences:
**Department of Education

==Education==
The university has offered bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;kandidatexamen&quot;) and Swedish master&#x27;s degree (&quot;magisterexamen&quot;, one year) in a wide range of subjects since 1994, doctoral degree (&quot;doktorsexamen&quot; and &quot;licentiatexamen&quot;) since 2001, and International master&#x27;s degree (&quot;masterexamen&quot;, two years) according to the Bologna model since 2005. Mid Sweden University also offers professional degrees within Master of Science and Engineering (&quot;civilingenjörsexamen&quot;, similar to German Diploma engineer) since 2003, and as engineer, teacher, nurse, specialist nurse, social worker/welfare officer (&quot;socionom&quot;), journalist and, from 2008, Psychologist.

The university&#x27;s two main campuses have different focuses but with some overlap. The Sundsvall campus has a school of education and offers various courses in the humanities and arts. It also has a wide range of courses and degrees in the technical and natural sciences and journalism. The Östersund campus focuses on graduate degrees in tourism, health care, social work and public administration. Campus Östersund also has Sweden&#x27;s only ecotechnology programme. Besides the above, education and research within digital printing technology is located in the city of Örnsköldsvik.

The institution is also well known for a wide range of web-based distance education.

==Number of students and employees==
In school year 2009/2010, the university had 21,476 undergraduate students (including master students) with 4,000 of them based in Östersund, 4,000 in Sundsvall, 2,000 in Härnösand and the rest in distance-learning programs. The university has 235 doctoral students, about 800 teachers, of which 80 were employed professors, and in all more than 1,000 employees.

<text>Halmstad University () is a university college (Swedish: &quot;högskola&quot;) in Halmstad, Sweden. It was established in 1983. Halmstad University is a public higher education institution offering bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programmes in various fields of studies. In addition, it conducts PhD programmes in the three fields Information Technology, Innovation Science, and Health and Lifestyle.

During 2022 Halmstad University had 11,831 students, 66 professors and 92 PhD-students. The study programmes and courses include more than 50 programmes and 200 single subject courses.
== Campus == 
Most university institutions are gathered on the main campus, two kilometres south of the city centre and the river Nissan. The area has been named Bærtling Quarters after the in Sweden well-known painter Olle Bærtling, who was born nearby. The university also conducts education at Campus Varberg, in the city of that name, 70 km north of Halmstad.

== Education == 
Halmstad University conducts education within a broad field, but three profile areas are prominent: Health and Lifestyle, Information Technology, and Innovation Sciences. These areas make a base for the university&#x27;s activities, and it is also in these that the university offers education up to master and PhD-level.

The fields of education include Business, Engineering, Health, Humanities, Social Sciences and Teacher&#x27;s Education. Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s, and advanced professional degrees like Master of Science in Business and Economics (Swedish: Civilekonom) and Master of Science and Engineering (Swedish: Civilingenjör) are awarded. As is often the case in the newer universities in Sweden, education is largely applied and often includes project work in collaboration with industry and society. Each year several hundred international degree-seeking students start one of the twelve master&#x27;s programmes offered in English, and several hundred exchange students follow courses within bachelor-level programmes. PhD-education has been offered since 2010 in the two areas of Information Technology and Innovation Sciences and since 2013 also in Health and Society.

== Research ==
The research is largely conducted multidisciplinary within the university&#x27;s two focus areas: 
* Health Innovation
* Smart Cities and Communities.

== Collaboration with society ==
Cooperation with society is done both through teaching and research. Industry and organisations are involved in study programmes, courses are offered for professionals or commissioned by industry and organisations. Some of the arenas at the university for this cooperation are 
* Digital Laboratory Centre 
* Electronics Centre in Halmstad
* Fab Lab
* Health Data Centre
* Health Lab
* Leap for Life
* Rydberg Laboratory

== Organisation ==
The University Governing Board is Halmstad University&#x27;s highest decision-making body. The board consists of eight society representatives appointed by the Swedish government, one of whom is the chairman, Harald Castler, vice-chancellor Susanna Öhman, three representatives elected within the faculty (university teachers) and three student union representatives.

Operations are led by the university management, consisting of the Vice-Chancellor, Pro Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellors, and the University Director who is in charge of administration. Research and teaching take place within four schools. These are each managed by a dean and a school board.
*School of Business, Innovation and Sustainability
*School of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences 
*School of Health and Welfare
*School of Information Technology

== Vice-Chacellors ==
* SvenOve Johansson (1983–1997)
* Lars Fredén (1998–2000)
* Romulo Enmark (2000–2010)
* Mikael Alexandersson (2011–2017)

<doc id="216956" wikidata="Q899224" url="?curid=216956" title="Glycobiology">
<text>Defined in the narrowest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biosynthesis, and biology of saccharides (sugar chains or glycans) that are widely distributed in nature. Sugars or saccharides are essential components of all living things and aspects of the various roles they play in biology are researched in various medical, biochemical and biotechnological fields.

==History==
According to &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the specific term &quot;glycobiology&quot; was coined in 1988 by Prof. Raymond Dwek to recognize the coming together of the traditional disciplines of carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry. This coming together was as a result of a much greater understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of glycans. However, as early as the late nineteenth century pioneering efforts were being made by Emil Fisher to establish the structure of some basic sugar molecules. Each year the Society of Glycobiology awards the Rosalind Kornfeld award for lifetime achievement in the field of glycobiology.

==Glycoconjugates==

Sugars may be linked to other types of biological molecule to form glycoconjugates. The enzymatic process of glycosylation creates sugars/saccharides linked to themselves and to other molecules by the glycosidic bond, thereby producing glycans. Glycoproteins, proteoglycans and glycolipids are the most abundant glycoconjugates found in mammalian cells. They are found predominantly on the outer cell membrane and in secreted fluids. Glycoconjugates have been shown to be important in cell-cell interactions due to the presence on the cell surface of various glycan binding receptors in addition to the glycoconjugates themselves. In addition to their function in protein folding and cellular attachment, the N-linked glycans of a protein can modulate the protein&#x27;s function, in some cases acting as an on-off switch.

==Glycomics==

&quot;Glycomics, analogous to genomics and proteomics, is the systematic study of all glycan structures of a given cell type or organism&quot; and is a subset of glycobiology.

==Challenges in the study of sugar structures==
Part of the variability seen in saccharide structures is because monosaccharide units may be coupled to each other in many different ways, as opposed to the amino acids of proteins or the nucleotides in DNA, which are always coupled together in a standard fashion. The study of glycan structures is also complicated by the lack of a direct template for their biosynthesis, contrary to the case with proteins where their amino acid sequence is determined by their corresponding gene.

Glycans are secondary gene products and therefore are generated by the coordinated action of many enzymes in the subcellular compartments of a cell. Since the structure of a glycan may depend on the expression, activity and accessibility of the different biosynthetic enzymes, it is not possible to use recombinant DNA technology in order to produce large quantities of glycans for structural and functional studies as it is for proteins.

==Modern tools and techniques for glycan structure prediction==
Advanced analytical instruments and software programs, when used in combination, can unlock the mystery of glycan structures. Current techniques for structural annotation and analysis of glycans include liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and lectin arrays.

One of the most widely used techniques is mass spectrometry which uses three principal units: the ionizer, analyzer and detector.

Glycan arrays, like that offered by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics and Z Biotech LLC, contain carbohydrate compounds that can be screened with lectins or antibodies to define carbohydrate specificity and identify ligands.

===Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)===
MRM is a mass spectrometry-based technique that has recently been used for site-specific glycosylation profiling. Although MRM has been used extensively in metabolomics and proteomics, its high sensitivity and linear response over a wide dynamic range make it especially suited for glycan biomarker research and discovery. MRM is performed on a triple quadrupole (QqQ) instrument, which is set to detect a predetermined precursor ion in the first quadrupole, a fragmented in the collision quadrupole, and a predetermined fragment ion in the third quadrupole. It is a non-scanning technique, wherein each transition is detected individually and the detection of multiple transitions occurs concurrently in duty cycles. This technique is being used to characterize the immune glycome.

==Medicine==
Drugs already on the market, such as heparin, erythropoietin and a few anti-flu drugs, have proven effective and highlight the importance of glycans as a new class of drug. Additionally, the search for new anti-cancer drugs is opening up new possibilities in glycobiology. Anti-cancer drugs with new and varied action mechanisms together with anti-inflammatory and anti-infection drugs are today undergoing clinical trials. They may alleviate or complete current therapies. Although these glycans are molecules that are difficult to synthesize in a reproducible way, owing to their complex structure, this new field of research is highly encouraging for the future.

==Skin==
Glycobiology, in which recent developments have been made possible by the latest technological advances, helps provide a more specific and precise understanding of skin aging.
It has now been clearly established that glycans are major constituents of the skin and play a decisive role in skin homeostasis.
* They play a crucial role in the recognition of molecules and cells, they act, most notably, at the surface of cells to deliver biological messages.
* They are instrumental in the metabolism of cells: synthesis, proliferation and differentiation
* They have a role to play in the structure and architecture of tissue.
Vital to the proper functioning of skin, glycans undergo both qualitative and quantitative changes in the course of aging. The functions of communication and metabolism are impaired and the skin&#x27;s architecture is degraded.

<doc id="216958" wikidata="Q82268" url="?curid=216958" title="Eclipse (software)">
<text>Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It had been the most popular IDE for Java development until 2016, when it was surpassed by IntelliJ IDEA. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages via plug-ins, including Ada, ABAP, C, C++, C#, Clojure, COBOL, D, Erlang, Fortran, Groovy, Haskell, HLASM, JavaScript, Julia, Lasso, Lua, NATURAL, Perl, PHP, PL/I, Prolog, Python, R, Rexx, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Rust, Scala, and Scheme. It can also be used to develop documents with LaTeX (via a TeXlipse plug-in) and packages for the software Mathematica. Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++, and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.

The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge. The Eclipse software development kit (SDK), which includes the Java development tools, is meant for Java developers. Users can extend its abilities by installing plug-ins written for the Eclipse Platform, such as development toolkits for other programming languages, and can write and contribute their own plug-ins. Since Eclipse 3.0 (released in 2004), plug-ins are installed and managed as &quot;bundles&quot; using Equinox, an implementation of OSGi.

The Eclipse SDK is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License, although it is incompatible with the GNU General Public License. It was one of the first IDEs to run under GNU Classpath and it runs without problems under IcedTea.

==History==
Eclipse was inspired by the Smalltalk-based VisualAge family of integrated development environment (IDE) products. Although fairly successful, a major drawback of the VisualAge products was that developed code was not in a component-based software engineering model. Instead, all code for a project was held in a compressed database using SCID techniques (somewhat like a zip file but in .dat). Individual classes could not be easily accessed, certainly not outside the tool. A team primarily at the IBM Cary, North Carolina, lab developed the new product as a Java-based replacement.
In November 2001, a consortium was formed with a board of stewards to further the development of Eclipse as open-source software. It is estimated that IBM had already invested nearly $40 million by that time. The original members were Borland, IBM, Merant, QNX Software Systems, Rational Software, Red Hat, SuSE, TogetherSoft, and WebGain. The number of stewards increased to over 80 by the end of 2003. In January 2004, the Eclipse Foundation was created.

Eclipse 3.0 (released on 21 June 2004) selected the OSGi Service Platform specifications as the runtime architecture.

The Association for Computing Machinery recognized Eclipse with the 2011 ACM Software System Award on 26 April 2012.

===Licensing===
The Eclipse Public License (EPL) is the fundamental license under which Eclipse projects are released. Some projects require dual licensing, for which the Eclipse Distribution License (EDL) is available, although use of this license must be applied for and is considered on a case-by-case basis.

Eclipse was originally released under the Common Public License, but was later re-licensed under the Eclipse Public License. The Free Software Foundation has said that both licenses are free software licenses, but are incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL).

===Name===
According to Lee Nackman, Chief Technology Officer of IBM&#x27;s Rational division (originating in 2003) at that time, the name &quot;Eclipse&quot; (dating from at least 2001) was not a wordplay on Sun Microsystems, as the product&#x27;s primary competition at the time of naming was Microsoft Visual Studio, which &quot;Eclipse&quot; was to eclipse.

Different versions of Eclipse have been given different science-related names. The versions named after Callisto, Europa, and Ganymede, which are moons of Jupiter, were followed by a version named after Galileo, the discoverer of those moons. These were followed by two sun-themed names, Helios of Greek mythology, and Indigo, one of the seven colors of a rainbow (which is produced by the sun). The version after that, Juno, has a triple meaning: a Roman mythological figure, an asteroid, and a spacecraft to Jupiter. Kepler, Luna, and Mars continued the astronomy theme, and then Neon and Oxygen constituted a theme of chemical elements. Photon represented a return to sun-themed names.

, the alphabetic scheme was abandoned in order to better align with the new Simultaneous Release strategy. Releases are named in the format YYYY-MM to reflect the quarterly releases, starting with version 4.9 named 2018-09.

===Releases===
Since 2006, the Foundation has coordinated an annual &quot;Simultaneous Release&quot;. Each release includes the Eclipse Platform and several other Eclipse projects.

From 2008 through 2018, each Simultaneous Release had occurred on the 4th Wednesday of June. In 2018 the project switched to quarterly (13 week) YYYY-MM releases without intermediate service releases.


==Architecture==
Eclipse uses plug-ins to provide all the functionality within and on top of the run-time system. Its run-time system is based on Equinox, an implementation of the OSGi core framework specification.

In addition to allowing the Eclipse Platform to be extended using other programming languages, such as C and Python, the plug-in framework allows the Eclipse Platform to work with typesetting languages like LaTeX and networking applications such as telnet and database management systems. The plug-in architecture supports writing any desired extension to the environment, such as for configuration management. Java and CVS support is provided in the Eclipse SDK, with support for other version control systems provided by third-party plug-ins.

With the exception of a small run-time kernel, everything in Eclipse is a plug-in. Thus, every plug-in developed integrates with Eclipse in the same way as other plug-ins; in this respect, all features are &quot;created equal&quot;. Eclipse provides plug-ins for a wide variety of features, some of which are from third parties using both free and commercial models. Examples of plug-ins include for Unified Modeling Language (UML), for Sequence and other UML diagrams, a plug-in for DB Explorer, and many more.

The Eclipse SDK includes the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT), offering an IDE with a built-in Java incremental compiler and a full model of the Java source files. This allows for advanced refactoring techniques and code analysis. The IDE also makes use of a &quot;workspace&quot;, in this case a set of metadata over a flat filespace allowing external file modifications as long as the corresponding workspace &quot;resource&quot; is refreshed afterward.

Eclipse implements the graphical control elements of the Java toolkit called Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), whereas most Java applications use the Java standard Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing, or JavaFX. Eclipse&#x27;s user interface also uses an intermediate graphical user interface layer called JFace, which simplifies the construction of applications based on SWT. Eclipse was made to run on Wayland during a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Project in 2014.

, language packs being developed by the &quot;Babel Project&quot; provide translations into over 40 natural languages.

== Rich client platform==
Eclipse provides the rich client platform (RCP) for developing general-purpose applications.

The following components constitute the rich client platform:
* Equinox OSGi – a standard bundling framework
* Core platform – boot Eclipse, run plug-ins
* Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) – a portable widget toolkit
* JFace – viewer classes to bring model view controller programming to SWT, file buffers, text handling, text editors
* Eclipse Workbench – views, editors, perspectives, wizards

Examples of rich client applications based on Eclipse are:
* IBM Notes 8 and 9
* Attachmate-Novell NetIQ Designer for Identity Manager
* Apache Directory Studio
* Remote Component Environment
* DBeaver, a SQL client software
* Portfolio Performance
* UDig, a GIS software
* AnyLogic, a multimethod simulation modeling tool

==Server platform==
Eclipse supports development for Tomcat, GlassFish and many other servers and is often capable of installing the required server (for development) directly from the IDE. It supports remote debugging, allowing a user to watch variables and step through the code of an application that is running on the attached server.

==Web Tools Platform==
The Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) project is an extension of the Eclipse platform with tools for developing Web and Java EE applications. It includes source and graphical editors for a variety of languages, wizards and built-in applications to simplify development, and tools and APIs to support deploying, running, and testing apps.

==Modeling platform==
The Modeling project contains all the official projects of the Eclipse Foundation focusing on model-based development technologies. All are compatible with the Eclipse Modeling Framework created by IBM. Those projects are separated into six categories:

* Model Transformation includes projects using Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)-based models as an input to produce either a model or text as an output. Model-to-model transformation projects include ATLAS Transformation Language (ATL), an open source transformation language and toolkit used to transform a given model or to generate a new model from a given EMF model. Model-to-text transformation projects contain Acceleo, an implementation of MOFM2T, a standard model to text language from the Object Management Group (OMG). The Acceleo code generator can generate any textual language (Java, PHP, Python, etc.) from EMF-based models defined with any metamodel (Unified Modeling Language (UML), Systems Modeling Language (SysML), etc.). It is open-source.
*Model Development Tools include projects implementating various modeling standards used in the industry, and their toolkits. Among those projects can be found implementations of several standards:
** Unified Modeling Language (UML)
** Systems modeling language (SysML)
** Object Constraint Language (OCL)
** Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
** Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR)
** XML Schema (XSD)
** National Electronic Distributors Association (NEDA)
** Model-to-Model Transformations (MMT)
*Concrete Syntax Development contains the Graphical Modeling Framework, an Eclipse-based framework dedicated to the graphical representation of EMF-based models.
*Abstract Syntax Development hosts the Eclipse Modeling Framework, core of most modeling projects of the Eclipse Foundation and frameworks available for the EMF like Connected Data Objects (CDO), EMF query or EMF validation.
* Technology and Research includes modeling project prototypes, hosting all Eclipse Foundation modeling projects during their incubation phase.
*Amalgam provides the packaging and integration between all available modeling tools for the Eclipse package dedicated to modeling tools.

==Application lifecycle management==
Application lifecycle management (ALM) and task management in Eclipse need an optional component called Mylyn (), an open-source implementation of the task-focused interface. It provides an API for tools embedding the task-focused interface. For software developers, it helps a developer work efficiently with many different tasks (such as bugs, problem reports or new features). Tasks are integrated into Mylyn. For all tasks that have been integrated, Mylyn monitors user activity and tries to identify information relevant to the task at hand. It uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the related information. Mylyn can integrate with repositories such as Bugzilla, Trac, Redmine, Mantis, JIRA, Unfuddle, and GitHub. It focuses on improving productivity by reducing searching, scrolling, and navigation. By making task context explicit, Mylyn is also meant to facilitate multitasking, planning, reusing past efforts, and sharing expertise.

The project name comes from myelin, an electrically insulating layer that surrounds neurons&#x27; axons. The original name of this project, &quot;Mylar&quot;, replicated a trademark of a boPET film company, so the Eclipse Foundation changed the project name.

==Features==
Eclipse IDE features include text editor with syntax coloring, coding assistance, code completion, code refactoring, code analysis with &quot;Quick fix&quot; suggestions along with code debugging.

Along with native support for OSGi, JPMS support has been added as of Java 9.

==Extensions==
Eclipse supports a rich selection of extensions, adding support for Python via PyDev, Android development via Google&#x27;s ADT (superseded by Android Studio since 2015), JavaFX via e(fx)clipse, JavaScript, jQuery, and many others at the Eclipse Marketplace. Valable is a Vala plug-in for Eclipse.

In addition to the built-in Java compiler warnings, additional plug-ins are available for linting to improve code quality and consistency such as SpotBugs and Sonar.

Support for build tools such as Ant, Maven, Make, and CMake includes the capability to replace Eclipse native project file format with Maven pom.xml directly.

==Alternative distributions==
Several alternative distributions exist in the Eclipse project.

===PHP Development Tools===

The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) Development Tools project provides a framework for the Eclipse platform. The project encompasses all development components, including code-completion, develop PHP and facilitate extensibility. It leverages the existing Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP) and Dynamic Languages Toolkit (DLTK).

===Android Development Tools===
Android Development Tools (ADT) was superseded in 2015 by the Eclipse foundation&#x27;s own plugin, called Andmore: Development Tools for Android, after Google discontinued development of their plug-in for the Eclipse IDE, that is designed to provide an integrated environment in which to build Android applications. ADT/Andmore extends the abilities of Eclipse to let developers set up new Android projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API, debug their applications using the Android SDK tools, and export signed (or unsigned) .apk files in order to distribute their applications. It is freely available to download. Google&#x27;s ADT was the official IDE for Android until 2015 but was replaced by Eclipse&#x27;s Andmore and the official Android Studio. As of 2024, the project appears to be moribund, with no activity since 2017.

<text>Södertörn University (, abbreviated as SH) or University college of South Stockholm is a public university college () located in Flemingsberg in Huddinge Municipality, and the larger area called Södertörn, in Stockholm County, Sweden. In 2013, it had about 13,000 full-time and part-time students. The campus area in Flemingsberg hosts the main campus of SH, several departments of the Karolinska Institutet, and the School of Technology and health of the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge (formerly Huddinge Hospital), is also located there. The university is unique in the sense that it is the only higher educational institution in Sweden that teaches and researches philosophical schools such as German idealism, existentialism, deconstruction as well as critical theory and other views which are excluded from the traditional Anglo-Saxon analytical philosophy.

== History ==
Södertörn University was established as a university college in 1996 following a parliamentary decision in 1995. The expansion of higher education in the southern parts of Stockholm had then been investigated for a long time. The background was that the transition to higher education was low in the southern parts of Stockholm, unemployment was high and segregation problems tended to be large. Stockholm University did not consider it appropriate to increase the number of students of Stockholm University and a university in Södertörn should be independent and not part of the University of Stockholm. Karolinska Institutet had already relocated their dental education to Flemingsberg. KTH and Stockholm University had facilities in Flemingsberg and Novum Research Park was under construction.

At the university&#x27;s inception in 1996, there were around 1,000 students. SH had facilities in Södertälje, Flemingsberg and Haninge. Initially the pro-vice chancellor of Stockholm University was also vice-chancellor of Södertörn University, but on 1 January 1997, Per Thullberg was appointed vice-chancellor and SH also attained the right to award their own degrees. In 2002 the main building &quot;Moas båge&quot; (Moa&#x27;s crescent) was inaugurated in Flemingsberg. The building also received the Concrete Products Outdoor Environment Prize in 2003. With the new facilities the teacher education program was moved from Södertälje to Flemingsberg. In spring 2006, the university&#x27;s board operations decided to move from campus Haninge to campus Flemingsberg by autumn 2008 and phase out the Södertälje campus where teaching had already been discontinued.

Södertörn University applied to the government to become a university in 2002. The application has not yet been processed. In 2004 Södertörn University applied together with Karolinska Institutet and KTH for approval to create a university network at Södertörn University based on the same model as the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. In May 2006, an updated version of the university application was submitted to the government, including changes implemented since 2002. On 1 July 2010, the Swedish Higher Education Authority granted Södertörn University the right to award doctoral degrees in the areas of Historical Studies, Critical and Cultural Theory, Environmental Studies and Politics, Economy and the Organisation of Society.

At the end of 2013 Södertörn University was awarded the task of providing the basic training programme for the police. It will run as contract education and will cover five semesters of full-time studies, including a six-month traineeship at a police authority. The first 180 police cadets started their education at Södertörn University in January 2015.

In 2013 Södertörn University had 12,578 students, of whom 6,984 were full-time students.

<text>The brown jay (Cyanocorax morio) is a large jay native to Central America and southern Texas.

==Taxonomy==
The brown jay was formerly placed in its own genus &quot;Psilorhinus&quot;. When molecular phylogenetic studies found that the genus &quot;Cyanocorax&quot; was paraphyletic relative to &quot;Psilorhinus&quot;, &quot;Psilorhinus&quot; was subsumed into &quot;Cyanocorax&quot; to resolve the paraphyly.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. m. palliatus&quot; (Van Rossem, 1934) – extreme south Texas (south USA) and northeast, east Mexico
* &quot;C. m. morio&quot; (Wagler, 1829) – southeast Mexico to west Panama
* &quot;C. m. vociferus&quot; (Cabot, S, 1843) – north Yucatán Peninsula (southeast Mexico)

==Description==

Brown jays vary in plumage geographically: there are two main groups. Northern birds are almost completely dark brown, with lighter brown on the underparts. Southern birds are white-bellied and have bright white tips to the outer tail feathers. The intergrade zone is in Veracruz, Mexico. Adults in both populations have black bills, legs, and feet. Immatures have yellow bare parts, including yellow eye-rings.

The voice is a loud but low-pitched &quot;pee-ah&quot; call and is often modified to suit its situation or mood.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northernmost extent of the brown jay is in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas close to the Mexican border; from Mexico it occurs south into Central America. in Mexico it occurs widely in the east and southeast. In Central America, it is widespread on the Gulf slope from Belize south to western Panama; it is scarcer on the Pacific slope, and in El Salvador is confined to the far northeast in Morazán Department close to the Honduras border.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Food is sought largely in trees but brown jays also take some food from the ground. They are rather indiscriminate feeders. Insects and a wide range of other invertebrates are taken, also lizards, nectar, and fruit (e.g. that of &quot;Trophis racemosa&quot; in the Moraceae). Though they will take eggs and nestlings, they appear not to if there is plenty of other food available.

The nest is built in a tree or large shrub with both sexes helping in construction. There are normally three eggs laid but up to six is not unusual. Incubation is between 18 and 20 days. Only the female broods but the male feeds her while doing so.

Sometimes the offspring from a previous season will help in raising the chicks. If a helper bird returns with food, it will give it to one of the resident parents to feed the chicks.

===Ingesund School of Music===
The Ingesund School of Music is part of Karlstad University and the Department of Artistic Studies. It is situated in the beautiful Arvika area in mid-Sweden. The school offers music teacher education, music studies, and sound engineering.

== Buildings ==
Karlstad University has a new and environmentally friendly way of heating and cooling the university&#x27;s buildings. The initiative is one of the largest in a campus area in Europe, making Karlstad University almost self-sufficient for heat and cold.

With the new plant, Karlstad University will produce virtually all its heat and cooling locally. This will happen via 270 drilled holes, 200 meters down to the ground. And the environmental benefits are many, among other things, carbon dioxide emissions are radically reduced and energy consumption for heating and cooling buildings can fall by about 70 percent.

The investment means that the current district heating is replaced and that heat can instead be supplied by heat pump technology. During the summer, heat is stored in the ground and then taken up during the winter.

There is no other campus in Europe with a comprehensive geo-energy plant in this size, says Birgitta Hohlfält, Regional Director of Akademiska Hus Väst.

<doc id="216965" wikidata="Q220130" url="?curid=216965" title="Flinders Petrie">
<text>Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie ( – ), commonly known as simply Sir Flinders Petrie, was an English Egyptologist and a pioneer of systematic methodology in archaeology and the preservation of artefacts. He held the first chair of Egyptology in the United Kingdom, and excavated many of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt in conjunction with his Irish-born wife, Hilda Urlin. Some consider his most famous discovery to be that of the Merneptah Stele, an opinion with which Petrie himself concurred. Undoubtedly at least as important is his 1905 discovery and correct identification of the character of the Proto-Sinaitic script, the ancestor of almost all alphabetic scripts.

Petrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings. Petrie has been denounced for his pro-eugenics views; he was a dedicated believer in the superiority of the Northern peoples over the Latinate and Southern peoples.

He has been referred to as the &quot;father of Egyptian archaeology&quot;.

==Early life==
Petrie was born on 3 June 1853 in Charlton, Kent, England, the son of William Petrie (1821–1908) and Anne (née Flinders) (1812–1892). Anne was the daughter of British Captain Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia (and after whom Petrie was named). William Petrie was an electrical engineer who developed carbon arc lighting and later developed chemical processes for Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co.

Petrie was raised in a Christian household (his father being a member of the Plymouth Brethren), and was educated at home. He had no formal education. His father taught his son how to survey accurately, laying the foundation for his archaeological career. At the age of eight, he was tutored in French, Latin, and Greek, until he had a collapse and was taught at home. He also ventured his first archaeological opinion aged eight, when friends visiting the Petrie family were describing the unearthing of the Brading Roman Villa in the Isle of Wight. The boy was horrified to hear the rough shovelling out of the contents, and protested that the earth should be pared away, inch by inch, to see all that was in it and how it lay. &quot;All that I have done since,&quot; he wrote when he was in his late seventies, &quot;was there to begin with, so true it is that we can only develop what is born in the mind. I was already in archaeology by nature.&quot;

==Academic career==
The chair of Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology at University College London was set up and funded in 1892 following a bequest from Amelia Edwards, who died suddenly in that year. Petrie&#x27;s supporter since 1880, Edwards had instructed that he should be its first incumbent. He continued to excavate in Egypt after taking up the professorship, training many of the best archaeologists of the day.
In 1904, Petrie published Methods and Aims in Archaeology, the definitive work of his time, in which he defined the goals and methodology of his profession along with the more practical aspects of archaeology—such as details of excavation, including the use of cameras in the field. Insights include the contention that research results were dependent on the personality of the archaeologist, who, he felt, needed to possess broad knowledge as well as insatiable curiosity. His own abundance of that characteristic was never questioned.

In 1913, Petrie sold his large collection of Egyptian antiquities to University College, London, where it is now housed in the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology. One of his trainees, Howard Carter, went on to discover the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922.

==Petrie&#x27;s mental capacity==
==Archaeology career==
===In Britain===
In his teenage years, Petrie surveyed British prehistoric monuments, commencing with the late Romano-British &#x27;British Camp&#x27; that lay within yards of his family home in Charlton, in attempts to understand their geometry. At 19 he produced the most accurate survey of Stonehenge.

===Giza survey===
His father had corresponded with Piazzi Smyth about his theories of the Great Pyramid and Petrie travelled to Egypt in early 1880 to make an accurate survey of Giza, making him the first to properly investigate how the pyramids there were constructed; many theories had been advanced on this, and Petrie read them all, but none was based on first hand observation or logic.

Petrie&#x27;s published reports of this triangulation survey, and his analysis of the architecture of Giza therein, were exemplary in its methodology and accuracy, disproving Smyth&#x27;s theories and still providing much of the basic data regarding the pyramid plateau to this day. On that visit, he was appalled by the rate of destruction of monuments (some listed in guidebooks had been worn away completely since then) and mummies. He described Egypt as &quot;a house on fire, so rapid was the destruction&quot; and felt his duty to be that of a &quot;salvage man, to get all I could, as quickly as possible and then, when I was 60, I would sit and write it all&quot;.

===Egypt Exploration Fund affiliation===
Returning to England at the end of 1880, Petrie wrote a number of articles and then met Amelia Edwards, journalist and patron of the Egypt Exploration Fund (now the Egypt Exploration Society), who became his strong supporter and later appointed him as professor at her Egyptology chair at University College London. Impressed by his scientific approach, the university 
offered him work as the successor to Édouard Naville. Petrie accepted the position and was given the sum of £250 per month to cover the excavation expenses. In November 1884, Petrie arrived in Egypt to begin his excavations.

===Koptos===
===Tanis dig===
He first went to a New Kingdom site at Tanis, with 170 workmen. He cut out the middle man role of foreman on this and all subsequent excavations, taking complete overall control himself and removing pressure on the workmen from the foreman to discover finds quickly but sloppily. Though he was regarded as an amateur and dilettante by more established Egyptologists, this made him popular with his workers, who made several small but significant finds that would have been lost under the old system.

===Tell Nebesheh dig===
In 1886, while working for the Egypt Exploration Fund, Petrie excavated at Tell Nebesheh in the Eastern Nile Delta. This site is located 8 miles southeast of Tanis and, among the remains of an ancient temple there, Petrie found a royal sphinx, now located at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

===Nile and Sehel Island===
By the end of the Tanis dig, he ran out of funding but, reluctant to leave the country in case it was renewed, he spent 1887 cruising the Nile taking photographs as a less subjective record than sketches. During this time, he also climbed rope ladders at Sehel Island near Aswan to draw and photograph thousands of early Egyptian inscriptions on a cliff face, recording embassies to Nubia, famines and wars.
===Fayum burials===
By the time he reached Aswan, a telegram had reached there to confirm the renewal of his funding. He then went straight to the burial site at Fayum, particularly interested in post-30 BC burials, which had not previously been fully studied. He found intact tombs and 60 of the famous portraits, and discovered from inscriptions on the mummies that they were kept with their living families for generations before burial. Under Auguste Mariette&#x27;s arrangements, he sent 50% of these portraits to the Egyptian department of antiquities.

However, when he later found that Gaston Maspero placed little value on them and left them open to the elements in a yard behind the museum to deteriorate, he angrily demanded that they all be returned, forcing Maspero to pick the 12 best examples for the museum to keep and return 48 to Petrie, who sent them to London for a special showing at the British Museum. Resuming work, he discovered the village of the Pharaonic tomb-workers.

===Palestine, Tell Hesi and Wadi Rababah===
In 1890, Petrie made the first of his many forays into Palestine, leading to much important archaeological work. His six-week excavation of Tell el-Hesi (which was mistakenly identified as Lachish) that year represents the first scientific excavation of an archaeological site in the Holy Land. Petrie surveyed a group of tombs in the Wadi al-Rababah (the biblical Hinnom) of Jerusalem, largely dating to the Iron Age and early Roman periods. Here, in these ancient monuments, Petrie discovered that two different types of cubit had been used as units of length.

===Amarna===
From 1891, he worked on the temple of Aten at Tell-el-Amarna, discovering a New Kingdom painted pavement of garden and animals and hunting scenes. This became a tourist attraction but, as there was no direct access to the site, tourists wrecked neighbouring fields on their way to it. This made local farmers deface the paintings, and it is only thanks to Petrie&#x27;s copies that their original appearance is known.

===Discovery of the &#x27;Israel&#x27; or Merneptah stele===
In early 1896, Petrie and his archaeological team were conducting excavations on a temple in Petrie&#x27;s area of concession at Luxor. This temple complex was located just north of the original funerary temple of Amenhotep III, which had been built on a flood plain. They were initially surprised that this building which they were excavating
: was also attributed to Amenophis III since only his name appeared on blocks strewn over the site...Could one king have had two mortuary temples? Petrie dug and soon solved the puzzle: the temple had been built by Merneptah or Merenptah, the son and successor of Ramesses II, almost entirely from stone which had been plundered from the temple of Amenophis III nearby. Statues of the latter had been smashed and the pieces thrown into the foundations; fragments of couchant stone jackals, which must have once formed an imposing avenue approaching the pylon, and broken drums gave some idea of the splendour of the original temple. A statue of Merneptah himself was found—the first known portrait of this king...Better was to follow: two splendid stelae were found, both of them usurped on the reverse side by Merneptah, who had turned them face to the wall. One, beautifully carved, showed Amenophis III in battle with Nubians and Syrians; the other, of black granite, was over ten feet high, larger than any stela previously known; the original text commemorated the building achievements of Amenophis and described the beauties and magnificence of the temple in which it had stood. When it could be turned over, an inscription of Merneptah was revealed, recording his triumphs over the Libyans and the Peoples of the Sea; [Wilhelm] Spiegelberg [a noted German philologist] came over to read it, and near the end of the text he was puzzled by one name, that of a people or tribe whom Merenptah had victoriously smitten-&quot;I.si.ri.ar?&quot; It was Petrie whose quick imaginative mind leapt to the solution: &quot;Israel!&quot; Spiegelberg agreed that it must be so. &quot;Won&#x27;t the reverends be pleased?&quot; was his comment. At dinner that evening Petrie prophesied: &quot;This stele will be better known in the world than anything else I have found.&quot; It was the first mention of the word &quot;Israel&quot; in any Egyptian text and the news made headlines when it reached the English papers.

During the field season of 1895/6, at the Ramesseum, Petrie and the young German Egyptologist Wilhelm Spiegelberg became friends. Spiegelberg was in charge of the edition of many texts discovered by his British colleague, and Petrie offered important collections of artefacts to the University of Strasbourg. In 1897, the Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität Straßburg gratefully conferred to Petrie the title of doctor honoris causa, and in June 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1905.

===Hu and Abadiya cemeteries===
From 1889 to 1899, Petrie directed a team excavating over 17 cemeteries containing numerous graves between Hu and Abadiya, Egypt. The dig team included Beatrice Orme, David Randall-MacIver, Arthur Cruttenden Mace, Henrietta Lawes and Hilda Petrie. Predynastic, Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom and Roman graves were excavated and published at &#x27;Diospolis Parva&#x27;.

== Discovery of the Proto-Sinaitic script ==
In the winter of 1904-5, Petrie and his team (among which we find Currelly, Capitain Weill, Lieutenant Frost, Miss Eckenstein) were conducting a series of archaeological studies in the Sinai Peninsula centered around the site of Serabit el-Khadim, a lucrative turquoise mine used during the Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasty and again between the Eighteenth and mid-Twentieth Dynasty. As they were thoroughly exploring and studying the temple of Hathor and the surrounding mining area, they discovered amongst, the Egyptian texts, a significant series of foreign inscriptions. Having been joined by his wife Hilda, herself also an egyptologist, Petrie realized the script was wholly alphabetic and not the combination of logograms and syllabics characteristic of Egyptian script proper. He thus assumed that the script showed a script that the turquoise miners had devised themselves, using linear signs that they had borrowed from hieroglyphics. He published his findings in London the following year. He had discovered and correctly identified the character of the Proto-Sinaitic script, the ancestor of almost all alphabetic scripts.

==Later life==

In 1923, Petrie was knighted for services to British Archaeology and Egyptology. Students of UCL commemorated the investiture by writing and performing a musical play. A hundred years later, the questions had changed: &quot;Between investigations on eugenics, decolonial practice, and calls for repatriation, what has become of Flinderella?&quot;

===Palestine: Jemmeh and Ajjul===
The focus of his work shifted permanently to Palestine in 1926. From 1927 until 1938, he excavated in Palestine under the auspices of the American School of Research. he discovered ruins of ten cities in Tell el-Hesi. He began excavating several important sites in the south-west of Palestine, including Tell Jemmeh and Tell el-Ajjul.

===Luxor and the novel excavation system===
In parallel with his work in Palestine, Petrie became interested in early Egypt. In 1928, while digging a cemetery at Luxor, this proved so huge that he devised an entirely new excavation system, including comparison charts for finds, which is still used today.

===Move to Jerusalem===
In 1933, on retiring from his professorship, he moved permanently to Jerusalem, where he lived with Lady Petrie at the British School of Archaeology, then temporarily headquartered at the American School of Oriental Research (today the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research).

==Death and preservation of head==

Sir Flinders Petrie died in Jerusalem on 28 July 1942. His body was interred in the Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion, but he donated his head (and thus his brain) to the Royal College of Surgeons of London. World War II was then at its height, and the head was delayed in transit. After being stored in a jar in the college basement, its label fell off and no one knew to whom the head belonged. However, it was eventually identified, and is now stored, but not displayed, at the Royal College of Surgeons.

There is a popular legend that Hilda brought back her husband&#x27;s head in a hat box from Jerusalem after the war. But letters in the Petrie Museum archive illustrate that this legend is not true.

==Personal life==
Petrie married Hilda Urlin (1871–1957) in London on 26 November 1896. The couple had two children, John (1907–1972) and Ann (1909–1989). The family originally lived in Hampstead, London, where an English Heritage blue plaque has been placed on the building in which they lived at 5 Cannon Place. John Flinders Petrie became a noted mathematician, who gave his name to the Petrie polygon.

==Legacy==
===Scientific excavation methods===
Flinders Petrie&#x27;s painstaking recording and study of artefacts set new standards in archaeology. He wrote: &quot;I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.&quot;

===Relative dating through pottery===

By linking styles of pottery with periods, he was the first to use seriation in Egyptology, a new method for establishing the chronology of a site.

===Teacher and mentor===
Petrie was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including Howard Carter, who discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun. On the centennial of Petrie&#x27;s birth in 1953, his widow Hilda Petrie created a student travel scholarship to Egypt.

===Egypt findings===
Many thousands of artefacts recovered during excavations led by Petrie can be found in museums worldwide.

===Petrie Medal for archaeology===
The Petrie Medal was created in celebration of Petrie&#x27;s seventieth birthday, when funds were raised to commission and produce 20 medals to be awarded &quot;once in every three years for distinguished work in Archaeology, preferably to a British subject&quot;. The first medal was awarded to Petrie himself (1925), and the first few recipients included Sir Aurel Stein (1928), Sir Arthur Evans (1931), Abbé Henri Breuil (1934), J.D. Beazley (1937), Sir Mortimer Wheeler (1950), Alan Wace (1953), and Sir Leonard Woolley (1957).

===Racist views===

Petrie remains controversial for his pro-eugenics and racist views, and was a dedicated believer in the superiority of the Northern peoples over the Latinate and Southern peoples. In his 1906 sociological series &quot;Question of the day&quot;, he expressed these views, ascribing social problems of England to racial degeneration brought on by communism, trade unionism, and government assistance to people groups he found inferior. His racist views spilled over into his academic opinions. Believing that society is the product of racial biology, he contended that the culture of Ancient Egypt was derived from an invading Caucasoid &quot;Dynastic Race&quot;, which had entered Egypt from the south in late predynastic times, conquered the &quot;inferior, exhausted mulatto&quot; natives, and slowly introduced the higher Dynastic civilisation as it interbred with them. With relation to some of his earlier conclusions in 1895, where Petrie had written: &quot;the Egyptians were largely formed from Libyan immigrants to begin with; the basis of the race apparently being a mulatto of Libyan-negro mixture judging from the earliest skeletons at Medum.&quot; Petrie also engaged in fierce controversies with the British Museum&#x27;s Egyptology expert E. A. Wallis Budge, who contended that the religion of the Egyptians was not introduced by invaders, but was essentially identical to that of the people of northeastern and central Africa; however, most of their colleagues judged Petrie&#x27;s opinion to be more scientific.

===Palestinian archaeology===
His involvement in Palestinian archaeology was examined in the exhibition &quot;A Future for the Past: Petrie&#x27;s Palestinian Collection&quot;.

===Memorial===
In August 2012, more than a hundred people gathered at Petrie&#x27;s grave, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of his death. His headstone is marked only with his name and an ankh symbol, the Egyptian hieroglyph for &quot;life&quot;.

==Published work==

A number of Petrie&#x27;s discoveries were presented to the Royal Archaeological Society and described in the society&#x27;s &quot;Archaeological Journal&quot; by his good friend and fellow archaeologist Flaxman Charles John Spurrell. Petrie published a total of 97 books.

<text>Örebro University () is a public university in Örebro, Sweden.

The university has its roots in the Örebro campus of Uppsala University, and became an independent state university college in 1977, Örebro University College (&quot;Högskolan i Örebro&quot;). The university college also incorporated three other existing educational institutions in Örebro: the teaching seminar, the sports college (founded in 1966) and the social work college (founded 1967). Örebro University College was granted the privileges of a university by the Government of Sweden in 1999, becoming the 12th university in Sweden.

On 30 March 2010 the university was granted the right to award medical degrees in collaboration with Örebro University Hospital, making it the 7th medical school in Sweden.

The law programme at Örebro University is one of Sweden&#x27;s most popular programmes (number 10 in 2018, with more than 4,800 applicants).

==History==
In 1967, Uppsala University established a branch in Örebro, the College of Social Sciences. In 1977, Örebro University College was established through a merger of the Uppsala University branch in Örebro, the Preschool Teaching Seminary, and the College of Physical Education and Sport Science, and the College of Social Sciences. In 1999, the university college was granted the status of a university by the Government of Sweden and opened by then Prime Minister Göran Persson on 6 February 1999.

==Student Life==

=== Student Union ===
The student union called &quot;Örebro studentkår&quot; shortened &quot;ÖS&quot; was created 1963 and represents all students at Örebro University.

Örebro Student Union collaborates and is in constant contact with the university and the municipality to speak on behalf of students in the decisions that affect them. Among other things, the Student Union has student representatives in the Faculty Boards – which are part of the university&#x27;s central management.

Örebro Student Union is a democratic, non-political organisation which is ruled by the students themselves as a whole, but to make things easier there are different departments that run the actual work in the student union, the most important ones being the student council and the student union board.

==== Student council====
The Student Council is the organisation&#x27;s highest decision-making body. Simply translated, the general council is Örebro Student Union&#x27;s own parliament. The role of the Student Council today is to set the overall direction for Örebro Student Union as an organization and activities and to be responsible for the full-time remunerated employees who are elected by the Student Council.

The council consists of 41 members where each union section is represented; the members are elected by the union section&#x27;s members to represent the union section and speak on its behalf. Every ordinary member of Örebro Student Union has the right to submit points to the Student Council.

The council meets four to five times a year, when they vote on various issues that affect or have been submitted by the students. A couple weeks before each voting session the student council assembles for an opinion meeting where all documents that will be brought up at the time of the vote will be reviewed. This is so that the council&#x27;s members can ask questions and make themselves familiar with the issue for them to bring it back to their respective sections for their opinion as well as being able to discuss and exchange ideas before the actual voting meeting which will reduce the amount of time needed to make an actual decision.

==== Student union board ====
Directly subordinate to Örebro Student Union&#x27;s (ÖS) council is the union board – Örebro Student Union&#x27;s highest executive body.

The union board consists of the president of ÖS, the two vice presidents of ÖS and one member from each section (usually the president or vice president of the section). The main task of the Student Union Board can be summarized as implementing the council&#x27;s decisions and managing the organization.

=== Kårsektionerna ===
The student union is divided into sections &quot;Kårsektioner&quot; that represent the different programs and faculties that are available at Örebro University. Örebro studentkår have 9 different sections called; Corax, DokSek, GIH, Grythyttan, Qultura, Serum, Sesam, Sobra and TekNat.

There is also one un-official student section at Örebro University called ESN which contains all the exchange students who come to study at the university. ESN does not have any voting power in the student union, as its members are only students at the university for a short time.

Each student section has its own given colour which also translates onto their student overall, or &quot;Ovve&quot;. The different colours help in identifying different sections from each other, for example during the student introduction or just on a night out at the student club. 
=== Ovven ===
The student overall or &quot;Ovve&quot; is arguably the holiest piece of clothing a Swedish university student can own. The act of owning/wearing an Ovve is a cultural phenomenon dating back to the 1960s that has evolved through the different universities in Sweden. Today owning the boilersuit-looking overall filled with patches is a must for university students across the country, and the piece of clothing comes with a series of rules that its bearer must follow.

While the rules and act of wearing the ovve differ slightly between universities, they are mostly the same all throughout the country, with the most important rule being: You can never wash the Ovve unless you wear it while doing so.

==== The ovve ceremony ====
Since the ovve is considered holy among the Swedish university students, you are not allowed to use it fully until it has been through the ovve ceremony, which is like a baptism of sorts. Before the ovve ceremony you are only able to wear your ovve fully buttoned up, in student terms &quot;uppcabbad,&quot; and free from any sort of embellishments. The ceremony itself can be different depending on which university you study at, but they all have the common goal of inviting new people to the ovve-wearing society. After you and your ovve have been through the ceremony you are finally allowed to embellish it to your heart&#x27;s desire and wear it rolled down and tied at your waist (nedcabbad).

<doc id="216970" wikidata="Q310046" url="?curid=216970" title="Peter Mandelson">
<text>Peter Benjamin Mandelson, Baron Mandelson, (born 21 October 1953), is a British politician, lobbyist and diplomat who has served as British Ambassador to the United States since February 2025. 

A member of the Labour Party, Mandelson served as Labour&#x27;s director of communications from 1985 to 1990, becoming one of the first people to whom the term &quot;spin doctor&quot; was applied, and gained the nickname &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; because of his &quot;ruthless&quot; and &quot;media savvy&quot; reputation.

Mandelson served as Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and President of the Board of Trade in 1998 and again from 2008 to 2010, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 1999 to 2001 as well as First Secretary of State and Lord President of the Council from 2009 to 2010. He was the European Commissioner for Trade from 2004 to 2008, Member of Parliament (MP) for Hartlepool from 1992 to 2004 and was appointed to the House of Lords as a life peer in 2008. In November 2010, he co-founded Global Counsel, a lobbying firm based in London.

Mandelson has been described as having a &quot;significant influence&quot; on the office of current Labour Party leader and prime minister Keir Starmer as a &quot;core part&quot; of his political network. In December 2024, Starmer nominated Mandelson to be the HM ambassador to the United States.

==Early life and education==
Peter Mandelson was born in Hendon, Middlesex, on 21 October 1953, the younger son of the Hon. Mary Joyce Mandelson () and George Norman Mandelson (1920–1988). Of Polish Jewish extraction, his patrilineal great-great-great-grandfather was Colonel Naphtali Felthousen Mendelssohn; his great-grandfather, Levy Mandelson (1834–1891) was son-in-law of Samuel Cohen; and, his grandfather, Norman Levy Mandelson (1872–1956), founded the Harrow United Synagogue. His father George Norman Mandelson (&quot;known as&quot; Tony) was the advertising manager of &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; who served as a commissioned officer in the Royal Dragoons during the Second World War. On his mother&#x27;s side, Mandelson is a grandson of Herbert Morrison, the London County Council leader and a Labour Cabinet minister in the Attlee government. Mandelson was raised in Hampstead Garden Suburb; recalling his childhood, he said: &quot;my whole upbringing was framed around the Suburb – my friendships and values&quot;.

=== Education ===
Mandelson attended the Garden Suburb School, and from 1965 to 1972 the Hendon County Grammar School. In 1966, he appeared on stage with the local amateur theatre group, the Hampstead Garden Suburb Dramatic Society, as the eponymous lead in &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;. During his teenage years he joined the Young Communist League due to the UK&#x27;s support of the United States&#x27; role in the Vietnam War. He was educated at the University of Oxford as an undergraduate of St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE); his tutors included Nicholas Stern.

== Early career ==
As Chairman of the British Youth Council, in 1978 Mandelson was delegated to attend the Soviet-organised World Festival of Youth and Students at Havana, Cuba. He was elected to Lambeth Borough Council in 1979 but stood down in 1982, disillusioned with the state of Labour politics. Mandelson then worked from 1982 to 1985 as a television producer at London Weekend Television on &quot;Weekend World&quot;, where he formed a friendship with his superior John (&quot;now&quot; Lord) Birt.

== Political career ==

=== Labour&#x27;s director of communications ===
In 1985, the Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock appointed him as the party&#x27;s director of communications. As director, he was one of the first people in Britain to whom the term &quot;spin doctor&quot; was applied; he was thus called &quot;the Prince of Darkness&quot;. Mandelson ran the campaign at the 1986 Fulham by-election where Labour defeated the Conservative Party.

For the 1987 general election campaign, Mandelson commissioned film director Hugh Hudson, whose &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981) had won an Oscar as Best Picture, to make a party political broadcast promoting Neil Kinnock as a potential prime minister. Tagged &quot;Kinnock – the Movie&quot;, it led to the party leader&#x27;s approval rating being raised by 16%, to 19%, in polls, and was even repeated in another PPB slot. The election, held on 11 June 1987, returned Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservatives for the third time, although Labour gained 20 seats, and, this time, convincingly pushed the SDP-Liberal Alliance into third place. Opponents termed the Labour Party&#x27;s election campaign &quot;a brilliantly successful election defeat&quot;. He ceased being a Labour Party official in 1990 when he was selected as Labour candidate for the constituency of Hartlepool, which was then considered a safe seat.

===As an MP===
Mandelson was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election, and made several speeches outlining his strong support for the European Union. Although sidelined during the brief period when John Smith led the Labour Party, Mandelson was by now close to two Shadow Cabinet members – Gordon Brown and Tony Blair – each regarded as potential future party leaders. Following Smith&#x27;s sudden death on 12 May 1994, Mandelson opted to back Blair for the leadership, believing him a superior communicator to Brown, and played a leading role in the leadership campaign. This created acrimony between Mandelson and Brown, though they were considered to be allies in the Labour Party.

In 1994, Kate Garvey suggested that Mandelson (who was at the time being derided by the trades unions and other Labour factions), should adopt a &quot;nom de guerre&quot; throughout Blair&#x27;s leadership bid, so that he might conceal his considerable role within the campaign team. Mandelson agreed to be called &quot;Bobby&quot; for the duration and was thanked by Blair using this pseudonym in his victory speech. After becoming a close ally and trusted adviser to Tony Blair, Mandelson was Labour&#x27;s election campaign director for the 1997 general election, which Labour won decisively.

=== Minister without Portfolio ===
Mandelson was appointed as a Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet Office, where his job was to co-ordinate within government. A few months later, he also acquired responsibility for the Millennium Dome, after Blair decided to go ahead with the project despite the opposition of most of the Cabinet (including the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport who had been running it). Jennie Page, the Dome project&#x27;s chief executive, was abruptly sacked after a farcical opening night. In June 2000, in what was seen as a reference to the close interest in the Dome from Mandelson, known at the time as so-called &quot;Dome Secretary&quot; and his successor Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Page told the House of Commons Select Committee for Culture and Heritage: &quot;I made several attempts to persuade ministers that standing back from the Dome would be good for them as well as good for the Dome&quot;.

=== Secretary of State for Trade and Industry ===
In July 1998, Mandelson was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and was sworn of the Privy Council; he launched the Millennium Bug And Electronic Commerce Bill and a Competitiveness White paper, which he described, as &#x27;bold, far reaching and absolutely necessary&#x27;. He also appointed a &quot;Net Tsar&quot; to lead the UK in what he termed the &quot;new industrial revolution&quot;. Mandelson bought a home in Notting Hill in 1996 partly with an interest-free loan of £373,000 from Geoffrey Robinson, a Cabinet colleague and millionaire whose business dealings were subject to an inquiry by Mandelson&#x27;s department. Mandelson contended that he had deliberately not taken part in any decisions relating to Robinson. He had not declared the loan in the Register of Members&#x27; Interests and resigned in December 1998. Mandelson had also not declared the loan to his lender (the Britannia Building Society) although they decided not to take any action, with the CEO stating &quot;I am satisfied that the information given to us at the time of the mortgage application was accurate.&quot; Mandelson initially thought he could weather the press storm, but had to resign when it became clear that the Prime Minister thought nothing else would clear the air. In October 2000, it was reported that Robinson had &quot;accused Peter Mandelson of lying to the Commons about the home loan affair that cost both of them their government jobs.&quot;

Later, it emerged that while in the role, Mandelson urged PM Blair to proceed with the rollout of the system which later metastasised into the Horizon IT scandal arguing that it was &quot;only sensible choice&quot;.

=== Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ===
Mandelson was out of the Cabinet for ten months. In October 1999 he was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, replacing Mo Mowlam. In his very first speech in the post he mistakenly referred to himself as the &quot;Secretary of State for Ireland&quot;. During his tenure he oversaw the creation of the devolved legislative assembly and power-sharing executive and reform of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. 

On 24 January 2001, Mandelson resigned from the Government for a second time, following accusations of using his position to influence a passport application. He had contacted Home Office Minister Mike O&#x27;Brien on behalf of Srichand Hinduja, an Indian businessman who was seeking British citizenship and whose family firm was to become the main sponsor of the &quot;Faith Zone&quot; in the Millennium Dome. At the time Hinduja and his brothers were under investigation by the Indian Government for alleged involvement in the Bofors scandal. Mandelson insisted he had done nothing wrong and was exonerated by an independent inquiry by Sir Anthony Hammond, which concluded that neither Mandelson nor anyone else had acted improperly.

At the 2001 general election Mandelson was challenged by Arthur Scargill of the Socialist Labour Party and by John Booth, a former Labour Party press officer standing as &quot;Genuine Labour&quot;, but Mandelson was re-elected with a large majority. In his victory speech, Mandelson said: &quot;It was said that I was facing political oblivion ... Well, they underestimated Hartlepool and they underestimated me because I am a fighter and not a quitter.&quot;

=== Stepping down as MP ===
Despite Labour success at the June 2001 general election, a third Cabinet appointment did not materialise and Mandelson indicated his interest in becoming the United Kingdom&#x27;s European Commissioner when the new Commission was established in 2004. Both of Britain&#x27;s Commissioners, Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten, were due to stand down. Appointment as a European Commissioner would require his resignation from Parliament, precipitating a by-election in his Hartlepool constituency. His EC appointment was announced in the summer and on 8 September 2004 Mandelson resigned his seat by petitioning to become Steward of the Manor of Northstead. Labour held the seat at the 2004 Hartlepool by-election with a much-reduced majority of 2,033 votes (equating to 40.7% of the vote), being succeeded by Iain Wright as MP for Hartlepool.

=== European Commissioner ===
On 22 November 2004, Mandelson became Britain&#x27;s European Commissioner, taking the trade portfolio. In October 2008 he left his post as Trade Commissioner to return to UK politics. As a former EU Commissioner, Mandelson became entitled to a £31,000 pension upon reaching the age of 65 years. It was claimed by Christopher Hope of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2009 that Mandelson&#x27;s pension was contingent on a &quot;duty of loyalty to the Communities&quot;, which also applied after his term in office. The TaxPayers&#x27; Alliance, which was reported to have uncovered the threat to his pension, demanded that he should declare the conflict of interest and either relinquish his EU pay cheques or resign as a minister. &quot;When one considers that his new ministerial post deals specifically with business, enterprise and regulatory reform – all areas that are intimately involved with EU legislation, regulation and policy –&quot; the group said, &quot;the conflict of interest is even more stark.&quot; Mandelson did not agree that he had a conflict of interests. &quot;He has always had a clear view of British interests and how they are secured by our EU membership,&quot; a spokesperson said.

The website Full Fact reported in 2019 that the claim was untrue, stating that while there are rules governing the conduct of current and former EU staff members, which can lead to pensions sanctions, the European Commission had informed them that it would be &quot;probably impossible&quot; for such people to lose their pension for criticising the EU or supporting Brexit. Full Fact also pointed out that there had been multiple cases of both current and ex-commissioners criticising the EU – in April 2019, German former Commissioner Günter Verheugen criticised the EU&#x27;s Brexit negotiating position, saying &quot;the problem is on the EU side&quot;, while in 2017 British former Commissioner Lord Hill had supported &quot;getting on&quot; with Brexit.

===Peerage and return to Cabinet ===

On 3 October 2008, as part of Gordon Brown&#x27;s Cabinet reshuffle it was announced, amid some controversy, that Mandelson would return to Government in the re-designated post of Business Secretary and would be raised to the peerage, thus becoming a member of the House of Lords. On 13 October 2008 he was created Baron Mandelson, of Foy in the County of Herefordshire and of Hartlepool in the County of Durham, being introduced in the House of Lords the same day. Following his return to office, Mandelson supported the planned Heathrow expansion. On 6 March 2009, environmental protester Leila Deen of anti-aviation group Plane Stupid approached him outside a summit on the government&#x27;s low carbon industrial strategy and threw a cup of green custard in his face in protest over his support for a third runway at Heathrow Airport. The protester was cautioned on 9 April for causing &quot;harassment, alarm or distress&quot;.

In a Cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009 Mandelson was appointed Lord President of the Council with the honorary title of First Secretary of State; it was also announced that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills would be merged into his, affording him the new title of Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and that he would continue as President of the Board of Trade. Mandelson was a member of 35 of the 43 Cabinet committees and subcommittees.

In August 2009, Mandelson was widely reported to have ordered &quot;technical measures&quot; such as internet disconnection to be included in the draft of the Digital Economy Act 2010 after a &quot;big lobbying operation&quot;, even though the Digital Britain report had rejected this type of punishment. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that according to their Whitehall sources, Mandelson was persuaded that tough laws were needed to reduce online copyright infringement following an intensive lobbying campaign by influential people in the music and film industry. The paper also reported that this included a meeting with DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen at the Rothschild family villa on the Greek island of Corfu. Mandelson&#x27;s spokesperson claimed that there had been no discussion of internet piracy during the Corfu dinner and suggested that the decision to reverse Lord Carter&#x27;s findings had been taken in late July before the trip. &quot;The Times&quot; reported after the Corfu meeting that an unnamed Whitehall source had confirmed that before this trip, Mandelson had shown little personal interest in the Digital Britain agenda, which has been ongoing for several years. According to the source of &quot;The Times&quot;, Mandelson returned from holiday and effectively issued an edict that the regulation needed to be tougher.

In August 2011, a Freedom of Information (FOI) request showed that Mandelson had decided to approve the inclusion of technical measures, such as the disconnection of internet access, at least two months before public consultation had finished and that he had shown little interest in the consultation. Letters from Mandelson&#x27;s office document talks with Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, on 2 June 2009 and that on the following day Mandelson advised Lord Carter about the &quot;possibility of [the Secretary of State] having a power to direct OfCom to go directly to introduce technical measures&quot;. Mandelson made the formal announcement that technical measures, including disconnection, were to be included in the Digital Economy Bill two months later on 7 August 2009.

An opinion poll conducted by the centre-left think tank Compass found in March 2009 that Mandelson was less disliked by Labour Party members than Deputy Leader Harriet Harman. This was felt to be unusual as Mandelson &quot;historically has been unpopular among Labour members&quot;. Blair&#x27;s assertion in 1996, namely that &quot;my project will be complete when the Labour Party learns to love Peter Mandelson&quot;, was seen as prophetic in late September 2009 when Mandelson was enthusiastically received at the party conference in Brighton.

== Post-Cabinet career ==
After the Labour Party lost the 2010 general election, Mandelson&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;The Third Man: Life at the Heart of New Labour&quot;, were published in July 2010, two months after leaving office. The memoirs were subsequently criticised by Labour leadership contenders Ed and David Miliband as too by Andy Burnham.

During this time, he was appointed President of the international think tank Policy Network.

In November 2010, Mandelson and Benjamin Wegg-Prosser founded Global Counsel, a lobbying firm based in London, with the financial support of WPP, the advertising giant. 

The firm provides advice for corporate strategists and senior management worldwide. 

Peter Mandelson has been criticised for so far not disclosing his clients. 

As a corporate lobbyist, he personally helped clients such as Shein, Shell, Palantir, Alibaba, TikTok, and the UK private water industry obtain meetings with ministers and senior officials. 

In 1999, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, Mandelson was an invited guest of the Bilderberg Group and attended the annual conferences. In January 2011, it was announced that Mandelson would serve as a senior adviser to the advisory investment banking firm, Lazard. 

In 2013, Lord Mandelson also joined the Board of Trustees of Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Alfred Herrhausen Gesellschaft. In May 2011 it was revealed that there was speculation that Mandelson had been approached by China to be a candidate for the leadership of the International Monetary Fund, even though Mandelson had not served as a finance minister or headed a central bank. It was then speculated that Lord Mandelson&#x27;s name might be put forward to succeed Pascal Lamy as Director-General of the World Trade Organization, backed by David Cameron.

In May 2012, Mandelson confirmed that he was advising Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (APP) in selling timber products to Europe. In 2012 APP was accused of illegal logging in Indonesia and damaging the habitats of rare animals such as the Sumatran tiger. At least 67 companies worldwide, such as Tesco and Kraft Foods since 2004 and Danone since 2012 have boycotted APP. In 2013, Lord Mandelson was appointed to the revived post of High Steward of Hull, an ancient ceremonial position held by his grandfather Herbert Morrison in 1956–65 and defunct since 1974.
After the 2015 Labour leadership election resulted in Jeremy Corbyn becoming the party leader, Mandelson stated that he believed that Labour was now unelectable, but advised party members unhappy with the situation to wait for Corbyn to demonstrate this before working to replace him. He wished for an early general election to force Corbyn out. In February 2017, he said Corbyn had &quot;no idea in the 21st century how to conduct himself as a leader of a party putting itself forward in a democratic election&quot; and &quot;I work every single day to bring forward the end of [Corbyn&#x27;s] tenure in office&quot;.

After the results of the 2017 UK general election became known, Mandelson conceded that Corbyn&#x27;s election campaign was &quot;very sure-footed&quot; and the result, in which Labour gained seats and denied the Conservatives a majority, unexpected. &quot;I was wrong&quot; about Corbyn, he told BBC News. &quot;I am very surprised, an earthquake has happened in British politics and I did not foresee it&quot;, although he doubted Corbyn&#x27;s ability to gain a Commons majority. Two years later, at the 2019 general election, Labour suffered their worst defeat since the 1930s. Mandelson described the result as &quot;not undeserved&quot;, arguing that Corbyn&#x27;s leadership was one of the main reasons for Labour&#x27;s defeat.

During the 2016 EU referendum, Mandelson sat on the board on Britain Stronger in Europe, the official &quot;Remain&quot; campaign, which was unsuccessful. Following the Brexit Referendum, Mandelson was an outspoken advocate for a second referendum.

After Roberto Azevêdo announced he would step down as Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in September 2020, Mandelson declared an interest in succeeding him. He proceeded to lobby governments around the world for the role, arguing that the WTO had &quot;reached a fork in the road&quot; and had to be &quot;picked up and put back on its feet&quot;. Mandelson, an opponent of Brexit, was overlooked in favour of the Conservative Liam Fox: his prospective candidacy ceased when Fox secured the UK Government&#x27;s nomination.

In 2021, it was reported that Mandelson had been advising Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on moving the party beyond Corbyn&#x27;s leadership and broadening its electoral appeal. Mandelson is one of the stars of the weekly podcast &quot;How To Win An Election&quot; from &quot;The Times,&quot; presented by Matt Chorley and alongside Polly Mackenzie and Danny Finkelstein.

Contesting the 2024 University of Oxford Chancellor election, Lord Mandelson finished fourth out of thirty-eight candidates, which Lord Hague won.

== Ambassadorship ==
In December 2024, Mandelson was named as the next UK Ambassador to the United States.

Peter Mandelson had previously described President Donald Trump as &quot;little short of a white nationalist and racist,&quot; &quot;reckless and a danger to the world&quot; and likened him to &quot;a bully&quot;.

== Controversies ==
During the 2009 expenses scandal, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; raised questions about the timing of Mandelson&#x27;s second home allowance claim, dating from 2004, saying, &quot;Lord Mandelson billed the taxpayer for almost £3,000 of work on his constituency home in Hartlepool less than a week after announcing his decision to stand down as an MP.&quot; Mandelson said in a statement, &quot;The work done was necessary maintenance. All claims made were reasonable and submitted consistent with parliamentary rules.&quot; On 22 April 2005, &quot;The Times&quot; revealed that Mandelson had spent the previous New Year&#x27;s Eve on the yacht of Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, which was at the centre of a major EU investigation and although it did not allege impropriety, it did state that Mandelson&#x27;s visit was inappropriate for a serving European Commissioner.

In 2006, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reported that Mandelson had received a free cruise on a yacht from Diego Della Valle, a controversial Italian mogul, raising questions as Della Valle&#x27;s businesses (such as luxury shoe brand Tod&#x27;s) benefited from tariffs imposed shortly thereafter by Mandelson as EU Trade Commissioner on Chinese shoes. Reports also indicated that Mandelson had been lent a private jet by Nat Rothschild, who also benefited from his decisions, while serving as Commissioner. Mandelson and Rothschild were accused of corruption leading Rothschild to sue the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; alleging libel, however Rothschild lost the case.

During the summer of 2008, Mandelson had a widely publicised disagreement with Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France. Sarkozy accused him of trying to sell out European farmers and appeared to blame his handling of the Doha round of trade talks for the &quot;no&quot; vote in the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Mandelson said his position at world trade talks had been undermined and told the BBC he did not start the row, saying, &quot;I stood up for myself, I&#x27;m not to be bullied.&quot; He said he believed the row was over but renewed his warnings on protectionism. 

In 2008, Mandelson was hospitalised, suffering from a kidney stone. At this time, melamine added to milk in China had caused kidney stones and other ailments in thousands of Chinese children, killing at least six. Ironically, during the previous week Mandelson had drunk a glass of Chinese yoghurt in front of reporters in order to show his confidence in Chinese dairy products, although his own kidney stones were unrelated.

In October 2008 Mandelson was reported to have maintained private contacts over several years with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, most recently on holiday in August 2008 on Deripaska&#x27;s yacht at Taverna Agni on the Greek island of Corfu. News of the contacts sparked criticism because, as European Union Trade Commissioner, Mandelson had been responsible for two decisions to cut aluminium tariffs that had benefited Deripaska&#x27;s United Company Rusal. Mandelson denied that there had been a conflict of interest and insisted that he had never discussed aluminium tariffs with Deripaska. On 26 October 2008 the Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague claimed the &quot;whole country&quot; wanted &quot;transparency&quot; about Mandelson&#x27;s previous meetings with Deripaska. In response, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Mandelson&#x27;s dealings with Deripaska had been &quot;found to be above board&quot;. Mandelson said that meeting business figures from &quot;across the range&quot; in emerging economies was part of his brief as EU Trade Commissioner. On 29 October 2008, while Mandelson was on a ministerial visit to Moscow, it was alleged in the British press that Valery Pechenkin, the head of security at Deripaska&#x27;s company Basic Element, had organised a swift entry visa for Mandelson when he turned up in Moscow to visit Deripaska in 2005.

In June 2013, writing for the Progress website, Mandelson warned Labour it risked harming its election chances if affiliated trade unions continued to &quot;manipulate parliamentary selections&quot; as was alleged in the 2013 Labour Party Falkirk candidate selection controversy. In April 2014, it was reported that Mandelson had strong ties to Russian conglomerate Sistema.

Peter Mandelson has been criticised for being a member of the House of Lords while running a lobbying firm. In 2021, he was the only Labour peer to vote against an amendment denouncing genocide in Xinjiang.

=== Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein ===
In 2019, UK&#x27;s Channel 4 aired an episode of &quot;Dispatches&quot; in which a source close to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein claimed that Peter Mandelson (while serving as a UK Cabinet Minister) made a phone call to Epstein in order to set up a meeting with Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan. 

In June 2023, an internal JPMorgan report from 2019, filed to a New York court, found that:&quot;&quot;Jeffrey Epstein appears to maintain a particularly close relationship with Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Lord [Peter] Mandelson, a senior member of the British Government&quot;.&quot;In February 2025, when asked about his relationship with Epstein by the Financial Times, Mandelson said &quot;I’m not going to go into this. It’s an FT obsession and frankly you can all fuck off. OK?&quot;

== Non-political commitments ==
Mandelson served, until 8 October 2008, as President of the Central School of Speech and Drama. He was replaced in this un-remunerated post by playwright Harold Pinter, who died two months later. 

Guest of honour in 2011 at Herbert Morrison Primary School in Vauxhall, South London, which was hosting a special themed day in honour of Mandelson&#x27;s grandfather, after whom the school was named, 

Lord Mandelson served as Chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan University from 2016 to 2025. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mandelson is gay and said to be &quot;intensely private&quot; about his personal life. During his time in government, the press – tabloid and broadsheet alike – often portrayed Mandelson as effeminate through &quot;the linguistic resources of camp&quot; and narcissistic – sometimes including coded references to homosexual acts in their descriptions of his actions. 

Having lived in London with Reinaldo Avila da Silva , a Brazilian translator, since March 1998, Lord Mandelson wed his partner on 28 October 2023.

=== Attempted outings and harassment ===
While his sexual orientation was known to friends, colleagues and constituents, in 1987 the &quot;News of the World&quot; ran an issue that attempted to out Mandelson as gay. Mandelson preferred to keep his personal life private and as such did not respond. Mandelson was outed again by Matthew Parris in 1998 on the BBC programme &quot;Newsnight&quot;. This led to press harassment of his partner, with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; sending a reporter to take pictures of him while he was at his languages course.

An internal investigation later found that the photos had been obtained without Avila da Silva&#x27;s consent and images of him attempting to cover his face had been secretly deleted. Mandelson phoned the BBC and the Press Complaints Commission following &quot;Newsnight&quot; broadcast, and an internal memo was later sent within the BBC, stating: &quot;under no circumstances whatsoever should allegations about the private life of Peter Mandelson be repeated or referred to on any broadcast.&quot;

<text>The Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway (W&amp;LLR) () is a narrow-gauge heritage railway in Powys, Wales. The line is around long and runs westwards from the town of Welshpool () via Castle Caereinion to the village of Llanfair Caereinion.

==History==

===Early proposals===


The first proposal to connect Llanfair Caerinion and Welshpool by railway was the Llanfair Railway of 1864; this would have been a narrow-gauge line, with a mixed-gauge section where it connected to the Cambrian Railways. This proposal was abandoned. The next attempt came in 1876 with the promotion of the Welshpool and Llanfair Railway Bill, which proposed a railway along a similar route to the 1864 effort. This bill passed through the Houses of Parliament, becoming the &#x27; (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. ccxxv). This attempt failed because the promoters were unable to raise sufficient capital, and was officially abandoned by the &#x27; (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c. xli). In 1886, another Welshpool and Llanfair Railway Bill appeared for a gauge railway on a similar route; this became the &#x27; (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. clxxxv) which expired unused in 1892, and was officially abandoned by the &#x27; (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. ii).

=== The Light Railways Act 1896 ===
In August 1896, the Light Railways Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 48) was passed, and this spurred further attempts at a railway to Llanfair Caereinion. The first of these was the Llanfair &amp; Meifod Valley Light Railway Bill of 1896, which proposed a standard-gauge line from Arddleen about 8 miles north of Welshpool, through the Meifod Valley.

In late December 1896, the mayor of Welshpool William Addie proposed a gauge railway called the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. By March 1897, Addie had contracted with noted narrow-gauge promoter Everard Calthrop to assist in preparing a case for the inquiry. An application for a Light Railway Order was submitted to the Board of Trade in May 1897. Calthrop proposed the use of transporter wagons, 0-6-0 tank locomotives and a large &quot;Barsi-type&quot; locomotive for heavy market day traffic. At the August 1897 public inquiry Calthrop appeared, along with J. R. Dix manager of the Corris Railway. The enquiry considered both the Llanfair &amp; Meifod Light Railway and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway proposals. The commissioners took their time deciding. Meanwhile, the promoters of the W&amp;LLR had approached the Cambrian Railways to have them pay for and construct the railway. After much time-consuming negotiations, the Cambrian agreed and on 8 September 1899, the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway Order 1899 was granted to begin construction of the line.

===Original operations===

It was opened on 6 April 1903 to aid economic development in a remote area, never making a profit. It was originally operated by the Cambrian Railways, connecting with it at the former Oswestry and Newtown Railway station in the town of Welshpool. The line is built through difficult country, having a great number of curves in order to reach the summit of 600 ft. The original terminus at Welshpool was located alongside the main line station and trains wound their way through the town, using the locomotive bell as a warning.

In the 1923 Grouping of railway companies, Cambrian Railways, including the Welshpool to Llanfair Caereinion line, was absorbed by the Great Western Railway (GWR). On 9 February 1931 the line lost its passenger service, which was replaced by a bus service, and it became a freight-only line. It was temporarily re-opened to passengers between 6 and 11 August 1945 for the Eisteddfod. The GWR itself was nationalised in 1948 and became part of British Railways.

Freight traffic lingered on until 1956, by which time British Railways decided to close the line, with services ceasing on 5 November.

===Preservation===
A group of volunteers and enthusiasts took the line over and started raising money to restore it. On 6 April 1963, the western half of the line, from Llanfair Caereinion to Castle Caereinion, was reopened as a Heritage railway. 

On 13 December 1964, a pier supporting the steel girder bridge over the River Banwy was seriously damaged by flood waters dislodging the bridge. During the spring and early summer of 1965 the 16th Railway Regiment of the Royal Engineers replaced the damaged masonry pier with a fabricated steel one and restored the span to its original position. Train services between Llanfair Caereinion to Castle Caereinion resumed on 14 August 1965.

In 1972, services were extended to Sylfaen. The line through Welshpool, however, could not be reopened, so the line now has a new terminus station at Raven Square on the western outskirts of the town, opened on 18 July 1981.
In 2008, there were discussions with Welshpool Town Council about reinstating the link through the town to the main line station, following a different route from that originally used.

Because of the gauge, unusual for British narrow-gauge railways, locomotives and rolling stock to supplement the originals have had to be obtained from sources around the world including the Zillertalbahn in Austria. A major grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund permitted restoration of both original locomotives together with several coaches and original wagons, and provision of new workshop facilities, ready for the line&#x27;s centenary.

==Golfa Bank==
Golfa Bank is a particularly steep bank on the railway. The bank is nearly a mile at 1 in 29, which in its day, was the steepest section of the Cambrian Railways worked by passenger trains and is still a challenging climb. The line travelling up the slope is curvy, to make the climb easier. Golfa summit is 630 ft above sea level, meaning the locomotives have to travel from about 350 ft above sea level at the bottom of Golfa Bank, equal to climbing 280 ft in 1.5 miles. The locomotives had to be built specifically to manage the bank, due to its steepness.

There was a halt at the top called , 1.75 miles or 3.2 km from the terminus. The halt had a loop that was provided for goods traffic. The station was opened on 6 April 1903. and closed with the line in 1931. The station officially reopened on 18 July 1981, but was closed again by 2015.

<text>Ahura (Avestan: 𐬀𐬵𐬎𐬭𐬀) is an Avestan language designation of a type of deity inherited by Zoroastrianism from the prehistoric Indo-Iranian religion, and denotes a particular class of Zoroastrian divinities. The term is assumed to be linguistically related to the Asuras of Indian Vedic era.

==Etymology==
Avestan &quot;ahura&quot; &quot;lord&quot; derives from Proto-Indo-Iranian language &quot;*Hásuras&quot;, also attested in an Indian context as Rigvedic &quot;asura&quot;. As suggested by the similarity to the Old Norse &quot;æsir&quot;, Indo-Iranian &quot;*Hásuras&quot; may have an even earlier Proto-Indo-European language root.

The &quot;Rigveda&quot; says that Asura such as the “Father Asura”, Varuṇa, and Mitra, are “older gods” who originally ruled over the primeval undifferentiated Chaos.

It is commonly supposed that Indo-Iranian &quot;*Hásuras&quot; was the proper name of a specific divinity with whom other divinities were later identified.

==In scripture==
===Gathas===
In the Gathas, the oldest hymns of Zoroastrianism and thought to have been composed by Zoroaster, followers are exhorted to pay reverence to only the &quot;ahura&quot;s and to rebuff the &quot;daeva&quot;s and others who act &quot;at Lie&#x27;s command&quot;. That should not, however, be construed to reflect a view of a primordial opposition. Although the &quot;daeva&quot;s would, in later Zoroastrian tradition, appear as malign creatures, in the Gathas the &quot;daeva&quot;s are (collectively) gods that are to be rejected.

The Gathas do not specify which of the divinities other than Ahura Mazda are considered to be &quot;ahura&quot;s but does mention other ahuras in the collective sense.

===Younger Avesta===
In the &quot;Fravaraneh&quot;, the traditional name for the Zoroastrian credo summarized in &quot;Yasna&quot; 12.1, the adherent declares: &quot;I profess myself a Mazda worshiper, a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster, rejecting the &quot;daevas&quot; ... &quot; This effectively defines &quot;ahura&quot; by defining what &quot;ahura&quot; is not.

In the Younger Avesta, three divinities of the Zoroastrian pantheon are repeatedly identified as ahuric. These three are Ahura Mazda, Mithra, and Apam Napat, the &quot;Ahuric triad&quot;. Other divinities with whom the term &quot;Ahuric&quot; is associated include the six Amesha Spentas, and (notable among the &quot;yazata&quot;s) Anahita of the Waters and Ashi of Reward and Recompense.
