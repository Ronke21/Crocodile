<text>The North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church (; NEK) was a Lutheran regional church in Northern Germany which emerged from a merger of four churches in 1977 and merged with two more churches in 2012. The NEK largely covered the area of the states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg where it was the most important Christian denomination. It had 2.1 million members (as of 2006) in 595 parishes, constituting 46% of the population in its ambit.

In May 2012 the NEK, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg and the Pomeranian Evangelical Church merged into Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany.

The NEK was a full member of the Protestant Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, EKD), the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany (VELKD), and the Lutheran World Federation (joined 1977). The church was also a member of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe.

==History==
The North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church was founded in 1977 by the merger of four former state churches: 
* the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Eutin (), which had been split off from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg and represented the former Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck.
* the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the State of Hamburg ();
* the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the State of Lübeck ();
* the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Schleswig-Holstein; ()

It is named after its ambit mostly located north of the River Elbe. In 1992 Maria Jepsen was the first woman to become a bishop in the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. At Pentecost 2012 it merged with the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Mecklenburg and the Pomeranian Evangelical Church to form the new Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany.

==Prominent buildings==

The most prominent church buildings and sees of the bishops were Schleswig Cathedral, Lübeck Cathedral and St. Michaelis in Hamburg.

==Practices==

Ordination of women and blessing of same-sex unions were allowed.

<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia () was a Lutheran member church of the umbrella Protestant Church in Germany (&quot;Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland&quot;, EKD). The seat of the church was in Eisenach. The church covered those parts of the state of Thuringia that were not part of the former Province of Saxony. It was the largest Protestant denomination in this area.

==History==
After in early November 1918 the grand duke, the dukes and princes of the eight monarchies, later merging into the new State of Thuringia, had abdicated and thus released each of the eight territorial Lutheran church bodies from their respective supreme governorate (summepiscopacy), Lutheran church leaders, among them the Saxe-Altenburgian court preacher Wilhelm Reichardt as one of the driving forces, decided the unification of the church bodies on 15 November 1918. Within seven of these Lutheran church bodies majorities formed to merge, to wit: 
* &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Principality of Reuss Junior Line&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Fürstentums Reuß jüngere Linie) 
* &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Herzogtums Sachsen-Gotha)
* &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Herzogtums Sachsen-Altenburg)
* &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Herzogtums Sachsen-Meiningen) 
* &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Grand Duchy of Saxony&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Großherzogtums Sachsen)
* &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Fürstentums Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt) and 
* &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Fürstentums Schwarzburg-Sondershausen). 
Only the &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Principality of Reuss Elder Line&quot; (Evangelisch-lutherische Kirche des Fürstentums Reuß ältere Linie) refused the merger and renamed as the &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church in Reuss Elder Line&quot; (). On 5 December 1919 synodals from the seven other church bodies then convened for the constitutive synod, founding the Thuringian Evangelical Church (Thüringer evangelische Kirche), a Lutheran church body, with effect of 13 February 1920 and Reichardt as its spiritual leader then titled state supreme pastor (Landesoberpfarrer). Three months later all the eight former monarchies merged into the new state of Thuringia. 

In 1922 the Thuringian Evangelical Church became a member of the German Evangelical Church Confederation, which was dissolved in 1933 in favour of a united Protestant church for all of Germany, which, however, never materialised due to inner church struggles on the Nazi intrusion in ecclesiastical affairs. 
The parishioners within the Thuringia church body voted by a majority for candidates of the Nazi-submissive German Christians in the presbyteries and the synod in the unconstitutional reelection imposed by Hitler on 23 July 1933. Nazi opponents then formed the &quot;Confessing Church of Thuringia&quot;, gradually pressed into hiding. In 1934 the &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Church in Reuss Elder Line&quot; with 70,000 parishioners (as of 1922) merged in the Thuringian Evangelical Church, which thus comprised all the area of the state of Thuringia in its borders of 1920. During the struggle of the churches the official submissive church leadership even further radicalised in its extremism as to anti-Semitism and suppression of confessing church adherents. 

In 1933 Reichardt adopted the title of a state bishop (Landesbischof) and deprived the synod of its legislative rights. Martin Sasse succeeded Reichardt after his retirement in 1934. After Sasse&#x27;s death in 1942 the quarrelling fractions within the Thuringian German Christians blocked the appointment of a new state bishop, but Hugo Rönck, the head of the central church administration, assumed the leadership using the title church president. With the defeat of the Nazis in sight Confessing Church members within the Thuringia church body urged Rönck to resign in April 1945 and the US occupying power later arrested him only days after. In May 1945 Moritz Mitzenheim succeeded Rönck again using the constitutional title state supreme pastor. In August 1945 Mitzenheim participated for the Thuringian Evangelical Church in a meeting in Treysa, where the foundation of a new Protestant umbrella, the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) was decided, of which the Thuringian Evangelical Church became a founding member. 

In 1948 the church body renamed into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia. An orderly synod legalised the new title state bishop (Landesbischof), later used by Mitzenheim. He turned out to be a rather uncritical collaborator of the upcoming communist dictatorship. Under the influence of the high church functionary and later state bishop Ingo Braecklein, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia seceded from the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) and prompted the foundation of the Confederation of Protestant Churches in the GDR (Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR) in 1969. In 1991 that confederation was dissolved again and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia rejoined the EKD. 

Between 1945 and 1969 and again from 1991 to 2008 the church was also a full member of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany (VELKD) and since 1973 also of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe. The church body was based on the teachings brought forward by Martin Luther during the Reformation. 

In December 2006 the church body had approx. 440,000 parishioners in 1,308 church parishes. There was no cathedral church. The church had its own academy in Neudietendorf.

On 1 July 2004 the church announced its intention to merge with the Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony to form the new Evangelical Church in Central Germany. The merger was completed on 1 January 2009.

<doc id="213036" wikidata="Q1319217" url="?curid=213036" title="Méric Casaubon">
<text>Meric Casaubon (14 August 1599 – 14 July 1671) was an English classical scholar. He was the first to translate the &quot;Meditations&quot; of Marcus Aurelius into English. He was the son of Isaac Casaubon.

Although biographical dictionaries (including the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition) commonly accentuate his name to Méric, he himself did not do so.

==Life==
Meric Casaubon was born in Geneva to a French father, scholar Isaac Casaubon; he was named for his godfather Meric de Vic. After education in Sedan, at an early age he joined his father in England, and completed his education at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford (B.A. 1618; M.A. 1621; D.D. 1636).

His defence of his father against the attacks of certain Catholics (&quot;Pietas contra maledicos patrii Nominis et Religionis Hostes&quot;, 1621), secured him the notice and favour of James I, who conferred upon him a prebendal stall in Canterbury Cathedral (stall IX) which he held from 1628 to his death. He also vindicated his father&#x27;s literary reputation against certain impostors who had published, under his name, a work on &quot;The Origin of Idolatry&quot; (&quot;Vindicatio Patris adversus Impostores&quot;, 1624).

During the English Civil War he was deprived of his benefices and his prebendal stall at Canterbury Cathedral and retired to Oxford refusing to acknowledge the authority of Oliver Cromwell, who, notwithstanding, requested him to write an impartial history of the events of the period. In spite of the tempting inducements held out, he declined, and also refused the post of inspector of the Swedish universities offered him by Queen Christina. After the Restoration, he was reinstated in his benefice and his stall in Canterbury and devoted the rest of his life to literary work. He died at Canterbury and is buried in the cathedral. His coin collection was incorporated into that of Canon John Bargrave.

Casaubon&#x27;s reputation was overshadowed by that of his father; but his editions of numerous classical authors, especially of the &quot;Meditations&quot; of Marcus Aurelius, were especially valued, and reprinted several times (but by modern standards, his translation is difficult reading). He had an interest in the study of Anglo-Saxon, which he shared with his lifelong &quot;trustie frend&quot; William Somner. Edward Stillingfleet, whom Casaubon admired, bought many of his books, which are now in Archbishop Marsh&#x27;s Library, Dublin. Some other volumes from his library came into Canterbury Cathedral Library through William Somner.

==Controversy==
In &quot;A Treatise Concerning Enthusiasme&quot; (1655), Casaubon wrote against enthusiasm, and circumscribed the domain of the supernatural. The next year he produced an edition of John Dee, portraying him as having had dealings with the Devil. The background is of orthodox Anglicans wishing to discredit the sectarian Protestants of the period; but also to validate the existence of spirits to atheists. Casaubon was in touch with Nicholas Bernard about the Dee manuscript. Following the Restoration, Casaubon wrote supporting the traditional theories of witchcraft. He was in fact operating on several fronts: as well as attacking those who would deny the supernatural entirely, and limiting the role of reason in faith, he defended humanist learning against the claims for the new natural philosophy, emanating from figures in the Royal Society who saw it as completely replacing the old learning.

== Benefices ==

*1626–1630: rector of Bleadon, Somerset
*1628–1671: prebendal stall IX at Canterbury Cathedral
*1630–1634: rector of St Mary in the Marsh, Kent
*1634–1634: rector of Old Romney, Kent
*1634–1662: vicar of Minster, Kent
*1634–1662: vicar of Monkton with Birchington, Kent
*1643/44: ejected from his benefices by Parliament
*1660: reinstated to the living at Minster
*1662–1671: rector of Ickham, Kent

== Family ==
Casaubon married Frances Harrison of Hampshire in about 1628. His wife&#x27;s grandfather was William Barlow, who had been a canon of Winchester Cathedral since 1581. The couple had seven children, most of whom were born in Canterbury, but only two lived to maturity:
* John Casaubon (1636-1692) was a country &#x27;surgeon&#x27; who practised in and around the Canterbury area. He kept a diary of some of his cases and family matters. It ends with the self-diagnosis of the oesophageal cancer which finally caused his death. The diary is kept at Southampton Archives.
* Anne Casaubon (c. 1649-1686) was the last child to be born. She married a country parson named John Dauling, who was also the executor of Casaubon&#x27;s will.
Frances Casaubon died on 24 February 1652 in London. Her poor health and death was one of the reasons Meric gave for not complying with Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s request.

<text>The Northern City Line is a commuter railway line in England, which runs from Moorgate station to Finsbury Park in London with services running beyond. It is part of the Great Northern Route services, and operates as the south-eastern branch of the East Coast Main Line (ECML). It is underground from Moorgate to Drayton Park in Highbury, from which point it runs in a cutting until joining the ECML south of Finsbury Park. Its stations span northern inner districts of Greater London southwards to the City of London, the UK&#x27;s main financial centre. Since December 2015, its service timetable has been extended to run into the late evenings and at weekends, meeting a new franchise commitment for a minimum of six trains per hour until 23:59 on weekdays and four trains per hour at weekends.

The official name for this line is the Moorgate Line, but it is rarely referred to as this due to confusion with the Widened Lines route from to , which, until March 2009, also served surface-level station on the London Midland Region. The Northern City Line&#x27;s name is derived from the fact that it was originally a London Underground line, where it was described or managed as part of both the Metropolitan and Northern lines (sometimes as the &quot;Highbury Branch&quot;), although never connected to either. Built as an isolated route with a northern terminus at Finsbury Park, reconstruction connected it to the British Rail network in 1976 and began its modern service pattern. One of London&#x27;s deep-level railways, the Northern City is unlike the others in being owned by Network Rail and served by commuter trains operated by Great Northern from Moorgate to Finsbury Park and onwards to Hertfordshire.

== History ==


The Great Northern &amp; City Railway (GN&amp;CR) was planned to allow electrified trains to run from the Great Northern Railway (GNR, now the East Coast Main Line) at Finsbury Park to the City of London at Moorgate. Despite being built using similar methods to the tube network then under construction, the tunnels were built large enough to take a main-line train, with an internal diameter of , compared with those of the Central London Railway with a diameter less than . For this reason the line was popularly known as the &quot;Big Tube&quot; in its early days. However, the GNR eventually opposed the scheme and cancelled its electrification plans, and the line opened in 1904 with the northern terminus in tunnels underneath Finsbury Park GNR station. It was originally electrified using an unusual fourth-rail system with a conductor rail outside each running rail.

The GN&amp;CR was bought in 1913 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR), which operated what are today the Metropolitan and Hammersmith &amp; City lines and the former East London line. The MR had plans to link it to the Circle and Waterloo &amp; City lines, but these were never fulfilled. During this period, the line remained an isolated branch, without through services to any other part of the rail network. Carriages were brought to it through a connection into a freight yard near Drayton Park station, where a small depot was built to service trains.

The GN&amp;CR generating station closed when the MR took over, and became the studio of Gainsborough Pictures. After lying derelict for many years, it became a temporary venue for the Almeida Theatre. The site has since been redeveloped as apartments.

After the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, the MR was amalgamated with the other Underground railways and the line was renamed the Northern City Line. In 1934 it was re-branded as part of the Edgware–Morden line (which was renamed the Northern line in 1937), and in 1939 operations were transferred from the Metropolitan to the Northern. As part of London Transport&#x27;s New Works Programme, the Northern Heights plan was to connect the Northern City Line at Finsbury Park to existing main-line suburban branches running to Alexandra Palace, High Barnet and Edgware, which would be taken over by London Transport and electrified. The Highgate branch of the Edgware–Morden line would connect to this network north of Highgate. Only parts of this plan were completed: when the Second World War started, the Highgate link and electrification of the Barnet branch were well under way and ultimately completed, but the Northern City connection to Highgate was first postponed and finally cancelled after the war.

After the war there were proposals to extend the Northern City Line north and south. The London Plan Working Party Report of 1949 proposed several new lines and suburban electrification schemes for London, lettered from A to M. The lower-priority routes J and K would have seen the Northern City Line extended to Woolwich (Route J) and Crystal Palace (Route K), retaining the &quot;Northern Heights&quot; extensions to Edgware and Alexandra Palace. The lines would have run in small-diameter tube tunnels south from Moorgate to Bank and London Bridge. The &quot;K&quot; branch would have run under Peckham to Peckham Rye, joining the old Crystal Palace (High Level) branch (which was still open in 1949) near Lordship Lane. Nothing came of these proposals, and the Edgware, Alexandra Palace and Crystal Palace (High Level) branches were all closed to passengers in 1954. As a result, the Northern City Line remained isolated from the rest of the network.

In 1964, the Northern City Line (low level) platforms at Finsbury Park were given over to become the southbound platforms of both the Piccadilly line and the new Victoria Line, the former Piccadilly line platforms becoming the northbound Piccadilly and Victoria lines&#x27; platforms. From this time the NCL used Drayton Park as its terminus. At the same time a change was made at Highbury &amp; Islington, with the northbound Northern City line diverted to a new platform alongside the northbound Victoria line, and the southbound Victoria using the former northbound Northern City platform, both providing cross-platform interchange. Passengers from Moorgate to Finsbury Park took the Northern City line to Highbury &amp; Islington and then changed onto the Victoria Line.

In 1970 the line was connected (as intended by its original promoters) to the mainline via the high level platforms at Finsbury Park as part of a wider plan to electrify ECML suburban services. The line was renamed Northern line (Highbury Branch) and the following year an agreement was made to transfer it to British Rail. Commuter trains were run to/from Moorgate instead of King&#x27;s Cross, relieving congestion at King&#x27;s Cross.

The last London Underground services ran in October 1975 and British Rail services commenced in August 1976, replacing services to Broad Street via the city branch of the North London Line. These British Rail services used the name &quot;Great Northern Electrics&quot;. The track and tunnels are now owned by Network Rail. Services are provided by Great Northern to and, via the Hertford Loop Line, to (with some extending to Stevenage, Hitchin or Letchworth). The name &quot;Northern City Line&quot; has been revived to refer to the underground part of the route.

==Infrastructure==
From Finsbury Park to Drayton Park traction current is supplied at 25 kV AC via overhead line, controlled by York Electrical Control Room.
From Drayton Park to Moorgate traction current is supplied at 750 V DC via third rail. There are two electrical sections, separated by a gap at Poole Street:
* Queensland Road to Poole Street
* Poole Street to Finsbury Circus

Trains change from AC to DC traction supply, or vice versa, whilst standing at Drayton Park station. The platform starting signal on the Up platform at Drayton Park is held at danger (red) as the train approaches. This ensures that all trains stop to lower the pantograph before going into the tunnel.

In the 1970s the original London Underground fourth-rail traction current supply was converted to a third-rail 750V DC system. The redundant centre fourth-rail was disconnected and left in situ since it was difficult to remove in the narrow tunnels.

Signalling is controlled from Kings Cross panel at York ROC. Between Drayton Park and Moorgate, there is no Automatic Warning System or Train Protection &amp; Warning System equipment provided, due to the position of the auxiliary return rail. All signals are multiple aspect colour light signals fitted with train stop arms.

=== East Coast Digital Programme ===
Works to commission new ETCS digital signalling on the line, along with the first test train under the new system, took place during the Early May Bank Holiday in 2022. The new signalling system was approved by the Office of Rail and Road in March 2023, and gradually introduced on passenger services from 27 November 2023. By November 2024, all passenger services were operated under ETCS signalling, with traditional lineside signals expected to be switched off in 2025.

==Operational procedures==
Because mainline trains operate over the infrastructure inherited from London Underground, there are some practices on the NCL which differ from Railway Rulebook instructions, and these are contained in an additional publication. These include:

===Passing signals at danger===
If a train is standing at a signal at danger &quot;inside a tunnel&quot; and it is not possible for the driver to contact the signaller, the driver is permitted to pass that signal under their own authority. As soon as the train starts to move, the tripcock on the train will automatically operate and bring the train to a stop, so the driver must reset it before continuing. They must then proceed with caution, be prepared to stop short of any obstruction, and not travel any faster than . When they reach the next signal they must stop and attempt to contact the signaller, to inform the signaller of what has taken place regardless of the aspect that it is showing.

Platform starting signals, which let the train &quot;into&quot; a tunnel, can only be passed at danger with the signaller&#x27;s authority.

===Assisting a failed train===
Unlike surface lines, the driver of a train which fails on the NCL is not required to leave the train to lay detonators and then wait for the assisting train. The driver remains with the train and the signaller will authorise the driver of the assisting train to proceed to the rear of the failed train at a maximum speed of . To ensure that the rear of the failed train is always visible, all trains working over the NCL are required to display three red lights at their rear: two tail lamps plus the red portion of the destination roller blind.

On reaching the failed train, the assisting driver will stop short then clip their tunnel telephone onto the tunnel wires so that they can discuss with the driver of the failed train how to carry out the assistance in order to get the trains moving again. Then the two trains are coupled together and the drivers can talk to each other over the usual cab-to-cab handsets before proceeding.

==Rolling stock==

As part of its contract to supply electrical equipment during the construction of the line, in 1901 British Thomson-Houston provided 35 sets of traction control equipment to Brush Electrical Engineering Company and Dick, Kerr &amp; Company. The original plan was for 11 seven-car trains (33 motors and 44 trailers) and one shunting locomotive. Initially 26 motorcars and 32 trailer cars were built. They were known as the &#x27;wooden&#x27; cars because they were fabricated of teak and mahogany on steel underframes. In 1906 Brush delivered another five motors and 13 trailers. There were of all-steel construction and naturally-enough referred to as &#x27;steel cars&#x27;. The GN&amp;CR converted one trailer to a motor car, bringing the fleet to 32 motors and 44 trailers. (The remaining sets of traction control equipment were used as maintenance spares.) Normal operation was six-car formations at peak times, reduced to two-car sets at other times. Cars were long over buffers, wide, and in height. Seats were provided for 58 passengers in the wooden trailers and 64 in the steel ones. Motor cars seated 54 because of a equipment compartment behind the driver&#x27;s cab. Uniquely in England, coupling between cars was by means of link and pin on the centre-line.

The original fleet of 76 carriages was withdrawn and replaced by London Underground Standard Stock on 15 May 1939. These became the last pre-1938 trains running on the Underground, being phased out during the last weeks of October 1966 through 3 November. 1938 tube stock serviced the line, in variously three-, four- and six-car formations, until its temporary closure on 4 October 1975.

Services are currently operated by dual-voltage Class 717 electric multiple units (EMUs), which replaced Class 313 units as part of a franchise commitment when Govia Thameslink Railway took over management of the line and its services. The Class 717s began to enter service in March 2019. To comply with regulations for trains operating in single-bore tunnels where there is not enough clearance space for side evacuation, they have emergency doors at both ends of a unit. When operating on , the two motor coaches of a Class 313 collected traction current from their own shoe gear only; there was no traction bus linking them together as found on most electric multiple units. All of the Class 313 units when operating on the NCL had their Driving Motor B vehicle at the London end, and whilst on were electronically limited to , which is the maximum line speed. All stations are long enough to accept six-car trains.

==Accidents and incidents==

===Moorgate tube crash===

The Moorgate tube crash, which killed 43 people, is the most serious peacetime accident on the London Underground. It occurred at Moorgate station on 28 February 1975, when a Highbury Branch train ran through the terminus at speed and crashed into the dead end of the tunnel beyond. The crash was found to have been caused by the driver, who was killed, but the specific cause was never determined; a report found that there was insufficient evidence to say whether it was a deliberate act of the driver or due to a medical condition.

===Tunnel penetration incident===
On 8 March 2013, pile boring operations on a building site in East Road, Hackney, above the tunnel, penetrated and obstructed the line between Old Street and Essex Road stations. A serious accident was averted by the actions of an observant train driver, and the line was restricted for several days for repairs. A subsequent investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch was highly critical of carelessness on the construction companies involved and the planning approval process.

==Passenger volume==
This is the number of passengers using stations on the line from the year beginning April 2002 to the year beginning April 2019. These numbers include all passengers using the station, not just Northern City Line users.

<text>Norrmalmstorg () is a town square in central Stockholm, Sweden. It connects shopping streets Hamngatan and Biblioteksgatan and is the starting point for tram travellers with the Djurgården line. Close to the southwest is the park Kungsträdgården.

In the Swedish edition of &quot;Monopoly&quot;, Norrmalmstorg is the most expensive lot.

The square is famous for the 1973 Norrmalmstorg robbery, in which events gave name to the Stockholm syndrome. The building in question is now occupied by the Nobis Hotel Stockholm.

<doc id="213047" wikidata="Q2762318" url="?curid=213047" title="Heir apparent">
<text>An heir apparent is a person who is first in an order of succession and cannot be displaced from inheriting by the birth of another person. A person who is first in the current order of succession but could be displaced by the birth of a more eligible heir is known as heir presumptive.

Today these terms most commonly describe heirs to hereditary titles (e.g. titles of nobility) or offices, especially when only inheritable by a single person. Most monarchies refer to the heir apparent of their thrones with the descriptive term of &quot;crown prince&quot; or &quot;crown princess&quot;, but they may also be accorded with a more specific substantive title: such as Prince of Orange in the Netherlands, Duke of Brabant in Belgium, Prince of Asturias in Spain (also granted to heirs presumptive), or the Prince of Wales in England and Wales; former titles include Dauphin in the Kingdom of France, and Tsesarevich in Imperial Russia.

The term is also applied metaphorically to an expected successor to any position of power, e.g. a political or corporate leader.

This article primarily describes the term &quot;heir apparent&quot; in a hereditary system regulated by laws of primogeniture—it may be less applicable to cases where a monarch has a say in naming the heir (performed either while alive, e.g. crowning the heir as a , or through the monarch&#x27;s will).

== Heir apparent versus heir presumptive ==
In a hereditary system governed by some form of primogeniture, an heir apparent is easily identifiable as the person whose position as first in the line of succession to a title or office is secure, regardless of future births. An heir presumptive, by contrast, can always be &quot;bumped down&quot; in the succession by the birth of somebody more closely related in a legal sense (according to that form of primogeniture) to the current title-holder.

The clearest example occurs in the case of a childless bearer of a hereditary title that can only be inherited by one person. If at any time the title bearer were to produce children, those children would rank ahead of any person who had formerly been heir presumptive.

Many legal systems assume childbirth is always possible regardless of age or health. In such circumstances a person may be, in a practical sense, the heir apparent but still, legally speaking, heir presumptive. Indeed, when Queen Victoria succeeded her uncle King William IV, the wording of the proclamation even gave as a caveat:

This provided for the possibility that William&#x27;s wife, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, was pregnant at the moment of his death, since such a posthumous child, regardless of its sex, would have displaced Victoria from the throne. Adelaide was 44 at the time, so pregnancy was possible even if unlikely.

=== Daughters in male-preference primogeniture ===

Daughters (and their lines) may inherit titles that descend according to male-preference primogeniture, but only in default of sons (and their heirs). That is, both female and male offspring have the right to a place somewhere in the order of succession, but when it comes to what that place is, a female will rank behind her brothers regardless of their ages or her age.

Thus, normally, even an only daughter will not be an heiress apparent, since at any time a brother might be born who, though younger, would assume that position. Hence, she is an heiress presumptive. For example, Queen Elizabeth II was the heiress presumptive during the reign of her father, King George VI; had George fathered a legitimate son, then that child would have displaced Elizabeth in the line of succession and become heir apparent.

However, a granddaughter could for example be an heiress apparent if she were the only daughter of the deceased eldest son of the sovereign (e.g. Queen Elizabeth II would have been the heiress apparent to George V if her oldest uncle and father both had died before their father).

=== Women as heirs apparent ===
In a system of absolute primogeniture that disregards gender, female heirs apparent occur. As succession to titles, positions, or offices in the past most often favoured males, females considered to be an heir apparent were rare. Absolute primogeniture was not practised by any modern monarchy for succession to their thrones until the late twentieth century, with Sweden being the first to adopt absolute primogeniture in 1980 and other Western European monarchies following suit.

Since the adoption of absolute primogeniture by most of the Western European monarchies, examples of female heirs apparent include Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands, and Princess Elisabeth of Belgium; they are, respectively, the oldest children of Kings Carl XVI Gustaf, Willem-Alexander, and Philippe. Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway is heir apparent to her father, who is heir apparent to the Norwegian throne, and Victoria herself has a female heir apparent in her elder child, Princess Estelle. Victoria was not heir apparent from birth (in 1977), but gained the status in 1980 following a change in the Swedish Act of Succession. Her younger brother Carl Philip (born 1979) was thus heir apparent for a few months (and is a rare example of an heir apparent losing this status without a death occurring).

In 2015, pursuant to the 2011 Perth Agreement, the Commonwealth realms changed the rules of succession to the 16 thrones of Elizabeth II to absolute primogeniture, except for male heirs born before the Perth Agreement. The effects are not likely to be felt for many years; the first two heirs at the time of the agreement (Charles, Prince of Wales, later Charles III, and his son William, Prince of Wales) were already eldest born children, and in 2013 William&#x27;s first-born son Prince George of Wales became the next apparent successor.

But even in legal systems that apply male-preference primogeniture, female heirs apparent are by no means impossible: if a male heir apparent dies leaving no sons but at least one daughter, then the eldest daughter would replace her father as heir apparent to whatever throne or title is concerned, but only when it has become clear that the widow of the deceased is not pregnant. Then, as the representative of her father&#x27;s line she would assume a place ahead of any more distant relatives. For example, had George, Prince of Wales (the future George IV) predeceased his father, King George III, between 1796 and 1817, the former&#x27;s daughter, Princess Charlotte, being his only legitimate child, would have become heir apparent to the British throne. Such a situation has not to date occurred with the English or British throne; several times an heir apparent has died, but each example has either been childless or left a son or sons. However, there have been several female heirs apparent to British peerages (e.g. Frances Ward, 6th Baroness Dudley, and Henrietta Wentworth, 6th Baroness Wentworth).

In one special case, however, England and Scotland had a female heir apparent. The Revolution settlement that established William and Mary as joint monarchs in 1689 only gave the power to continue the succession through issue to Mary II, elder daughter of the previous king, James II. William, by contrast, was to reign for life only, and his (hypothetical) children by a wife other than Mary would be placed in his original place (as Mary&#x27;s first cousin) in the line of succession—after Mary&#x27;s younger sister Anne. Thus, after Mary&#x27;s death William continued to reign, but he had no power to beget direct heirs, and Anne became the heir apparent for the remainder of William&#x27;s reign. She eventually succeeded him as Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

== Displacement of heirs apparent ==
The position of an heir apparent is normally unshakable: it can be assumed they will inherit. Sometimes, however, extraordinary events—such as the death or the deposition of the parent—intervene.

=== People who lost heir apparent status ===
* On 30 April 892, Al-Mufawwid was removed from the succession to the Abbasid Caliphate. When al-Mu&#x27;tamid died in October 892, he was succeeded by Al-Mu&#x27;tadid.
* Parliament deposed James Francis Edward Stuart, the infant son of King James VII &amp; II (of Scotland and of England and Ireland respectively) whom James II was rearing as a Catholic, as the King&#x27;s legal heir apparent—declaring that James had, de facto, abdicated—and offered the throne to James II&#x27;s elder daughter, the young prince&#x27;s much older Protestant half-sister, Mary (along with her husband, Prince William of Orange). When the exiled King James died in 1701, his Jacobite supporters proclaimed the exiled Prince James Francis Edward as King James VIII of Scotland and James III of England and Ireland; but neither he nor his descendants (the last of whom died in 1807) were ever successful in their bids for the throne.
* Crown Prince Gustav (later known as Gustav, Prince of Vasa), son of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, lost his place when his father was deposed and replaced by Gustav IV Adolf&#x27;s aged uncle, the Duke Carl, who became Charles XIII of Sweden in 1809. The aged King Charles XIII did not have surviving sons, and Prince Gustav was the only living male of the whole dynasty (besides his deposed father), but the prince was never regarded as heir of Charles XIII, although there were factions in the Riksdag and elsewhere in Sweden who desired to preserve him, and, in the subsequent constitutional elections, supported his election as his grand-uncle&#x27;s successor. Instead, the government proceeded to have a new crown prince elected (which was the proper constitutional action, if no male heir was left in the dynasty), and the Riksdag elected first August, Prince of Augustenborg, and then, after August&#x27;s death, the Prince of Ponte Corvo (Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who acceded as Charles XIV John in 1818). The two lines united later, when Charles XIV John&#x27;s great-grandson Crown Prince Gustaf (who acceded as Gustaf V in 1907) married Gustav IV Adolf&#x27;s great-granddaughter Victoria of Baden, who became Crown Princess of Sweden. Thus, from Gustav VI Adolf onward, the kings of Sweden are direct descendants of both Gustav IV Adolf and his son&#x27;s replacement as crown prince, Charles XIV John.
* Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, at his birth in 1979, was heir apparent to the throne of Sweden. Less than eight months later, a change in that country&#x27;s succession laws instituted absolute primogeniture, and Carl Philip was supplanted as heir apparent by his elder sister Victoria.
* Muqrin bin Abdulaziz became Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in January 2015 upon the death of his half-brother King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and the accession of another half-brother, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, to the Saudi throne. In April of that year, Salman removed Muqrin as Crown Prince, replacing him with their nephew Muhammad bin Nayef. Muhammad bin Nayef himself was later replaced as Crown Prince by the king&#x27;s son Mohammad bin Salman.

=== Breaching legal qualification of heirs apparent ===
In some jurisdictions, an heir apparent can automatically lose that status by breaching certain constitutional rules. Today, for example:

* A British heir apparent would lose this status if he or she became a Catholic. This is the only religion-based restriction on the heir apparent. Previously, marrying a Catholic also equated to losing this status. However, in October 2011 the governments of the then-16 Commonwealth realms (now 15), of which King Charles III is monarch, agreed to remove the restriction on marriage to a Catholic. All of the Commonwealth realms subsequently passed legislation to implement the change, which fully took effect in March 2015.
* Swedish Crown Princes and Crown Princesses would lose heir apparent status, according to the Act of Succession, if they married without approval of the monarch and the Government, abandoned the &quot;pure Evangelical faith&quot;, or accepted another throne without the approval of the Riksdag.
* Dutch Princes and Princesses of Orange would lose status as heir to the throne if they married without the approval of the States-General, or simply renounced the right.
* Spanish Princes and Princesses of Asturias would lose status if they married against the express prohibition of the monarch and the Cortes.
* Belgian Dukes and Duchesses of Brabant would lose heir apparent status if they married without the consent of the monarch, or became monarch of another country.
* Danish Crown Princes and Princesses would lose status if they married without the permission of the monarch. When the monarch grants permission for a dynast to enter marriage, he may set conditions that must be met for the dynasts and/or their children to gain or maintain a place in the line of succession; this also applies for Crown Princes and Princesses.

<text>Coventry Transport Museum (formerly known as the Museum of British Road Transport) is a transport museum, located in Coventry city centre, England.

It houses the largest collection of British-made road transport held in public ownership. It is located in Coventry because the city was previously the centre of the British car industry. There are more than 240 cars and commercial vehicles, 100 motorcycles, 200 bicycles.

The ever-changing temporary exhibitions feature motor cars, commercial vehicles, cycles and motorcycles from the museums own collection and beyond. The museum offers activities ranging from engineering challenges to scientific experiments.

The museum is also home to a 60 year old Vintage Sleigh Ride, that has been popular in the city for generations of local residents.

It has a full-time archive department, which deals with an array of historical items, and offers a public enquiry service answering questions and finding items and information. Visitors need to contact the museum prior to visiting should they wish to access the archives, or speak to a curator.

== Exhibits ==

Notable exhibits in the museum are Thrust2 and ThrustSSC, the British jet cars which broke the land speed record in 1983 and 1997, respectively, and some of the royal cars – Queen Mary&#x27;s and King George V&#x27;s State limousines.

Coventry Transport Museum&#x27;s £8.5 million redevelopment project in which 12 of the museum&#x27;s 14 galleries were completely transformed was completed in 2015, the project was funded by the Heritage Lottery Foundation, European Development Fund, Biffa Award and Garfield Weston. As part of the museum&#x27;s redevelopment project, both Thrust SSC and Thrust 2 cars were relocated by specialist haulier from their position in the museum&#x27;s Spirit of Speed Gallery to the new Biffa Award Land Speed Record Gallery which opened in 2015.

Many mass-produced cars are in the collection, including an Austin Allegro, an Austin Metro previously owned by Lady Diana Spencer, a Ford Escort MK2, Hillman Imp, Triumph Acclaim, Talbot Sunbeam, Talbot Horizon, Peugeot 206 and Peugeot 405. Many of the vehicles on display were either produced in Coventry or produced by companies which had a presence in Coventry at some stage.

A Humber staff car used by General Montgomery during the Second World War is also on display.

The museum displays many Jaguars and other Coventry built cars such as the Triumph, Humber and Standard marques, an Alvis tank, Massey Ferguson tractors, and Coventry built buses, including the bus that the Coventry City football team paraded in after their victory in the 1987 FA Cup Final. Coventry motorcycle marques are also represented in the museum&#x27;s collection including: Triumph, Francis-Barnett, Rudge-Whitworth and Coventry-Eagle and it is affiliated to the British Motorcycle Charitable Trust.

<doc id="213055" wikidata="Q7775505" url="?curid=213055" title="The Woman Who Did">
<text>The Woman Who Did (1895) is a novel by Grant Allen about a young, self-assured middle-class woman who defies convention as a matter of principle and who is fully prepared to suffer the consequences of her actions. It was first published in London by John Lane in a series intended to promote the ideal of the &quot;New Woman&quot;. It was adapted into a British silent film in 1915, &quot;The Woman Who Did&quot;, which was directed by Walter West, and later into a 1925 German film, &quot;Die Frau mit dem schlechten Ruf&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Herminia Barton, the Cambridge-educated daughter of a clergyman, frees herself from her parents&#x27; influence, moves to London and starts living alone. As she is not a woman of independent means, she starts working as a teacher. When she meets and falls in love with Alan Merrick, a lawyer, she suggests they live together without getting married. Reluctantly, he agrees, and the couple move to Italy. There, in Florence, Merrick dies of typhoid before their daughter Dolores is born. Legal technicalities and the fact that the couple were not married prevent Herminia from inheriting any of Merrick&#x27;s money.

Dreaming of being a role model for Dolores and her friends, Herminia returns to England and raises her daughter as a single mother. She wants to show the younger generation that even as a woman there is something one can do about the unfair position of women in society—a small step maybe, but with more and larger steps to follow soon. However, Dolores turns out to be ashamed of her mother&#x27;s unmarried state and gradually turns against her. Eventually, Herminia chooses to make a huge sacrifice for her daughter&#x27;s benefit and commits suicide.

==Reception==
Allen was sympathetic to the feminist cause and saw his novel as a way to promote women&#x27;s rights. It certainly created an immediate popular sensation - Flora Thompson for instance describing how, in small-town Hampshire, &quot;copies were bought and handed round until practically everyone of mature age in the village had read and passed judgement on it&quot;. However, the novel was also controversial right from the start, with conservative readers as well as feminists criticizing Allen for the heroine he had invented. For example, Victoria Crosse wrote her novel &quot;The Woman Who Didn&#x27;t&quot; (1895) as a response to Allen&#x27;s book and Mrs. Lovett Cameron wrote &quot;The Man Who Didn&#x27;t&quot;.

Whereas Herminia Barton questions the institution of marriage by refusing to get married herself, Victoria Crosse&#x27;s heroine Eurydice Williamson—&quot;the woman who didn&#x27;t&quot;—remains faithful to her impossible husband although, during a passage from India, she meets a man who falls in love with her. Similarly, Lovett Cameron&#x27;s hero is a married man who resists the temptation to stray.

Another novel written in reply to Allen&#x27;s work, Lucas Cleeve&#x27;s &quot;The Woman Who Wouldn&#x27;t&quot;, (1895) sold well and received hostile reviews. The author said of this:

&quot;If one young girl is kept from a loveless, mistaken marriage, if one frivolous nature is checked in her career of flirtation by remembrance of Lady Morris, I shall perhaps be forgiven by the public for raising my feeble voice in answer to &quot;The Woman Who Did&quot;&quot;.

The campaigner Emma Brooke saw this novel and her own novel &quot;The Superfluous Woman&quot; as important in trying to resolve the &quot;Sex Question&quot; which she thought dominated intellectual debate in the 1880s. She was annoyed when H. G. Wells reinvented the question when he spoke to the Fabian Society in 1906.

Sarah Grand, the feminist writer who coined the term &quot;New Woman,&quot; considered the novel to have and important social purity moral:Mr. Grant Allen is a large-minded, liberal man, and he argues that if men are permitted to practice polygamy then women should be equally free to indulge in polyandry. I do not know that he approves of polygamy, only he is liberal enough to say that if men are to claim sexual freedom then it should be accorded to women also. The story answers the question when followed to its logical conclusions, and shows very clearly that women have nothing to gain and everything to lose by renouncing the protection which legal marriage gives.Thomas Hardy approved more of Allen&#x27;s progressive aims in the novel, than of their artistic realisation.

<doc id="213058" wikidata="Q3065467" url="?curid=213058" title="Barebone's Parliament">
<text>Barebone&#x27;s Parliament, also known as the Little Parliament, the Nominated Assembly and the Parliament of Saints, came into being on 4 July 1653, and was the last attempt of the English Commonwealth to find a stable political form before the installation of Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector. It was an assembly entirely nominated by Oliver Cromwell and the Army&#x27;s Council of Officers. It acquired its name from the nominee for the City of London, Praise-God Barebone. The Speaker of the House was Francis Rous. The total number of nominees was 140, 129 from England, five from Scotland and six from Ireland (see the list of MPs).

After conflict and infighting, on 12 December 1653, the members of the assembly voted to dissolve it. It was preceded by the Rump Parliament and succeeded by the First Protectorate Parliament.

==Need for a parliament==
Following the execution of King Charles, the Rump Parliament was the last remaining element of the English government. It had little or no claim to representation of the populace and held elections only to replace members. The mood of the country was for long-needed reforms to be carried out but the Rump made little progress. The enactment of a Navigation Act to aid merchants led to the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652. There was an expectation that a new parliament should be called; however, the Rump made no moves towards its dissolution.

==Debate over form of assembly==
The forced dissolution of the Rump Parliament on 20 April 1653 left a gap in the legislature, with no blueprint to fill it. Cromwell and the Council of Officers claimed to be &quot;led by necessity and Providence to act as we have done, even beyond and above our own thoughts and desires, so we shall ... put ourselves wholly upon the Lord for a blessing&quot;.

On 29 April, Cromwell set up a small Council of State of thirteen members, responsible for foreign policy and administration of the country. The Council of Officers remained responsible for decisions about the new form of government. John Lambert argued in favour of lodging power in the hands of ten or twelve men. Thomas Harrison, drawing on his Fifth Monarchist beliefs, argued that their duty was to accelerate the coming of the kingdom of Christ by putting power into the hands of godly men. Another Fifth Monarchist, John Rogers (Fifth Monarchist), proposed the idea of an assembly numbering 70 based on the Jewish Sanhedrin. The Council of Officers settled on an assembly of 140 representatives, double the Sanhedrin model, which may signify a practical compromise to emulate the Sanhedrin while accommodating members from across England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The Scottish and Irish delegates were English soldiers serving in those countries.

The Council of Officers then settled the question of how to select the group&#x27;s representatives, agreeing that members should be chosen by the council, all of whom were free to put forward nominations. Power would be vested in each member by Cromwell in his role as commander-in-chief of the army. Although there was negative reaction from some churches, with a member of a congregation in London declaring &quot;the question is not so much now who is Independent, Anabaptist, etc., as who is for Christ and who is for Cromwell&quot;, most of the sects welcomed the decision. S. R. Gardiner conjectured that the Council of Officers consulted congregational churches in each county, asking them to send names of suitable candidates for the new assembly. However, no copy of any letter of consultation survives, and although some churches did send in nominations, there is no evidence that a mass consultation took place. By 3 May the Council of Officers had had over a hundred names submitted by its members. By 23 May an initial list of nominations was ready, which was then added to and refined over the next few weeks.

==Inauguration==

The assembly met for the first time on 4 July in the council chamber at Whitehall. Cromwell opened proceedings with a speech around two hours long. He began by summing up the &quot;series of Providences&quot; that had brought them to this point, starting with the Short Parliament and singling out 1648 as the &quot;most memorable year that ever this nation saw&quot;. In a much-analysed passage, Cromwell is supposed to have declared: &quot;God doth manifest it to be &quot;the&quot; day of the Power of Jesus Christ&quot;. This has sometimes been adduced as evidence that Cromwell shared Harrison&#x27;s Fifth Monarchist beliefs, welcoming the assembly as the start of Christ&#x27;s kingdom on earth. However, the first published version of the speech records this sentence as &quot;God doth manifest it to be a day of the Power of Jesus Christ&quot;, considerably softening the impact, and implying that he merely thought it to be a spiritually joyful occasion. Cromwell then asked a written &#x27;instrument&#x27; to be read out, drawn up by the Council of Officers and investing power in the assembly.

The assembly then adjourned before sitting in full on the following day. On that day they elected Francis Rous, initially as chairman (he was not known as Speaker until a month later). Henry Scobell was appointed as Clerk. Cromwell and four other officers – Lambert, John Desborough, Harrison and Matthew Tomlinson – were then co-opted as members. On 12 July, the assembly published a declaration declaring itself to be the parliament of the Commonwealth of England. This was the first time that it had been formally described as a parliament.

==Membership==
The parliament became a subject of ridicule very quickly after its establishment. A newswriter called them &quot;s, Innkeepers, Millwrights, Stockingmongers and such a rabble as never had hopes to be of a Grand Jury&quot;. In particular, its members were singled out for their alleged low social status, their puritanism and their relative lack of political experience. These criticisms were seen to be encapsulated by one of its members, Praise-God Barebone, a leather seller, Fifth Monarchist and lay preacher from Fleet Street in London. Before its dissolution the assembly had become known as Barebone&#x27;s Parliament.

Despite contemporary slanders, the assembly&#x27;s members were mainly drawn from the richest five per cent of the population, and few tradesmen were represented. Nor was it solely composed of Fifth Monarchists, despite the impression that hostile contemporary pamphlets give. Twelve or thirteen members can be identified as Fifth Monarchists, some of whom had served with Harrison. These were contrasted with about fifteen of the more active members of the assembly, who were more moderate Independents. Although it is misleading to divide the assembly into two parties, an analysis of its entire membership along moderate and radical lines identifies 76 members as religious moderates and 47 as radicals, with a further 21 either impossible to identify or not participating in the assembly.

Only four regicides, Anthony Stapley, John Carew, Thomas Harrison, and Cromwell himself, were appointed. Thomas Harrison was the leader of the Fifth Monarchists and John Carew was also a Fifth Monarchist.

==The rise of conflict==

On 13 July, the assembly began debating tithes – which were objected to by many sects on the grounds that they were a remnant of Catholicism, that they supported a professional rather than voluntary clergy, and that their economic burden fell unequally. There was general consensus that tithes were objectionable, but little agreement about what mechanism for generating revenue should replace them. Debate within the assembly was quickly echoed by petitions from churches around the country. Another contentious issue the assembly debated during its early weeks was the trial of John Lilburne, which again did little to unite opinion. A third issue, reform of the legal system, again split the members, with Fifth Monarchists arguing that only laws contained in scripture should be reflected in the temporal legal system, while former members of the Rump&#x27;s Hale Commission pushed for progressive reform.

By early September, Cromwell was already said to have been growing frustrated with the assembly&#x27;s in-fighting between different groups. A newswriter reported him saying to a confidant that he was &quot;more troubled now with the fool than before now with the knave&quot;. He also wrote to his son-in-law Charles Fleetwood complaining that the members &quot;being of different judgements, and of each sort most seeking to propagate their own, that spirit of kindness that is to them, is hardly accepted of any&quot;. Attendance also began to fall. Over one hundred members were present at most votes in July, dropping to an average turnout of 70 by October. Various bills inflamed conflict between the radical and moderate members – bills to abolish the Court of Chancery, regulate legal fees, and speed up settlement of cases in the Court of Admiralty all became bogged down in conflict. At this point, however, radical members were still mainly outnumbered in votes by moderate and conservative members.

==Dissolution and aftermath==
This changed during November and December when debate returned to the question of tithes. On 6 December the committee of the assembly appointed to consider the question presented their report, covering the question of how unfit ministers were to be ejected, naming commissioners who would have the job of enacting this, and retaining support for tithes in prescribed circumstances. The first clause of the report was voted against by 56 votes to 54 in a defeat for the moderates. Two days later, moderates came to the House and demanded that the assembly abdicate its powers, criticising radical members for threatening the wellbeing of the Commonwealth by fomenting disagreement. Rous and around 40 members walked out and went to Cromwell at Whitehall, presenting a document signed by nearly 80 members that declared: &quot;Upon a Motion this day made in the House, that the sitting of this Parliament any longer as now constituted, will not be for the good of the Commonwealth&quot;. Those left in the house were soon confronted by troops requesting that they leave.

The collapse of the radical consensus which had spawned the Nominated Assembly led to the Grandees passing the Instrument of Government in the Council of State which paved the way for Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate.

<doc id="213059" wikidata="Q16628" url="?curid=213059" title="Wen Jiabao">
<text>Wen Jiabao (; born 15 September 1942) is a Chinese retired politician who served as the 6th premier of China from 2003 to 2013. In his capacity as head of government, Wen was regarded as the leading figure behind China&#x27;s economic policy. From 2002 to 2012, he held membership in the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; top power organ, where he was ranked third out of nine members and after general secretary Hu Jintao and Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress.

He worked as the director of the General Office of the Chinese Communist Party between 1986 and 1993, and accompanied Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang as Zhao&#x27;s personal secretary to Tiananmen Square during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, where Zhao called on protesting students to leave the square and after which Zhao was removed from his position within the Party. In 1998, Wen was promoted to the post of Vice Premier under Premier Zhu Rongji, his mentor, and oversaw the broad portfolios of agriculture and finance.

Wen was dubbed &quot;the people&#x27;s premier&quot; by both domestic and foreign media. Instead of concentrating on GDP growth in large cities and rich coastal areas, Wen advocated for advancing policies considered more favorable towards farmers and migrant workers. Wen&#x27;s government reduced agricultural taxes and pursued ambitious infrastructure projects. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, Wen&#x27;s government injected four trillion yuan into the economy as part of a stimulus program.

Seen as the leading member of the reform wing of the Communist Party, Wen expressed openness to political reforms. However, his family came under scrutiny by investigative journalists for having accumulated a massive fortune during his time in government, casting a cloud over his legacy shortly prior to his retirement. He left office in 2013 and was succeeded by Li Keqiang.

==Early life and education==

Born in Beichen district of the City of Tianjin, Wen Jiabao went to the Nankai High School from which the first premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Zhou Enlai graduated.

Wen attended the Beijing Institute of Geology (now the China University of Geosciences) for undergraduate education with a major in geological surveying and prospecting from 1960 to 1965. Afterwards, he pursued his graduate studies in geological structure from 1965 to 1968.

Wen joined the Chinese Communist Party when he was a college student in April 1965. His granduncle worked as a diplomat at FMPRC.

== Early career ==
After the completion of his graduate studies, he began his career in the geology bureau of Gansu province. From 1968 to 1978, he presided over the Geomechanics Survey Team under the Gansu Provincial Geological Bureau and head of its political section. Wen succeeded in office, rising as chief of the Gansu Provincial Geological Bureau and later as Vice-minister of Geology and Mineral Resources.

Wen was &quot;discovered&quot; by then-CCP general secretary Hu Yaobang in 1985, and joined the ranks of the Central Committee and Politburo. There was some public speculation after 1989 over whether Wen was closer to Hu Yaobang or Zhao Ziyang, but Wen implicitly confirmed that he was a protégé of Hu by the release of his 2010 article, &quot;Recalling Hu Yaobang when I returned to Xingyi&quot;. After Wen was promoted to work in Beijing, he served as Chief of the Party&#x27;s General Affairs Office, an organ that oversaw day-to-day operations of the party&#x27;s leaders. He remained in the post for eight years.

Wen built a network of patronage during his career. Throughout this period Wen was said to be a strong administrator and technocrat, having earned a reputation for meticulousness, competence, and a focus on tangible results. Outgoing Premier Zhu Rongji showed his esteem for Wen by entrusting him from 1998 with the task of overseeing agricultural, financial and environmental policies in the office of Vice-Premier, considered crucial as China prepared to enter the World Trade Organization. Wen served as Secretary of the Central Financial Work Commission from 1998 to 2002. By the end of the 1990s Wen and Zhang Peili were the main investor and founder of Ping An Insurance, which was established with the help of Hong Kong tycoon Cheng Yu-tung&#x27;s family through real estate firm New World Development.

=== Survival of Tiananmen purge ===
Wen&#x27;s most significant political recovery occurred after accompanying Zhao on his visit to students demonstrating in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Unlike Zhao, who was purged from the party days later for &quot;grave insubordination&quot; and lived under house arrest in Beijing until his death in January 2005, Wen survived the political aftermath of the demonstrations.
Wen Jiabao is the only Chief of the Party&#x27;s General Affairs Office to have served under three General Secretaries: Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, and Jiang Zemin.

==First-term premiership==
Wen entered the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, China&#x27;s highest ruling council, in November 2002, ranked third out of nine members (After Hu Jintao and Wu Bangguo). During the transition of authority as Hu Jintao assumed the general secretary and presidency in November 2002 and March 2003 respectively, Wen&#x27;s nomination as premier was confirmed by the National People&#x27;s Congress with over 99% of the delegates&#x27; vote.

After taking over as Premier, Wen oversaw the continuation of economic reforms and has been involved in shifting national goals from economic growth at all costs to growth which also emphasizes more egalitarian wealth, along with other social goals, such as public health and education. Wen&#x27;s broad range of experience and expertise, especially cultivated while presiding over agricultural policies under Zhu Rongji, has been important as the &quot;fourth generation&quot; sought to revitalize the rural economy in regions left out by the past two decades of reform. In addition, the Chinese government under Wen has begun to focus on the social costs of economic development, which include damage to the environment and to workers&#x27; health. This more comprehensive definition of development was encapsulated into the idea of a &quot;xiaokang society&quot;. In November 2003, Wen and his government introduced the slogan of &quot;Five Comprehensive Coordinations&quot; which outlined the Communist Party&#x27;s priorities for harmonious and scientific development: mitigating urban-rural imbalances, interregional imbalances, socio-economic imbalances, human-environmental imbalances, and domestic-international imbalances. Chinese economy remained high growth rate throughout Wen&#x27;s first term as Premier, which China has an average GDP growth rate of 11% between 2003 and 2008.

Initially regarded as quiet and unassuming, Wen is said to be a good communicator and is known as a &quot;man of the people.&quot; Wen has appeared to make great efforts to reach out to those who seem left out by two decades of stunning economic growth in rural and especially western China. Unlike Jiang Zemin and his protégés on the Politburo Standing Committee, who form the so-called &quot;Shanghai clique&quot;, both Wen and Hu hail from, and have cultivated their political bases, in the vast Chinese interior. Many have noted the contrasts between Wen and Hu, &quot;men of the people&quot;, and Jiang Zemin, the flamboyant, multilingual, and urbane former mayor of Shanghai, the country&#x27;s most cosmopolitan city.

Like Hu Jintao, whose purported brilliance and photographic memory have facilitated his meteoric rise to power, Wen is regarded as well-equipped to preside over a vast bureaucracy in the world&#x27;s most populated and perhaps most rapidly changing nation. In March 2003, the usually self-effacing Wen was quoted as saying, &quot;The former Swiss ambassador to China once said that my brain is like a computer&quot;, he said. &quot;Indeed, many statistics are stored in my brain.&quot;

Mild-tempered and conciliatory, especially compared to his predecessor, the tough, straight-talking Zhu Rongji, Wen&#x27;s consensual management style has enabled him to generate a great deal of good will, but has also created some opponents who are in support of tougher policy decisions. Notably, Wen was widely known to have clashed with then-Shanghai party chief Chen Liangyu over the central government&#x27;s policies.

Wen was involved in two major episodes involving public health. In early 2003, he was involved in ending the official inaction over the SARS crisis. On 1 December 2004, he became the first major Chinese official to publicly address the problem of AIDS, which has devastated parts of Yunnan and Henan and threatens to be a major burden on Chinese development. Since May 2004, Wen made various visits to communities devastated by AIDS, trips shown prominently on national media. By showing these actions, Wen displayed an effort to reverse years of what many activists have described as a policy of denial and inaction. Furthermore, Wen is concerned about the health and safety of previous drug addicts; since March 2004, Wen had visited several drug addict treatment facilities in southern China and addressed the issue to the patients in person, recognizing that AIDS is more likely to be spread by drug abuse and the reuse of hypodermic syringes than by sexual contact.

Wen was known to conduct visits to relatively poor areas of China&#x27;s countryside randomly to avoid elaborate preparations to appease officials and hide the real situation, which is done often in China. At committee meetings of the State Council, Wen made it clear that the rural wealth disparity problem must be addressed. Along with general secretary Hu Jintao, the government focused on the &quot;Three Rural Issues&quot;, namely, agriculture, the countryside, and farmers, and emphasized these core areas as requiring further work and development. The Hu-Wen administration abolished the thousand year old agricultural tax entirely in 2005, a bold move that significantly changed the rural economic model. But despite these initiatives, Wen has been criticized for allowing the urban-rural gap to actually increase during his tenure.

Like Zhu Rongji, Wen is generally seen as a popular communist official with the Chinese public. His attitude is seemingly sincere and warm, triggering comparisons with former premier Zhou Enlai. Wen spent Chinese New Year in 2005 with a group of coal miners in a Shanxi coal mine. To many, Wen has gained the image of being the &quot;people&#x27;s premier&quot;, a populist, and an ordinary Chinese citizen who knows and understands ordinary people&#x27;s needs. In an annual meeting of the Chinese Authors Association, Wen spoke for over two hours to the delegates without looking at script. To foreign media, Wen was also the highest figure in the Chinese government to give free press conferences, often facing politically sensitive and difficult questions regarding subjects such as Taiwan Independence, Tibetan independence and human rights.

In December 2003, Wen visited the United States for the first time. During the trip, Wen was able to get President George W. Bush to issue what many saw as a mild rebuke to the then President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Chen Shui-bian. Wen has also been on visits to Canada and Australia, mostly on economic issues. Wen also visited Japan in April 2007 in what was termed the &quot;de-thawing journey&quot;, where he characterized the relationship between the Asian powers as for &quot;mutual benefit&quot;. He also met with Emperor Akihito and played baseball.

Balancing regional development was a top priority early in Wen&#x27;s Premiership. During his delivery of the Annual Work Report of the State Council in March 2004, Wen introduced The Rise of the Central Regions campaign. This campaign included Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, and Shanxi. Through it, the central government sought to further advance the already-occurring process of industrial transfer from coastal regions to the interior.

On 15 March 2005, after the anti-secession law was passed, by a majority of 2,896 to nil, with two abstentions by the National People&#x27;s Congress, Wen said: &quot;We don&#x27;t wish for foreign intervention, but we are not afraid of it.&quot; as an allusion to the United States&#x27; stance on Taiwan. That earned him a long round of applause that was rare even by Chinese standards.

On 5 March 2007, Wen announced plans to increase the military budget. By the end of 2007 the military budget rose 17.8 percent from the previous year&#x27;s 45 billion dollars, creating tension with the United States.

After the conclusion of the 2007 National People&#x27;s Congress, Wen criticized the state of the economy in comments later described as the &quot;Four Uns.&quot; Wen stated that after thirty years of rapid economic growth, the economy was at risk of becoming unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable. His comments about the risk of an unsustainable economy alluded to overconsumption of resources, particularly coal, as well as growing income and wealth disparities. Wen&#x27;s critique of the &quot;Four Uns&quot; prompted significant internal debate over China&#x27;s growth strategy.

There were rumors about Wen&#x27;s retirement and reputed clashes with former Shanghai party chief Chen Liangyu before the party&#x27;s 17th Party Congress. Some sources suggested that Wen would ask to retire due to fatigue. Ultimately, Wen stayed on the Premier job, and was responsible for the drafting of the important speech delivered by Party general secretary Hu Jintao outlining China&#x27;s direction in the next five years.

In January 2008, while during the midst of severe snowstorms, Premier Wen made his way south and visited train stations in Changsha and Guangzhou, addressing the public while calming their mood for long train delays.

== Second-term premiership ==
Wen Jiabao was appointed to a second five-year term as premier on 16 March 2008, leading efforts to cool soaring inflation and showcase the country to the world at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He received fewer votes in favor than he did in 2003, a sign that the premiership can create enemies, even in the mere formalities of China&#x27;s electoral system. Wen faced grave economic challenges as the world became increasingly affected by the U.S. economic crisis. Social stability and regional activism in China&#x27;s restive hinterland regions also dominated Wen&#x27;s policy agenda. On 18 March 2008, during the press conference after the 2008 National People&#x27;s Congress, Wen toed the government line in blaming supporters of the Dalai Lama for violence in Tibet, and said Chinese security forces exercised restraint in confronting rioting and unrest in the streets of Lhasa. Wen acted as the spokesman of the Chinese government during the 2008 unrest in Tibet and refused to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and his followers, unless they chose to &quot;give up all separatist activities.&quot; On 12 November 2010, during the 2010 Asian Games opening ceremony in Guangzhou, Wen became the first non-head of state to open the Asian Games.

In the 2011 Two Sessions Work Report, Wen stated his support for e-commerce in China, describing it as a mechanism to expand domestic consumption.

In his final address as China&#x27;s prime minister Wen warned of the nation&#x27;s growing divisions between rich and poor, the hazards of unchecked environmental degradation and the risks posed by unbalanced economic growth.

=== Response to 2008 Sichuan earthquake ===
Premier Wen Jiabao&#x27;s popularity was boosted significantly when he went to the disaster area of the Sichuan a mere few hours after the disaster occurred. He declared on national television that survivors are to be rescued as long as there is &quot;a glimmer of hope&quot;. He was named the General Commander of the Earthquake Relief Efforts Committee immediately following the disaster. Following his visits to the area, images of the Premier were displayed on national media, numerous videos popped up on Chinese video sites making comparisons with former Premier Zhou Enlai, a largely popular figure who was also dubbed the &quot;People&#x27;s Premier&quot;. While party leaders are often shown on state television looking rather stiff and sitting motionlessly, Wen&#x27;s on-site image and candid nature attracted a large popular following of Chinese citizens.

In addition, there was speculation on internet forums as well as foreign media about the availability of the scientific prediction of the 2008 earthquake, and Wen was quoted as the only high-ranking Chinese leader to try to announce the scientific prediction and made it public, but was somehow prevented by other members of the Politburo Standing Committee.

=== 2009 NPC ===
Before the 2009 National People&#x27;s Congress convened, on 28 February, Premier Wen Jiabao went online on video chat to answer queries hosted by China&#x27;s official government website gov.cn and the official Xinhua News Agency. During the session Wen openly advocated for transparency of the government and remarked that he was somewhat nervous about the occasion. He received a wide range of questions from large numbers of online Chinese netizens and chose to answer selected questions about prominent economic issues, such as global financial breakdown.

At the Congress, Wen also passed on a message of reassurance that GDP growth would not dip below 8% in 2009. He did not introduce a new stimulus package, and played down speculation that part of the 1.18 trillion RMB central government spending was not going directly into the economy. He also expressed concern about the security of Beijing&#x27;s holdings in U.S. treasury debt. In a more unusual gesture, Wen also expressed interest in visiting Taiwan, stating he would &quot;crawl there if [he] could not walk&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===

Wen Jiabao played a prominent role advancing China&#x27;s foreign policy positions, and became increasingly visible on the world stage as China&#x27;s economic power expanded. He went on an official working visit to North Korea on 4 October 2009, the first time a Chinese Premier has visited North Korea since Li Peng&#x27;s visit in 1991. He was greeted at the Pyongyang Airport by ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il. Kim rarely greeted foreign dignitaries himself upon their arrival at the airport. Reuters believed this to be a show of solidarity from North Korea and that the country was serious in fostering a good relationship with China. Wen also met with European Union leaders at a China-EU conference in late November 2009, where he refused calls for China to revalue its Yuan and re-examine its foreign exchange regime. Wen remarked in Nanjing that &quot;some countries are on the one hand pressuring China to appreciate its currency while on the other hand they are practicing trade protectionism against China in many different forms.&quot;

In December, in what was seen as a mild rebuke of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper during the latter&#x27;s working visit to China, Wen stated, &quot;This is your first trip to China and this is the first meeting between the Chinese Premier and the Canadian Prime Minister in almost five years. Five years is too long a time for China Canada relations.&quot; However, the interpretation that Wen rebuked Harper was later disputed in select newspaper editorials. Wen also traveled to the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference, where he met with U.S. President Barack Obama twice to secure an 11th-hour non-binding agreement on emissions cuts.

=== Bo Xilai incident ===
Wen Jiabao is one of the main critics of Bo Xilai, then Party Secretary of Chongqing and a leading figure of the conservative faction within the communist party. Bo Xilai opposed many of Wen Jiabao&#x27;s policies when he was Minister of Commerce in the Wen Jiabao Government. It was believed that Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier Wu Yi both had a bad relationship with Bo Xilai, and both Wen and Wu successfully blocked Bo Xilai from becoming Vice Premier in 2008. After Wang Lijun incident in February 2012, Wen Jiabao became one of the leading figures in the attempt to remove Bo Xilai, and he openly criticized local authority in Chongqing under the leadership of Bo Xilai during a press conference after 2012 National People&#x27;s Congress on 14 March 2012. The day after the press conference, Bo Xilai was removed from his position in Chongqing and placed under house arrest. Eventually Bo Xilai was expelled from the party in September 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2013.

=== Retirement ===
After 18th Party Congress in November 2012, Wen stepped down as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. In March 2013, Wen retired from politics after Li Keqiang succeeded him as Premier of China.

== Political views ==
Domestic and foreign media variously described Wen as &quot;populist&quot; and in touch with the needs of ordinary people. On most social issues Wen seems to be moderate, with his brand of policies based around societal harmony as prescribed by the Scientific Development Concept, the leading ideology of the administration.

In the first term of his Premiership Wen&#x27;s attitudes towards political reform seemed ambivalent. He remarked that &quot;the socialist system will continue in China for the next 100 years&quot;, although later, in a press conference at the 2007 National People&#x27;s Congress, he stated that &quot;democracy is one of the basic goals of the socialist system&quot;. Furthermore, in an interview in September 2008, Wen acknowledged that the democratic system in China needs to be improved, where the power &quot;truly belongs to the people&quot; through the construction of an independent judicial system and for the government to accept criticism from the people. Wen, seen as a former ally of Premier Zhao Ziyang, was likely supportive of the latter&#x27;s political rehabilitation; however, he rarely mentioned Zhao publicly during his premiership. On the subject of Taiwan, he reputedly believed in gradual negotiations. On the subject of Tibet, he toed the party line in condemning the exiled Dalai Lama for inciting &quot;separatist violence&quot;.

Xinhua published articles in early 2007 on the direction of national development. The authorship of the articles was attributed separately to Wen Jiabao, particularly 26 February piece &quot;Our Historical Tasks at the Primary Stage of Socialism and Several Issues Concerning China&#x27;s Foreign Policy&quot;. The article advanced Wen&#x27;s &quot;peace doctrine&quot; in global affairs, as well as what appeared to be inclinations towards fostering social democracy and advocacy of universal values. This was suspected as a sign that Wen has some differing viewpoints to the official party line – that values are relativistic and that &quot;Chinese values&quot; are not necessarily the same as &quot;Western values,&quot; and that universal values is thus an empty concept. The debate continues to rage in Chinese political circles today, with neo-leftist thinkers such as Chinese Academy of Social Sciences President Chen Kuiyuan criticizing Wen&#x27;s advocacy of universal values, saying that it relegates Chinese values and thinking as an inferior alternative to supposedly more &quot;correct&quot; Western norms.

Wen is perceived by some observers as a liberal voice in China&#x27;s ruling elite. Wen has openly talked about democracy and increased freedoms in his speeches and interviews with foreign correspondents, although much of it was deemed &quot;sensitive&quot; commentary and censored in state media. Wen remarked that &quot;someone who speaks is not a criminal, someone who listens is duly warned&quot; (, &quot;which alludes to the classical work Shi Jing&quot;) at an internal party conference in 2009, an event reported on Xinhua and other state networks. His remarks triggered debate from netizens, as it seemed to contravene the practices of the Communist Party, particularly in its suppression of dissent. Analysts noted that Wen&#x27;s message was aimed at party members, and not necessarily the general public because Wen believes freedom of speech has deteriorated since Hu Jintao&#x27;s accession to power and has negatively affected China&#x27;s political landscape and international reputation. His comments also ostensibly addressed the pervasive &quot;fake-talking&quot; present in Chinese political circles, in an attempt to curb systemic and institutional woes stemming from officials who are afraid to speak the truth.

Wen has progressively amplified his liberal rhetoric as his Premiership continued, remarking in August 2010 that &quot;Without political reform, China may lose what it has already achieved through economic restructuring&quot;. Wen&#x27;s comments were largely censored in state media, but he gained support from a group of some 23 party elders in October, who denounced the authorities&#x27; censorship of Wen&#x27;s remarks in an open letter to the National People&#x27;s Congress. In an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN&#x27;s Global Public Square television program aired in 2008, Wen made the following statement: &quot;I have summed up my political ideals into the following four sentences. To let everyone lead a happy life with dignity. To let everyone feel safe and secure. To let the society be one with equity and justice. And to let everyone have confidence in the future. In spite of the various discussions and views in the society, and in spite of some resistance, I will act in accordance with these ideals unswervingly, and advance within the realm of my capabilities political restructuring. I will like to tell you the following two sentences to reinforce my view on this point. I will not fall in spite of the strong wind and harsh rain, and I will not yield until the last day of my life.&quot; When asked by Zakaria whether or not China would have competitive elections in the next 25 years, Wen stated that it would be &quot;hard to predict&quot; what would happen in that timeframe. At the 2012 National People&#x27;s Congress, Wen mentioned the word &quot;reform&quot; 70 times. He remarked that China must &quot;press ahead with both economic structural reforms and political structural reforms, in particular reforms on the leadership system of the Party and the country.&quot; There is also indication from party insiders that Wen has been pushing the case for the political rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

== Public image and political influence ==
Wen has been described as a populist by most observers. His quick responses and visits to the scenes of various disasters, including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, has earned him a considerable reputation as an approachable leader in touch with the experiences of the masses. Wen engages regularly with locals on his trips to various provinces domestically as well as foreign visits; he played baseball and badminton with Japanese and South Korean citizens during visits to those countries. &quot;Whether taking a stroll or swimming, it puts me at ease both mentally and physically and helps me handle my heavy workload,&quot; Wen had remarked.

Wen&#x27;s public image has been criticized by Chinese dissident Yu Jie, who charged that Wen&#x27;s rhetoric is insincere and empty. Dissidents such as Yu allege that Wen&#x27;s parade of appearances on Chinese media is a carefully managed public relations campaign designed to distract people from real issues. They say that through use of Wen&#x27;s charisma, the government hopes to showcase cosmetic solutions to much larger, systemic issues in order to placate public opinion. They also point out that Wen&#x27;s words are rarely translated into deeds. On the other hand, Li Datong, a pro-democracy advocate, in an interview with the Associated Press, stated that &quot;among the top Chinese leaders, who else speaks about democracy? Who else speaks about universal values and freedom?... Wen is the only one.&quot; Li believes that Wen is genuinely calling for democratic reform but he is powerless to make major decisions on the matter due to internal opposition. Wen&#x27;s family members have also been subject to gossip and scrutiny outside of mainland China. Taiwanese media zoomed in on his wife&#x27;s alleged personal fortunes from her jewelry business, while the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported on a private equity firm called New Horizon Capital co-founded by Wen&#x27;s son Wen Yunsong.

When he was the head of the Chinese government, Wen Jiabao was considered to be one of the most powerful statesmen in the world. In 2006, he was named to the Time 100 list. In 2009, Wen was named one of ten people and the only non-American in a list compiled by ABC of people who shaped the U.S. economy the most since 2000. Wen also topped a list of &quot;10 leaders to watch&quot; in 2010 released 19 January by Eurasia Group, a global political risk research and consulting firm. Behind that U.S. President Barack Obama came second. In August 2010, Wen was named &quot;The Man of the People&quot; by &quot;Newsweek&quot;. In October 2010, Wen Jiabao was a person selected on the Time&#x27;s cover that the title was &quot;Wen&#x27;s World&quot;. In 2011, Wen was ranked 14th in &quot;Forbes&quot; list of the World&#x27;s Most Powerful People.

In 2021, Chinese authorities censored a tribute that Wen Jiabao had written for his mother in the small paper Macau Herald.

== Personal life and family wealth ==
Wen Jiabao is married to Zhang Peili, whom he met while working as a government geologist in Gansu. Zhang is a jewelry expert and has played a prominent role in the nation&#x27;s diamond trade. She rarely appears with Wen in public. They have a son, Wen Yunsong, and a daughter, Wen Ruchun (Lily Chang).

In October 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Wen&#x27;s family controlled financial assets worth at least US$2.7 billion during his time as Premier. In response, a Chinese government spokesman stated that the report &quot;blackens China&#x27;s name and has ulterior motives&quot;, and the websites of &quot;The New York Times&quot; were censored in mainland China. Lawyers representing Wen&#x27;s family also denied the report&#x27;s content. Wen personally wrote a letter submitted to the Politburo Standing Committee asking for an investigation to the claim and willing to make his family assets public. Professor Zhu Lijia, of the Chinese Academy of Governance, suggest that this is Wen&#x27;s last try to push the passing of the &quot;Sunshine law&quot;, which would require government officials to release their financial information to the public. Professor Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Hong Kong&#x27;s Baptist University questioned the timing of the report and suggested &quot;It looks very much [like] some people close to Bo Xilai are trying to throw mud at the reformists&quot;.

Wen is known for his adept use of Chinese poetry to convey political and diplomatic messages, when responding to journalists, or simply to begin a speech.

<text>Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick KB, PC (May/June 158719 April 1658) was an English naval officer, politician and peer who commanded the Parliamentarian navy during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. A Puritan, he was also lord of the Manor of Hunningham.

==Personal details==

Robert Rich was the eldest son and third of seven children born to Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick (1559–1619) and his first wife Penelope (1563–1607). His parents separated soon after his brother Henry&#x27;s birth, although they did not formally divorce until 1605, when Penelope married her long-time partner, Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy (1563-1606). Penelope was a sister of the Earl of Essex, executed for treason in 1601, making Rich a cousin to future Parliamentarian general Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex.

He had two sisters, Essex (1585-1658) and Lettice (1587-1619) and a younger brother Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland (1590–1649). He also had a number of half brothers and sisters, including Penelope (1592-?), Isabella, Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport (1597-1666), and Charles (1605-1627). Almost certainly fathered by Charles Mountjoy, these children were brought up within the Rich family and appear in its pedigree, with the exception of Mountjoy, who was legitimised after his father&#x27;s death.

Robert Rich married three times, first in February 1605 to Frances Hatton (1590–1623) Lady of the Manor of Hunningham, daughter and heiress of Sir William Hatton (1560–1597) Lord of the Manor of Hunningham, formerly &quot;Newport&quot;, the granddaughter of Francis Gawdy. Their children included Anne (1604–1642), Robert (1611–1659), Lucy (1615–after 1635), Frances (1621–1692) and Charles (1623?–1673). Sometime before January 1626, he married Susan Rowe (1582–1646), a daughter of Sir Henry Rowe, Lord Mayor of London, and widow of William Holliday (c.1565–1624), Alderman of London, a wealthy London merchant and chairman of the East India Company. In March 1646, he made his third and last marriage to Eleanor Wortley (died 1667); neither of these produced children.

==Career==
He succeeded to his father&#x27;s title as Earl of Warwick in 1619. Early developing interest in colonial ventures, he joined the Guinea, New England, and Virginia companies, as well as the Virginia Company&#x27;s offspring, the Somers Isles Company (the Somers Isles, or Bermuda, was at first the more secure of the Virginia Company&#x27;s two settlements, being impossible to attack overland and almost impregnable against attack from the ocean due to its encircling reef, and was attractive as a base of operations for Warwick&#x27;s privateers, though his ship the &quot;Warwick&quot; was lost at Castle Harbour in November 1619).

He was also instrumental in the establishment of the ill-fated Providence Island colony in the West Indies (which was also linked with his privateering activities). Warwick&#x27;s enterprises involved him in disputes with the East India Company (1617) and with the Virginia Company, which in 1624 was suppressed as a result of his action. In August 1619, the &quot;White Lion&quot;, a privateer ship sponsored by him and operating under a Dutch letter of marque, attacked the Portuguese slave ship &quot;São João Bautista&quot; and captured approximately 20 African slaves. The &quot;White Lion&quot; proceeded to sail to Old Point Comfort in the English colony of Virginia, where its crew sold the Africans to the colony&#x27;s settlers, including Governor George Yeardley. This event is considered by historians to be a major event in slavery in the colonial history of the United States. In 1627, he commanded an unsuccessful privateering expedition against the Spanish. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Maldon for 1604 to 1611 and for Essex in the short-lived Addled Parliament of 1614.

==Colonial ventures==

Warwick&#x27;s Puritan connections and sympathies gradually estranged him from the court but promoted his association with the New England colonies. In 1628 he indirectly procured the patent for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in 1631 he was granted the &quot;Saybrook&quot; patent in Connecticut. Forced to resign the presidency of the Council for New England in the same year, he continued to manage the Somers Isles Company (the Somers Isles being one of the colonies that sided with the Crown) and Providence Island Company, the latter of which, founded in 1630, administered Old Providence on the Mosquito Coast. Meanwhile, in England, Warwick opposed the forced loan of 1626, the payment of ship money, and Laud&#x27;s church policy.

His Richneck Plantation was located in what is now the independent city of Newport News, Virginia. The Warwick River, Warwick Towne, Warwick River Shire, and Warwick County, Virginia are all believed named for him, as are Warwick, Rhode Island and Warwick Parish in Bermuda (alias The Somers Isles). The oldest school in Bermuda, Warwick Academy, was built on land in Warwick Parish given by the Earl of Warwick; the school was begun in the 1650s (its early records were lost with those of the Warwick Vestry in a twentieth-century shipwreck), though the school places its founding officially in 1662.

==The Long Parliament==
By the summer of 1640 Warwick had emerged as the centre of the resistance to Charles I. This was the result of decades of resisting actions including opposing Charles I&#x27;s compulsory loans during the 1620s and in January 1637 – 12 years into Charles I’s personal rule – personally presenting the case for a new parliament to the king. 

In September 1640, Warwick signed the Petition of Twelve to Charles I, asking the king to summon another parliament.

Over the early part of the new parliament, Warwick led one wing of the opposition to Charles I. The Warwick House group pushed for further reform than the more conciliatory Bedford House group, and in particular urged the need for the execution of the Earl of Stratford. 

==Civil War period==

In 1642, following the dismissal of the Earl of Northumberland as Lord High Admiral, Warwick was appointed commander of the fleet by Parliament. In 1643, he was appointed head of a commission for the government of the colonies, which the next year incorporated Providence Plantations, afterwards Rhode Island, and in this capacity, he exerted himself to secure religious liberty.

As commander of the fleet, in 1648, Warwick retook the &#x27;Castles of the Downs&#x27; (at Walmer, Deal, and Sandown) for Parliament, and became Deal Castle&#x27;s captain 1648–53. The subject was criticized for not recapturing the royalist fleet in 1648 when Prince Rupert suffered mutiny and disarray in Hellevoetsluis. However, he was dismissed from office on the abolition of the House of Lords in 1649. He retired from national public life, but was intimately associated with the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, whose daughter Francis married his grandson and heir, also Robert Rich, in 1657 (the marriage was a short one as the grandson died the following year).

<doc id="213067" wikidata="Q15197384" url="?curid=213067" title="Battle of Orgreave">
<text>The Battle of Orgreave was a violent confrontation on 18 June 1984 between pickets and officers of the South Yorkshire Police (SYP) and other police forces, including the Metropolitan Police, at a British Steel Corporation (BSC) coking plant at Orgreave, in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. It was a pivotal event in the 1984–1985 UK miners&#x27; strike, and one of the most violent clashes in British industrial history.

Journalist Alastair Stewart has characterised it as &quot;a defining and ghastly moment&quot; that &quot;changed, forever, the conduct of industrial relations and how this country functions as an economy and as a democracy&quot;. Most media reports at the time depicted it as &quot;an act of self-defence by police who had come under attack&quot;. In 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) reported that there was &quot;evidence of excessive violence by police officers, a false narrative from police exaggerating violence by miners, perjury by officers giving evidence to prosecute the arrested men, and an apparent cover-up of that perjury by senior officers&quot;.

Historian Tristram Hunt has described the confrontation as &quot;almost medieval in its choreography ... at various stages a siege, a battle, a chase, a rout and, finally, a brutal example of legalised state violence&quot;.

71 picketers were charged with riot and 24 with violent disorder. At the time, riot was punishable by life imprisonment. The trials collapsed when the evidence given by the police was deemed &quot;unreliable&quot;. Gareth Peirce, who acted as solicitor for some of the pickets, said that the charge of riot had been used &quot;to make a public example of people, as a device to assist in breaking the strike&quot;, while Michael Mansfield called it &quot;the worst example of a mass frame-up in this country this century&quot;.

In June 1991, the SYP paid £425,000 in compensation to 39 miners for assault, wrongful arrest, unlawful detention and malicious prosecution.

Following the 2016 inquest verdict into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, previously censored documents suggesting links between the actions of senior SYP officers at both incidents were published. This led to renewed calls for a public inquiry to be held into the actions of the police at Orgreave.

In October 2016, in an Oral Answer to a Question in the House of Commons, a written ministerial statement to the House of Commons and Lords, and in a letter to the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC), Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced there would be no statutory inquiry or independent review. In 2016, Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, admitted that the SYP had been &quot;dangerously close to being used as an instrument of state&quot;.

==Background==

===Transport of coal and coke===
The Orgreave Coking Works, where coal was turned into coke for use in steel production, was regarded by National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) leader Arthur Scargill as crucial. Early in the strike, British Steel plants had been receiving &quot;dispensations&quot;, picket-permitted movements of coal to prevent damage to their furnaces. However, it was found that more than the permitted amount of coal had been delivered, so action was taken.

In the early days of the 1984–85 strike, the NUM made a decision to picket the integrated steel complexes. Scargill invoked the notion of the old &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; whereby the unions in coal, steel and rail were bound to support one another, and asked steelworkers not to handle deliveries of coal. Bill Sirs of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (ISTC) rejected such calls on the grounds that industrial action by steelworkers at the integrated complexes could incapacitate the rolling mills and billet forges, and cause job losses. Sirs stated, in defiance of Scargill, that his members would continue to handle any fuel that presented itself.

There was also some opposition within the NUM to the picketing of the steel plants, as closures in the steel industry could reduce demand for coal and lead to job losses in the coal industry. Mick McGahey, the deputy leader of the NUM, was particularly concerned about the picketing of the Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland, which he had campaigned to keep open, and negotiated agreements to maintain supplies of coal to the plant.

Picketing was largely unsuccessful at the plants of Ravenscraig, Llanwern and Port Talbot, which were all close to deep-water ports and had a range of methods of receiving coal supplies. The plant at Scunthorpe was inland and thus more vulnerable to picketing. The cokeworks at Orgreave became a target of the NUM pickets in an attempt to deny supplies of coal and coke to Scunthorpe.

An agreement between the NUM and ISTC over deliveries of 15,700 tonnes of coal per week to Scunthorpe broke down after an explosion in the Queen Mary blast furnace at the plant on 21 May 1984. It took two hours to douse the flames and a further eight hours to stop the liquid iron bursting through the brickwork. This was considered a result of the poor quality of coal supplies. Attempts by the ISTC to persuade the NUM to deliver more coal did not bring immediate results, with the divisional official Roy Bishop writing on both the physical dangers to the workers by the Queen Mary and the possibility of irreversible damage to the furnace. As the NUM did not respond immediately, British Steel decided to act quickly to find alternative supplies. The company ordered a large consignment of coal from Poland to be delivered to Flixborough, Lincolnshire, and spoke to every haulage company it had ever used to arrange for non-unionised hauliers to transport the coal. In addition, an order was made for 5,000 tonnes of top-quality coke to be delivered from Orgreave to Scunthorpe.

A sympathetic steelworker informed the Barnsley NUM of the plans on 22 May. Although there had been some picketing at Orgreave since the start of the strike, 23 May is generally considered the beginning of the major struggle between NUM pickets and the police to stop deliveries of coke from the plant. 18 June, which is often known as &quot;the Battle of Orgreave&quot;, is generally considered the end of this period.

===Changes in policing tactics===

Mass picketing had proved successful at the Battle of Saltley Gate in Saltley, Birmingham, during the 1972 miners&#x27; strike. At Saltley Coke Works, 30,000 pickets and supporters led by Scargill had faced 800 police officers, and on 10 February 1972 Sir Derrick Capper, the chief constable of Birmingham City Police, ordered the coking plant to close its gates &quot;in the interests of public safety&quot;. Closure of the Saltley works secured victory for the NUM and nine days later the Conservative government of Edward Heath agreed to meet the union&#x27;s demands.

As a direct result of Saltley, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) established the National Reporting Centre (NRC) which would be &quot;operationalised in times of industrial or political crisis [to provide] a coordinated national response to demands on policing&quot;. The NRC assumed the power – &quot;endorsed by the Home Secretary&quot; – to deploy police officers from any force in the country to areas of &quot;high tension&quot; and &quot;across force boundaries without the knowledge or consent of local police authorities&quot;. Speaking in October 1984, John Alderson, the former deputy chief constable of Dorset Police, criticised the NRC as a &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; national police&quot;. In addition, events in the early 1980s, such as the national steel strike of 1980 and the riots in inner-city areas such as Brixton and Toxteth, had led police forces to train officers to deal with mass protests differently. For example, officers during the 1981 riots had been left using dustbin lids to protect themselves from missiles, whereas the police at Orgreave had all been equipped with riot shields.

=== Riot at Maltby and death of Joe Green ===
The Battle of Orgreave came amidst events that caused tensions to escalate in the Yorkshire coalfield. In Maltby, roughly from Orgreave, a large group of young mineworkers besieged the town&#x27;s police station on Saturday, 9 June. There was a heavy police response that left the town cordoned off for several days and created local resentment.

On Friday, 15 June, an underground worker from Kellingley Colliery, Joe Green was killed while picketing. As Green was trying to dissuade lorries from delivering fuel to Ferrybridge &quot;A&quot; Power Station, he was fatally struck by a trailer.

This came after the death of David Jones in controversial circumstances at Ollerton on 15 March 1984, and also a similar incident in the 1972 strike in which picketer Freddie Matthews was killed by a lorry that mounted the pavement to cross a picket line. Speaking at a well-attended rally in nearby Wakefield on Sunday 17 June, Scargill made an impassioned plea to close Orgreave with mass picketing.

==Events==
The NUM deployed 5,000 pickets from across the UK, who planned to use sheer numbers (&quot;mass picketing&quot;) to prevent access to Orgreave by strike-breaking lorries that collected coke for use at Scunthorpe. The South Yorkshire Police (SYP) were determined not to see a repeat of 1972&#x27;s Battle of Saltley Gate – where 30,000 pickets had overwhelmed 800 police officers – and deployed around 6,000 officers from eighteen different forces at Orgreave, equipped with riot gear and supported by police dogs and 42 mounted police officers.

Robert East &quot;et al&quot;, writing in the &quot;Journal of Law and Society&quot; in 1985, suggested that rather than maintaining order and upholding the law, &quot;the police intended that Orgreave would be a &#x27;battle&#x27; where, as a result of their preparation and organisation, they would &#x27;defeat&#x27; the pickets&quot;. Michael Mansfield said: &quot;They wanted to teach the miners a lesson – a &quot;big&quot; lesson, such that they wouldn&#x27;t come out in force again.&quot; Civil liberties pressure group Liberty has said: &quot;There &quot;was&quot; a riot. But it was a police riot.&quot;

Having corralled the pickets into a field overlooking the coke works, the SYP positioned officers equipped with long riot shields at the bottom of the field and mounted police and dogs to either side. A road along one side of the field allowed the mounted police to deploy rapidly, and a railway cutting at the top of the field made retreat by the pickets difficult and dangerous. When the pickets surged forward at the arrival of the first convoy of lorries, SYP Assistant Chief Constable Anthony Clement ordered a mounted charge against them. It was &quot;a serious overreaction&quot; and the miners responded by throwing stones and other missiles at the police lines. Clement ordered two further mounted advances, and the third advance was supported by &quot;short shield&quot; snatch squads who followed the mounted police, &quot;delivering baton beatings to the unarmed miners&quot;. There followed a lull of several hours, during which many pickets left the scene. The coking plant had closed for the day and no more lorries were due to arrive. Those pickets that remained in the field were sunbathing or playing football and posed no threat to the police or the plant. By now &quot;massively outnumbering&quot; the pickets, the police advanced again and launched another mounted charge. Officers pursued the pickets out of the field and into Orgreave village, where Clement ordered a &quot;mounted police canter&quot; which Hunt describes as an &quot;out-of-control police force [charging] pickets and onlookers alike on terraced, British streets&quot;.

==Trials==
Official reports state that during the confrontation 93 arrests were made, with 51 pickets and 72 policemen injured. 95 pickets were charged with riot, unlawful assembly and similar offences after the battle. A number of these men were put on trial in 1985, but the trials collapsed, all charges were dropped and a number of lawsuits were brought against the SYP for assault, unlawful arrest and malicious prosecution. The SYP later agreed to pay £425,000 compensation and £100,000 in legal costs to 39 pickets in an out of court settlement. However, no officer was disciplined for misconduct.

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1985, Gareth Peirce said that the events at Orgreave &quot;revealed that in this country we now have a standing army available to be deployed against gatherings of civilians whose congregation is disliked by senior police officers. It is answerable to no one; it is trained in tactics which have been released to no one, but which include the deliberate maiming and injuring of innocent persons to disperse them, in complete violation of the law.&quot;

==Calls for official inquiry==
Mansfield described the evidence given by the SYP as &quot;the biggest frame-up ever&quot;. He said that the force had a culture of fabricating evidence which was not corrected by the time of the Hillsborough disaster. After the 2012 report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, NUM leader Chris Kitchen called for the investigation into the force&#x27;s practices to be widened to cover the Orgreave clashes. Also in 2012, the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC) was formed to campaign for a public inquiry into the policing of the events of 18 June 1984, following the success of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. In October 2012, a BBC One regional news and current affairs programme, &quot;Inside Out&quot;, broadcast a 30-minute film about the events at Orgreave. The programme reexamined the evidence that the SYP had deliberately attempted to co-ordinate arrest statements in order to charge the miners with riot.
Following the programme, the SYP referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

In June 2015, the IPCC announced that it would not launch a formal investigation into the events at Orgreave because too much time had passed. A Labour MP, Helen Jones, responded in the House of Commons by expressing her &quot;deep concern&quot;, saying that the decision &quot;calls into question whether the IPCC is fit for purpose&quot;.

Labour MS Mick Antoniw, who represented several Welsh miners charged with offences at Orgreave, said the miners were &quot;surrounded on all sides by police horses and police dogs and then savagely attacked by charge after charge of baton-wielding police officers on horseback. Despite public calls at that time for an investigation, no inquiry ever took place. The tragedy of this failure is that not only have those miners who were arrested been denied the justice and vindication that would come from such an inquiry it meant that an early opportunity to investigate the culture and operation of the South Yorkshire Police never took place.&quot;

In September 2016, Mike Freeman, a retired detective superintendent with Greater Manchester Police who had been a sergeant at Orgreave, told how the SYP pre-arranged a system whereby officers who made arrests would not – contrary to established police procedure – be responsible for their prisoners and write out statements detailing the arrest, but instead hand over prisoners at a reception point, return to the picket line, and at the end of the operation simply sign statements which had been pre-prepared by other officers not involved in the arrest. Freeman said that he had &quot;never encountered it before or since&quot; and &quot;I knew in my own mind that was wrong, and I can clearly remember saying to colleagues that I was with that day, &#x27;I will not be making an arrest on that operation&#x27;, and I didn&#x27;t.&quot; Another officer said that he and colleagues at Orgreave had been instructed by a superior officer not to write anything in their pocketbooks, a practice controversially repeated by the SYP at Hillsborough in 1989. It was a disciplinary offence not to write in their pocketbooks, which were considered &quot;contemporaneous notes&quot; and &quot;very difficult to amend without it being obvious, and therefore persuasive, credible evidence in a courtroom&quot;.

In October 2016, a former Merseyside Police officer who was present at Orgreave told BBC journalist Dan Johnson that at a briefing before the confrontation senior SYP officers were &quot;anticipating trouble and in some ways relishing it and looking forward to it&quot;. He said that the police support units had been given &quot;a licence to do what we wanted&quot; and were ordered to charge &quot;a largely peaceful crowd&quot;. Of the violence that followed, he said: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing. I was just seeing police officers attack people. These were people on the ground and even if they weren&#x27;t doing anything – just walking away – police officers had their batons and they were just hitting people.&quot; A number of police officers had removed the identification numbers on their uniforms, as illustrated in an iconic photograph taken on the day by Martin Jenkinson.

The campaign for an inquiry gained more coverage following revelations about corruption in the SYP during the Hillsborough disaster. Wakefield Metropolitan District Council became the first council in the UK to fly the flag of the OTJC in June 2016, whilst other councils in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire were considering the same action.

==Media coverage==
Footage of the confrontation was filmed by a crew from the BBC. When this appeared on that evening&#x27;s news bulletins, it was edited and broadcast out of chronological sequence, showing pickets throwing stones at the police and the police subsequently carrying out a mounted charge. This corresponded with the narrative given by the police that the decision to use horses was necessary to stop the stone throwing, and was only taken after the police had been subjected to a sustained barrage of missiles. Video taken by the police&#x27;s own cameramen and footage recorded by filmmaker Yvette Vanson demonstrated that the reverse was true, and that the stone throwing had been a response to the unprovoked first mounted charge. In July 1991 the BBC said:

Tony Benn challenged this explanation, stating that he had spoken to BBC staff shortly after the broadcast who &quot;were up in arms as they could see quite clearly that the police charge[d] and &quot;then&quot; the miners throw stones [but they] were ordered to transpose the order in such a way as to give the opposite impression&quot;. Benn said: &quot;They didn&#x27;t make a mistake ... Whoever gave the orders actually destroyed the truth of what they reported.&quot;

Independent Television News (ITN) also filmed the events, and part of their news bulletin that evening showed a policeman standing over a prone picket and repeatedly striking him in the head with his baton. The picket was beaten unconscious and the policeman&#x27;s baton broke in half. In the BBC&#x27;s report, filmed from the same vantage point, the footage was cut just before the policeman began beating the picket. In 2014, a spokesman for the BBC claimed that the crew had &quot;failed to record some of the violence due to a camera error&quot;.

At an internal BBC meeting held on 19 June 1984, Peter Woon, the editor of BBC News, said there was &quot;a general feeling in the newsroom&quot; that the previous day&#x27;s coverage of Orgreave had displayed &quot;a marginal imbalance&quot;, while Alan Protheroe, the assistant director general of the BBC, admitted that &quot;the BBC&#x27;s early evening coverage of Orgreave might not have been wholly impartial&quot;. In 2009, Nicholas Jones, a former BBC journalist, said: &quot;I got ensnared by the seeming inevitability of the Thatcherite storyline that the mineworkers had to be defeated in order to smash trade union militancy.&quot; Jones said that the media may have been guilty of &quot;a collective failure of judgment&quot;, and if its &quot;near-unanimous narrative had not been so hostile to the NUM and had done more to challenge government then Thatcher may have been forced to reach a negotiated settlement during the initial phase of the dispute&quot;. Geoffrey Goodman, a former industrial editor for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, said that &quot;the dominant media account&quot; had been &quot;hostile&quot; to the strikers, &quot;with much of the UK&#x27;s mainstream media willingly &#x27;marshalled by Downing Street to provide the propaganda that helped defeat the miners.

==Analysis==
Paul Routledge, a journalist and biographer of Arthur Scargill, suggested that the National Coal Board (NCB) had used the Orgreave dispute as a diversionary tactic to concentrate pickets in one location and relieve the pressure of policing working pits in Nottinghamshire. He writes that Kevin Hunt, the NCB director of industrial relations, had asked Scargill in advance if he would allow more tonnage to be allowed out of Orgreave, which led Scargill to believe that Orgreave was a pressure point that he should target. The picketing of working pits in Nottinghamshire lost momentum after Orgreave, partly because many pickets were given bail conditions after being arrested, and the number of strikers in Nottinghamshire decreased.

Ian MacGregor, Chairman of the NCB, wrote in his biography, &quot;It [Orgreave] became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for Scargill, a fight he had to win. We were quite encouraged that he thought it so important and did everything we could to help him continue to think so, but the truth was that it hardly mattered a jot to us – beyond the fact that it kept him out of Nottingham.&quot;

David Hart, a right-wing political activist and adviser to MacGregor, the NCB, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, claimed that Orgreave was &quot;a set-up by us&quot;. He said in a 1993 interview, &quot;The coke was of no interest whatsoever. We didn&#x27;t need it. It was a battleground of our choosing on grounds of our choosing. I don&#x27;t think that Scargill believes that even today. The fact is that it was a set-up and it worked brilliantly.&quot; Following his comments, senior managers from the NCB denied these claims and threatened Hart with disassociation. John Alderson, in &quot;Principled Policing: Protecting the Public with Integrity&quot; (1998), wrote that if MacGregor and Hart&#x27;s claims were true, the &quot;conspiracy to draw the miners into mass pickets and predictable violent conflict between the police and themselves&quot; constituted a &quot;deceit... tantamount to incitement&quot;.

Inside the NUM the failure of the mass picketing tactic led some in the regional union leadership, especially those influenced by the Eurocommunist wing of the Communist Party of Great Britain in Scotland and South Wales, to turn towards a &quot;cultural politics&quot; approach of building a mass movement in the country to support, through solidarity and practical help, the striking miners and to force a political concession from the government. The rejection of the &quot;militant labourism&quot; of Scargill this represented was and remains an area of controversy and dispute in the wider Labour Movement in Britain.

==In culture==

In 2001, conceptual artist Jeremy Deller originated and set in motion the idea of a re-enactment of the event as an arts project, commissioned by British arts organisation Artangel, with the recreations scripted and staged by historical re-enactment events company EventPlan Limited. The event took place on 17 June 2001 and was filmed by film director Mike Figgis for a Channel 4 documentary. The re-enactment featured 800 people including 280 local residents, a number of people (police and pickets) from the original encounter and 520 re-enactors from various groups such as The Sealed Knot, Legio II Augusta (Romans), The Vikings (reenactment), War of the Roses and English Civil War Society, but with authentic 1980s clothing and techniques. Only the railway crossing was omitted from the re-enactment, on safety grounds.

The Dire Straits song &quot;Iron Hand&quot; from the 1991 album &quot;On Every Street&quot; tells the story of the event.

The Manic Street Preachers song &quot;30-Year War&quot; from &quot;Rewind the Film&quot; mentions the event as an instance of class conflict.

In the video for his song &quot;Sirens&quot;, Dizzee Rascal is chased by huntsmen through the fictional &#x27;Orgreave Estate&#x27;.

Irvine Welsh&#x27;s &quot;Skagboys&quot; opens with a journal entry detailing the lead character Mark Renton&#x27;s experience at The Battle of Orgreave.

The confrontations at Orgreave form a substantial part of David Peace&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;GB84&quot;.

Orgreave is subject of protest art prints by British artist Darren Coffield.

The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign has been involved in a number of fundraising and commemorative activities in 2014 and 2015, including live concerts and a fundraising double-CD compilation album, containing (in part) musical and spoken-word tracks relating to the events.

<doc id="213070" wikidata="Q207122" url="?curid=213070" title="Artificial insemination">
<text>Artificial insemination is the deliberate introduction of sperm into a female&#x27;s cervix or uterine cavity for the purpose of achieving a pregnancy through in vivo fertilization by means other than sexual intercourse. It is a fertility treatment for humans, and is a common practice in animal breeding, including dairy cattle (see frozen bovine semen) and pigs.

Artificial insemination may employ assisted reproductive technology, sperm donation and animal husbandry techniques. Artificial insemination techniques available include intracervical insemination (ICI) and intrauterine insemination (IUI). Where gametes from a third party are used, the procedure may be known as &#x27;assisted insemination&#x27;.

==Humans==
===History===
The first recorded case of artificial insemination was John Hunter in 1790, who helped impregnate a linen draper&#x27;s wife. The first reported case of artificial insemination by donor occurred in 1884: William H. Pancoast, a professor in Philadelphia, took sperm from his &quot;best looking&quot; student to inseminate an anesthetized woman without her knowledge. The case was reported 25 years later in a medical journal. The sperm bank was developed in Iowa starting in the 1950s in research conducted by University of Iowa medical school researchers Jerome K. Sherman and Raymond Bunge.

In the United Kingdom, the British obstetrician Mary Barton founded one of the first fertility clinics to offer donor insemination in the 1930s, with her husband Bertold Wiesner fathering hundreds of offspring.

In the 1980s, direct intraperitoneal insemination (DIPI) was occasionally used, where doctors injected sperm into the lower abdomen through a surgical hole or incision, with the intention of letting them find the oocyte at the ovary or after entering the genital tract through the ostium of the fallopian tube.

===Patients and gamete donors===

There are multiple methods used to obtain the semen necessary for artificial insemination, and the sperm used in artificial insemination may be provided by the recipient patient&#x27;s partner or by a sperm donor whose identity is known or unknown. 

Artificial insemination techniques were originally used mainly to assist heterosexual couples to conceive where they were having difficulties, but with the advancement of techniques in this field, notably ICSI, the use of artificial insemination for such couples has largely been rendered unnecessary. However, there are still reasons why a couple would seek to use artificial insemination using the male partner&#x27;s sperm. In the case of such couples, before artificial insemination is turned to as the solution, doctors will require an examination of both the male and female involved in order to remove any and all physical hindrances that are preventing them from naturally achieving a pregnancy including any factors which prevent the couple from having satisfactory sexual intercourse. The couple is also given a fertility test to determine the motility, number, and viability of the male&#x27;s sperm and the success of the female&#x27;s ovulation. From these tests, the doctor may or may not recommend a form of artificial insemination. The results of investigations may, for example, show that the woman&#x27;s immune system may be rejecting her partner&#x27;s sperm as invading molecules. Women who have issues with the cervix – such as cervical scarring, cervical blockage from endometriosis, or thick cervical mucus – may also benefit from artificial insemination, since the sperm must pass through the cervix to result in fertilization. 

Nowadays artificial insemination in humans is mainly used as a substitute for sexual intercourse for women without a male partner who wish to have their own children—such as women in lesbian relationships and single women—and thus where sperm from a sperm donor is used. 

==== Barriers for patients and donors ====
Some countries have laws which restrict and regulate who can donate sperm and who is able to receive artificial insemination. Some women who live in a jurisdiction which does not permit artificial insemination in the circumstance in which she finds herself may travel to another jurisdiction which permits it. Compared with natural insemination, artificial insemination can be more expensive and more invasive, and may require professional assistance.

===Preparations===
Timing is critical, as the window and opportunity for fertilization is little more than twelve hours from the release of the ovum. To increase the chance of success, the woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle is closely observed, often using ovulation kits, ultrasounds or blood tests, such as basal body temperature tests over, noting the color and texture of the vaginal mucus, and the softness of the nose of her cervix. To improve the success rate of artificial insemination, drugs to create a stimulated cycle may be used, but the use of such drugs also results in an increased chance of a multiple birth.

Sperm can be provided fresh or washed. Washed sperm is required in certain situations. Pre- and post-concentration of motile sperm is counted. Sperm from a sperm bank will be frozen and quarantined for a period, and the donor will be tested before and after production of the sample to ensure that he does not carry a transmissible disease. Sperm from a sperm bank will also be suspended in a semen extender which assists with freezing, storing and shipping.

If sperm is provided by a private donor, either directly or through a sperm agency, it is usually supplied fresh, not frozen, and it will not be quarantined. Donor sperm provided in this way may be given directly to the recipient woman or her partner, or it may be transported in specially insulated containers. Some donors have their own freezing apparatus to freeze and store their sperm.

===Techniques===

Semen used is either fresh, raw, or frozen. Where donor sperm is supplied by a sperm bank, it will always be quarantined and frozen, and will need to be thawed before use. The sperm is ideally donated after two or three days of abstinence, without lubrication as the lubricant can inhibit the sperm motility. When an ovum is released, semen is introduced into the woman&#x27;s vagina, uterus or cervix, depending on the method being used.

Sperm is occasionally inserted twice within a &#x27;treatment cycle&#x27;.

====Intracervical====
Intracervical insemination (ICI) is the method of artificial insemination which most closely mimics the natural ejaculation of semen by the penis into the vagina during sexual intercourse. It is painless and is the simplest, easiest and most common method of artificial insemination involving the introduction of unwashed or raw semen into the vagina at the entrance to the cervix, usually by means of a needleless syringe. The vagina acts as a filter to separate out the sperm from other chemicals in the ejaculate, as with intercourse, so that only sperm pass through the cervix on their way to the uterus.

ICI is commonly used in the home, by self-insemination and practitioner insemination. Sperm used in ICI inseminations does not have to be &#x27;washed&#x27; to remove seminal fluid so that raw semen from a private donor may be used. Semen supplied by a sperm bank prepared for ICI or IUI use is suitable for ICI. ICI is a popular method of insemination amongst single and lesbian women purchasing donor sperm on-line.

Although ICI is the simplest method of artificial insemination, a meta-analysis has shown no difference in live birth rates compared with IUI. It may also be performed privately by the woman, or, if she has a partner, in the presence of her partner, or by her partner. ICI was previously used in many fertility centers as a method of insemination, but its popularity in this context has waned as other, more reliable methods of insemination have become available.

During ICI, air is expelled from a needleless syringe which is then filled with semen which has been allowed to liquify. A specially-designed syringe, wider and with a more rounded end, may be used for this purpose. Any further enclosed air is removed by gently pressing the plunger forward. The woman lies on her back and the syringe is inserted into the vagina. Care is optimal when inserting the syringe, so that the tip is as close to the entrance to the cervix as possible. A vaginal speculum may be used for this purpose and a catheter may be attached to the tip of the syringe to ensure delivery of the semen as close to the entrance to the cervix as possible. The plunger is then slowly pushed forward and the semen in the syringe is gently emptied deep into the vagina. It is important that the syringe is emptied slowly for safety and for the best results, bearing in mind that the purpose of the procedure is to replicate as closely as possible a natural deposit of the semen in the vagina. The syringe (and catheter if used) may be left in place for several minutes before removal. The woman can bring herself to orgasm so that the cervix &#x27;dips down&#x27; into the pool of semen, again replicating closely vaginal intercourse, and this may improve the success rate.

Following insemination, fertile sperm will swim through the cervix into the uterus and from there to the fallopian tubes in a natural way as if the sperm had been deposited in the vagina through intercourse. The woman is therefore advised to lie still for about half-an-hour to assist conception.

One insemination during a cycle is usually sufficient. Additional inseminations during the same cycle may not improve the chances of a pregnancy.

Ordinary sexual lubricants should not be used in the process, but special fertility or &#x27;sperm-friendly&#x27; lubricants can be used for increased ease and comfort.

When performed at home without the presence of a professional, aiming the sperm in the vagina at the neck of the cervix may be more difficult to achieve and the effect may be to &#x27;flood&#x27; the vagina with semen, rather than to target it specifically at the entrance to the cervix. This procedure is sometimes referred to as &#x27;intravaginal insemination&#x27; (IVI). Sperm supplied by a sperm bank will be frozen and must be allowed to thaw before insemination. The sealed end of the straw itself must be cut off and the open end of the straw is usually fixed straight on to the tip of the syringe, allowing the contents to be drawn into the syringe. Sperm from more than one straw can generally be used in the same syringe. Where fresh semen is used, this must be allowed to liquefy before inserting it into the syringe, or alternatively, the syringe may be back-loaded.

A conception cap, which is a form of conception device, may be inserted into the vagina following insemination and may be left in place for several hours. Using this method, a woman may go about her usual activities while the cervical cap holds the semen in the vagina close to the entrance to the cervix. Advocates of this method claim that it increases the chances of conception. One advantage with the conception device is that fresh, non-liquefied semen may be used. The man may ejaculate straight into the cap so that his fresh semen can be inserted immediately into the vagina without waiting for it to liquefy, although a collection cup may also be used. Other methods may be used to insert semen into the vagina notably involving different uses of a conception cap. These include a specially designed conception cap with a tube attached which may be inserted empty into the vagina after which liquefied semen is poured into the tube. These methods are designed to ensure that semen is inseminated as close as possible to the cervix and that it is kept in place there to increase the chances of conception.

====Intrauterine====
Intrauterine insemination (IUI) involves injection of &#x27;washed&#x27; sperm directly into the uterus with a catheter. Washing involves the removal of chemicals other than sperm which are in the natural ejaculate. In forms of vaginal insemination, including artificial vaginal insemination and ICI, these chemicals will be filtered out by the vagina. Insemination in this way also means that the sperm do not have to swim through the cervix which is coated with a mucus layer. This layer of mucus can slow down the passage of sperm and can result in many sperm perishing before they can enter the uterus. Donor sperm is sometimes tested for mucus penetration if it is to be used for ICI inseminations but partner sperm may or may not be able to pass through the cervix. In these cases, the use of IUI can provide a more efficient delivery of the sperm. In general terms, IUI is usually regarded as more efficient than ICI or IVI. It is therefore the method of choice for single and lesbian women wishing to conceive using donor sperm since this group of recipients usually require artificial insemination because they do not have a male partner, not because they have medical problems. Owing to the high number of these recipients using donor sperm services, IUI is therefore the most popular method of insemination today at a fertility clinic. The term &#x27;artificial insemination&#x27; has, in many cases, come to mean IUI insemination.

It is important that washed sperm is used because unwashed sperm may elicit uterine cramping, expelling the semen and causing pain, due to content of prostaglandins. (Prostaglandins are also the compounds responsible for causing the myometrium to contract and expel the menses from the uterus, during menstruation.) Resting on the table for fifteen minutes after an IUI is optimal for the woman to increase the pregnancy rate.

Using this technique, as with ICI, fertilization takes place naturally in the external part of the fallopian tubes in the same way that occurs following intercourse.

For heterosexual couples, the indications to perform an intrauterine insemination are usually a moderate male factor, the incapability to ejaculate in vagina and an idiopathic infertility. A short period of ejaculatory abstinence before intrauterine insemination is associated with higher pregnancy rates. For the man, a TMS of more than 5 million per ml is optimal. In practice, donor sperm will satisfy these criteria and since IUI is a more efficient method of artificial insemination than ICI and, because of its generally higher success rate, IUI is usually the insemination procedure of choice for single women and lesbians using donor semen in a fertility centre. Lesbians and single women are less likely to have fertility issues of their own and enabling donor sperm to be inserted directly into the womb will often produce a better chance of conceiving. A 2019 showed that pregnancy rates were similar between lesbian women and heterosexual women undergoing IUI. However, it was found that there is a significantly higher multiple gestation rate among lesbian women undergoing ovulation induction (OI) when compared to lesbian women undergoing natural cycles.

Unlike ICI, intrauterine insemination normally requires a medical practitioner to perform the procedure. One of the requirements is to have at least one permeable tube, proved by hysterosalpingography. The infertility duration is also important. A female under 30 years of age has optimal chances with IUI; A promising cycle is one that offers two follicles measuring more than 16 mm, and estrogen of more than 500 pg/mL on the day of hCG administration. However, GnRH agonist administration at the time of implantation does not improve pregnancy outcome in intrauterine insemination cycles according to a randomized controlled trial. One of the prominent private clinic in Europe has published a data A multiple logistic regression model showed that sperm origin, maternal age, follicle count at hCG administration day, follicle rupture, and the number of uterine contractions observed after the second insemination procedure were associated with the live-birth rate
The steps to follow in order to perform an intrauterine insemination are:
* Mild controlled ovarian stimulation (COS): there is no control of how many oocytes are at the same time when stimulating ovulation. For that reason, it is necessary to check the amount being ovulated via ultrasound (checking the amount of follicles developing at the same time) and administering the desired amount of hormones.
* Ovulation induction: using substances known as ovulation inductors.
* Semen capacitation: wash and centrifugation, swim-up, or gradient. The insemination should not be performed later than an hour after capacitation. &#x27;Washed sperm&#x27; may be purchased directly from a sperm bank if donor semen is used, or &#x27;unwashed semen&#x27; may be thawed and capacitated before performing IUI insemination, provided that the capacitation leaves a minimum of, usually, five million motile sperm.
* Luteal phase support: a lack of progesterone in the endometrium could end a pregnancy. To avoid that 200 mg/day of micronized progesterone are administered via vagina. If there is pregnancy, this hormone is kept administering until the tenth week of pregnancy.
The cost breakdown for Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) involves several components. The procedure itself typically ranges from $300 to $1,000 per cycle without insurance. The cost of the sperm may vary widely, with prices per vial ranging from $500 to $1,000 or more from a sperm bank. Additional expenses might include consultation fees, ovulation-inducing medication, ultrasounds, and blood tests.

The extent of insurance coverage for fertility treatments, including Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), varies considerably. Some insurance plans may cover some of the costs, while others may not provide any financial support for fertility treatments. Coverage depends on various factors, such as the insurance plan, state policies and regulations, and the underlying cause of infertility. Several states have mandated insurers to provide coverage for infertility services.

IUI can be used in conjunction with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Clomiphene Citrate is the first line, Letrozole is second line, in order to stimulate ovaries before moving on to IVF. Still, advanced maternal age causes decreased success rates; women aged 38–39 years appear to have reasonable success during the first two cycles of ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI. However, for women aged over 40 years, there appears to be no benefit after a single cycle of COH/IUI. Medical experts therefore recommend considering in vitro fertilization after one failed COH/IUI cycle for women aged over 40 years.

A double intrauterine insemination theoretically increases pregnancy rates by decreasing the risk of missing the fertile window during ovulation. However, a randomized trial of insemination after ovarian hyperstimulation found no difference in live birth rate between single and double intrauterine insemination. A Cochrane found uncertain evidence about the effect of IUI compared with timed intercourse or expectant management on live birth rates but IUI with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is probably better than expectant management.

Due to the lack of reliable evidence from controlled clinical trials, it is not certain which semen preparation techniques are more effective (wash and centrifugation; swim-up; or gradient) in terms of pregnancy and live birth rates.

Intrauterine insemination success factors

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedures have shown to be more successful and effective with certain factors taken into account. One major factor is the health of the sperm that is used. Sperm motility, which is improved by the sperm washing procedure, sperm density, and the sperm concentration index, all of which are found through washing and studying of the health of the specimen, are major indicators of a positive pregnancy test following IUI. 

The age of both the male and female (egg and sperm donors) involved in the process are extremely important. Although age has typically been pinned on the women as a determining factor, research shows that both male and female age has about equal impact on the success of the procedure. Along with age, the duration of fertility is also found to be a factor in IUI success, the longer one faces infertility, the lower the chance of a positive pregnancy test occurring. When people talk about age as a risk factor, they are generally speaking to the way in which the DNA in the eggs and sperm have increased probabilities of mutations.

Lastly, the biological factors of the female’s body can have some impact on the success of the IUI procedure. The endometrial thickness at time of insemination is moderately important, though less of a concern than some of the other factors. The number of follicles developed, grown, and retrieved from the ovaries during ovarian stimulation is particularly important and a major success factor in fertility treatments. And lastly, for the female partner, the estradiol concentration within the body on the day of HCG administration. 

Who IUI can be used for

Because IUI is less expensive and less invasive than other fertility options (for example, in vitro fertilisation, or IVF), it is typically the first outlet for those looking for fertility treatments. For individuals or couples who struggle with getting pregnant, but haven&#x27;t explored any fertility treatments yet, they would be good candidates for IUI. IUI provides those with a more affordable and accessible outlet for fertility treatments, however, IUI may not be the most successful option if it is determined to be female factor infertility. IUI is also a very good option for single individuals who are using donor sperm, as donor sperm undergoes regulations and checks which may not be the case for a partner sperm donation. IUI can additionally be a good fertility outlet for lesbian or queer couples as they most often do not face infertility, and would most likely be using regulated and checked donor sperm. Furthermore, surrogates can be artificially inseminated through IUI to help other individuals and/or couples become pregnant with their sperm.

====Intrauterine tuboperitoneal====
Intrauterine tuboperitoneal insemination (IUTPI) involves injection of washed sperm into both the uterus and fallopian tubes. The cervix is then clamped to prevent leakage to the vagina, best achieved with a specially designed double nut bivalve (DNB) speculum. The sperm is mixed to create a volume of 10 ml, sufficient to fill the uterine cavity, pass through the interstitial part of the tubes and the ampulla, finally reaching the peritoneal cavity and the Pouch of Douglas where it would be mixed with the peritoneal and follicular fluid. IUTPI can be useful in unexplained infertility, mild or moderate male infertility, and mild or moderate endometriosis. In non-tubal sub fertility, fallopian tube sperm perfusion may be the preferred technique over intrauterine insemination.

====Intratubal====
Intratubal insemination (ITI) involves injection of washed sperm into the fallopian tube, although this procedure is no longer generally regarded as having any beneficial effect compared with IUI. ITI however, should not be confused with gamete intrafallopian transfer, where both eggs and sperm are mixed outside the woman&#x27;s body and then immediately inserted into the fallopian tube where fertilization takes place.

====LGBTQ+ concerns====
Although many fertilization procedures, such as IUI are typically carried out in a medical setting, society is increasingly recognizing the important role that this plays in the lives of individuals who might otherwise not conceive through heterosexual penetrative sexual intercourse. Artificial insemination using a sperm donor for LGBTQ+ individuals and couples is one of the more cost-effective avenues to parenting. While clinic based IUI may be open to many, it typically still includes hetero-reproductive narratives which dates from the early days of fertilization procedures when these were often exclusively for married couples and when there was a resistance in many societies to extend these services to the LGBTQ+ community. Indeed, in the early days, there were very few fertility clinics which would provide services to single women and lesbian couples. In the UK, notable pioneers in this respect were the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) and the Pregnancy Advisory Service (PAS), both of which operated before statutory control of fertility services in 1992, and the London Women&#x27;s Clinic (LWC) which provided artificial insemination to single women and lesbians from 1998. Most donor insemination procedures undertaken in many countries today are for lesbian couples or single mainly lesbian women, yet much of their rhetoric and advertising is directed at heterosexual couples. Indeed, many sperm banks seem reluctant to inform donors that most of their donations will be used for lesbians and single women. 
To improve the way society talks about and carries out donor insemination inclusive language may be used. One way to do this is to bring LGBTQ narratives into this process, with a particular emphasis on this being a family-centered process. Even in a medical setting, it is important to bring intimacy and family-centeredness into this process, as this promotes connectedness and inclusiveness in what can be seen as a hostile and discriminatory environment. LGBTQ couples or individuals typically have to navigate more complexities and barriers than heterosexual couples when undergoing fertility treatment, such as stigma and carrier decisions, so allowing room for intimacy and connectedness in the process can improve the experience for individuals, reduce stress, and minimize barriers that target marginalized individuals.

Lesbian couples may either select a friend or family member as their sperm donor or choose an anonymous donor. After a sperm donor is selected, a couple can proceed with donor sperm IUI. IUI is an economic option for same-sex couples and can be done without the use of medication. According to a study from 2021, lesbian women undergoing IUI had an average clinical pregnancy rate of 13.2% per cycle and 42.2% success rate giving the average number of cycles at 3.6.

===Pregnancy rate===
The rates of successful pregnancy for artificial insemination are 10-15% per menstrual cycle using ICI, and 15–20% per cycle for IUI. In IUI, about 60 to 70% have achieved pregnancy after 6 cycles.

However, these pregnancy rates may be very misleading, since many factors have to be included to give a meaningful answer, e.g. definition of success and calculation of the total population. These rates can be influenced by age, overall reproductive health, and if the patient had an orgasm during the insemination. The literature is conflicting on immobilization after insemination has increasing the chances of pregnancy. Previous data suggests that it is statistically significant for the patient to remain immobile for 15 minutes after insemination, while another review article claims that it is not. A point of consideration, is that it does cost the patient or healthcare system to remain immobile for 15 minutes if it does increase the chances. For couples with unexplained infertility, unstimulated IUI is no more effective than natural means of conception.

The pregnancy rate also depends on the total sperm count, or, more specifically, the total motile sperm count (TMSC), used in a cycle. The success rate increases with increasing TMSC, but only up to a certain count, when other factors become limiting to success. The summed pregnancy rate of two cycles using a TMSC of 5 million (may be a TSC of ~10 million on graph) in each cycle is substantially higher than one single cycle using a TMSC of 10 million. However, although more cost-efficient, using a lower TMSC also increases the average time taken to achieve pregnancy. Women whose age is becoming a major factor in fertility may not want to spend that extra time.

===Samples per child===
The number of samples (ejaculates) required to give rise to a child varies substantially from person to person, as well as from clinic to clinic. However, the following equations generalize the main factors involved:

For intracervical insemination:
:formula_1
* &quot;N&quot; is how many children a single sample can give rise to.
* &quot;V&quot;&quot;s&quot; is the volume of a sample (ejaculate), usually between 1.0 mL and 6.5 mL
* &quot;c&quot; is the concentration of motile sperm in a sample &quot;after freezing and thawing&quot;, approximately 5–20 million per ml but varies substantially
* &quot;r&quot;&quot;s&quot; is the pregnancy rate per cycle, between 10% and 35% 
* &quot;n&quot;&quot;r&quot; is the total motile sperm count recommended for vaginal insemination (VI) or intra-cervical insemination (ICI), approximately 20 million pr. ml.
The pregnancy rate increases with increasing number of motile sperm used, but only up to a certain degree, when other factors become limiting instead.

With these numbers, one sample would on average help giving rise to 0.1–0.6 children, that is, it actually takes on average 2–5 samples to make a child.

For intrauterine insemination, a &quot;centrifugation fraction&quot; (&quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot;) may be added to the equation:
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot; is the fraction of the volume that remains after centrifugation of the sample, which may be about half (0.5) to a third (0.33).

:formula_2

On the other hand, only 5 million motile sperm may be needed per cycle with IUI (&quot;n&quot;&quot;r&quot;=5 million)

Thus, only 1–3 samples may be needed for a child if used for IUI.

===Social implications===
One of the key issues arising from the rise of dependency on assisted reproductive technology (ARTs) is the pressure placed on couples to conceive, &quot;where children are highly desired, parenthood is culturally mandatory, and childlessness socially unacceptable&quot;.

The medicalization of infertility creates a framework in which individuals are encouraged to think of infertility quite negatively. In many cultures donor insemination is religiously and culturally prohibited, often meaning that less accessible &quot;high tech&quot; and expensive ARTs, like IVF, are the only solution.

An over-reliance on reproductive technologies in dealing with infertility prevents many – especially, for example, in the &quot;infertility belt&quot; of central and southern Africa – from dealing with many of the key causes of infertility treatable by artificial insemination techniques; namely preventable infections, dietary and lifestyle influences.

If good records are not kept, the offspring when grown up risk accidental incest.

=== Risk factors ===
The risk factors of artificial insemination are comparatively low to other forms of fertility treatment. The most prominent risk factor would be infection after the procedure, with other risk factors including a higher risk of having twins or triplets, and minor vaginal bleeding during the procedure.

Although these risk factors are minor and generally manageable, there is a significant knowledge gap between identity groups around risk factors for fertility treatments in general. For instance, it was found that LGBTQ+ individuals had &quot;had significant knowledge gaps of risk factors associated with reproductive outcomes when compared to heterosexual female peers.&quot; Therefore, it is imperative that providers take extra care in educating their LGBTQ+ patients on potential risk factors of artificial insemination. The implications of this knowledge gap between LGTBQ+ individuals and their heterosexual counterparts are serious and worth noting. Lack of access to proper information and risk factors around procedures like these may dissuade someone from pursuing these procedures altogether. As a result, there will be less normalization of LGBTQ+ family making and reproduction, which only perpetuates this cycle of lack of information among LGBTQ+ folks.

=== Legal restrictions ===
Some countries restrict artificial insemination in a variety of ways. For example, some countries do not permit AI for single women, and other countries do not permit the use of donor sperm.

As of May 2013, the following European countries permit medically assisted AI for single women:

* Belarus
* Belgium
* Britain
* Bulgaria
* Denmark
* Estonia
* Finland
* Germany
* Greece
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Ireland
* Latvia
* Moldova
* Montenegro
* Netherlands
* North Macedonia
* Romania
* Russia
* Spain
* Ukraine
* Armenia
* Cyprus


==== Law in the United States ====
History of Law Around Artificial Insemination

Artificial insemination used to be seen as adultery and was illegal until the 1960s when states started recognizing the child born from artificial insemination as legitimate. Once the children began to be recognized as legitimate, legal questions around who the parents of the child are, how to handle surrogacy, paternity rights, and eventually artificial insemination and LGBT+ parents began to arise. Prior to the use of artificial insemination, the legal parents of a child were the two people who conceived the child or the person who birthed the child and their legal spouse, but artificial insemination complicates the legal process of becoming a parent as well as who is the parent of the child. Deciding who the parents of the child are is the largest legal predicament around artificial insemination. However, questions around surrogacy and donor&#x27;s rights also appear as a side question to determining the parent(s). Some major cases that deal with artificial insemination and parental rights are, &quot;K.M v E.G, Johnson v Calvert, Matter of Baby M,&quot; and &quot;In Re K.M.H.&quot;

Legal Parental Relations and Artificial Insemination

When children are conceived the traditional way, there is little discrepancy around who the legal parents of the child are. However, because children conceived using artificial insemination may not be genetically related to one or more of their parents, who the legal parents of the child are can come into question. Prior to the passage of the Uniform Parentage Act in 1973, children conceived via artificial insemination were deemed as “illegitimate” children. The Uniform Parentage Act then recognized the children born from artificial insemination as legal and laid precedent for how the legal parents of the child were decided. However, this act only applied to the children of those married couples. It established that the person who birthed the child was the mother and the father would be the husband of the woman. In 2002, the Uniform Parentage Act, which is adopted individually on a state by state basis, was revised to address non married couples and states that an unmarried couple has the same rights to the child that a married couple would. This extended who has the right to be a parent to a man who would supposedly fill in the social role as a “father.” There were now numerous ways to establish parental rights for both the mother and the father depending on if the child was born using a sperm donor or a surrogate. Currently, a revised version of the Uniform Parentage Act is starting to be passed in a few states that expands how parental relations can be determined. This bill includes expanding “father” to mean any person who would fill the role of a father, regardless of their gender and “mother” is expanded to anyone who gives birth to the child regardless of gender. In addition, this act would also change any language of “husband” or “wife” to “spouse.”

===== &quot;Paternity rights&quot; =====
There is no federal law that applies to all fifty states when it comes to artificial insemination and paternity rights, but the Uniform Parentage Act is a model which many states have adopted. Under the 1973 UPA, married heterosexual couples making use of artificial insemination through a licensed physician could list the husband as the natural father of the child, rather than the sperm donor. Since then a revised version of the Act has been introduced, though to less widespread adoption

Generally paternity is not an issue when artificial insemination is between a married woman and an anonymous donor. Most states provide that anonymous donors&#x27; paternity claims are not recognized, and most sperm donation centers make use of contracts that require donors to sign away their paternity rights before they can participate. When the mother knows the donor, however, or engages in artificial insemination while unmarried, complications may arise. In cases of private sperm donation, paternity rights and responsibilities are often conferred onto sperm donors when: the donor and recipient did not comply with state laws regarding artificial insemination, the sperm donor and recipient know one another, or the donor had the intent of being a father to the child. When one or a number of these things is true, courts have at times found written agreements relinquishing parental rights to be unenforceable.

===Opposition and criticism===

==== Religious opposition ====

Some theologically buttressed arguments reject the moral validity of this practice, such as Pope John XXIII. However, according to a document of the USCCB, the intrauterine insemination (IUI) of “licitly obtained” (normal intercourse with a silastic sheath i.e. a perforated condom) but technologically prepared semen sample (washed, etc.) has been neither approved nor disapproved by Church authority and its moral validity remains under discussion. Some religious groups, such as the Catholic Church, and individuals have also criticized artificial insemination because acquiring sperm for the procedure is seen as &quot;a form of adultery promoting the vice of masturbation.&quot;

==== Other morality-based opposition ====
There are critics of artificial insemination who voice concerns regarding the potential for AI to encourage eugenicist practices through selection of particular traits. The line of reasoning follows the history of artificial insemination in breeding livestock and other domesticated animals wherein preferred traits are encouraged through human-controlled selection.

==Other animals==

Artificial insemination is used for pets, livestock, endangered species, and animals in zoos or marine parks difficult to transport.

===Reasons and techniques===

It may be used for many reasons, including to allow a male to inseminate a much larger number of females, to allow the use of genetic material from males separated by distance or time, to overcome physical breeding difficulties, to control the paternity of offspring, to synchronize births, to avoid injury incurred during natural mating, and to avoid the need to keep a male at all (such as for small numbers of females or in species whose fertile males may be difficult to manage).

Artificial insemination is much more common than natural mating, as it allows several female animals to be impregnated from a single male. For instance, up to 30-40 female pigs can be impregnated from a single boar. Workers collect the semen by masturbating the boars, then insert it into the sows via a raised catheter known as a pork stork. Boars are still physically used to excite the females prior to insemination, but are prevented from actually mating.

Semen is collected, extended, then cooled or frozen. It can be used on-site or shipped to the female&#x27;s location. If frozen, the small plastic tube holding the semen is referred to as a &quot;straw&quot;. To allow the sperm to remain viable during the time before and after it is frozen, the semen is mixed with a solution containing glycerol or other cryoprotectants. An &quot;extender&quot; is a solution that allows the semen from a donor to impregnate more females by making insemination possible with fewer sperm. Antibiotics, such as streptomycin, are sometimes added to the sperm to control some bacterial venereal diseases. Before the actual insemination, estrus may be induced through the use of progestogen and another hormone (usually PMSG or Prostaglandin F2α).

===History===

The first viviparous animal to be artificially fertilized was a dog. The experiment was conducted with success by the Italian Lazzaro Spallanzani in 1780. Another pioneer was the Russian Ilya Ivanov in 1899. In 1935, diluted semen from Suffolk sheep was flown from Cambridge in Britain to Kraków, Poland, as part of an international research project. The participants included Prawochenki (Poland), Milovanoff (USSR), Hammond and Walton (UK), and Thomasset (Uruguay).

Modern artificial insemination was pioneered by John O. Almquist of Pennsylvania State University. He improved breeding efficiency by the use of antibiotics (first proven with penicillin in 1946) to control bacterial growth, decreasing embryonic mortality, and increase fertility. This, and various new techniques for processing, freezing, and thawing of frozen semen significantly enhanced the practical utilization of artificial insemination in the livestock industry and earned him the 1981 Wolf Foundation Prize in Agriculture. Many techniques developed by him have since been applied to other species, including humans.

===Species===
Artificial insemination is used in many non-human animals, including sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, pedigree animals generally, zoo animals, turkeys and creatures as tiny as honeybees and as massive as orcas (killer whales).

Artificial insemination of farm animals is common in the developed world, especially for breeding dairy cattle (75% of all inseminations). Swine are also bred using this method (up to 85% of all inseminations). It is an economical means for a livestock breeder to improve their herds utilizing males having desirable traits.

Although common with cattle and swine, artificial insemination is not as widely practiced in the breeding of horses. A small number of equine associations in North America accept only horses that have been conceived by &quot;natural cover&quot; or &quot;natural service&quot; – the actual physical mating of a mare to a stallion – the Jockey Club being the most notable of these, as no artificial insemination is allowed in Thoroughbred breeding. Other registries such as the AQHA and warmblood registries allow registration of foals created through artificial insemination, and the process is widely used allowing the breeding of mares to stallions not resident at the same facility – or even in the same country – through the use of transported frozen or cooled semen.

In modern species conservation, semen collection and artificial insemination are used also in birds. In 2013 scientist of the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen, Germany, from the working group of Michael Lierz, Clinic for birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, developed a novel technique for semen collection and artificial insemination in parrots producing the world&#x27;s first macaw by assisted reproduction.

Scientists working with captive orcas were able to pioneer the technique in the early 2000s, resulting in &quot;the first successful conceptions, resulting in live offspring, using artificial insemination in any cetacean species&quot;. John Hargrove, a SeaWorld trainer, describes Kasatka as being the first orca to receive artificial insemination.

===Violation of rights===

Artificial insemination on animals has been criticised as a violation of animal rights, with animal rights advocates equating it with rape and arguing it constitutes institutionalized bestiality. Artificial insemination of farm animals is condemned by animal rights campaigners such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Joey Carbstrong, who identify the practice as a form of rape due to its sexual, involuntary and perceived painful nature. Animal rights organizations such as PETA and Mercy for Animals frequently write against the practice in their articles. Much of the meat production in the United States depends on artificial insemination, resulting in an explosive growth of the procedure over the past three decades. The state of Kansas makes no exceptions for artificial insemination under its bestiality law, thus making the procedure illegal.

== Criteria for benefiting from artificial insemination according to the 2021 Bioethics Law ==
According to the 2021 Bioethics Law, the criteria that must be met to benefit from artificial insemination are as follows:

# Artificial insemination can be performed using sperm from the husband or frozen sperm from an anonymous donor.
# Both spouses or the unmarried woman must consent in advance to artificial insemination or embryo transfer.
# The parenting project must be validated through a series of interviews with professionals (doctors, psychologists, etc.).
# Individuals benefiting from artificial insemination must be of reproductive age.

The 2021 Bioethics Law has expanded the scope of Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP).

<text>The Mosquito Coast (also known as the Mosquitia or Mosquito Shore) is an area along the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua and Honduras. It was named after the local Miskito Nation and was long dominated by British interests and known as the Mosquito Kingdom. From 1860 suzerainty of the area was transferred to Nicaragua with the name Mosquito Reserve, and in November 1894 the Mosquito Coast was militarily incorporated into Nicaragua. However, in 1960, the northern part was granted to Honduras by the International Court of Justice.

The Mosquito Coast was generally defined as the domain of the Miskito Kingdom and expanded or contracted with that domain. During the 19th century, the question of the kingdom&#x27;s borders was a serious issue of international diplomacy between Britain, the United States, Nicaragua, and Honduras. Conflicting claims regarding both the kingdom&#x27;s extent and arguable nonexistence were pursued in diplomatic exchanges. The British and Miskitu definition applied to the whole eastern seaboard of Nicaragua and even to La Mosquitia in Honduras: i.e., the coast region as far west as the Río Negro or Tinto.

==History==
Before the arrival of Europeans in the region, the area was divided into a large number of small, egalitarian groups, possibly speaking languages related to Sumu and Paya. Columbus visited the coast briefly in his fourth voyage. Detailed Spanish accounts of the region, however, only relate to the late 16th and early 17th centuries. According to their understanding of the geography, the region was divided between two &quot;Provinces&quot; Taguzgalpa and Tologalpa. Lists of &quot;nations&quot; left by Spanish missionaries include as many as 30 names, though careful analysis of them by Karl Offen suggests that many were duplicated and the regional geography included about a half dozen entities speaking related but distinct dialects occupying the various river basins of the region.

===Attempted Spanish settlement===
During the 16th century, Spanish authorities issued various licenses to conquer Taguzgalpa and Tologalpa in 1545, 1562, 1577, and 1594, but no evidence suggests that any of these licenses resulted in even brief settlements or conquests. The Spanish were unable to conquer this region during the 16th century and in the 17th century sought to &quot;reduce&quot; the region through missionary efforts. These included several attempts by Franciscans between 1604 and 1612; another one led by Fray Cristóbal Martinez in 1622, and a third one between 1667 and 1675. None of these efforts resulted in any lasting success.

Because the Spanish failed to have significant influence in the region, it remained independent of outside control. This allowed the native people to continue their traditional way of life and to receive visitors from other regions. English and Dutch privateers who preyed on Spanish ships soon found refuge in the Mosquito Coast.

===British contact and recognition of the Mosquito Kingdom===
Although the earliest accounts do not mention it, a political entity of uncertain organization, but probably not very stratified, which the English called the &quot;Mosquito Kingdom&quot; was present on the coast in the early seventeenth century. One of the kings of this polity visited England around 1638 at the behest of the Providence Island Company and sealed an alliance.

In subsequent years, the kingdom stood strongly against any Spanish incursions and was prepared to offer rest and asylum to any anti-Spanish groups that might come to their shores. At the very least English and French privateers and pirates did visit there, taking in water and food. A detailed account of the kingdom written by a buccaneer known only as M. W. describes its organization as being fundamentally egalitarian, with the king and some officials (usually called &quot;Captains&quot; in that period but later being more elaborate) being primarily military leaders, but only in time of war.

====Early British alliance====
The first British contacts with the Mosquito region started around 1630, when the agents of the English chartered Providence Island Company—of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer—occupied two small cays and established friendly relations with the local inhabitants. Providence Island, the company&#x27;s main base and settlement, entered into regular correspondence with the coast during the decade of company occupation, 1631–1641.

The Providence Island Company sponsored the Miskito&#x27;s &quot;King&#x27;s Son&quot; visit to England during the reign of Charles I (1625–1649). When his father died, this son returned home and placed his country under English protection. Following the capture of Providence Island by Spain in 1641, England did not possess a base close to the coast. However, shortly after the English captured Jamaica in 1655, they recommenced relations with the coast, and Oldman went to visit England. According to the testimony of his son Jeremy, taken around 1699, he was received in audience by &quot;his brother king&quot;, Charles II and was given a &quot;lac&#x27;d hat&quot; and a commission &quot;to kindly use and relieve such straggling Englishmen as should chance to come that way&quot;.

====Emergence of the Mosquitos Zambos (Miskito Sambu)====
While accounts vary, the Miskito Sambu appear to be descended from the survivors of a shipwrecked slave ship who reached this area in the mid-seventeenth century. These survivors intermarried with the local Miskito people, thereby creating a mixed-race group. They gradually adopted the language and much of the culture of their hosts. The Miskito Sambu settled near the Wanks (Coco) River. By the late 17th century, their leader held the office of general with jurisdiction over the northern portions of the Mosquito Kingdom. In the early eighteenth century, they managed to take over the office of King, which they held for at least the rest of the century.

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Miskitos Zambos began a series of raids that attacked Spanish-held territories and still independent indigenous groups in the area. Miskito raiders reached as far north as the Yucatán, and as far south as Costa Rica. They sold many of the captives they took as slaves to English or other British merchants; the slaves were transported to Jamaica to work on sugar plantations. Through such raiding, the Zambo gained a more dominant position and the king&#x27;s domain was inhabited primarily by Zambos. They also assisted the government of Jamaica in hunting down Maroons in the 1720s.

====Sociopolitical system====
Although English accounts referred to the area as a &quot;kingdom&quot;, it was relatively loosely organized. A description of the kingdom written in 1699, notes that it occupied discontinuous areas along the coast. It probably did not include a number of settlements of English traders. Although English accounts refer as well to various noble titles, Miskito social structure does not appear to have been particularly stratified. The 1699 description noted that people holding titles such as &quot;king&quot; and &quot;governor&quot; were only empowered as war leaders, and did not have the last word in judicial disputes. Otherwise, the author saw the population as living in an egalitarian state.

M. W. mentioned titled officers in his account of 1699, but later sources define these superior offices to include the king, a governor, and a general. In the early 18th century, the Miskito kingdom became organized into four distinct clusters of population, centered on the banks of the navigable rivers. They were integrated into a single if loosely structured political entity. The northern portions were dominated by Sambus and the southern ones by Tawira Miskitos. The king, whose domain lay from the Wanks River south to the Rio Kukalaya, including the king&#x27;s residence near Sandy Bay, was a Sambu, as was the general, who ruled the northern portions of the kingdom, from the Wanks River to nearly Trujillo. The Governor, who was a Tawira, controlled the southern regions, from the Cucalaya River to Pearl Key Lagoon. In the later 18th century (post 1766), another title, Admiral, was recorded; this man was also a Tawira, controlling a region on the extreme south from Pearl Key Lagoon down to around Bluefields.

====British settlement====
The Miskito king Edward I and the British concluded a formal Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in 1740, and Robert Hodgson, Senior was appointed as Superintendent of the Shore. The language of the treaty includes what amounts to a surrender of sovereignty, and is often taken by historians as an indication that a British protectorate was established over the Mosquito Kingdom.

Britain&#x27;s primary motive and the most immediate result of the treaty was to secure an alliance between the Miskito and British for the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, and the Miskito and British cooperated in attacks on Spanish settlements during the war. The most notable being the Raid on Matina in August by 1747 – the main fort (Fuerte de San Fernando de Matina) was captured and the cacao rich area was subsequently ravaged. This military cooperation would prove important as Miskito forces were vital to protecting not only British interests in the Mosquito Kingdom but also for British holdings in British Honduras (now Belize).

A more lasting result of this formal relation was that Edward I and other Miskito rulers who followed him allowed the British to establish settlements and plantations within his realm, and issued the first land grants to this effect in 1742. British settlement concentrated especially in the Black River area, Cape Gracias a Dios, and Bluefields. The British plantation owners used their estates to grow some export crops and as bases for the exploitation of timber resources, especially mahogany. Most of the labor on the estates was supplied by African slaves and by indigenous slaves captured in Miskito and British raids into Spanish territory. By 1786, there were several hundred British residents on the shore and several thousand slaves, mostly African.

The Miskito kings received regular gifts from the British in the form of weapons and consumer goods, and provided security against slave revolts and capturing runaways.

====British evacuation====
Spain, which claimed the territory, suffered considerably from the Miskito attacks which continued during peacetime. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Spanish forces attempted to eliminate the British presence, seizing the settlement at Black River, and driving British settlers from the isle of Roatán; however, this ultimately failed when armed settlers led by the Anglo-Irish soldier Edward Despard retook the settlements.

Although Spain had been unable to drive the British from the coast or occupy any position, in the course of the diplomatic negotiations following the war, Britain found itself making concessions to Spain. In the 1786 Convention of London, Britain agreed to evacuate British settlers and their slaves from the Mosquito Coast to their as yet informal colony in what was to become British Honduras; later treaties recognized Britain&#x27;s commercial, but never territorial rights in the region. Some of the settlers and their slaves remained after they swore loyalty to the King of Spain, especially in Bluefields.

===Spanish interlude===
====Government reorganization and Spanish settlement====
The Mosquito Coast was initially annexed (or from the Spanish point of view, re-annexed) to the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Since the beginning, however, poor land communication with Guatemala City made easier for the Miskito elites to sail to Cartagena de Indias and swear fealty to Spain before the Viceroy of New Granada instead. Viceroy Francisco Gil de Taboada even suggested that government over the Mosquito Coast should be transferred to Havana, Cuba, mirroring the long-standing relation that the Mosquito Kingdom had earlier with British Jamaica, but this idea was rejected by the Spanish Crown. Guatemala protested the perceived unruliness of the Spanish appointed governor at Bluefields, who was none other but a former British Superintendent of the Mosquito Coast who had sworn recent fealty to Spain, Robert Hodgson Jr., but his loyalty and good work were defended by the New Granadan Viceroy José Manuel de Ezpeleta, who succeeded Taboada in 1789 and considered that Hodgson&#x27;s influence among the Miskito was vital to avoid a revolt. Hodgson Jr. was the son of Robert Hodgson Sr., the first British appointed Superintendent in 1749–1759, and he had occupied himself this post from 1767 to 1775, when his political enemies persuaded Lord George Germain to replace him with James Lawrie, the last British Superintendent before the evacuation and a declared adversary of Hodgson.

The Spanish hoped to win over support of the Miskito elite by offering presents like the British had and educating their youth in Guatemala, as many Miskito had been educated previously in Jamaica. Catholic missionaries also travelled to the Coast with the aim of converting the native population in this period. The acceptance of the new order was unequal and often influenced by the underlying tensions within the own Miskito elites, divided between the northern regions controlled by the Sambu, loyal to King George II Frederic who remained himself friendly to the British, and the Tawira southerners aligned with Admiral Briton, who developed closer ties with Spain and adopted the name Don Carlos Antonio Castilla after his own conversion.

The Spanish also sought to occupy the positions formerly held by British settlers with their own colonists. Beginning in 1787, around 1,200 settlers were brought in from the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary Islands. They settled in Sandy Bay, Cape Gracias a Dios and Black River, but not in the new capital Bluefields.

====Miskito revolt====
The new colony suffered setbacks as a result of many of the settlers dying en route and the Miskito Crown showing its dissatisfaction with the gifts offered by the Spanish. The Miskito resumed trade with Jamaica and, when news of another Anglo-Spanish War arrived in 1797, George II raised an army to attack Bluefields, deposing Hodgson, and drove the Spanish out of the kingdom on September 4, 1800. However, the king died suddenly in 1801. According to British George Henderson, who visited the Mosquito Coast in 1804, many in the kingdom believed that George II had been poisoned by his brother Stephen as part of a deal with the Spanish. In order to prevent Stephen from seizing power for himself, General Robinson spirited George II&#x27;s young heir George Frederic Augustus I to Jamaica by way of Belize and established a regency in his name.

With Spanish power over the Mosquito Coast vanished and British influence rapidly returning, the Captaincy General of Guatemala sought full control of the shore from Spain. The Colombian Ricardo S. Pereira, writing in 1883, considered this act a miscalculation on the part of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala, and if they had simply raised an army and marched on the Mosquito Coast, nobody would have questioned that the area was part of the Captaincy General once Spanish power was fully restored. Instead, the Spanish government heeded the old advice espoused by Gil de Taboada and Ezpeleta, and decided against Guatemala&#x27;s request on November 30, 1803, reaffirming the control of the Viceroyalty of New Granada over the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (used by New Granadan coast guards as a base against British privateers, often coming from the Mosquito Coast itself), and transferring sovereignty of the Mosquito Coast over to New Granada and considering the area a dependency of San Andrés. While Spanish rule was never restored over the Mosquito Coast (instead, the British occupied the Archipelago itself in 1806 during the course of the war against Spain), the Royal Decree of 1803 became the reason for territorial disputes between the United Provinces of Central America and Gran Colombia after Latin American independence, and between Nicaragua and Colombia for the rest of the 19th century.

In the meantime George II&#x27;s brother Stephen made some overtures to Spain, who reciprocated by calling Stephen king and giving him the traditional gifts (albeit less frequently than to George II), but he later changed allegiances and raided Spanish held territory. In 1815, Stephen, styling himself &quot;King Regent [...] of the Shore&quot;, and 33 other Miskito notables gave their &quot;consent, assent, and declaration to, for, and of&quot; George Frederic Augustus I as their &quot;Sovereign King&quot;. His coronation in Belize on January 16, 1816, in a deliberate move to secure British support, marked the end of the regency. Meanwhile, Spain lost rule over New Granada in 1819 and over Central America in 1821, when the First Mexican Empire was proclaimed.

===Renewed British presence===
As internecine conflicts seized both Gran Colombia and Central America post-independence, the potential of any regional power to threaten the Miskito kingdom declined. Miskito Kings renewed their alliance with Great Britain, which in 1801 had merged with Ireland to form the United Kingdom, and Belize replaced Jamaica as the principal British connection to the kingdom. George Frederic Augustus I&#x27;s 1816 coronation in Belize was imitated by his successor Robert Charles Frederic in 1845.

====Economic expansion====

The Miskito kings allowed the settlement of foreigners in their lands as long as their sovereignty was respected, opportunity that was seized by British merchants and Garifuna people from Trujillo, Honduras. Between 1820 and 1837 the Scottish con man Gregor MacGregor pretended to have been named &quot;Cacique of Poyais&quot; by George Frederic Augustus I and sold forged land rights to eager settlers and investors in Britain and France. Most settlers suffered from the lack of infrastructure and died from tropical diseases, MacGregor having led them to believe that the area was already developed and just in need of skilled workers. In the 1830s and 40s King Robert Charles Frederic also appointed small traders, notably William Hodgson and brothers Peter and Samuel Shepherd, as his agents to administer his claims to tribute and taxes from lands as far south as Panama.

At the same time, the mahogany trade peaked in Europe, but the supply in Belize, a main exporter, was becoming scarce. The Miskito Kingdom became an alternative source to Belize-based traders and wood cutting companies, who acquired concessions and land grants from Robert Charles Frederic. In 1837, Britain formally recognized the Mosquito Kingdom as an independent state, and took diplomatic measures to prevent the new nations that left the imploding Federal Republic of Central America in 1838–1841 from interfering with the kingdom.

The expansion of the economy attracted and benefitted from the arrival of capital from the United States, and immigrants from the States, the West Indies, Europe, Syria and China. Especially abundant was the immigration of Afro-Caribbeans following the abolition of slavery in the British and French Caribbean in 1841, who settled mainly in and around Bluefields, merging with the descendants of the slaves that had not been evacuated in 1786 and giving origin to the Miskito Coast Creoles. Because of their greater knowledge of English, the Creoles soon became the workers most sought by foreign companies, occupying the intermediate levels in the businesses and relegating the native Miskitu to the worst paid occupations at the base.

In August 1841, a British ship, without knowledge of London, carried the Miskito King Robert Charles Frederic and the British Governor of Belize, Alexander MacDonald, to occupy Nicaragua&#x27;s only Caribbean port in San Juan del Norte, placed at the mouth of the San Juan River and likely endpoint of a possible future transoceanic canal through Nicaragua, and claimed it for the Mosquito Kingdom. The commander of the port was kidnapped and abandoned in a deserted beach, and the civilian population was told to leave the place by March 1842. The Nicaraguan government protested and the British did not carry on the threatened evacuation of the port, but neither did they take action against MacDonald for the incident.

====Second British protectorate and American opposition====
In 1844, the British government declared a new protectorate over the Mosquito Kingdom and appointed a consul-general of the Mosquito Coast, Patrick Walker with seat in Bluefields. The proclamation was motivated by the state of anarchy in the Mosquito Kingdom after the death of Robert Charles Frederic, but also by the impending American annexation of Texas and the British desire to build a canal through Central America before the United States did.

The protectorate was claimed to extend from Cape Honduras in the north to the mouth of the San Juan River in the south, including San Juan del Norte. Nicaragua protested again and sent forces to San Juan del Norte, which the Miskito King George Augustus Frederic II replied to with an ultimatum demanding all Nicaraguan forces to leave before January 1, 1848. Nicaragua appealed to the United States, but the Americans, then at war with Mexico, did not answer. After the ultimatum expired, Miskito-British forces led by the King and Patrick Walker, and backed by two British warships, seized San Juan del Norte. They also destroyed Serapaqui, where the British prisoners captured during the first attempt on San Juan del Norte were interned, and advanced to Lake Nicaragua, during which Walker drowned. On March 7 Nicaragua signed a peace treaty where it ceded San Juan del Norte to the Mosquito Kingdom, who renamed it Greytown after Charles Edward Grey, governor of Jamaica.

With the Mexican–American War concluded, the new US delegate in Central America, E. G. Squier, tried to get Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras to form a common front against the British, who were now threatening to annex Tiger Island (&quot;El Tigre&quot;) in Honduras&#x27; Pacific coast. After British and American forces nearly clashed in El Tigre, both governments reprimanded the commanders of their forces there and concluded the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty on April 18, 1850. In this document the two powers pledged themselves to guarantee the neutrality and equal use of the proposed canal, and to not &quot;occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast or any part of Central America&quot;, nor make use of any protectorate or alliance, present or future, to such ends.

The United States assumed that this meant the immediate British evacuation of the Mosquito Coast, while the British argued that it only bound them to not expand further in Central America and that both the 1844 protectorate and the 1848 peace treaty were still valid. On November 21, the American steamer &quot;Prometheus&quot; was fired upon by a British warship for not paying port tariffs at Greytown. One of the passengers was Cornelius Vanderbilt, business magnate and one of the richest people in the United States. The British government apologized after the United States sent two armed sloops to the area.

More incidents happened in the following years. In 1852, Britain occupied the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras and rebuffed the American protests claiming that they had been part of Belize before the treaty. The American representative in Nicaragua, Solon Borland, considered the treaty breached and argued openly for the US annexation of Nicaragua and the rest of Central America, for which he was forced to resign. In 1853, the buildings of the US-owned Accessory Transit Company in Greytown were looted and destroyed by the locals. In 1854, an American steamer captain killed a Greytown Creole, and Borland, who had remained in Greytown after his resignation, stopped the arrest for murder by threatening the marshal and his men with a rifle, arguing that they had no power to arrest an American citizen. Though he held no office, Borland ordered 50 American passengers bound for New York to remain on land and &quot;protect US interests&quot; while he sailed to the United States for help. In an example of gunboat diplomacy, the Americans sent then the and demanded 24,000 dollars in damages, an apology and a pledge of good behavior in the future. When the terms weren&#x27;t met, the crew bombarded Greytown, then landed and burnt the town to the ground. Damage was extensive but no one was killed. With its attention seized by the ongoing Crimean War and the firm opposition of Britain&#x27;s merchant class to a war with the United States, the British government only protested and demanded an apology that was never received.

By 1859 British opinion was no longer supportive of their nation&#x27;s presence in the Mosquito Coast. The British government returned the Bay Islands and ceded the northern part of the Mosquito Coast to Honduras, negotiating with Guatemala to enlarge the British territory in Belize as compensation. The next year, Britain signed the Treaty of Managua, ceding the rest of the Mosquito Coast to Nicaragua.

====Arrival of the Moravian Church====
In the 1840s, two British citizens who travelled Europe advertising the sale of land in Cabo Gracias a Dios attracted the interest of Prince Charles of Prussia. Charles&#x27; first plan was to establish a Prussian settlement in the area and sent three German merchants to study this possibility on the ground. Their dictamen was against colonization, but their suggestion to evangelize the Mosquito Coast was taken up by the Prince of Schönburg-Waldenburg, who delegated the task in the Moravian Church. The first missionaries arrived in 1848 with a letter of recommendation from Lord Palmerston and began to work in 1849 in Bluefields, targeting the royal family and the Creoles before expanding to the rest of the Kingdom. In 1880, the mission saw a membership of 1,030 made up of mostly urban creoles. By 1890, the membership was 3,924 and made up of mostly Miskito and rural natives.

===Treaty of Managua===
Britain and Nicaragua signed the Treaty of Managua on January 28, 1860, which transferred suzerainty over the Caribbean coast between Cabo Gracias a Dios and Greytown to Nicaragua. Attempts to decide the sovereignty over the northern bank of the Wanks/Coco River which cuts Cabo Gracias a Dios in half, began in 1869, but would not be settled until ninety-one years later when the International Court of Justice decided in favor of Honduras.

The 1860 treaty also recognized that the Mosquito Kingdom, now reduced to the territory around Bluefields, would become an autonomous Miskito reserve, usually called &quot;Mosquito Reservation&quot; or &quot;Mosquito Reserve&quot;. The municipal constitution of the reserve, signed on September 13, 1861, confirmed George Augustus Frederic II as ruler of the territory and its inhabitants, but only as hereditary chief and not king, a title that, along those of general, admiral and governor, was abolished; and that the hereditary chief would be advised by a council of 41 members elected for a period of eight years. The composition of this council was not limited to Miskito: instead, the first council included a number of Moravian missionaries and its first session started with an oration in this denomination. In compensation for his losses, George Augustus Frederic II would be paid £1000 yearly and until 1870 by the Nicaraguan government.

The death of George Augustus Frederic II in 1865, after only half that time had passed, led to a dispute between Nicaragua and the reserve&#x27;s government. As indicated in its name, the position of hereditary chief was not completely elective like the title of King that preceded it, but had to be occupied by a member of George Augustus Frederic II&#x27;s lineage of full Miskito ancestry. The council argued that none of George Augustus Frederic II&#x27;s wives was Miskito and that none of their children was eligible as a result. The election of William Henry Clarence as new chief, George Augustus Frederic II&#x27;s nephew by his second sister, was not recognized by Nicaragua. William Henry Clarence asked for support to Great Britain, accusing Nicaragua of not abiding to the terms of the 1860 treaty and threatening the Miskitu&#x27;s autonomy, and complaining both about increasing Nicaraguan immigration and the political instability in Nicaragua proper, which threatened the peace within the reserve.

In 1881, Nicaragua and Britain agreed to subject the most disputed points of the 1860 treaty to the arbitration of the Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria-Hungary. His decision, released on June 2, agreed largely with the interests of the Miskito—and by extension, the British. The arbitration decided that:
* Sovereignty over the Mosquito Coast belonged to Nicaragua, but it was largely limited by the autonomy of the Miskito, as recognized in the 1860 treaty.
* Nicaragua had the right to fly its flag in any part of the Mosquito Coast.
* Nicaragua could maintain a Commissioner on the Mosquito Coast to defend her national interests.
* The Miskito could also fly their own flag on the Mosquito Coast, so long as said flag included some sign of Nicaraguan suzerainty. A compromise was reached by using the flag used during the British protectorate (designed by Patrick Walker), but with the Union Flag on the canton replaced by the flag of Nicaragua.
* Nicaragua could not make concessions to the exploitation of natural resources in the Mosquito Coast. That right alone corresponded to the Miskito government.
* Nicaragua could not regulate the Miskito&#x27;s trade, nor tax importations to or exportations from the Mosquito Coast.
* Nicaragua had to pay the money overdue to the Miskito king.
* Nicaragua could not limit the goods imported or exported through the port of San Juan del Norte (Greytown), unless these goods went to or came from Nicaraguan territory outside the reserve.

From 1883, the land and capital in the reserve began to be agglutinated by an increasingly small number of US citizens.

====Annexation to Nicaragua====
When in 1894, Rigoberto Cabezas led a campaign to annex the reserve, natives responded with vigorous protest, an appeal to Britain to protect them, and more militant resistance – to little avail. The situation was such that, from July 6 to August 7, the US occupied Bluefields to &#x27;protect US interests&#x27;. After enjoying almost complete autonomy for fourteen years, on 20 November 1894 their territory formally became incorporated into that of the republic of Nicaragua by Nicaraguan president José Santos Zelaya. The former Mosquito Coast was established as the Nicaraguan department of Zelaya. During the 1980s, the department was dissolved and substituted by the North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) and South Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS), autonomous regions with a certain degree of self-government. Those regions were renamed the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCN) and the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCS) in 2014.

===Miskito under Nicaragua===
The Miskito continued to enjoy a certain autonomy under Nicaragua, though there was considerable tension between the claims of the government and those of the indigenous people. This tension was expressed openly during Sandinista rule, which sought greater state control. The Miskito were strong supporters of U.S. efforts to undermine the Sandinistas and were important allies of the Contras.

===Miskito separatism===
Miskito dissidents declared the independence of the unrecognized Communitarian Nation of Moskitia in 2009. The movement is led by Reverend Hector Williams, who was elected as &quot;Wihta Tara&quot; (Great Judge) of Moskitia by the Council of Elders, its governing body composed of traditional leaders from within the Miskito community. The council advocates for independence and has considered a referendum, seeking international recognition. It also addresses the needs of the impoverished Moskitian communities, such as drug addiction among youth as the coast is slowly gaining influence as a corridor for drug trafficking. However, the allure of possible Narco funding might be a tempting method of supporting independence should the movement find no support.

The movement was backed by a 400-man &quot;indigenous army&quot; made up of veterans of the Contras, which captured the YAMATA party headquarters in 2009.

==Inhabitants==
The Mosquito Coast was a sparsely populated territory.

Today, what used to be the Miskito Coast of Nicaragua has a population of 400,000 inhabitants, consisting of 57% Miskito, 22% Creoles (Afro-Europeans), 15% Ladinos, 4% Sumu (Amerindian), 1% Garifuna (Afro-Indians), 0.5% Chinese and 0.5% Rama (Amerindian).

==Religion==
Anglicanism and the Moravian Church gained a significant following in the Mosquito Coast.

Early history of the Mosquito Coast also saw minor involvement from the Puritans.

==Popular culture==
* W. Douglas Burden describes an expedition in search of a silver mine along the coast. The relevant chapters are &quot;an Outlandish Land&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s Story&quot; in &quot;Look to the Wilderness&quot;.

<text>Amory Bloch Lovins (born November 13, 1947) is an American writer, physicist, and former chairman/chief scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute. He has written on energy policy and related areas for four decades, and served on the US National Petroleum Council, an oil industry lobbying group, from 2011 to 2018.

Lovins has promoted energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, and the generation of energy at or near the site where the energy is actually used. Lovins has also advocated a &quot;negawatt revolution&quot; arguing that utility customers don&#x27;t want kilowatt-hours of electricity; they want energy services. In the 1990s, his work with Rocky Mountain Institute included the design of an ultra-efficient automobile, the Hypercar. He has provided expert testimony and published 31 books, including &quot;Reinventing Fire&quot;, &quot;Winning the Oil Endgame&quot;, &quot;Small is Profitable&quot;, &quot;Brittle Power&quot;, and &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot;.

== Early life and education==
Lovins was born in Washington, DC. His father, Gerald H. Lovins worked as an engineer and his mother, Miriam Lovins, worked as a social services administrator. Lovins is the brother of Julie Beth Lovins, a computational linguist who wrote the first stemming algorithm for word matching.

In 1964, Lovins entered Harvard College as a National Merit Scholar. After two years there, he transferred to Oxford. In 1969, he became a junior research fellow at Merton College, Oxford, as a result of which he had a temporary Oxford master of arts status. He left without a degree in 1971, because the university would not allow him to pursue a doctorate in energy. Lovins moved to London to pursue his energy work, and returned to the United States in 1981. He settled in western Colorado in 1982.

Lovins&#x27; four grandparents emigrated to the United States from small villages lying between Kyiv and Odesa in Ukraine in the early 20thcentury. Most of his remaining family are believed to have been killed by German Nazis in the 1941 Tarashcha massacre.

== Work ==

=== Friends of the Earth ===
Each summer from 1965 to 1981, Lovins guided mountaineering trips and photographed the White Mountains of New Hampshire, contributing photographs to &quot;At Home in the Wild: New England&#x27;s White Mountains&quot;. In 1971, he wrote about Wales&#x27; endangered Snowdonia National Park in the book, &quot;Eryri, the Mountains of Longing&quot;, commissioned by David Brower, president of Friends of the Earth. Lovins spent about a decade as British representative for Friends of the Earth.

During the early 1970s, Lovins became interested in resource policy, especially energy policy. The 1973 energy crisis helped create an audience for his writing and an essay originally penned as a U.N. paper grew into his first book concerned with energy, &quot;World Energy Strategies&quot; (1973). His next book was &quot;Non-Nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy&quot; (1975), co-authored with John H. Price.

=== Rocky Mountain Institute ===
By 1978, Lovins had published six books and consulted widely. In 1982, he and his wife, Hunter Lovins founded Rocky Mountain Institute, based in Snowmass, Colorado. Together with a group of colleagues, the Lovinses fostered efficient resource use and sustainable development.

Lovins clients have included many &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies, real-estate developers, and utilities. Public-sector clients have included the OECD, UN, Resources for the Future, many national governments, and 13 US states. Lovins served in 1980 and 1981 on the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Energy Research Advisory Board, and from 1999 to 2001 and 2006 to 2008 on Defense Science Board task forces on military energy efficiency and strategy. His visiting academic chairs most recently included a visiting professorship in Stanford University&#x27;s school of engineering.

Since 1982, RMI has grown into a broad-based &quot;think-and-do tank&quot; with more than 600 staff and an annual budget over $120 million. RMI has spun off five for-profit companies.

== Ideas ==

=== Soft energy paths ===
Amory Lovins published an article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; called &quot;Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?&quot; in 1976. Lovins argued that the United States had arrived at an important crossroads and could take one of two paths. The first, supported by U.S. policy, promised a future of steadily increasing reliance on fossil fuels and nuclear fission, and had serious environmental risks. The alternative, which Lovins called &quot;the soft path&quot;, favored &quot;benign&quot; sources of renewable energy like wind power and solar power, along with a heightened commitment to energy conservation and energy efficiency. In October 1977, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; ran a cover story on Lovins&#x27; ideas. Residential solar energy technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple, energy conserving, residential solar energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy.

Lovins has described the &quot;hard energy path&quot; as involving inefficient energy use and centralized, non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels. He believes soft path impacts are more &quot;gentle, pleasant and manageable,&quot; than hard path impacts. These impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level.

&quot;Lovins on the Soft Path&quot; is a documentary film made by Amory and Hunter Lovins. It received &quot;Best Science and Technology Film, San Francisco International Film Festival, 1983; Blue Ribbon, American Film Festival, 1982; Best of the Festival, Environmental Education Film Festival, 1982; Best Energy Film, International Environmental Film Festival, 1982; and Chris Bronze Plaque, Columbus International Film Festival, 1982.&quot;

=== Nuclear power limitations ===
Lovins wrote (as an attempt to balance the inherently intermittent nature of solar and wind) that nuclear power plants are intermittent in that they will sometimes fail unexpectedly, often for long periods of time. For example, in the United States, 132 nuclear plants were built, and 21% were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems, while another 27% have at least once completely failed for a year or more. The remaining U.S. nuclear plants produce approximately 90% of their full-time full-load potential, but even they must shut down (on average) for about 1 out of each 18 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance. To cope with such intermittence by nuclear (and centralized fossil-fueled) power plants, utilities install a &quot;reserve margin&quot; of roughly 15% extra capacity spinning ready for instant use.

Lovins also argues that nuclear plants have an additional disadvantage: for safety, they must instantly shut down in a power failure, but due to the inherent nuclear-physics of the systems, they can&#x27;t be restarted quickly. For example, during the Northeast Blackout of 2003, nine operating U.S. nuclear units had to shut down temporarily. During the first three days after restarting, their output was less than 3% of normal. After twelve days of restart, their average capacity loss had exceeded 50 percent.

Lovins provided his general assessment of nuclear power in a 2011 &quot;Huffington Post&quot; article, saying that &quot;Nuclear power is the only energy source where mishap or malice can kill so many people so far away; the only one whose ingredients can help make and hide nuclear bombs; the only climate solution that substitutes proliferation, accident, and high-level radioactive waste dangers. Indeed, nuclear plants are so slow and costly to build that they reduce and retard climate protection&quot;. With respect to the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Lovins wrote: &quot;An earthquake-and-tsunami zone crowded with 127 million people is an unwise place for 54 reactors&quot;.

Regarding nuclear power in the United Kingdom, Amory Lovins commented in 2014 that:

Britain&#x27;s plan for a fleet of new nuclear power stations is ... unbelievable ... It is economically daft. The guaranteed price [being offered to French state company EDF] is over seven times the unsubsidized price of new wind in the US, four or five times the unsubsidized price of new solar power in the US. Nuclear prices only go up. Renewable energy prices come down. There is absolutely no business case for nuclear. The British policy has nothing to do with economic or any other rational base for decision making.

=== Negawatt revolution ===
A negawatt is a unit in watts of power saved. It is basically the opposite of a watt. Amory Lovins has advocated a &quot;negawatt revolution&quot;, arguing that utility customers don&#x27;t want kilowatt-hours of electricity; they want energy services such as hot showers, cold beer, lit rooms, and spinning shafts, which can come more cheaply if electricity is used more efficiently.

=== Hypercar ===
In 1994, Amory Lovins developed the design concept of the Hypercar. This vehicle would have ultra-light construction with an aerodynamic body using advanced composite materials, low-drag design, and hybrid drive. Designers of the Hypercar claim that it would achieve a three- to fivefold improvement in fuel economy, equal or better performance, safety, amenity, and affordability, compared with today&#x27;s cars.

In 1999, RMI took this process a step further by launching a for-profit venture, Hypercar Inc. in which RMI has a minority interest. In 2004, Hypercar Inc. changed its name to Fiberforge to better reflect the company&#x27;s new goal of lowering the cost of high-volume advanced-composite structures by leveraging the patents of David F. Taggart, one of the founders of Hypercar, Inc.

Lovins says the commercialization of the Hypercar began in 2014, with the production of the all-carbon electric BMW i3 family and the 313 miles per gallon Volkswagen XL1.

=== Citizen participation ===
Lovins does not see his energy ideas as green or left-wing, and he is an advocate of private enterprise and free market economics. He notes that Rupert Murdoch has made News Corporation carbon-neutral, with savings of millions of dollars. But, says Lovins, large institutions are becoming more &quot;gridlocked and moribund&quot;, and he supports the rise of &quot;citizen organizations&quot; around the world.

Paul Hawken&#x27;s &quot;Blessed Unrest&quot; chronicles the rise of millions of non-profit citizen organizations around the world — the greatest social movement in history. As central institutions become more gridlocked and moribund, a new vitality is beginning to spread renewal through the stem to the flower.

== Criticism ==
Institutions and energy specialists have criticized various positions taken by Amory Lovins. One of the main points of contention is the assumption by the RMI of a linear relation between improvements in energy efficiency and reductions in aggregate energy consumption. The Jevons Paradox suggests that improvements in energy efficiency actually lead to an increase in energy use, as a result of decreasing cost. This &quot;rebound effect&quot; is downplayed in the analyses performed by Lovins.

Other assumptions made by Lovins have also received criticism. For example, in Lovins&#x27; book, Reinventing Fire, it is assumed that 50% of all electricity in the US could come from wind in 2050. Other authors find that this is capped probably around 30%. Similar overestimates are identified in PV (solar), where estimates are made for about 30%; this is seen as implausible. Moreover, according to the authors, no analyses are given about the need for huge volumes of electricity storage, which would be needed when the sun doesn&#x27;t shine and the wind doesn&#x27;t blow.

== Awards ==
Amory Lovins was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1984, of the World Academy of Art and Science in 1988, and of the World Business Academy in 2001. He has received the Right Livelihood Award, the Blue Planet Prize, Volvo Environment Prize, the 4th Annual Heinz Award in the Environment in 1998, and the National Design (Design Mind), Jean Meyer, and Lindbergh Awards.

Lovins is also the recipient of the &quot;Time&quot; Hero for the Planet awards, the Benjamin Franklin and Happold Medals, and the Shingo, Nissan, Mitchell, and Onassis Prizes. He received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1993, and is an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences, and an Honorary Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council. He is on the Advisory Board of the Holcim Foundation.

In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Lovins as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people.

On March 17, 2016, Lovins received the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1. Klasse (Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit) from the Federal Republic of Germany for intellectually underpinning Germany&#x27;s Energiewende, most notably with his concept of &quot;soft energy&quot; and how that promotes peace and prosperity.

Lovins was a senior Ashoka Fellow in 2009.

== Personal life ==
In 1979 Amory Lovins married L. Hunter Sheldon, a lawyer, forester, and social scientist. They separated in 1989 and divorced in 1999. In 2007, he married Judy Hill, a fine-art landscape photographer.

<text>The house crow (Corvus splendens), also known as the Indian, greynecked, Ceylon or Colombo crow, is a common bird of the crow family that is of Asian origin but now found in many parts of the world, where they arrived assisted by shipping. It is between the jackdaw and the carrion crow in size ( in length) but is slimmer than either. The forehead, crown, throat and upper breast are a richly glossed black, whilst the neck and breast are a lighter grey-brown in colour. The wings, tail and legs are black. There are regional variations in the thickness of the bill and the depth of colour in areas of the plumage.

==Taxonomy==
The nominate race &quot;C. s. splendens&quot; is found in Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh and has a grey neck collar. The subspecies &quot;C. s. zugmayeri&quot; is found in the dry parts of South Asia and Iran and has a very pale neck collar. The subspecies &quot;C. s. protegatus&quot; is found in southern India, the Maldives (sometimes separated as &quot;maledivicus&quot;) and Sri Lanka and is darker grey. &quot;C. s. insolens&quot;, found in Myanmar, is the darkest form and lacks the grey collar.

==Distribution and habitat==
It has a widespread distribution in southern Asia, being native to Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Laccadive Islands, southern Myanmar, south Thailand, and coastal southern Iran. It was introduced to East Africa around Zanzibar (about 1897) and Port Sudan. It arrived in Australia via ship but has up to now been exterminated. Recently, it has made its arrival in Europe and has been breeding in the Dutch harbour town Hook of Holland since 1998.

A population between 200 and 400 birds has been present in Sham Shui Po, New Kowloon, Hong Kong, in particular Lai Kok Estate and Sham Shui Po Park, as well as Kowloon Tsai Park in Kowloon Tsai. An individual has been present in Cork Harbour on the south coast of Ireland since early September 2010.

In the New World, a small population of house crows is established in the area around St. Petersburg, Florida. As of April 2009, the introduced population of house crows in Socotra Island, Yemen, has been eradicated to avoid negative ecological effects to endemic species of Socotra.

It is associated with human settlements throughout its range, from small villages to large cities. In Singapore, there was a density of 190 birds/km2 in 2001 with efforts to suppress the population in planning.

Due to a human population explosion in the areas it inhabits, this species has also proportionately multiplied. Being an omnivorous scavenger has enabled it to thrive in such circumstances.

==Invasive species==
The invasive potential for the species is great all over the tropics. This species can make use of resources with great flexibility and appears to be associated with humans, and no populations are known to exist independently of humans. Based on niche-modelling it is estimated that it can also persist in some coastal areas in southern and northwestern Europe. In 2016, house crow was added to the List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern. The breeding population of this species is reported from Netherlands (Hoek van Holland), while individuals were seen in Belgium, Hungary, Poland and Spain.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
House crows feed largely on refuse around human habitations, small reptiles and mammals, and other animals such as insects and other small invertebrates, eggs, nestlings, grain and fruits. House crows have also been observed swooping down from the air and snatching baby squirrels. Most food is taken from the ground, but also from trees as opportunity arises. They are highly opportunistic birds and given their omnivorous diet, they can survive on nearly anything that is edible. These birds can be seen near marketplaces and garbage dumps, foraging for scraps. They have also been observed to eat sand after feeding on carcasses.

===Nesting===

At least some trees in the local environment seem to be necessary for successful breeding although house crows occasionally nest on telephone towers. It lays 3–5 eggs in a typical stick nest, and occasionally there are several nests in the same tree. In South Asia they are parasitized by the Asian koel. Peak breeding in India as well as Peninsular Malaysia is from April to July. Large trees with big crowns are preferred for nesting.

===Roosting===
House crows roost communally near human habitations and often over busy streets. A study in Singapore found that the preferred roost sites were in well-lit areas with a lot of human activity, close to food sources and in tall trees with dense crowns that were separated from other trees. The roost sites were often enclosed by tall buildings. Before flying into roost trees, crows make pre-roosting aggregations perched on TV antennas, roof tops, wayside trees, open fields, and feed or preen during this time.

===Voice===
The voice is a harsh &quot;kaaw-kaaw&quot;.

==Relationship to humans==
It is suspected that paramyxoviruses, such as PMV 1 that causes of Newcastle disease may be spread by &quot;Corvus splendens&quot;. Outbreaks of Newcastle disease in India were often preceded by mortality in crows. They have also been found to carry &quot;Cryptococcus neoformans&quot;, which can cause cryptococcosis in humans.
House crows in Tanzania curiously showed an absence of blood parasites, although some species such as &quot;Trypanosoma corvi&quot; have been first described from this species. Pathologist T.R. Lewis expressed surprise at the numbers of haematozoa present in the blood of house crows from Calcutta.

<text>Chicago is a 1975 American musical with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb, and book by Ebb and Bob Fosse. Set in Chicago in the Jazz Age, the musical is based on a 1926 play of the same title by Maurine Dallas Watkins about actual criminals and crimes on which she reported. The story is a satire on corruption in the administration of criminal justice and the concept of the &quot;celebrity criminal&quot;.

The world premiere of the musical was a Broadway tryout from April 8, 1975, to May 3, 1975, at the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia. The original Broadway production opened on June 3, 1975 at the 46th Street Theatre and ran for 936 performances, until August 27, 1977. Bob Fosse directed and choreographed the original production, and his style is strongly identified with the show. It debuted in the West End in 1979, where it ran for 600 performances. &quot;Chicago&quot; was revived on Broadway in 1996, and a year later in the West End.

The 1996 Broadway production holds the record as the longest-running musical revival and the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. It is the second longest-running show ever to run on Broadway, behind only &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. &quot;Chicago&quot; surpassed &quot;Cats&quot; on November 23, 2014, when it played its 7,486th performance. The West End revival became the longest-running American musical in West End history. The ongoing 1996 revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; is the longest-running show currently on Broadway. &quot;Chicago&quot; has been staged in numerous productions around the world, and has toured extensively in the United States and United Kingdom. The 2002 film adaptation of the musical won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==History==
The musical &quot;Chicago&quot; is based on a play of the same name by reporter and playwright Maurine Dallas Watkins, who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. In the early 1920s, Chicago&#x27;s press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the Jazz Age, and a long string of acquittals by Cook County juries of female murderers (juries at the time were all male, and convicted murderers generally faced death by hanging). A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; generally favored the prosecution&#x27;s case, while still presenting the details of these women&#x27;s lives. Its rivals at the Hearst papers were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called &quot;sob-sisters&quot; – women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants. Regardless of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities.

Annan, the model for the character of Roxie Hart, was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924 murder of Harry Kalstedt, who served as the basis for the Fred Casely character. The &quot;Tribune&quot; reported that Annan played the foxtrot record &quot;Hula Lou&quot; over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who &quot;tried to make love to her&quot;. Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. Velma Kelly is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer and society divorcée. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner&#x27;s abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O&#x27;Brien were models for a composite character in &quot;Chicago&quot;, Billy Flynn. Just days apart, separate juries at the Criminal Courts building acquitted both women.

Watkins&#x27; sensational columns documenting these trials proved so popular that she wrote a play based on them. The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. Cecil B. DeMille produced a silent film version, &quot;Chicago&quot; (1927), starring former Mack Sennett bathing beauty Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as &quot;Roxie Hart&quot; (1942) starring Ginger Rogers, but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it, due to content restrictions on Hollywood films of the era.

In the 1960s, Gwen Verdon read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; historian Kevin Boyd Grubb has speculated that, by this point, Watkins may have regretted Annan and Gaertner&#x27;s acquittals, and felt that her treatment of them should not be glamorized. Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her estate sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse. John Kander and Fred Ebb began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional vaudeville number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show&#x27;s comparison between &quot;justice&quot;, &quot;show business&quot;, and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and choreographed.

==Synopsis==

=== Act I ===
Velma Kelly is a vaudevillian who welcomes the audience to tonight&#x27;s show (&quot;All That Jazz&quot;). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928, in the bedroom of chorus girl Roxie Hart, where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.

Roxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband&#x27;s willingness to do anything for her (&quot;Funny Honey&quot;). However, when the police mention the deceased&#x27;s name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. With both Roxie and Amos furious at each other for the other&#x27;s betrayal, Roxie confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women&#x27;s block in the Cook County Jail, where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (&quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister after she caught them having sex, though she denies committing the act on account of blacking out from the sight. The block is presided over by Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton, whose system of taking bribes (&quot;When You&#x27;re Good to Mama&quot;) perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media&#x27;s top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma&#x27;s big return to vaudeville.

Velma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, Billy Flynn. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (&quot;A Tap Dance&quot;), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (&quot;All I Care About&quot;). Billy takes Roxie&#x27;s case before realizing Amos does not have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a media circus and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (&quot;A Little Bit of Good&quot;), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie&#x27;s press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (&quot;We Both Reached for the Gun&quot;) to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.

Roxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (&quot;Roxie&quot;). As Roxie&#x27;s fame grows, Velma&#x27;s notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Do It Alone&quot;). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Do It Alone (Reprise)&quot;). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (&quot;My Own Best Friend&quot;), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page.

===Act II===
Velma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie&#x27;s manipulation of the system (&quot;I Know a Girl&quot;) and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (&quot;Me and My Baby&quot;). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie&#x27;s story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos&#x27;s, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (&quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (&quot;When Velma Takes The Stand&quot;), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a &quot;common criminal&quot; and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of celebrity is fleeting and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted on her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, become the first woman to be executed in Chicago in decades.

The trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (&quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie&#x27;s child. As Roxie recounts Billy&#x27;s carefully crafted false narrative of the night of Fred&#x27;s murder (with Fred re-appearing on stage in flashback), she steals all of Velma&#x27;s schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (&quot;Class&quot;). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie&#x27;s fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn&#x27;t pregnant, at which point a fed up Amos leaves her.

The final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they sing bittersweetly about modern life (&quot;Nowadays&quot;). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial actually to be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma&#x27;s dance (&quot;Hot Honey Rag&quot;) to make it as sexy as possible. The show ends with a brief finale as Roxie and Velma thank their audience (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Musical and staging style==
According to Fred Ebb, he wrote the book in a vaudeville style because &quot;the characters were performers. Every musical moment in the show was loosely modeled on someone else: Roxie was Helen Morgan, Velma was Texas Guinan, Billy Flynn was Ted Lewis, Mama Morton was Sophie Tucker.&quot; Composer John Kander elaborates that the reason the show was called a vaudeville &quot;is because many of the songs we wrote are related to specific performers like those you mentioned, and Eddie Cantor and Bert Williams as well.&quot;

It was through the initial production, and not the writing, that many of the &quot;traditional&quot; &quot;Chicago&quot; staging conventions were developed:

The double snap in &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; was added as an afterthought at the suggestion of Ebb to Kander. Kander explains: &quot;I remember when we wrote &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;, before we took it in and played it for Bob, you [Ebb] said with absolute confidence &#x27;Try adding a couple of finger snaps to it. Bobby will love that.&#x27; We added them...and as soon as he heard the finger snaps, he loved the song.&quot; During rehearsals, &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; was originally staged as an orgy on the steps of the courthouse. Fosse was talked out of allowing this staging, when Orbach &quot;convinced him that he was missing the Brechtian subtlety intrinsic in the number.&quot;

The original finale was &quot;Loopin&#x27; the Loop&quot;, a doubles act with Verdon and Rivera; however, &quot;the scene seemed too much like an amateur act so Fosse asked for something more &#x27;glamorous in pretty gowns. The piece was cut and replaced with &quot;Nowadays&quot;. Instrumental sections of &quot;Loopin&#x27; the Loop&quot; can still be heard in the Overture. Two other sections termed &quot;Keep It Hot&quot; and &quot;RSVP&quot; were cut from the finale as well.

Another principal character, a theatrical agent named Henry Glassman, was played by David Rounds, whose role was to exploit the notoriety of the prisoners for his own gain. He also served as the evening&#x27;s M.C. This character&#x27;s role and the song &quot;Ten Percent&quot; was cut, with the character folded into that of Matron Mama Morton, and various members of the chorus shared his M.C. duties.

In a reversal of roles, Fosse decided the lyrics for &quot;Class&quot; were too offensive and censored Kander and Ebb&#x27;s original version. One of the original lyrics &quot;Every guy is a snot/Every girl is a twat&quot; was restored for the 2002 film, although the entire number was cut from the final product.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===

&quot;Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville&quot; opened on June 3, 1975 at the 46th Street Theatre, and ran for a total of 936 performances, closing on August 27, 1977. The opening night cast starred Chita Rivera as Velma Kelly, Gwen Verdon as Roxie Hart, Jerry Orbach as Billy Flynn, and Barney Martin as Amos Hart. Velma Kelly had been a comparatively minor character in all versions of &quot;Chicago&quot; prior to the musical rendering. The role was fleshed out to balance Rivera&#x27;s role opposite Verdon&#x27;s Roxie Hart.

The musical received mixed reviews. The Brechtian style of the show, which frequently dropped the fourth wall, made audiences uncomfortable. According to James Leve, &quot;&quot;Chicago&quot; is cynical and subversive, exploiting American cultural mythologies in order to attack American celebrity culture.&quot;

The show opened the same year as Michael Bennett&#x27;s highly successful &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, which beat out &quot;Chicago&quot; in both ticket sales and at the Tony Awards. The show was on the verge of closing when it ran into another setback: Verdon had to have surgery on nodes in her throat after inhaling a feather during the show&#x27;s finale. The producers contemplated closing the show, but Liza Minnelli stepped in and offered to play the role of Roxie Hart in place of Verdon. Her run lasted slightly over a month (August 8, 1975, through September 13, 1975), boosting the show&#x27;s popularity, until Verdon recuperated and returned to the show. Ann Reinking, who would go on to star in the highly successful 1996 revival and choreograph that production in the style of Fosse, was also a cast replacement for Roxie Hart during the show&#x27;s original run.

===1979 West End===
The first West End, London production opened at the Cambridge Theatre in April 1979 and ran for around 600 performances (having had its European premiere at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, on 23 November 1978). It commenced in the West End with most of the Sheffield cast, and was directed by Peter James and choreographed by Gillian Gregory. The producers were Ray Cooney and Larry Parnes. Jenny Logan starred as Velma Kelly, with Ben Cross as Billy, Antonia Ellis as Roxie Hart and Don Fellows as Amos Hart. Ellis (Actress of the Year in a Musical) and Ben Cross (Actor of the Year in a Musical) were nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for their performances, and the musical was nominated as Musical of the Year. Elizabeth Seal later replaced Ellis as Roxie Hart.

=== 1977 Argentina ===
The original Argentine production opened at the Teatro El Nacional featuring Nélida Lobato (Roxie), Ambar La Fox (Velma), Marty Cosens (Billy), Jovita Luna (Mama Morton) and Juan Carlos Thorry (Amos) as a replica of the original Broadway production. The book was adapted by Enrique Pinti and the production was directed by Wilfredo Ferran and Mike Ribas. Gene Foote choreographed the production based on the original choreography by Bob Fosse. It was produced by Alejandro Romay.

=== 1981 Australia ===
The original Australian production opened at the Sydney Opera House&#x27;s Drama Theatre in June 1981. Featuring Nancye Hayes (Roxie), Geraldine Turner (Velma), Terence Donovan (Billy), Judi Connelli (Mama) and George Spartels (Amos), it was a new production directed by Richard Wherrett for the Sydney Theatre Company, rather than a replica of the Broadway production. It transferred to the Theatre Royal in Sydney, before touring to Melbourne&#x27;s Comedy Theatre, Adelaide&#x27;s Festival Theatre and a return season at the Theatre Royal, playing until March 1982. Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s production also toured to the Hong Kong Arts Festival in February 1983.

===1992 Los Angeles===
The Long Beach Civic Light Opera presented Chicago in 1992, directed by Rob Marshall with choreography by Ann Reinking. Juliet Prowse played Roxie opposite Bebe Neuwirth as Velma. Gary Sandy played Billy Flynn with Kaye Ballard as Mama Morton.

===1996 Broadway revival===
City Center Encores! series presented &quot;Chicago&quot; in concert in May 1996. The Encores! series, according to their statement, &quot;celebrates the rarely heard works of America&#x27;s most important composers and lyricists...Encores! gives three glorious scores the chance to be heard as their creators originally intended.&quot;

The production was directed by Walter Bobbie with choreography &quot;in the style of Bob Fosse&quot; by Ann Reinking, who also reprised her previous role as Roxie Hart. Also in the cast were Bebe Neuwirth as Velma Kelly, Joel Grey as Amos Hart and James Naughton as Billy Flynn. The show was well-received, with Howard Kissel, reviewing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writing that &quot;This &quot;Chicago&quot; impressed me far more than the original.&quot;. Ben Brantley, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote &quot; &#x27;Make love to the audience&#x27; was another Fosse dictum. That&#x27;s exactly what Ms. Reinking and her ensemble do. &quot;Chicago&quot; can still seem glibly cynical and artificially cold, especially in its weaker second act. But these performers know just how to take off the chill.&quot; By May 10, 1996, there was talk of a Broadway production: &quot;Down the block, there is a move afoot to move the Encores production of &quot;Chicago&quot; to Broadway. Rocco Landesman said that he and Fran and Barry Weissler wanted to bring the production to the Martin Beck Theater this summer.&quot;
Barry and Fran Weissler brought the Encores! production to Broadway, after some revision and expansion, but retaining the spare and minimalist style in costumes and set. The set design includes the presence of the band center stage in an evocation of a jury box, around and upon which the actors play some scenes. There are also chairs along the sides of this central piece, in which the actors at times sit or lounge, when not directly involved in the action. The show opened on November 14, 1996, at the 
Richard Rodgers Theatre (the same theater where the original production had played) with a script adapted by David Thompson, eventually setting a record for recovering its initial costs faster than any other musical in history, likely due in part to the stripped-down design elements.

Unlike the original production, the revival was met with praise from critics. The &quot;CurtainUp&quot; reviewer noted, &quot;The show garnered ecstatic reviews, enviable box office sales and enough awards to warrant a special Chicago trophy room.&quot; Society had changed in light of events such as the O. J. Simpson murder case, and audiences were more receptive to the criminal-as-celebrity theme of the show.

The revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; won six Tony Awards, more than any other revival in Broadway history until &quot;South Pacific&quot; won seven Tonys in 2008. &quot;Chicago&quot; won for Best Revival of a Musical, Best Leading Actress in a Musical for Bebe Neuwirth, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for James Naughton, Best Lighting Design of a Musical for Ken Billington, Best Director of a Musical for Walter Bobbie and Best Choreography for Ann Reinking. &quot;Chicago: The Musical&quot; has run for more than 11,000 performances and holds the record for longest-running musical revival on Broadway. Ann Reinking, Bebe Neuwirth, James Naughton, and Joel Grey returned for cameo appearances.

The cast recording of the revival was released on January 28, 1997, on RCA Victor. The cast recording won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.

Among the many other performers and celebrities who have appeared in the show are Adam Pascal, Alan Thicke, Amra-Faye Wright, Amy Spanger, Alyssa Milano, Ana Villafañe, Angelica Ross, Ariana Madix, Ashlee Simpson, Billy Ray Cyrus, Billy Zane, Brandy Norwood, Brooke Shields, Carol Woods, Chandra Wilson, Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise, Chris Sullivan, Christie Brinkley, Christine Pedi, Christopher Fitzgerald, Christopher Sieber, Cuba Gooding Jr., Debra Monk, Eddie George, Elvis Stojko, Erich Bergen, Erika Jayne, Gretchen Mol, Isaac Mizrahi, Jaime Camil, James Monroe Iglehart, Jeff McCarthy, Jennifer Holliday, Jennifer Nettles, Jerry Springer, Jinkx Monsoon, Joey Lawrence, John O&#x27;Hurley, Kara DioGuardi, Kevin Chamberlin, Kevin Richardson, Leigh Zimmerman, Lillias White, Lisa Rinna, Marco Zunino, Marilu Henner, Marti Pellow, Mel B, Melanie Griffith, Melora Hardin, Michael C. Hall, Michelle Williams, Mýa, Nana Visitor, NeNe Leakes, Norm Lewis, Pamela Anderson, Patrick Swayze, Paulo Szot, Philip Casnoff, Rita Wilson, Rob Bartlett, Roz Ryan, Rumer Willis, Ruthie Henshall, Samantha Harris, Sebastián Yatra, Shiri Maimon, Sofía Vergara, Taye Diggs, Todrick Hall, Tony Yazbeck, Usher, Veronica Dunne, and Wendy Williams.

On February 12, 1997, the Broadway production moved into the larger Shubert Theatre. On January 29, 2003, more than six years into its run, the Broadway production moved a second time, to the Ambassador Theatre, where it has played ever since. On November 23, 2014, &quot;Chicago&quot; became the second longest-running Broadway show, surpassing &quot;Cats&quot;.

===London revivals===

On November 18, 1997, the revival production opened in London&#x27;s West End. Like the New York revival, it was directed by Walter Bobbie and designed by John Lee Beatty, with choreography by Ann Reinking in the style of Bob Fosse. The show ran at the Adelphi Theatre for nine years until transferring to the Cambridge Theatre in April 2006. The original cast of the production included German jazz singer Ute Lemper as Velma, British actress Ruthie Henshall as Roxie Hart, Nigel Planer as Amos Hart, and Henry Goodman as Billy Flynn. The production won the 1998 Olivier Award for Outstanding Musical, and Lemper was awarded Best Actress in a Musical. Both Lemper and Henshall have played the role of Velma on Broadway.

Like its Broadway counterpart, the London production featured many celebrities, including Alison Moyet, America Ferrera, Anita Dobson, Anita Louise Combe, Aoife Mulholland, Ashlee Simpson, Bonnie Langford, Brooke Shields, Chita Rivera, Christie Brinkley, Claire Sweeney, Clive Rowe, Darius Campbell, David Hasselhoff, Denise van Outen, Frances Ruffelle, Gaby Roslin, Ian Kelsey, James Doherty, Jennifer Ellison, Jerry Springer, Jill Halfpenny, Joel Grey, John Barrowman, Josefina Gabrielle, Justin Lee Collins, Kelly Osbourne, Kevin Richardson, Leigh Zimmerman, Les Dennis, Linzi Hateley, Lynda Carter, Maria Friedman, Marti Pellow, Michael French, Michael Greco, Michelle Williams, Peter Davison, Raza Jaffrey, Sacha Distel, Sally Ann Triplett, Tina Arena, and Tony Hadley.

The production moved out of the Cambridge Theatre on August 27, 2011 and transferred to the Garrick Theatre on November 7, 2011, starring America Ferrera as Roxie. Robin Cousins joined the cast as Billy Flynn on July 17, 2012. The show closed on September 1, 2012 after a total run of nearly 15 years in London. The UK tour of the production continued after the closing.

To celebrate the 21st Anniversary of the West End revival production, &quot;Chicago&quot; returned, this time at the Phoenix Theatre opening April 11, 2018, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as Billy Flynn, Sarah Soetaert as Roxie Hart, Josefina Gabrielle as Velma Kelly, and Ruthie Henshall as Mama Morton. A cast change saw Martin Kemp take over the role of Billy Flynn, with Alexandra Burke as Roxie Hart and Mazz Murray as Mama Morton. Denise Van Outen was announced to take over the role of Velma from 24 September 2018, but due to sustaining a stress fracture in her heel, her integration was delayed until 7 October. The production featured on ITV&#x27;s reality show, The Big Audition, to cast the replacement Velma. Following multiple rounds of singing, dancing and acting auditions, Laura Tyrer was selected to fill in for the role.

===North American tours===
There have been ten North American national tours of &quot;Chicago&quot;. The first tour started in April 1997 in Cincinnati, Ohio, six months after the revival opened on Broadway. The cast featured Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise (Roxie Hart), Jasmine Guy (Velma Kelly), Obba Babatundé (Billy Flynn) and Carol Woods (Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton). A second company started in December 1997 in Tampa, Florida. The tour went on hiatus in Fall 1999 and started again in October 1999 in Denver, Colorado, featuring Robert Urich as Billy Flynn, Vicki Lewis (Velma) and Nana Visitor (Roxie). The next tour started in October 2000 in Stamford, Connecticut, with Robert Urich. Chita Rivera joined the tour for several weeks.

The 2003 tour started in June 2003 at the National Theatre, Washington, DC, with Brenda Braxton playing Velma, Bianca Marroquin as Roxie, and Gregory Harrison as Billy Flynn. During 2004 the tour cast included Alan Thicke and Tom Wopat as Billy Flynn and Carol Woods as Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton. The most recent tour started in November 2008 in Charlotte, North Carolina and starred Tom Wopat as Billy Flynn, Bianca Marroquin as Roxie Hart, Terra C. MacLeod as Velma Kelly and Roz Ryan (later replaced by Carol Woods) as Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton. On January 16, 2012 Peruvian actor Marco Zunino joined the cast as Billy Flynn.

=== 2013 Hollywood Bowl ===
For its annual fully staged musical event, the Hollywood Bowl produced a limited run of &quot;Chicago&quot; from July 26-28, 2013, directed by Brooke Shields. The cast included Samantha Barks as Velma Kelly, Ashlee Simpson as Roxie Hart, Stephen Moyer as Billy Flynn, Drew Carey as Amos Hart, and Lucy Lawless as Mama Morton.

<text>The RBMK (, РБМК; &quot;reaktor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalnyy&quot;, &quot;high-power channel-type reactor&quot;) is a class of graphite-moderated nuclear power reactor designed and built by the Soviet Union. It is somewhat like a boiling water reactor as water boils in the pressure tubes. It is one of two power reactor types to enter serial production in the Soviet Union during the 1970s, the other being the VVER reactor. The name refers to its design where instead of a large steel pressure vessel surrounding the entire core, the core is surrounded by a cylindrical annular steel tank inside a concrete vault and each fuel assembly is enclosed in an individual 8 cm (inner) diameter pipe (called a &quot;technological channel&quot;). The channels also contain the coolant, and are surrounded by graphite.

The RBMK is an early Generation II reactor and the oldest commercial reactor design still in wide operation. Certain aspects of the original RBMK reactor design had several shortcomings, such as the large positive void coefficient, the &#x27;positive scram effect&#x27; of the control rods and instability at low power levels—which contributed to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, in which an RBMK experienced an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction, leading to a steam and hydrogen explosion, large fire, and subsequent core meltdown. Radioactive material was released over a large portion of northern and southern Europe—including Sweden—where evidence of the nuclear disaster was first registered outside of the Soviet Union, and before the Chernobyl accident was finally communicated by the Soviet Union to the rest of the world. The disaster prompted worldwide calls for the reactors to be completely decommissioned; however, there is still considerable reliance on RBMK facilities for power in Russia with the aggregate power of operational units at almost 7 GW of installed capacity. Most of the flaws in the design of RBMK-1000 reactors were corrected after the Chernobyl accident and a dozen reactors have since been operating without any serious incidents for over thirty years.

RBMK reactors may be classified as belonging to one of three distinct generations, according to when the particular reactor was built and brought online:

* Generation 1 – during the early-to-mid 1970s, before OPB-82 General Safety Provisions were introduced in the Soviet Union.
* Generation 2 – during the late 1970s and early 1980s, conforming to the OPB-82 standards issued in 1982.
* Generation 3 – post Chernobyl accident in 1986, where Soviet safety standards were revised to OPB-88; only Smolensk-3 was built to these standards.

Initially the service life was expected to be 30 years, later it was extended to a 45-year lifetime with mid-life refurbishments (such as fixing the issue of the graphite stack deformation), eventually 50 years lifetime was adopted for some units (Kursk 1-3 and 1-4, Leningrad 1-3 and 1-4, Smolensk 1-1, 1-2, 1-3). Efforts are underway to extend the licence of all the units. Leningrad unit 3&#x27;s licence has already been extended from June 2025 to 2030, by an additional five years as per the information given by the operator Rosatom. 

== History ==
The RBMK was the culmination of the Soviet nuclear power program to produce a water-cooled power reactor with dual-use potential based on their graphite-moderated plutonium production military reactors. The first of these, Obninsk AM-1 (&quot;Атом Мирный&quot;, &quot;Atom Mirny&quot;, Russian for &quot;peaceful atom,&quot; analogous to the American Atoms for Peace) generated 5 MW of electricity from 30 MW thermal power, and supplied Obninsk from 1954 until 1959. Subsequent prototypes were the AMB-100 reactor and AMB-200 reactor both at Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station.

By using a minimalist design that used regular (light) water for cooling and graphite for moderation, it was possible to use fuel with a lower enrichment (1.8% enriched uranium instead of considerably more expensive 4% enrichment). This allowed for an extraordinarily large and powerful reactor that could be built rapidly, largely out of parts fabricated on-site instead of by specialized factories. The initial 1000 MWe design also left room for development into yet more powerful reactors. For example, the RBMK reactors at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania were rated at 1500 MWe each, a very large size for the time and even for the early 21st century. For comparison, the EPR has a net electric nameplate capacity of 1600 MW (4500 MWthermal) and is among the most powerful reactor types ever built.

The RBMK-1000&#x27;s design was finalized in 1968. At that time it was the world&#x27;s largest nuclear reactor design, surpassing western designs and the VVER (an earlier Soviet PWR reactor design) in power output and physical size, being 20 times larger by volume than contemporary western reactors. Similarly to CANDU reactors it could be produced without the specialized industry required by the large and thick-walled reactor pressure vessels such as those used by VVER reactors, thus increasing the number of factories capable of manufacturing RBMK reactor components. No prototypes of the RBMK were built; it was put directly into mass production.

The RBMK was proclaimed by some as the national reactor of the Soviet Union, probably due to nationalism because of its unique design, large size and power output. Meanwhile the VVER design was called the &quot;American reactor&quot; due to the pressurized water (PWR) design shared with many Western reactors. A top-secret invention patent for the RBMK design was filed by Anatoly Aleksandrov from the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, who personally took credit for the design of the reactor, with the Soviet patent office. Because a containment building would have needed to be very large and expensive, doubling the cost of each unit, due to the large size of the RBMK, it was originally omitted from the design. It was argued by its designers that the RBMK&#x27;s strategy of having each fuel assembly in its own channel with flowing cooling water, was an acceptable alternative for containment.

The RBMK was mainly designed at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy and , headed by Anatoly Aleksandrov and Nikolai Dollezhal respectively, from 1964 to 1966. The RBMK was favored over the VVER by the Soviet Union due to its ease of manufacture, due to a lack of a large and thick-walled reactor pressure vessel and relatively complex associated steam generators, and its large power output, which would allow the Soviet government to easily meet their central economic planning targets.

The flaws in the original RBMK design were recognized by others, including from within the Kurchatov Institute before the first units were built, but the orders for construction of the first RBMK units, which were at Leningrad, had already been issued in 1966 by the Soviet government by the time their concerns reached the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Council of Ministers. This prompted a sudden overhaul of the RBMK. Plutonium production in an RBMK would have been achieved by operating the reactor under special thermal parameters, but this capability was abandoned early on. This was the design that was finalized in 1968. The redesign did not solve further flaws that were not discovered until years later. Construction of the first RBMK, which was at Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant, began in 1970. Leningrad unit 1 opened in 1973.

At Leningrad it was discovered that the RBMK, due to its high positive void coefficient, became harder to control as the uranium fuel was consumed or burned up, becoming unpredictable by the time it was shut down after three years for maintenance. This made controlling the RBMK a very laborious, mentally and physically demanding task requiring the timely adjustment of dozens of parameters every minute, around the clock, constantly wearing out switches such as those used for the control rods and causing operators to sweat. The enrichment percentage was increased to 2.0%, up from 1.8% to alleviate these issues.

The RBMK was considered by some in the Soviet Union to be already obsolete shortly after the commissioning of Chernobyl unit 1. Aleksandrov and Dollezhal did not investigate further or even deeply understand the problems in the RBMK, and the void coefficient was not analyzed in the manuals for the reactor. Engineers at Chernobyl unit 1 had to create solutions to many of the RBMK&#x27;s flaws such as a lack of protection against no feedwater supply. Leningrad and Chernobyl units 1 both had partial meltdowns that were treated, alongside other nuclear accidents at power plants, as state secrets and so were unknown even to other workers at those same plants.

By 1980 NIKIET realized, after completing a confidential study, that accidents with the RBMK were likely even during normal operation, but no action was taken to correct the RBMK&#x27;s flaws. Instead, manuals were revised, which was believed to be enough to ensure safe operation as long as they were followed closely. However, the manuals were vague and Soviet power plant staff already had a habit of bending the rules in order to meet economic targets, despite inadequate or malfunctioning equipment. Crucially, it was not made clear that a number of control rods had to stay in the reactor at all times in order to protect against an accident, as loosely articulated by the Operational Reactivity Margin (ORM) parameter. An ORM chart recorder and display were added to RBMK control rooms after the Chernobyl disaster.

== Reactor design and performance ==
=== Reactor vessel, moderator and shielding ===



The reactor pit or vault is made of reinforced concrete and has dimensions 21.6 m × 21.6 m × 25.5 m. It houses the vessel of the reactor, which is annular, made of an inner and outer cylindrical wall and top and bottom metal plates that cover the space between the inner and outer walls, without covering the space surrounded by the vessel. The reactor vessel is an annular steel cylinder with hollow walls and pressurized with nitrogen gas, with an inner diameter and height of 14.52 m × 9.7 m, and a wall thickness of 16 mm.

In order to absorb axial thermal expansion loads, it is equipped with two annular bellows compensators, one on the top and another on the bottom, in the spaces between the inner and outer walls. The vessel surrounds the graphite core block stack, which serves as moderator. The graphite stack is kept in a helium-nitrogen mixture, providing an inert atmosphere for the graphite, protecting it from potential fires, and facilitating transfer of excess heat from the graphite to the coolant channels.
The moderator blocks are made of nuclear graphite the dimensions of which are 25 cm × 25 cm on the plane perpendicular to the channels, and with several longitudinal dimensions of between 20 cm and 60 cm depending on the location in the stack. There are holes of 11.4 cm diameter through the longitudinal axis of the blocks for the fuel and control channels. The blocks are stacked, surrounded by the reactor vessel into a cylindrical core with a diameter and height of 14 m × 8 m. The maximum allowed temperature of the graphite is up to 730 °C.

The reactor has an active core region 11.8 m in diameter by 7 m height. There are 1700 tons of graphite blocks in an RBMK-1000 reactor. The pressurized nitrogen in the vessel prevents the escape of the helium-nitrogen mixture used to cool the graphite stack.

The reactor vessel has on its outer side an integral cylindrical annular water tank, a welded structure with 3 cm thick walls, an inner diameter of 16.6 m and an outer diameter of 19 m, internally divided to 16 vertical compartments. The water is supplied to the compartments from the bottom and removed from the top; the water can be used for emergency reactor cooling. The tank contains thermocouples for sensing the water temperature and ion chambers for monitoring the reactor power. The tank, along with an annular sand layer between the outer side of the tank and inner side of the pit, and the relatively thick concrete of the reactor pit serve as lateral biological shields.

The top of the reactor is covered by the upper biological shield (UBS), also called &quot;Schema E&quot;, or, after the explosion (of Chernobyl Reactor 4), &quot;Elena&quot;. The UBS is a cylindrical disc of 3 m × 17 m in size and 2000 tons in weight. It is penetrated by for fuel and control channel assemblies. The top and bottom are covered with 4 cm thick steel plates, welded to be helium-tight, and additionally joined by structural supports. The space between the plates and pipes is filled with serpentinite, a rock containing significant amounts of bound water. The serpentinite provides the radiation shielding of the biological shield and was applied as a special concrete mixture. The disk is supported on 16 rollers, located on the upper side of the reinforced cylindrical water tank. The structure of the UBS supports the fuel and control channels, the floor above the reactor in the central hall, and the steam-water pipes.

Below the bottom of the reactor core there is the lower biological shield (LBS), similar to the UBS, but only 2 m × 14.5 m in size. It is penetrated by the tubes for the lower ends of the pressure channels and carries the weight of the graphite stack and the coolant inlet piping. A steel structure, two heavy plates intersecting in right angle under the center of the LBS and welded to the LBS, supports the LBS and transfers the mechanical load to the building.

Above the UBS, there is a space with upper channel piping and instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) or control and monitoring cabling. Above that is Assembly 11, made up of the upper shield cover or channel covers. Their top surfaces form part of the floor of the reactor hall and serve as part of the biological shield and for thermal insulation of the reactor space. They consist of serpentinite concrete blocks that cover individual removable steel-graphite plugs, located over the tops of the channels, forming what resembles a circle with a grid pattern. The floor above the reactor is thus known by RBMK plant workers as &quot;pyatachok&quot;, referring to the five-kopeck coin. There is one cover (lid/block) per plug, and one plug per channel.

=== Fuel channels ===
The fuel channels consist of welded zircaloy pressure tubes 8 cm in inner diameter with 4 mm thick walls, led through the channels in the center of the graphite moderator blocks. The top and bottom parts of the tubes are made of stainless steel, and joined with the central zircaloy segment with zirconium-steel alloy couplings. The pressure tube is held in the graphite stack channels with two alternating types of 20 mm high split graphite rings. One is in direct contact with the tube and has 1.5 mm clearance to the graphite stack, the other one is directly touching the graphite stack and has 1.3 mm clearance to the tube. This assembly reduces transfer of mechanical loads caused by neutron-induced swelling, thermal expansion of the blocks, and other factors to the pressure tube, while facilitating heat transfer from the graphite blocks. The pressure tubes are welded to the top and bottom plates of the reactor vessel.

While most of the heat energy from the fission process is generated in the fuel rods, approximately 5.5% is deposited in the graphite blocks as they moderate the fast neutrons formed from fission. This energy must be removed to avoid overheating the graphite. About 80–85% of the energy deposited in the graphite is removed by the fuel rod coolant channels, using conduction via the graphite rings. The rest of the graphite heat is removed from the control rod channels by forced gas circulation through the gas circuit.

There are 1693 fuel channels and 170 control rod channels in the first generation RBMK reactor cores. Second generation reactor cores (such as Kursk and Chernobyl 3/4) have 1661 fuel channels and 211 control rod channels.
The fuel assembly is suspended in the fuel channel on a bracket, with a seal plug. The seal plug has a simple design, to facilitate its removal and installation by the remotely controlled online refueling machine.

The fuel channels may, instead of fuel, contain fixed neutron absorbers, or be filled completely with cooling water. They may also contain silicon-filled tubes in place of a fuel assembly, for the purpose of doping for semiconductors. These channels could be identified by their corresponding servo readers, which would be blocked and replaced with the atomic symbol for silicon.

The small clearance between the pressure channel and the graphite block makes the graphite core susceptible to damage. If a pressure channel deforms, for example, by too high an internal pressure, the deformation can cause significant pressure loads on the graphite blocks and lead to damage.

=== Fuel ===

The fuel pellets are made of uranium dioxide powder, sintered with a suitable binder into pellets 11.5 mm in diameter and 15 mm long. The material may contain added europium oxide as a burnable nuclear poison to lower the reactivity differences between a new and partially spent fuel assembly. To reduce thermal expansion issues and interaction with the cladding, the pellets have hemispherical indentations. A 2 mm hole through the axis of the pellet serves to reduce the temperature in the center of the pellet and facilitates removal of gaseous fission products. The enrichment level in 1980 was 2% (0.4% for the end pellets of the assemblies). Maximum allowable temperature of the fuel pellet is 2100 °C.

The fuel rods are zircaloy (1% niobium) tubes 13.6 mm in outer diameter, 0.825 mm thick. The rods are filled with helium at 0.5 MPa and hermetically sealed. Retaining rings help to seat the pellets in the center of the tube and facilitate heat transfer from the pellet to the tube. The pellets are axially held in place by a spring. Each rod contains 3.5 kg of fuel pellets. The fuel rods are 3.64 m long, with 3.4 m of that being the active length. The maximum allowed temperature of a fuel rod is 600 °C.

The fuel assemblies consist of two sets (&quot;sub-assemblies&quot;) with 18 fuel rods and 1 carrier rod. The fuel rods are arranged along the central carrier rod, which has an outer diameter of 1.3 cm. All rods of a fuel assembly are held in place with 10 stainless steel spacers separated by 360 mm distance. The two sub-assemblies are joined with a cylinder at the center of the assembly; during the operation of the reactor, this dead space without fuel lowers the neutron flux in the central plane of the reactor. The total mass of uranium in the fuel assembly is 114.7 kg. The fuel burnup is 20 MW·d/kg. The total length of the fuel assembly is 10.025 m, with 6.862 m of the active region.

In addition to the regular fuel assemblies, there are instrumented ones, containing neutron flux detectors in the central carrier. In this case, the rod is replaced with a tube with wall thickness of 2.5 mm; and outer diameter of 15 mm.

Unlike the rectangular PWR/BWR fuel assemblies or hexagonal VVER fuel assemblies, the RBMK fuel assembly is cylindrical to fit the round pressure channels.

The refueling machine is mounted on a gantry crane and remotely controlled. The fuel assemblies can be replaced without shutting down the reactor, a factor significant for production of weapon-grade plutonium and, in a civilian context, for better reactor uptime. When a fuel assembly has to be replaced, the machine is positioned above the fuel channel: then it mates to the latter, equalizes pressure within, pulls the rod, and inserts a fresh one. The spent rod is then placed in a cooling pond. The capacity of the refueling machine with the reactor at nominal power level is two fuel assemblies per day, with peak capacity of five per day.

The total amount of fuel under stationary conditions is 192 tons. The RBMK core has a relatively low power density at least partly due to the 25 cm spacing between channels and thus fuel assemblies.

=== Control rods ===

Most of the reactor control rods are inserted from above; 24 shortened rods are inserted from below and are used to augment the axial power distribution control of the core. With the exception of 12 automatic rods, the control rods have a 4.5 m long graphite section at the end, separated by a 1.25 m long telescope (which creates a water-filled space between the graphite and the absorber), and a boron carbide neutron absorber section. The role of the graphite section, known as &quot;displacer&quot;, is to enhance the difference between the neutron flux attenuation levels of inserted and retracted rods, as the graphite displaces water that would otherwise act as a neutron absorber, although much weaker than boron carbide. A control rod channel filled with graphite absorbs fewer neutrons than when filled with water, so the difference between inserted and retracted control rod is increased.

When the control rod is fully retracted, the graphite displacer is located in the middle of the core height, with 1.25 m of water at each of its ends. The displacement of water in the lower 1.25 m of the core as the rod moves down could cause a local increase of reactivity in the bottom of the core as the graphite part of the control rod passes that section. This &quot;positive scram&quot; effect was discovered in 1983 at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The control rod channels are cooled by an independent water circuit and kept at 40–70 °C.

The narrow space between the rod and its channel hinders water flow around the rods during their movement and acts as a fluid damper, which is the primary cause of their slow insertion time (nominally 18–21 seconds for the reactor control and protection system rods, or about 0.4 m/s). After the Chernobyl disaster, the control rod servos on other RBMK reactors were exchanged to allow faster rod movements, and even faster movement was achieved by cooling of the control rod channels by a thin layer of water between an inner jacket and the Zircaloy tube of the channel while letting the rods themselves move in gas.

The division of the control rods between manual and emergency protection groups was arbitrary; the rods could be reassigned from one system to another during reactor operation without technical or organizational problems.

Additional static boron-based absorbers are inserted into the core when it is loaded with fresh fuel. About 240 absorbers are added during initial core loading. These absorbers are gradually removed with increasing burnup. The reactor&#x27;s void coefficient depends on the core content; it ranges from negative with all the initial absorbers to positive when they are all removed.

The normal reactivity margin is 43–48 control rods.

=== Gas circuit ===
The reactor operates in a helium–nitrogen atmosphere (70–90% He, 10–30% N2 by volume). The gas circuit is composed of a compressor, aerosol and iodine filters, adsorber for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia, a holding tank for allowing the gaseous radioactive products to decay before being discharged, an aerosol filter to remove solid decay products, and a ventilator stack, the iconic chimney above the space between reactors in second generation RBMKs such as Kursk and Chernobyl 3/4 or some distance away from the reactors in first generation RBMKs such as Kursk and Chernobyl 1/2.

The gas is injected to the core stack from the bottom in a low flow rate, and exits from the standpipe of each channel via an individual pipe. The moisture and temperature of the outlet gas is monitored; an increase of them is an indicator of a coolant leak. A single gas circuit serves two RBMK-1000 reactors or a single RBMK-1500; RBMK reactors were always built in pairs. The gas circuit is housed between two reactors in second generation RBMKs such as Chernobyl 3/4, Kursk 3/4 and Smolensk 1–4.

=== Primary coolant circuit ===

The reactor has two independent cooling circuits, each having four main circulating pumps (three operating, one standby) that service one half of the reactor. The cooling water is fed to the reactor through lower water lines to a common pressure header (one for each cooling circuit), which is split to 22 group distribution headers, each feeding 38–41 pressure channels through the core, where the coolant boils. The mixture of steam and water is led by the upper steam lines, one for each pressure channel, from the reactor top to the steam separators, pairs of thick horizontal drums located in side compartments above the reactor top; each has diameter, length, wall thickness of , and weighs .

Steam, with steam quality of about 15%, is taken from the top of the separators by two steam collectors per separator, combined, and led to two turbogenerators in the turbine hall, then to condensers, reheated to , and pumped by the condensate pumps to deaerators, where remains of gaseous phase and corrosion-inducing gases are removed. The resulting feedwater is led to the steam separators by feedwater pumps and mixed with water from them at their outlets. From the bottom of the steam separators, the feedwater is led by 12 downpipes (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.

The turbine consists of one high-pressure rotor (cylinder) and four low-pressure ones. Five low-pressure separators-preheaters are used to heat steam with fresh steam before being fed to the next stage of the turbine. The uncondensed steam is fed into a condenser, mixed with condensate from the separators, fed by the first-stage condensate pump to a chemical (ion-exchange) purifier, then by a second-stage condensate pump to four deaerators where dissolved and entrained gases are removed; deaerators also serve as storage tanks for feedwater. From the deaerators, the water is pumped through filters and into the bottom parts of the steam separator drums.

The main circulating pumps have the capacity of 5,500–12,000 m3/h and are powered by 6 kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000 m3/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6,000–7,000 m3/h when the reactor power is below 500 MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow control valve so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.

The nominal coolant flow through the reactor is 46,000–48,000 m3/h. The steam flow at full power is /h.

The nominal temperature of the coolant at the inlet of the reactor is about and the outlet temperature , at pressure in the drum separator and reactor of . The pressure and the inlet temperature determine the height at which the boiling begins in the reactor; if the coolant temperature is not sufficiently below its boiling point at the system pressure, the boiling starts at the very bottom part of the reactor instead of its higher parts. With few absorbers in the reactor core, such as during the Chernobyl accident, the positive void coefficient of the reactor makes the reactor very sensitive to the feedwater temperature. Bubbles of boiling water lead to increased power, which in turn increases the formation of bubbles.

If the coolant temperature is too close to its boiling point, cavitation can occur in the pumps and their operation can become erratic or even stop entirely. The feedwater temperature is dependent on the steam production; the steam phase portion is led to the turbines and condensers and returns significantly cooler () than the water returning directly from the steam separator (284 °C). At low reactor power, therefore, the inlet temperature may become dangerously high. The water is kept below the saturation temperature to prevent film boiling and the associated drop in heat transfer rate.

The reactor is tripped in cases of high or low water level in the steam separators (with two selectable low-level thresholds); high steam pressure; low feedwater flow; loss of two main coolant pumps on either side. These trips can be manually disabled.

The level of water in the steam separators, the percentage of steam in the reactor pressure tubes, the level at which the water begins to boil in the reactor core, the neutron flux and power distribution in the reactor, and the feedwater flow through the core have to be carefully controlled. The level of water in the steam separator is mainly controlled by the feedwater supply, with the deaerator tanks serving as a water reservoir.

The maximum allowed heat-up rate of the reactor and the coolant is /h; the maximum cool-down rate is /h.

=== ECCS ===
The reactor is equipped with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS), consisting of dedicated water reserve tank, hydraulic accumulators, and pumps. ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the coolant system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.

The short-term ECCS subsystem consists of two groups of six accumulator tanks, containing water blanketed with nitrogen under pressure of , connected by fast-acting valves to the reactor. Each group can supply 50% of the maximum coolant flow to the damaged half of the reactor. The third group is a set of electrical pumps drawing water from the deaerators. The short-term pumps can be powered by the spindown of the main turbogenerators.

ECCS for long-term cooling of the damaged circuit consists of three pairs of electrical pumps, drawing water from the pressure suppression pools; the water is cooled by the plant service water by means of heat exchangers in the suction lines. Each pair is able to supply half of the maximum coolant flow. ECCS for long-term cooling of the intact circuit consists of three separate pumps drawing water from the condensate storage tanks, each able to supply half of the maximum flow. The ECCS pumps are powered from the essential internal 6 kV lines, backed up by diesel generators. Some valves that require uninterrupted power are also backed up by batteries.

=== Reactor control/supervision systems ===
The distribution of power density in the reactor is measured by ionization chambers located inside and outside the core. The physical power density distribution control system (PPDDCS) has sensors inside the core; the reactor control and protection system (RCPS) uses sensors in the core and in the lateral biological shield tank. The external sensors in the tank are located around the reactor middle plane, therefore do not indicate axial power distribution nor information about the power in the central part of the core. 

There are over 100 radial and 12 axial power distribution monitors, employing self-powered detectors. Reactivity meters and removable startup chambers are used for monitoring of reactor startup. Total reactor power is recorded as the sum of the currents of the lateral ionization chambers. The moisture and temperature of the gas circulating in the channels is monitored by the pressure tube integrity monitoring system.

The PPDDCS and RCPS are supposed to complement each other. The RCPS system consists of 211 movable control rods. Both systems, however, have deficiencies, most noticeably at low reactor power levels. The PPDDCS is designed to maintain reactor power density distribution between 10 and 120% of nominal levels and to control the total reactor power between 5 and 120% of nominal levels. The LAC-LAP (local automatic control and local automatic protection) RPCS subsystems rely on ionization chambers inside the reactor and are active at power levels above 10%.

Below those levels, the automatic systems are disabled and the in-core sensors are not accessible. Without the automatic systems and relying only on the lateral ionization chambers, control of the reactor becomes very difficult; the operators do not have sufficient data to control the reactor reliably and have to rely on their intuition. During startup of a reactor with a poison-free core this lack of information can be manageable because the reactor behaves predictably, but a non-uniformly poisoned core can cause large nonhomogenities of power distribution, with potentially catastrophic results.

The reactor emergency protection system (EPS) was designed to shut down the reactor when its operational parameters are exceeded. The design accounted for steam collapse in the core when the fuel element temperature falls below 265 °C, coolant vaporization in fuel channels in cold reactor state, and sticking of some emergency protection rods. However, the slow insertion speed of the control rods, together with their design causing localized positive reactivity as the displacer moves through the lower part of the core, created a number of possible situations where initiation of the EPS could itself cause or aggravate a reactor runaway.

The SKALA or SCALA computer system for calculation of the reactivity margin was collecting data from about 4,000 sources. Its purpose was to assist the operator with steady-state control of the reactor. Ten to fifteen minutes were required to cycle through all the measurements and calculate the results. SKALA could not control the reactor, instead it only made recommendations to the operators, and it used 1960s computer technology.

The operators could disable some safety systems, reset or suppress some alarm signals, and bypass automatic scram, by attaching patch cables to accessible terminals. This practice was allowed under some circumstances.

The reactor is equipped with a fuel rod leak detector. A scintillation counter detector, sensitive to energies of short-lived fission products, is mounted on a special dolly and moved over the outlets of the fuel channels, issuing an alert if increased radioactivity is detected in the steam-water flow.

In RBMK control rooms there are two large panels or mimic displays representing a top view of the reactor. One display is made up mostly or completely (in first generation RBMKs) of colored dials or rod position indicators: these dials represent the position of the control rods inside the reactor and the color of the housing of the dials matches that of the control rods, whose colors correspond to their function, for example, red for automatic control rods. The other display is a core map or core channel cartogram and is circular, is made of tiles, and represents every channel on the reactor. Each tile is made of a single light cover with a channel number and an incandescent light bulb, and each light bulb illuminates to represent out-of-spec (higher or lower than normal) channel parameters.

Operators have to type in the number of the affected channel(s) and then view the instruments to find exactly what parameters are out of spec. The core map represented information from the SKALA computer. Each unit had its own computer housed in a separate room. The control room also has chart or trend recorders. Some RBMK control rooms have been upgraded with video walls that replace the mimic displays and most chart recorders and eliminate the need to type in channel numbers and instead operators lay a cursor over a (now representative) tile to reveal its parameters that are shown on the lower side of the video wall. The control room is located below the floor of the deaerator room. Both rooms are in the space between the reactor and turbine buildings.

=== Containment ===
The RBMK design was built primarily to be powerful, quick to build and easy to maintain. Full physical containment structures for each reactor would have more than doubled the cost and construction time of each plant, and since the design had been certified by the Soviet nuclear science ministry as inherently safe when operated within established parameters, the Soviet authorities assumed proper adherence to doctrine by workers would make any accident impossible. RBMK reactors were designed to allow fuel rods to be changed at full power without shutting down, as in the pressurized heavy water CANDU reactor, both for refueling and for plutonium production for nuclear weapons. This required large cranes above the core.

As the RBMK reactor core is very tall (about ), the cost and difficulty of building a heavy containment structure prevented the building of additional emergency containment structures for pipes on top of the reactor core. In the Chernobyl accident, the pressure rose to levels high enough to blow the top off the reactor, breaking open the fuel channels in the process and starting a massive fire when air contacted the superheated graphite core. After the Chernobyl accident, some RBMK reactors were retrofitted with a partial containment structure, in lieu of a full containment building, which surround the fuel channels with water jackets in order to capture any radioactive particles released.

The bottom part of the reactor is enclosed in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances of a large number of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools (&quot;bubbler&quot; pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate (&quot;Structure E&quot;, after the explosion nicknamed &quot;Elena&quot;, not to be confused with the Russian ELENA reactor), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core.

The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of . The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header.

Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.

Hydrogen removal from the leaktight compartment is performed by removal of /hour of air, its filtration, and discharge into the atmosphere. The air removal is stopped automatically in case of a coolant leak and has to be reinstated manually. Hydrogen is present during normal operation due to leaks of coolant (assumed to be up to per hour).

=== Other systems ===
For the nuclear systems described here, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is used as the example.

==== Electrical systems ====
The power plant is connected to the 330 kV and 750 kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750 kV grid by a single generator transformer. The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant&#x27;s own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the generator transformer to also feed power to the grid. The 330 kV line is normally not used, and serves as an external power supply, connected by a station transformer to the power plant&#x27;s electrical systems.

The plant can be powered by its own generators, or get power from the 750 kV grid through the generator transformer, or from the 330 kV grid via the station transformer, or from the other power plant block via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems can be powered by diesel generators. Each unit transformer is connected to two 6 kV main power boards, A and B (e.g. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal non-essential drivers and connected to transformers for the 4 kV main power and the 4 kV reserve busbar.

The 7A, 7B, and 8B boards are also connected to the three essential power lines, namely for the coolant pumps, each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by the spinning down turbogenerators for about 45–50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start up. The generators are started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.

==== Turbogenerators ====
The electrical energy is generated by a pair of 500 MW hydrogen-cooled turbogenerators. These are located in the -long machine hall, adjacent to the reactor building. The turbines, the venerable five-cylinder K-500-65/3000, are supplied by the Kharkiv turbine plant. The electrical generators are the TVV-500. The turbine and the generator rotors are mounted on the same shaft. The combined weight of the rotors is almost and their nominal rotational speed is 3000 rpm.

The turbogenerator is long and its total weight is . The coolant flow for each turbine is /h. The generator produces 20 kV 50 Hz AC power. The generator&#x27;s stator is cooled by water while its rotor is cooled by hydrogen. The hydrogen for the generators is manufactured on-site by electrolysis. The design and reliability of the turbines earned them the State Prize of Ukraine for 1979.

The Kharkiv turbine plant (now Turboatom) later developed a new version of the turbine, K-500-65/3000-2, in an attempt to reduce use of valuable metal. The Chernobyl plant was equipped with both types of turbines; Block 4 had the newer ones.

===Design variants===
====RBMK-1500====
The primary difference between RBMK-1000 and RBMK-1500 reactors is that the RBMK-1500 is cooled with less water, which adopts a helical laminar flow instead of a linear laminar flow through the channels. The RBMK-1500 also uses less uranium. The helical flow is created by turbulators in the fuel assembly and increases heat removal. Because of the RBMK&#x27;s positive void coefficient, the reduced cooling water volume causes a higher power output. As the name suggests, it was designed for an electrical power output of 1500 MW. The only reactors of this type and power output are the ones at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant.

====RBMK-2000 and RBMK-3600====
The RBMK-2000 and RBMK-3600 were designed to produce 2000 and 3600 MW of electrical power respectively. The RBMK-2000 would have had an increased channel diameter and number of fuel rods per fuel assembly while maintaining the same dimensions of the reactor core as the RBMK-1000 and RBMK-1500. The RBMK-3600 presumably similarly to the RBMK-1500 would have added turbulators to the RBMK-2000 design to increase heat removal.

====RBMKP-2400====
The is rectangular instead of cylindrical, and it was a modular, theoretically infinitely longitudinally expandable design with vertical steam separators, intended to be made in sections at a factory for assembly in situ. It was designed to have a power output of 2400 MWe, and a higher thermal efficiency due to steam superheating directly in the reactor core in special fuel channels with fuel rods with stainless steel cladding instead of the more common Zircaloy cladding, for a steam outlet temperature of 450 °C. No reactor with this power output has ever been built, with the most powerful one currently being as of 2018 the 1750 MWe EPR. The development of this design was cancelled in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. An RBMKP-4800 would have had an increased number of evaporating and superheating channels thus increasing power output. Two RBMKP-2400s were planned for the Kostroma Nuclear Power Plant.

== Design flaws and safety issues ==
As an early Generation II reactor based on 1950s Soviet technology, the RBMK design was optimized for speed of production but sacrificed redundancy. Several of its design characteristics would prove to be dangerously unstable when operated outside their design specifications. The decision to use a graphite core with natural uranium fuel allowed for massive power generation at only a quarter of the expense of heavy water reactors, which were more maintenance-intensive and required large volumes of expensive heavy water for startup. However, its unintended consequences would not reveal themselves fully until the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.

=== High positive void coefficient ===
Light water (ordinary H2O) is both a neutron moderator and a neutron absorber. This means that not only can it slow down neutrons to velocities in equilibrium with surrounding molecules (&quot;thermalize&quot; them and turn them into low-energy neutrons, known as thermal neutrons, that are far more likely to interact with the uranium-235 nuclei than the fast neutrons produced by fission initially), but it also absorbs some of them.

In the RBMK series of reactors, light water functions as a coolant, while moderation is mainly carried out by graphite. As graphite already moderates neutrons, light water has a lesser effect in slowing them down, but could still absorb them. This means that the reactor&#x27;s reactivity (adjustable by appropriate neutron-absorbing rods) must take into account the neutrons absorbed by light water.
In the case of vaporisation of water to steam, the place occupied by water would be occupied by water vapor, which has a density vastly lower than that of liquid water (the exact number depends on pressure and temperature; at standard conditions, steam is about as dense as liquid water). Because of this lower density (of mass, and consequently of atom nuclei able to absorb neutrons), light water&#x27;s neutron-absorption capability practically disappears when it boils. This allows more neutrons to fission more U-235 nuclei and thereby increase the reactor power, which leads to higher temperatures that boil even more water, creating a thermal feedback loop.

In RBMK reactors, generation of steam in the coolant water would then in practice create a void: a bubble that does not absorb neutrons. The reduction in moderation by light water is irrelevant, as graphite still moderates the neutrons. However, the loss of absorption dramatically alters the balance of neutron production, causing a runaway condition in which more and more neutrons are produced, and their density grows exponentially. Such a condition is called a &quot;positive void coefficient&quot;, and the RBMK reactor series has the highest positive void coefficient of any commercial reactor ever designed.

A high void coefficient does not necessarily make a reactor inherently unsafe, as some of the fission neutrons are emitted with a delay of seconds or even minutes (post-fission neutron emission from daughter nuclei), and therefore steps can be taken to reduce the fission rate before it becomes too high. This situation, however, does make it considerably harder to control the reactor, especially at low power. Thus, control systems must be very reliable and control-room personnel must be rigorously trained in the peculiarities and limits of the system. Neither of these requirements were in place at Chernobyl: since the reactor&#x27;s actual design bore the approval stamp of the Kurchatov Institute and was considered a state secret, discussion of the reactor&#x27;s flaws was forbidden, even among the actual personnel operating the plant. Some later RBMK designs did include control rods on electromagnetic grapples, thus controlling the reaction speed and, if necessary, stopping the reaction completely. The RBMK reactor at Chernobyl, however, had manual clutch control rods.

All RBMK reactors underwent significant changes following the Chernobyl disaster. The positive void coefficient was reduced from +4.5 β to +0.7 β, decreasing the likelihood of further reactivity accidents, at the cost of higher enrichment requirements of the uranium fuel.

=== Improvements since the Chernobyl accident ===
In his posthumously published memoirs, Valery Legasov, the First Deputy Director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, revealed that the institute&#x27;s scientists had long known that the RBMK had significant design flaws. Legasov&#x27;s suicide in 1988, following frustrated attempts to promote nuclear and industrial safety reform, caused shockwaves throughout the scientific community. The RBMK&#x27;s design problems were discussed increasingly openly.

Following the accident at Chernobyl, all remaining RBMK reactors were retrofitted with a number of updates for safety. The largest of these updates fixed the RBMK control rod design. The control rods have graphite displacers, which prevent coolant water from entering the space vacated as the rods are withdrawn. In the original design, those displacers, being shorter than the height of the core, left columns of water at the bottom (and at the top) when the rods were fully extracted.

During insertion, the graphite would first displace that lower water, locally increasing reactivity. Also, when the rods were in their uppermost position, the absorber ends were outside the core, requiring a relatively large displacement before achieving a significant reduction in reactivity. These design flaws were likely the final trigger of the first explosion of the Chernobyl accident, causing the lower part of the core to become prompt critical when the operators tried to shut down the highly destabilized reactor by reinserting the rods. The updates are:

*An increase in fuel enrichment from 2% to 2.4% to compensate for control rod modifications and the introduction of additional absorbers.
*Manual control rod count increased from 30 to 45.
*80 additional absorbers inhibit operation at low power, where the RBMK design is most dangerous.
* AZ-5 (emergency reactor shutdown or SCRAM) sequence reduced from 18 to 12 seconds.
* Addition of the БАЗ or BAZ* system, (rapid reactor emergency protection) which would insert 24 uniformly distributed rods into the reactor core via a modified drive mechanism within 1.8 to 2.5 seconds.
*Precautions against unauthorized access to emergency safety systems.

In addition, RELAP5-3D models of RBMK-1500 reactors were developed for use in integrated thermal-hydraulics-neutronics calculations for the analysis of specific transients in which the neutronic response of the core is important.

*BAZ button is intended as a preemptive measure to bring down reactivity before AZ-5 is activated, to enable the safe and stable emergency shutdown of a RBMK.

=== Deformed graphite moderator blocks ===
From May 2012 to December 2013, Leningrad-1 was offline while repairs were made related to deformed graphite moderator blocks. The 18-month project included research and the development of maintenance machines and monitoring systems. Similar work will be applied to the remaining operational RBMKs. Graphite moderator blocks in the RBMK can be repaired and replaced in situ, unlike in the other current large graphite moderated reactor, the advanced gas-cooled reactor.

Longitudinal cutting in some of the graphite columns during lifetime extension refurbishment work can return the graphite stack to its initial design geometry.

== Further development ==

A post-Soviet redesign of the RBMK is the MKER (Russian: &quot;МКЭР&quot;, &quot;Многопетлевой Канальный Энергетический Реактор&quot; [Mnogopetlevoy Kanalniy Energeticheskiy Reaktor], which means &quot;Multi-loop pressure tube power reactor&quot;), with improved safety and a containment building. A MKER-800, MKER-1000 and MKER-1500 were planned for the Leningrad nuclear power plant.

== List of RBMK reactors ==

Color key:


A graphite-moderated Magnox reactor exists in North Korea at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. While the gas cooled Magnox, AGR and pebble bed reactors (Such as the Dragon reactor at Winfrith) use graphite as moderators their use of gases (carbon dioxide for Magnox and AGR, while helium for Dragon) as heat transfer fluids causes them to have no void coefficient.

== Known incidents ==
Many incidents occurred at various power plants operating the RBMK reactor. Most of them were covered up by the USSR government. These are some of the known incidents at the RBMK reactors:

* Explosion of a tank holding radioactive gases at the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant unit 1 in January 1975
* Partial meltdown at Leningrad unit 1 in 1975
* Power outage at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in 1980
* Partial meltdown at Chernobyl unit 1 in 1982
* Discovery of the positive scram effect at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant unit 1 in 1983
* Shifting of the concrete cross bars at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant units 3 and 4 in 1984
* Chernobyl disaster in 1986
* Turbine fire at Chernobyl unit 2 in 1991 resulting in its permanent shutdown

<doc id="213091" wikidata="Q1146264" url="?curid=213091" title="Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat">
<text>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is a sung-through musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, based on the character of Joseph from the Bible&#x27;s Book of Genesis. This was the first Lloyd Webber and Rice musical to be performed publicly; their first collaboration, &quot;The Likes of Us&quot;, written in 1965, was not performed until 2005. Its family-friendly retelling of Joseph, familiar themes, and catchy music have resulted in numerous stagings. According to the owner of the copyright, the Really Useful Group, by 2008 more than 20,000 schools and amateur theatre groups had staged productions.

&quot;Joseph&quot; was first presented as a 15-minute &quot;pop cantata&quot; at Colet Court School in London in 1968, and was published by Novello and recorded in an expanded form by Decca Records in 1969. After the success of the next Lloyd Webber and Rice piece, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;Joseph&quot; received amateur stage productions in the US beginning in 1970, and the first American release of the album was in 1971. The musical had its professional premiere, as a 35-minute musical, at the Haymarket ice rink during the Edinburgh International Festival in 1972. It was Part Two of &quot;Bible One&quot;, a Young Vic Theatre Company production presented by the National Theatre of Great Britain. While still undergoing various modifications and expansions, the musical was produced in the West End in 1973. In 1974, its full modern format was performed at the Haymarket Theatre in Leicester and was also recorded that year. The musical was mounted on Broadway in 1982. Several major revivals, national tours, and a 1999 direct-to-video film starring Donny Osmond followed.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
&quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; is based on the story of Joseph from the Book of Genesis.

A narrator opens the show by introducing Joseph, the dreamer (&quot;Prologue&quot;). Joseph sings an inspiring, but seemingly meaningless song to the audience (&quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;). The narrator then draws the audience&#x27;s attention to Joseph&#x27;s father Jacob and his 12 sons (&quot;Jacob and Sons&quot;). Jacob favours Joseph over his other sons, and he gives Joseph a multicoloured coat to show his affection for him. Joseph is ecstatic about this gift (&quot;Joseph&#x27;s Coat&quot;), while his brothers look on with jealousy.

The brothers’ jealousy is compounded by Joseph&#x27;s dreams, which suggest that he is destined to rule over them (&quot;Joseph&#x27;s Dreams&quot;). To stop this from happening, they try to kill him by throwing him down a pit, before changing their minds and selling him as a slave to some passing Ishmaelites. The narrator comments on how powerless Joseph was to stop this (&quot;Poor, Poor Joseph&quot;).

To hide what they have done, Joseph&#x27;s brothers and their wives tell Jacob that his beloved son has been killed. As proof, they show him Joseph&#x27;s coat, which they have torn to pieces and covered in goat&#x27;s blood (&quot;One More Angel in Heaven&quot;). When the devastated Jacob exits, the brothers and wives cheerfully celebrate Joseph&#x27;s departure (&quot;Hoedown&quot;).

Meanwhile, Joseph is taken to Egypt, where he is bought as a slave by the wealthy Potiphar. He works hard and is promoted, eventually running the household. Joseph catches the eye of Mrs Potiphar and although he turns down her advances, Potiphar sees them together and jumps to the wrong conclusion (&quot;Potiphar&quot;). Enraged, he throws Joseph in jail.

A heartbroken Joseph laments his situation (&quot;Close Every Door&quot;). Two prisoners, both former servants of the Pharaoh, are put in his cell. Joseph interprets their strange dreams and predicts the butler will return to Pharaoh&#x27;s service, while the baker will be executed. As Joseph questions his predictions, the other prisoners encourage Joseph to follow his own dreams (&quot;Go, Go Joseph&quot;).

===Act II===
The Narrator opens the second act with news that the Egyptian populace has been plagued by dreams that no one can interpret (&quot;Pharaoh Story&quot;). The butler, now freed and again serving Pharaoh, tells him of Joseph&#x27;s skill at deciphering dreams (&quot;Poor, Poor Pharaoh&quot;). Pharaoh has Joseph brought to him and describes his dreams, one involving seven fat cows, being devoured by seven skinny cows, and another about seven healthy ears of corn, similarly being devoured by seven withered ears of corn (&quot;Song of the King&quot;).

Joseph declares that Egypt will see seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by an equal period of severe famine, and that Pharoah must select a man to help Egypt prepare for the famine (&quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Dreams Explained&quot;). Impressed with what he hears, Pharaoh pardons and frees Joseph, makes him his second-in-command, and puts him in charge of famine preparations. As the seven plentiful years end, and the seven years of famine begins, Egypt, under Joseph&#x27;s leadership, manages to persevere (&quot;Stone the Crows&quot;).

Meanwhile, Joseph&#x27;s family back home is now starving and poor, having lost their farm and living off scraps in a brothel. Joseph&#x27;s brothers regret what they did to him and how they lied to their father, thinking that things might have turned out differently if Joseph was still with them (&quot;Those Canaan Days&quot;). Hearing that Egypt still has food, they travel there to beg for supplies (&quot;The Brothers Come to Egypt&quot;).

In Egypt, the brothers beg for food from Joseph, not recognizing him, and Joseph realizes that as the brothers bow before him this is the dream he had years ago coming true. He initially suggests the brothers might be spies, but they sincerely insist they&#x27;re struggling (&quot;Grovel, Grovel&quot;). Joseph gives them sacks of food, but plants a golden cup in the one belonging to Benjamin, his youngest brother. When the brothers attempt to depart, Joseph stops them, accusing them of theft. Each brother empties his sack (&quot;Who&#x27;s the Thief?&quot;), and when the cup is found in Benjamin&#x27;s sack Joseph accuses him of stealing. The other brothers beg Joseph to take them prisoner instead and let Benjamin go free (&quot;Benjamin Calypso&quot;).

Joseph sees that his brothers have changed and reveals who he really is (&quot;Joseph All the Time&quot;), then sends for Jacob (&quot;Jacob in Egypt&quot;). Upon meeting Jacob for the first time in years, Joseph sings &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; again, and the lyrics are revealed to be a vague overview of the story. Jacob returns Joseph&#x27;s coat to him, now fully repaired (&quot;Give Me My Coloured Coat&quot;)

In some productions, the cast perform a medley of songs from the show as they take their bows (&quot;Joseph Megamix&quot;).

== Production ==
=== Development and early vocal performances, publication, and recordings 1968–1971===
The 17-year-old budding musical-theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber was contacted by the 20-year-old aspiring pop-songwriter Tim Rice in 1965, and they created their first musical, &quot;The Likes of Us&quot;. They produced a demo tape of that work in 1966, but the project failed to gain a backer.

In the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webber family who had assisted on &quot;The Likes of Us&quot; and who was the music teacher at the Colet Court school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school&#x27;s choir. Doggett requested a &quot;pop cantata&quot; along the lines of Herbert Chappell&#x27;s &quot;The Daniel Jazz&quot; (1963) and Michael Hurd&#x27;s &quot;Jonah-Man Jazz&quot; (1966), both of which had been published by Novello and were based on the Old Testament. The request for the new piece came with a 100-guinea advance from Novello. This resulted in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph, in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles.

The piece was first presented as a 15-minute pop cantata at Colet Court School in London on 1 March 1968. Lloyd Webber&#x27;s composer father William arranged for a second performance at his church, Methodist Central Hall, with a revised and expanded 20-minute format; the boys of Colet Court and members of the band Mixed Bag sang at this performance in May 1968. One of the children&#x27;s parents in that audience was Derek Jewell, a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; music critic; he reviewed the piece in the newspaper, calling it a new pop oratorio and praising its innovation and exuberance. By its third performance, at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in November 1968, the musical had been expanded to 35 minutes.

Novello published the lyrics and sheet music of the 20-minute version at the beginning of 1969, as the third of their Old Testament pop cantatas. Decca Records, which had already recorded the St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral version of the musical in the summer of 1968, released the recording in 1969, credited to the Joseph Consortium, following the Novello publication. David Daltrey, front man of British psychedelic band Tales of Justine, played the role of Joseph and lead guitar, and Tim Rice was Pharaoh. Other vocalists included members of the Mixed Bag group, such as Terry Saunders and Malcolm Parry, and the choir of Colet Court School.

A 32-minute recording of the musical with 19 tracks was issued in the US on Scepter Records in 1971. It was a reissue of the 1969 Decca UK album, capitalising on the success of 1970&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in the US. It featured Daltrey as Joseph, Rice as Pharaoh, William S. Lloyd Webber on the Hammond organ, Alan Doggett conducting, and the Colet Court choir as the chorus.

===Early stage performances ===

====First American amateur productions 1970–1973====
Lloyd Webber and Rice used the popularity of their subsequent musical, the rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, to promote &quot;Joseph&quot;, which was advertised in America as a &quot;follow-up&quot; to &quot;Superstar&quot;. The rock opera&#x27;s title song &quot;Superstar&quot; had been an international hit single released in late 1969, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How To Love Him&quot;, another hit from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, was released 1 May 1970. The first American production of &quot;Joseph&quot; was an amateur stage production in May 1970, at Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Douglaston, Queens, New York City. Following this, other schools and colleges sought to produce the piece.

====Young Vic UK production and move to West End and Leicester 1972–1974====
In late August and September 1972, &quot;Joseph&quot; was presented at the Edinburgh International Festival by the Young Vic Theatre Company, directed by Frank Dunlop. It starred Gary Bond in the title role, Peter Reeves as the narrator, and Gordon Waller as Pharaoh; Alan Doggett was the music director. In October the production played at London&#x27;s Young Vic Theatre, and in November at the Roundhouse. The production was part of a double bill called &quot;Bible One: Two Looks at the Book of Genesis&quot;. Part I was Dunlop&#x27;s reworking of the first six of the medieval Wakefield Mystery Plays, with music by Alan Doggett. Part II was &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. This production of &quot;Joseph&quot;, still a 35-minute musical, was also broadcast in the UK by Granada Television in 1972.

In February 1973, theatre producer Michael White and impresario Robert Stigwood mounted a further expanded version of the Young Vic production at the Albery Theatre in the West End, where it ran for 243 performances. This Young Vic production of &quot;Joseph&quot; was recorded for an LP released on the RSO label in 1973. The mystery plays that had preceded the original Young Vic productions were dropped, and instead the musical was preceded by a piece called &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Journey&quot;, with music and lyrics by Lloyd Webber and Rice and a book by television comedy writers Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which contained a great deal of spoken dialogue, was eventually phased out in favour of a sung-through score that became part of &quot;Joseph&quot;. The first production of the show in its modern, final form was at the Haymarket Theatre in Leicester, which presented the musical several times from 1974 through 1978.

====English Cast charts====
====Irish productions, 1974–1978====
Starting in 1974, Irish stage and screen producer Noel Pearson mounted an Irish production of &quot;Joseph&quot;, starring Tony Kenny in the title role and with Pearson playing Jacob, which ran off-and-on for several years on several stages, starting in the Olympia Theatre in Dublin, moving on to the Cork Opera House for a two-week run, then to Limerick and then the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, followed by several other venues over the next 4 years. A cast recording was produced by Ram Records.

===Professional US productions, including Broadway, 1974–1984===
In 1974, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; was performed at the Playhouse in the Park in Philadelphia. The musical ran at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in 1976 and in 1977 as &quot;holiday fare&quot;. In the 1976 production, which opened on 30 December, direction was by Frank Dunlop, with a cast that featured Cleavon Little as the Narrator and David-James Carroll as Joseph. In the 1977 production, running in December through 1 January 1978, staging was by Graciela Daniele, with Carroll as Joseph, Alan Weeks as the Narrator and William Parry as Pharaoh/Elvis. In 1979, &quot;Joseph&quot; made its Connecticut debut at the historic Downtown Cabaret Theatre ahead of moving to New York City.

&quot;Joseph&quot; received an Off-Broadway production at the Entermedia Theatre, running from 18 November 1981 through 24 January 1982. Directed by Tony Tanner, the cast starred Bill Hutton as Joseph, Laurie Beechman as the Narrator, and Tom Carder as Pharaoh.

The production transferred to Broadway at the Royale Theatre on 27 January 1982 and ran through 4 September 1983, with 747 performances. Judith Dolan designed costumes for the production. This production was recorded on the Chrysalis label, and is the first to feature the Prologue (dubbed on the Chrysalis release &quot;You are what you feel&quot;). The producers were Gail Berman and Susan Rose, who were the youngest producers on Broadway. The show received six Tony Award nominations including Best Musical and Best Original Score but won none. Allen Fawcett replaced Hutton as Joseph in June 1982. David Cassidy took over the role of Joseph in March 1983 and also performed in the touring cast in 1983–1984.

===1990s===
With Jason Donovan in the lead, the expanded show was restaged in 1991 at the London Palladium with Steven Pimlott as director and Anthony Van Laast as choreographer, winning the 1992 Laurence Olivier Award for set design. The cast album of this production was the #1 UK album for two weeks in September 1991, and the single &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; from it was also the #1 UK single for two weeks in June–July 1991. When Donovan left, former children&#x27;s TV presenter Phillip Schofield portrayed Joseph. Darren Day would take up the role in 1993.

The musical opened in Toronto at the Elgin Theatre in June, 1992 until September that same year, with Donny Osmond as Joseph and Janet Metz as the Narrator. Following five years in the role, Osmond was succeeded by David Burnham as Joseph.

A major Australian production, based on the 1991 UK version, opened on 31 December 1992 at the State Theatre in Melbourne. It featured Indecent Obsession lead singer David Dixon as Joseph and Tina Arena as the Narrator. The musical then played seasons in Brisbane and Sydney through 1993.

The show was revived in the United States in 1993, playing in Los Angeles at the Pantages Theatre for 18 weeks, and in San Francisco at the Golden Gate Theatre for an 8-week run, before moving to Broadway, where it played for 231 performances at the Minskoff Theatre from 10 November 1993 to 29 May 1994. The cast featured Michael Damian (Joseph), Kelli Rabke (Narrator), Clifford David (Jacob), and Robert Torti (Pharaoh). Patrick Cassidy and Debbie Gibson performed 16 shows between 6–16 December 1999, at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago, IL. 29 students from Lake Bluff Middle School performed as part of the dream Choir.

===2000s===
A production starring Stephen Gately previewed in Oxford in December 2002, before moving to Liverpool over Christmas 2002. This production reached the West End at the New London Theatre in March 2003. Ian &quot;H&quot; Watkins took over the role of Joseph in 2005.

A US national tour began in September 2005 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, starring Patrick Cassidy. A 2007 revival of the London Palladium production at the Adelphi Theatre starred a &quot;Joseph&quot; cast with the winner of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;, presided over by Lloyd Webber. This was the second reality talent show to search for a West End star, capitalising on the success of the 2006 BBC–Lloyd Webber series, &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?&quot;. Viewers voted for Lee Mead as Joseph. Mead had previously played both Levi and Pharaoh in the 2005 UK Touring production. Mead had given up his ensemble role in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, where he also understudied Raoul. The new &quot;Joseph&quot; production, which began on 6 July 2007, used Steven Pimlott&#x27;s original direction (Pimlott had died since staging the Palladium production), with Preeya Kalidas as the Narrator. &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; finalist Lewis Bradley played Joseph for several shows in 2008 whilst Mead was on holiday. Gareth Gates took over the role in 2009.

&quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; contestant, Craig Chalmers was cast in the 2007 UK Tour alongside fellow contestant, Keith Jack as the Narrator. Chris Barton another contestant starred as Benjamin as well as Joseph in several performances. &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; contestant Antony Hansen took over the role of Joseph in 2009.

===2010s===
The long-running UK touring production was re-cast in 2010 with Keith Jack taking on Joseph in July 2010 opposite Jennifer Potts as the Narrator.

A new North American touring production began on 4 March 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio starring Diana DeGarmo as the Narrator and Ace Young as Joseph.

The 2013 UK touring production starred Ian &quot;H&quot; Watkins as Joseph, who had previously playing the role in the West End in 2005. Former X-Factor star Lloyd Daniels, appeared in the 2014 UK Tour as Joseph with Danielle Hope as the Narrator. The 2016 UK touring production starred Joe McElderry as Joseph and Lucy Kay as the Narrator. Former &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; contestant Ben James-Ellis appeared as both Pharaoh and Issachar. The tour started again in February 2019 with Jaymi Hensley taking the lead role, with Trina Hill portraying the Narrator.

In November 2018 it was announced that &quot;Joseph&quot; would return to the London Palladium for a limited run over the summer in 2019 to celebrate the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Sheridan Smith starred as the Narrator and Jason Donovan played Pharaoh, with the title role of Joseph being played by drama school graduate Jac Yarrow. The production ran from 27 June 2019 (previews), opening 11 July, to 8 September, produced by Michael Harrison and choreography by Joann M. Hunter. The success of this production led to it being announced to make a return the following year.

===2020s===
On 17 February 2020, a 50th anniversary concert production of &quot;Joseph&quot; was staged at Lincoln Center&#x27;s David Geffen Hall in New York City. Produced by Manhattan Concert Productions, directed by Michael Arden conducted by Stephen Oremus, and accompanied by the New York City Chamber Orchestra with over 300 singers, the one night only sold-out concert presentation starred Noah Galvin (a last minute replacement for Ari&#x27;el Stachel) as Joseph along with Eden Espinosa, Alex Newell, and Jessica Vosk sharing the central role of The Narrator. Additional casting included Chuck Cooper as Jacob, Andy Karl as Potiphar, Orfeh as Mrs. Potiphar, and Merle Dandridge as The Pharaoh.

The production returned to the London Palladium in 2021, playing a limited season from 1 July to 5 September. The production, which was postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, saw Alexandra Burke join the company as The Narrator and Yarrow and Donovan return to the roles of Joseph and Pharaoh respectively. Linzi Hateley reprised her role as the Narrator in specific performances, with choreography once again by Joann M. Hunter and produced by Michael Harrison.

In 2022 the production embarked on a UK Tour opening in Manchester in March until 29 October in Edinburgh.

In November 2022, the London Palladium production opened in Melbourne, Australia. The production then moved to Sydney opening, at the Capitol Theatre on 11 February, 2023. 

On 21 February 2024, it was announced that the London Palladium production would play a limited season at the Edinburgh Playhouse over Christmas 2024, opening on 3 December 2024, with Donny Osmond playing the role of Pharaoh. The production is to be directed by Laurence Connor, produced by Michael Harrison and choreography again by JoAnn M Hunter, and further casting to be announced, the production will then embark on a UK tour.

==Characters==
*Narrator: A character not of the time or place of the action. The Narrator tells the story through word and song, guiding the audience gently through the story of Joseph and his brothers, usually gives meaning to the story with their words. In early productions this character was usually played by a man; later productions have featured a woman in the role. The Narrator sometimes doubles as various characters.
*Jacob: The father of twelve sons, his favourite being Joseph. At times he may appear unfair and shallow, but he is, more importantly, the prophet who recognises the future and the calling of Joseph, thus saving the House of Israel. Sometimes doubles as Potiphar or the Narrator.
*Joseph: Eleventh son of Jacob. Obviously his father&#x27;s favourite, Joseph early on shows a talent for interpreting dreams and telling the future. This gets him into trouble with his brothers when he predicts his future will include ruling over the other eleven. However, it saves his life when in Egypt he correctly interprets Pharaoh&#x27;s dreams. In the end he has risen to a great position of power, but he still forgives his brothers and brings his family to Egypt to partake of the bounty he has accumulated there.
*Ishmaelites: Men of the desert, they buy Joseph as a slave, take him to Egypt, and sell him to Potiphar.
*Potiphar: A powerful and rich Egyptian, Potiphar purchases Joseph and puts him to work in his household, where he soon realises that Joseph is honest, hard-working, and a great addition to his pool of help. When he grows suspicious of Mrs. Potiphar and Joseph, however, he grows angry and has Joseph thrown into prison. Often played by the actor playing Jacob.
*Mrs. Potiphar: Beautiful but evil, Mrs. Potiphar tries to seduce Joseph, but is unsuccessful. However, she does manage to rip off much of his clothing just as her husband comes into the room, thus condemning him to prison. Also plays one of the wives.
*Baker: One of Pharaoh&#x27;s servants, the Baker is in prison with Joseph who correctly interprets his dreams and predicts that he will be put to death. Played by one of the brothers.
*Butler: Another of Pharaoh&#x27;s servants, the Butler is also in prison with Joseph who also correctly interprets his dreams, this time that he will be released and taken back into Pharaoh&#x27;s household. It is the Butler who tells Pharaoh about Joseph and his uncanny ability with dreams. Played by one of the brothers.
*Pharaoh: The most powerful man in Egypt, Pharaoh is considered a god on earth. When Joseph interprets his dreams, he promotes him to one of the highest positions in his government. In most productions, Pharaoh is portrayed as an Elvis Presley-style figure. Sometimes played by one of the brothers.
*Joseph&#x27;s Eleven Brothers: Although acting usually as a group, they each have their own different personalities, talents, and flaws. As a group they sell Joseph into slavery, but as individuals they deal with the following years and how they can make amends. They sing and dance their way through many situations and places. The brothers also double as Egyptians and servants of Potiphar.
**Reuben: Eldest son of Jacob. Takes the lead on &quot;One More Angel in Heaven&quot;
**Simeon: Second son of Jacob. Takes the lead on &quot;Those Canaan Days&quot;
**Levi: Third son of Jacob.
**Judah: Fourth son of Jacob. Takes the lead on &quot;Benjamin Calypso&quot;.
**Dan: Fifth son of Jacob.
**Naphtali: Sixth son of Jacob.
**Gad: Seventh son of Jacob.
**Asher: Eighth son of Jacob.
**Issachar: Ninth son of Jacob.
**Zebulun: Tenth son of Jacob.
**Benjamin: Youngest son of Jacob. Joseph accuses him of stealing the golden cup.
*The Wives: The wives of Jacob. The actresses playing the wives also double as Egyptians and servants of Potiphar.

<text>Simon John Charles Le Bon (born 27 October 1958) is an English singer. He is best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the new wave band Duran Duran and its offshoot Arcadia. Le Bon has received three Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. He also received an MBE from Charles III in 2024.

==Early life==
Le Bon was born on 27 October 1958, on his father&#x27;s birthday, in Bushey Maternity Hospital in Bushey, Hertfordshire, the first of three boys for John and Ann-Marie Le Bon, followed by his younger brothers, David and Jonathan. His mother encouraged his artistic talent when he was six years old by entering him in a screen test for a Persil washing powder TV advertisement, which proved successful. He was a member of the local church choir from a young age, and was trained as an actor.

===Education===
Le Bon went to Pinner County Grammar School and Nower Hill High School. In 1978, he completed an art foundation course at Harrow School of Art, before studying drama at the University of Birmingham.

==Career==

===Before Duran Duran===
For a time Le Bon worked as a theatre porter at Northwick Park Hospital Accident and Casualty, and also sang in a punk band called Dog Days at Harrow School of Art. He appeared in a few television advertisements and also in several theatre productions including &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; in the West End of London.

Le Bon worked on a kibbutz—an Israeli collective community—in the Negev desert in Israel in 1978, and then returned to England to study drama at the University of Birmingham before meeting the fledgling band Duran Duran in 1980.

===Duran Duran===

Duran Duran was founded by childhood friends John Taylor and Nick Rhodes along with singer-songwriter Stephen Duffy in 1978, but Duffy left a year later, convinced that the band was not going to be successful. The band went through a long succession of line-up changes after Duffy&#x27;s departure, but finally settled on a guitarist and drummer. The band had a powerful pop sound flavoured with disco, funk, and electronics, built on a solid rock rhythm section, and all they needed was a charismatic singer with a distinctive voice.

Le Bon&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Fiona Kemp (a bartender at the Rum Runner nightclub where Duran Duran were rehearsing), introduced him to the band in May 1980, recommending him as a potential lead vocalist. As band legend has it, he turned up for the audition wearing pink leopard-print trousers, and carrying a notebook containing a large collection of poems he had written—several of which would later become tracks on the early Duran Duran studio albums.

After listening to the songs the band had already composed together, Le Bon spent some time fitting one of his poems (&quot;Sound of Thunder&quot;) to one of the instrumentals, and found they had a good match. Le Bon agreed to &quot;try [Duran Duran] out for the summer&quot;; within six weeks the band was playing steadily around Birmingham, London and Nottingham, and a national tour supporting Hazel O&#x27;Connor led to a recording contract with EMI Records in December that year.

The band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Duran Duran&quot;, was released in 1981, and they quickly became famous as part of the New Romantic movement. Three more albums followed in quick succession: &quot;Rio&quot; (1982), &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; (1983) and the live album &quot;Arena&quot; (1984). Each album release was accompanied by heavy media promotion and a lengthy concert tour. By mid-1984, the band were ready for a break. Duran Duran&#x27;s only other work that year was an appearance on the Band Aid charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; which was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London on 25 November 1984. Le Bon&#x27;s vocal appears fourth on the song after Paul Young, Boy George and George Michael sing their lines.

Following the departures of Roger and Andy Taylor, Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor continued on as Duran Duran, recording and releasing &quot;Notorious&quot; (1986) and &quot;Big Thing&quot; (1988). The group added guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and drummer Sterling Campbell and recorded the studio album &quot;Liberty&quot; (1990), but the band&#x27;s success had begun to wane in the late 1980s.

Duran Duran had a resurgence in popularity in 1993 with the &quot;Wedding Album&quot;, featuring the top-10 single &quot;Ordinary World&quot;. Several months into the extensive worldwide concert tour supporting this album, Le Bon suffered a torn vocal cord, and the tour was postponed for six weeks while he recovered.

In 1995, Duran Duran released the covers album &quot;Thank You&quot;, and Le Bon had the chance to cover some of his favourite artists, (Jim Morrison, Lou Reed and Elvis Costello), but the album was severely panned by critics from all quarters. That year Le Bon also performed Duran Duran&#x27;s 1993 hit &quot;Ordinary World&quot; with opera tenor Luciano Pavarotti during a &quot;Children of Bosnia&quot; benefit concert for War Child. Le Bon described the event to Jam! Showbiz thusly: &quot;If you&#x27;re talking about name dropping, he&#x27;s one of the biggest names you could drop, Pav-The-Man&quot;.

When bassist John Taylor left the band in 1997, Le Bon and Rhodes remained as the only two members who had been with Duran Duran from the beginning of their recording career. The successive two studio albums with Le Bon, Rhodes and Cuccurullo—&quot;Medazzaland&quot; (1997) and &quot;Pop Trash&quot; (2000)—were not commercial successes.

In 2001, Duran Duran&#x27;s original five members reunited to record a new studio album, &quot;Astronaut&quot;, for Epic Records. &quot;Astronaut&quot; was released worldwide on 11 October 2004. The album was preceded by the single &quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot;, their first UK Top 10 single in a decade.

===Arcadia===
Before Duran Duran reunited in 1986, Le Bon formed the band Arcadia with Rhodes. The band had a UK/US top 10 hit with their first single &quot;Election Day&quot;, and released one studio album, &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; in 1985.

===Solo excursions===
While Le Bon has been in Duran Duran for the band&#x27;s entire recording history, he has also dabbled in solo outings. In 1985, for the Whitbread Round the World Race, he contributed a song titled &quot;Grey Lady of the Sea&quot; and narrated a video of that year&#x27;s race called &quot;Drum&quot; (1987). &quot;Grey Lady of the Sea&quot; was released as a single in Japan in 1988.

In 1989, for Jonathan Elias&#x27; &quot;Requiem for the Americas&quot; project, Le Bon contributed &quot;Follow in My Footsteps&quot;, with the Bangles&#x27; Susanna Hoffs providing backing vocals. The track was released on 7&quot; single in Italy that year.

In 1998, along with friend Nick Wood and wife Yasmin, he set up SYN Entertainment (Simon Yasmin Nick) in Tokyo, Japan. Having first conceived the idea in 1988, Le Bon is currently described as SYN&#x27;s &quot;Founder and Chairman&quot;, while Wood is &quot;Founder, President and Creative Director&quot;.

In 2000, SYN Entertainment founded SYN Records which has released a number of compilations, some of which have included contributions by Le Bon. Another solo track, &quot;Dreamboy&quot;, was featured on the SYN-released soundtrack to the Mario Van Peebles comedy film &quot;Love Kills&quot; (1998).

Also in 2000, SYN co-executive produced the Duran Duran studio album &quot;Pop Trash&quot; along with Rhodes&#x27; and Cuccurullo&#x27;s side-venture TV Mania.

In October 2005 Dutch trance DJ Ferry Corsten released the track &quot;Fire&quot;, with vocals by Le Bon. It was a remix of the lesser known Duran Duran single &quot;Serious&quot;, from the studio album &quot;Liberty&quot; (1990).

In late 2006, Le Bon became a member of Shinzou Sound, and took part in the Japan-based online manga project, &quot;Synesthesia&quot;, by co-writing the theme song &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; along with Nick Wood.

In 2010, Le Bon collaborated on the song &quot;Record Collection&quot;, the title track from Mark Ronson&#x27;s third studio album. In the song, Le Bon is heard singing the chorus, along with Mark Ronson and hip hop artist Wiley. Ronson later produced Duran Duran&#x27;s 2010 studio album &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot;, and 2015&#x27;s &quot;Paper Gods&quot;.

Since 2020, he has been hosting the music show &quot;WHOOOSH!&quot; with Katy Krassner. Originally on the Duran Duran website, the show moved to Spotify and then to Sirius XM where it airs on The Spectrum channel 28. The duo play 11 songs per week and discuss them. Le Bon curates all the tracks.

In 2024, LeBon appeared as a guest judge on season 6 of RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK. The lip-sync song chosen for the episode was &quot;Girls on Film&quot;.

==Personal life==
In the early 1980s, Le Bon was engaged to his then longtime girlfriend, model-turned-actress Claire Stansfield. After breaking up with her, he dated fashion model Yasmin Parvaneh. Seeing her face in a magazine, he phoned her modelling agency to track her down and they married on 27 December 1985. Yasmin suffered two miscarriages, but the couple went on to have three daughters, including Amber. He became a grandfather in 2018.

During Duran Duran&#x27;s hiatus in 1985, Le Bon drew media attention when his maxi yacht, &quot;Drum&quot;, lost its keel and capsized during the Fastnet Race, just off Falmouth along the southern coast of Cornwall. Before being rescued, Le Bon and other crew members were trapped under the boat, inside the hull, for forty minutes. All of them were rescued by the Royal Navy, using a search and rescue (SAR) helicopter from 771 Naval Air Squadron based near Helston. The rescue earned the Rescue Diver, POACMN L Slater, a George Medal. Despite the accident, Le Bon and &quot;Drum&quot; went on to participate in the 1985–1986 Whitbread Round the World Race, coming in third overall in elapsed time. Le Bon and his partners eventually sold &quot;Drum&quot;; the events surrounding &quot;Drum&quot; and the races were chronicled in a 1989 movie entitled &quot;Drum – The Journey of a Lifetime&quot; and the book &quot;One Watch at a Time&quot; written by &quot;Drum&quot;″s skipper, Skip Novak.

Twenty years after his accident, in 2005, Le Bon made public his desire to race again. During a touring break in August 2005, Le Bon again raced &quot;Drum&quot; in the Fastnet Race, borrowing the vessel from her owner (the late Scottish multi car garage owner Sir Arnold Clark) to participate, and raising funds for charity the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). Le Bon had to leave the race unfinished, as light winds were slowing &quot;Drum&quot; (and the other competitors), and would have delayed the boat&#x27;s arrival at Plymouth, interfering with Le Bon&#x27;s obligation to perform in Japan. He appears as the narrator in a documentary film project called &quot;The Weekend Sailor&quot; which is about a Swan 65 sailing yacht called &quot;Sayula II&quot; that won the first Whitbread Round the World sailing race in 1973–1974.

In 2009 Le Bon (who describes himself as a &quot;concerned agnostic&quot;) contributed an essay to the book &quot;The Atheist&#x27;s Guide to Christmas&quot;, edited by Ariane Sherine. In 2014, he became a distinguished supporter of Humanists UK.

Le Bon injured his vocal cords and was unable to finish his 2011 summer tour. He remarked, &quot;I am trying to be philosophical.&quot;

In 2018, Le Bon was accused by a therapist named Shereen Hariri of sexually assaulting her at the Wherehouse, a record store where she worked during a signing session on 10 April 1995. He responded via the band&#x27;s social media pages denying the allegation, saying in part, &quot;I have always been one who can admit to my mistakes and apologize for my failings. But I cannot apologize for something I did not do.&quot;

Le Bon was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.

<text>Benjamin Augustus Vereen (né Middleton; October 10, 1946) is an American actor, dancer and singer. He gained prominence for his performances in the original Broadway productions of the musicals &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, for which he received a Tony Award nomination, and &quot;Pippin,&quot; for which he won the 1973 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.

== Early life ==
Vereen was born October 10, 1946, in Dade County, Florida. While still an infant, Vereen and his family relocated to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. He was adopted by James Vereen, a paint-factory worker, and his wife, Pauline Vereen, who worked as a maid and theatre wardrobe mistress. He discovered he was adopted when he applied for a passport to join Sammy Davis Jr. on a tour of &quot;Golden Boy&quot; to London when he was 25. He was raised Pentecostal.

During his pre-teen years, he exhibited an innate talent for drama and dance and often performed in local variety shows. At the age of 14, Vereen enrolled at the High School of Performing Arts, where he studied under world-renowned choreographers Martha Graham, George Balanchine, and Jerome Robbins. Upon his graduation, he struggled to find suitable stage work and was often forced to take odd jobs to supplement his income.

==Career==
===Stage===
When Vereen was 18 years old, he made his New York stage bow off-off Broadway in &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; at the Greenwich Mews Theater directed by Stella Holt. By the following year, he was in Las Vegas, performing in Bob Fosse&#x27;s production of &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, a show with which he toured in 1967–68. He returned to New York City to play Claude in &quot;Hair&quot; in the Broadway production, before joining the national touring company.

The following year, he was cast as an ensemble dancer in the film adaptation of &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;. He is featured prominently in the &quot;Rich Man&#x27;s Frug&quot; dance number and the song &quot;Rhythm of Life&quot;, where he appears as one of three backup dancers for Sammy Davis Jr. After developing a rapport with Davis, Vereen was cast as his understudy in the upcoming production of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, which toured England and ended the run at the Palladium Theatre in London&#x27;s West End.

Vereen was nominated for a Tony Award for his role as Judas Iscariot in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; in 1972 and won a Tony for his appearance in &quot;Pippin&quot; in 1973. Vereen appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot; as the Wizard of Oz in 2005. Vereen has also performed in one-man shows and actively lectures on black history and inspirational topics.

In August 2011, Vereen was named co-artistic director of Tampa&#x27;s Broadway Theatre Project.

=== Television ===

Vereen has also starred in numerous television programs, and is well known for the role of &#x27;Chicken&#x27; George Moore in Alex Haley&#x27;s landmark TV miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, for which he received an Emmy nomination in 1977.

Vereen&#x27;s four-week summer variety series, &quot;Ben Vereen ... Comin&#x27; At Ya&quot;, aired on NBC in August 1975 and featured regulars Lola Falana, Avery Schreiber and Liz Torres.

In 1976, Vereen appeared as a guest star on the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, singing two songs.

In 1978, on a Boston Pops TV special, Vereen performed a tribute to Bert Williams, complete with period makeup and attire, and reprising Williams&#x27; high-kick dance steps, to Vaudeville standards such as &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Robert E. Lee&quot;.

In 1981, Vereen performed at Ronald Reagan&#x27;s first inauguration. The performance generated controversy as Vereen performed the first part of the show in blackface. Before the finale, ABC cut the live performance, generating confusion and anger from viewers at home. According to video artist Edgar Arcenaux, what TV viewers did not see was the second part of the performance, in which Vereen mimicked being refused service because of his color while trying to buy the Republican elite a congratulatory drink. As Arceneaux explains, Vereen&#x27;s performance was meant as a critique of Republican civil rights policies, but the TV audience didn&#x27;t get to see it.

Vereen was cast opposite Jeff Goldblum in the short-lived detective series &quot;Tenspeed and Brown Shoe&quot; (1980). During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Vereen worked steadily on television with projects ranging from the sitcom &quot;Webster&quot; to the drama &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;.
In 1985, Vereen starred in the &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; series as Puss in Boots alongside Gregory Hines. He appeared on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; episode &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Excuse&quot;, in which he played Will Smith&#x27;s biological father Lou Smith. He made several appearances on the 1980s sitcom &quot;Webster&quot; as the title character&#x27;s biological uncle.

He also appeared as Mayor Ben (a leopard) on the children&#x27;s program &quot;Zoobilee Zoo&quot; and as Itsy Bitsy Spider in &quot;Mother Goose Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rhyme&quot;. In 1993, he appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Interface&quot; as the father of &quot;Roots&quot; co-star LeVar Burton&#x27;s character Geordi La Forge; fellow &quot;Roots&quot; star Madge Sinclair appeared in the same episode as Geordi&#x27;s mother. He also appeared on the television series &quot;The Nanny&quot; episode &quot;Pishke Business&quot;. In 2010, he appeared on the television series &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episodes &quot;Cleaning House&quot; and &quot;False Positive&quot; as Sam Gibbs, the long lost father of James Stinson, Barney Stinson&#x27;s brother. He returned in 2013 and 2014 for another two episodes.

== Personal life ==

=== Wives, children, and extended family ===
He has six children. His 16-year-old daughter, Naja, was killed in an auto accident in 1987 on the New Jersey Turnpike when a truck overturned on her car. His other daughter, Karon Davis, is a professional artist; Vereen&#x27;s son-in-law was Davis&#x27; late husband, artist Noah Davis. His son, Ben Vereen Jr., died in 2020 at the age of 55.

Vereen is the godfather of R&amp;B singer Usher, and is also the first cousin once removed of former NFL running back Shane Vereen.

In the early 1980s, Vereen moved with his family to Saddle River, New Jersey.

In September 2012, Vereen filed for divorce from his wife of 36 years, Nancy Bruner Vereen, citing irreconcilable differences.

=== Health ===
In 1992, Vereen suffered three accidents in one day: His car hit a tree, causing him to hit his head on the roof of the car; he then suffered a stroke while he was walking on a Malibu highway, apparently veering into the road; and finally, as a result of &quot;that&quot;, he was hit by record producer David Foster, who was driving his car on the highway. His critical injuries, including a broken leg, required him to undergo arduous physical rehabilitation in the ensuing months.

In 2007, he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and he has a website in which he shares his personal story along with advice from medical experts.

=== Adoption ===
According to &quot;The Fayetteville Observer&quot; of April 29, 2006, Vereen learned while applying for a passport in the late 1960s that he was adopted. His birth certificate revealed that his birth name was Benjamin Augustus Middleton, that he was the son of Essie Middleton, and that he was born in Laurinburg, North Carolina. In April 2006, Vereen visited Scotland County with a genealogist on a search for family members and learned that his mother&#x27;s name was Essie May Pearson. The &quot;Laurinburg Exchange&quot; reported: &quot;Vereen, an adoptee who learned that he was born in Laurinburg and made a celebrated trip to Scotland County in 2006 to reconnect with family. While on the trip he learned his mother had died 24 years before, but that several relatives still lived in the area.&quot; According to her acquaintances, Essie had gone on a trip when Vereen was a child and had left her baby in someone&#x27;s care. When she returned, the child was gone. In the April 28, 2006, interview with the &#x27;Laurinburg Exchange&#x27;, Vereen said that his visit &quot;has just all been so overwhelming ... I&#x27;ve finally found my family&quot;. In May 2006, he met his mother&#x27;s daughter (his sister), Gloria Lewis-Walker, of Derby, Connecticut.

=== Public speaking and politics ===
Vereen has appeared as a public speaker and humanitarian speaking on such topics as black history, overcoming adversity, and the importance of continuing education. Vereen was the keynote speaker for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in St. Petersburg, Florida, annual alumni tribute gala held in October 2007.

He is an active Democrat.

== Sexual harassment allegations ==
In January 2018, four actresses in a Florida production of &quot;Hair&quot; directed by Vereen in 2015 alleged that he sexually harassed them throughout the production.

According to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;the women — part of the Venice Theatre production outside of Tampa — say Vereen forced unwanted kisses, hugged them aggressively, stripped naked during an acting exercise and made degrading comments about their weight, sex appeal and personal lives&quot;. &quot;The Daily News&quot; published cast members&#x27; claims that he used his position of authority as a director and mentor to pressure them to engage him in unwanted sexual interactions. For example, two of the actresses said he privately lured them on separate occasions to his Florida rental home. One woman willingly admits she and Vereen began a relationship, though she feels it was ultimately coerced; the other says he sexually molested her and later non-consensually kissed her and made sexually disparaging remarks.

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;While directing the 2015 production of the musical at the Venice Theatre in Florida, Vereen is alleged to have invited female cast members back to his apartment and goaded them into sex acts. He&#x27;s also accused of inappropriate talk and conduct during rehearsals that involved cast members stripping naked, ostensibly as preparation for a show that has, since its original 1967 production, been associated with a famous, full-cast nude scene.&quot;

Vereen has since apologized for his misconduct in 2018.

<doc id="213104" wikidata="Q6263018" url="?curid=213104" title="John Ward Studebaker">
<text>John Ward Studebaker (June 10, 1887 – July 26, 1989) served as U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1934 to 1948. He was also Chairman of the U.S. Radio Education Committee. His was the longest tenure of any education commissioner, and he devoted much of his time to children&#x27;s literacy and arithmetic.

==Background==

John Ward Studebaker was born on June 10, 1887, in Iowa and grew up in McGregor, Iowa. Although he was small in stature and had lost his right eye in an accident at the age of 12, he was a &quot;star all-round high school and college athlete&quot; who was the quarterback of his high school and college football teams, as well as playing baseball and basketball in college. He attended Leander Clark College in Toledo, Iowa (now part of Coe College), paying his way through school by working as a bricklayer.

==Career==

After college, Studebaker served as principal of a public school, and in 1914 became assistant superintendent of schools in Des Moines, Iowa. During World War I he took a leave of absence from that position to become national director of the Junior Red Cross and to undertake graduate study at Columbia University, where he was awarded a master&#x27;s degree in 1920. Returning to Des Moines, in 1920 he became the city&#x27;s school superintendent. As superintendent, he started special education programs for children with disabilities and &quot;slow learners.&quot;

Studebaker was first appointed Commissioner of Education by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934. He served for the remainder of Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency and continued in the position under President Harry Truman, resigning in 1948 with the explanation that he could no longer afford to serve in a position that paid only $10,000 annually.

Studebaker was best known, while Commissioner of Education, for his work on public forums. Believing that public discussion as civic education was the key to renewing democracy, he first ran a series of forums in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1932 – 1934, then instituted the Federal Forum Project, 1936 – 1941 until just before the outbreak of World War II. Studebaker published &quot;The American Way&quot; (1935) and &quot;Plain Talk&quot; (1936), both of which were influential with Depression-era educators.

Studebaker maintained his membership in the bricklayers&#x27; union long after becoming an educator. He was a member of the Methodist church, the Masons and Shriners, and Rotary International. Studebaker was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1940 to 1942. He died in 1989 in Walnut Creek, California, at age 102.

==Works==
The Library of Congress online catalog lists 37 entries for Studebaker; his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary cited two major works:
* &quot;The American Way: A Democracy at Work in the Des Moines Forums&quot; (1935)
* &quot;Plain Talk&quot; (1936))

<text>The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) is a large passerine bird species of the family Corvidae. It is a common bird found throughout much of North America. American crows are the New World counterpart to the carrion crow and the hooded crow of Eurasia; they all occupy the same ecological niche. Although the American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls and visual appearance are different.

From beak to tail, an American crow measures , almost half of which is tail. Its wingspan is . Mass varies from about , with males tending to be larger than females. Plumage is all black, with iridescent feathers. It looks much like other all-black corvids. They are very intelligent, and adaptable to human environments. The most usual call is &quot;&quot; They can be distinguished from the common raven (&quot;C. corax&quot;) because American crows are smaller and the beak is slightly less pronounced; from the fish crow (&quot;C. ossifragus&quot;) because American crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they call; and from the carrion crow (&quot;C. corone&quot;) by size, as the carrion crow is larger and of a stockier build.

American crows are common, widespread, and susceptible to the West Nile virus, making them useful as a bioindicator to track the virus&#x27;s spread. Direct transmission of the virus from crows to humans is impossible. 

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The American crow was described by German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1822. Its scientific name means literally &#x27;short-billed crow&#x27;, from Ancient Greek (&#x27;short-&#x27;) and (&#x27;billed&#x27;).

A 2012 genetic analysis of the genus &quot;Corvus&quot; by Knud A Jønsson and colleagues using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA calculated that the American crow diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the collared, carrion and hooded crows around 5 million years ago.

&quot;American crow&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).

===Subspecies===

The number of subspecies varies by authority, ranging between three and five. The unclear taxonomy of the northwestern crow, previously its own species, has complicated subspecies determinations. Subspecies differ in bill proportion and form a rough NE–SW clinal in size across North America. Birds are smallest in the far west and on the southern coast.
*&quot;C. b. brachyrhynchos&quot; – eastern crow: northeastern United States, eastern Canada and surroundings. The nominate subspecies, and largest.
*&quot;C. b. hesperis&quot; – western crow: western North America except the Arctic north, the Pacific Northwest and the extreme south. Smaller overall with a proportionally more slender bill and low-pitched voice.
*&quot;C. b. caurinus&quot; &quot;–&quot; northwestern crow: of the Pacific temperate rain forests was formerly considered a distinct species as &quot;C. caurinus&quot;, averaging smaller in size than other American crows with a distinctly hoarser call. It forms a hybrid swarm with American crow (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) in coastal Washington and British Columbia. The American Ornithological Society lumped the northwestern crow with the American crow in 2020. It is now considered a geographic variation within &quot;C. b. hesperis&quot;.
*&quot;C. b. pascuus&quot; – Florida crow: Florida. Mid-sized, short-winged, but decidedly long bill and legs.
*&quot;C. b. paulus&quot; – southern crow: southern United States. Smaller overall, bill also small.

==Description==

The American crow is a large, distinctive bird with iridescent black feathers all over. Its legs, feet and bill are also black. They measure in length, of which the tail makes up about 40%. The wing chord is , with the wingspan ranging from . The bill length can be from , varying strongly according to location. The tarsus is and the tail is . The body mass can vary from . Males tend to be larger than females.
The most usual call is a loud, short, and rapid &quot;&quot;. Usually the birds thrust their heads up and down as they utter this call. American crows can also produce a wide variety of sounds and sometimes mimic noises made by other animals, including other birds, such as barred owls.

Visual differentiation from the fish crow (&quot;C. ossifragus&quot;) is extremely difficult and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows tend to have more slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the fish crow&#x27;s upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.

If seen flying at a distance from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (&quot;C. corax&quot;) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling – like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar for extended periods, unlike crows, which rarely fly more than a few seconds without flapping their wings.

Crows have been noted to be intelligent. They have the same brain-weight-to-body ratio as humans. This has led to some studies that have identified that crows are self-aware and that young crows take time to learn from tolerant parents. While a human has a neocortex, the crow has a different area in their brain that is equally complex.

The average lifespan of the American crow in the wild is 7–8 years. Captive birds are known to have lived up to 30 years.

==Distribution and habitat==

The range of the American crow now extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in Canada, on the French islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, south through the United States, and into northern Mexico. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated range expansions of the American crow as well as range expansions of many other species of birds. Virtually all types of country from wilderness, farmland, parks, open woodland to towns and major cities are inhabited; it is absent only from tundra habitat, where it is replaced by the common raven. This crow is a permanent resident in most of the US, but most Canadian birds migrate some distances southward in winter. Outside of the nesting season these birds often gather in large (thousands or even millions) communal roosts at night.

The American crow was recorded in Bermuda from 1876 onwards.

==Behavior and ecology==

Studying the behavior of American crows is laborious due to the difficulty in catching them to band them, let alone catching them again. Thus much of their behavior, including daily routine, migration, molting, survivorship, age of first breeding, nestling development, and the nature of nesting helpers, remains poorly studied.
===Diet===
The American crow is omnivorous. It will feed on invertebrates of all types, carrion, scraps of human food, fruits, nuts such as walnuts and almonds, seeds, eggs and nestlings, stranded fish on the shore and various grains. American crows are active hunters and will prey on mice, young rabbits, frogs, and other small animals. In the winter and autumn, the diet of American crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns. Occasionally, they will visit bird feeders. The American crow is one of only a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food.

Like most crows, they will scavenge at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat and other crops are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow to be considered a nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests.
===Reproduction===

American crows are socially monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families of up to 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age for at least two years. Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.

The nesting season starts early, with some birds incubating eggs by early April. American crows build bulky stick nests, nearly always in trees but sometimes also in large bushes and, very rarely, on the ground. They will nest in a wide variety of trees, including large conifers, although oaks are most often used. Three to six eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The young are usually fledged by about 36 days after hatching. Predation primarily occurs at the nest site and eggs and nestlings are frequently eaten by snakes, raccoons, ravens and domestic cats. Adults are less frequently predated, but face potential attack from great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons and eagles. They may be attacked by predators such as coyotes or bobcats at carrion when incautious, although this is even rarer.

Although matings between relatives can cause inbreeding depression, that is, negative effects on offspring fitness, a number of species never-the-less prefer inbreeding. The American crow experiences inbreeding depression (as measured by fledgling survival) but still prefers inbreeding.

===West Nile virus===
American crows succumb easily to West Nile virus infection. This was originally a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got bitten by a mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.
The disease runs most rampant in the subtropical conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which &quot;Culex tarsalis&quot; is most significant. Mortality rates appear to be higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. Crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly.

=== Intelligence ===
American crows, like other corvids, are highly cunning and inquisitive. They are able to steal food from other species, often in creative ways. One example shows a group of crows stealing a fish from a Northern river otter: one bird pecked the otter&#x27;s tail to distract it while other birds swooped in and stole the fish. They are able to use and modify tools.

== Relationship with humans ==
Crows are used as a motif in some human cultures, often associated with death, thieves, graveyards, bad luck, and other negative connotations.

Conversely, they are seen by some neo-pagan and indigenous cultures as signs of good luck, or even signs of certain gods, such as Apollo, Odin, and others.

==Status and management==

The intelligence and adaptability of the American crow has insulated it from threats, and it is instead considered an agricultural pest. In 2012, BirdLife International estimated the American crow population to be around 31 million. The large population and vast range result in the least concern status for the American crow, meaning that the species is not threatened with extinction.

Crows have been killed in large numbers by humans, both for recreation and as part of organized campaigns of extermination. In Canada, American crows have no protections, aside from Quebec, which bans their hunting during the nesting season. Laws on their hunting vary throughout the United States. New Jersey allows for a limited hunting season, unless they are agricultural pests, in which case they may be killed. Oklahoma allows hunting even during the nesting season. In the first half of the 20th century, state-sponsored campaigns dynamited roosting areas, taking large numbers of crows. A campaign in Oklahoma from 1934 to 1945 dynamited 3.8 million birds. The effect on populations was negligible and damage to agricultural crops did not decrease, and thus the campaign was halted due to its ineffectiveness. In a study taking data from 1917 to 1999, intentional killings were the overwhelming cause of death for crows, accounting for 68% of all recovered bird bands.

Non-deadly methods of managing crows are varied but usually limited in their effectiveness. High value crops may be netted, but this is cost prohibitive for most other crops. Frightening may be used to disperse crows, including loud noises from guns, fake hawks flown from balloons, fake owls that move with the wind, strips of reflective tape on fences, or recordings of crow distress calls. Poisoned baits are of limited effectiveness, as only the most toxic baits work, and those are generally unacceptable for use. Crows quickly learn to avoid the less-toxic baits, as the baits make crows sick. The actual effect of crows on agriculture has been poorly studied. There is some suggestion that they may be a benefit to farmers, by eating insect pests and chasing off livestock predators like hawks.

<doc id="213111" wikidata="Q225946" url="?curid=213111" title="For Dummies">
<text>For Dummies is an extensive series of instructional reference books which are intended to present non-intimidating guides for readers new to the various topics covered. The series has been a worldwide success with editions in numerous languages.

The books are an example of a media franchise, consistently sporting a distinctive cover—usually yellow and black with a triangular-headed cartoon figure known as the &quot;Dummies Man&quot;, and an informal, blackboard-style logo. Prose is simple and direct; bold icons, such as a piece of string tied around an index finger, are placed in the margin to indicate particularly important passages.

== History ==
The first title, &quot;DOS For Dummies&quot;, was written by Dan Gookin and published in November 1991 by IDG Books. &quot;DOS For Dummies&quot; became popular due to the rarity of beginner-friendly materials for using DOS. The Windows title written by Andy Rathbone was soon released. While initially the series focused solely on software and technology topics, it later branched out to more general-interest titles, with topics as diverse as &quot;Acne For Dummies&quot;, &quot;Chess For Dummies&quot;, &quot;Fishing For Dummies&quot; and many other topics. The series is now published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., which acquired Hungry Minds (the new name for IDG Books as of 2000) in early 2001.
Notable &quot;For Dummies&quot; books include:
* &quot;DOS For Dummies&quot;, the first, published in 1991, whose first printing was just 7,500 copies
* &quot;Windows for Dummies&quot;, asserted to be the best-selling computer book of all time, with more than 15 million sold
* &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de France Pour Les Nuls&quot;, the top-selling non-English &quot;For Dummies&quot; title, with more than 400,000 sold

== Parts ==
Almost all &quot;Dummies&quot; books are organized around sections called &quot;parts&quot;, which are groups of related chapters. Parts are almost always preceded by a Rich Tennant comic that refers to some part of the subject under discussion, though the comics were discontinued in 2012. Sometimes the same Tennant drawing reappears in another &quot;Dummies&quot; book with a new caption.

Another constant in the &quot;Dummies&quot; series is &quot;The Part of Tens&quot;, a section at the end of the books where lists of 10 items are included. They are usually resources for further study and sometimes also include amusing bits of information that do not fit readily elsewhere.

== Expansions and alternative versions ==
Several related series have been published, including &quot;Dummies 101&quot;, with step-by-step tutorials in a large-format book (now discontinued); &quot;More ... for Dummies&quot;, which are essentially sequels to the first &quot;... For Dummies&quot; book on the subject; and &quot;For Dummies Quick Reference&quot;, which is a condensed alphabetical reference to the subject. A larger &quot;All-in-One Desk Reference&quot; format offers more comprehensive coverage of the subject, normally running about 750 pages. Also, some books in the series are smaller and do not follow the same formatting style as the others.

Wiley has also launched an interactive online course with Learnstreet based on its popular book, &quot;Java for Dummies&quot;, 5th edition.

A spin-off board game, &quot;Crosswords for Dummies&quot;, was produced in the late 1990s. The game is similar to &quot;Scrabble&quot;, but instead of letter tiles, players draw short strips of cardboard containing pre-built English words. The words vary in length from three to seven letters, with more points acquired for playing longer words. Another board game, &quot;SAT Game For Dummies&quot;, is used in SAT preparation. A &quot;Chess for Dummies&quot; was made, a black-and-yellow chessboard with a picture of a piece, along with a summary of how the piece moves, printed its starting positions, although there is a book with the same name.

In 2004, French publisher Anuman Interactive obtained the digital exploitation rights and launched many applications based on the &quot;For Dummies&quot; collection, such as &quot;Home Design 3D For Dummies&quot; and &quot;History For Dummies&quot;.

<doc id="213112" wikidata="Q4024762" url="?curid=213112" title="Zoobilee Zoo">
<text>Zoobilee Zoo is a children&#x27;s television series featuring actors dressed as animal characters that originally aired from 1986 to 1987. It continued to run in syndication until 2000 on several television channels including commercial network television stations, PBS stations, The Learning Channel, and Hallmark Channel. The original 65 episodes are currently owned by Hallmark Properties and were produced by WQED Pittsburgh.

Hosted by Ben Vereen, the show revolves around a group of six creative animal friends who live in a magical land called Zoobilee Zoo. Each possess a unique artistic skill and they frequently break into song and dance.

==Plot==
Each episode is opened by a greeting from host Ben Vereen, dressed as a spotted snow leopard, who plays the mayor of Zoobilee Zoo. Speaking directly to viewers that he refers to as &quot;Zoobaroos&quot;, Vereen usually appears throughout each episode to summarize the main themes or to perform a song and dance.

The plot in each episode revolves around the main characters, called Zoobles, as they play together and encounter difficulties common to young children. The primary themes are cooperation, making friends, and creativity.

==Cast and characters==
Each Zooble character has a certain artistic talent that shapes the way they approach different scenario:
* Sandey Grinn as Bill Der Beaver in all but 2 episodes, who likes to invent and fix stuff.
** Michael Sheehan as the original Bill Der Beaver in 2 episodes. When Sheehan decided to leave the show for other interests (such as &quot;Jem&quot;), he was replaced by Sandey Grinn.
* Forrest Gardner as Van Go Lion, who enjoys art.
* Karen Hartman as Talkatoo Cockatoo, who enjoys reading, writing, and speech.
* Michael B. Moynahan as Lookout Bear, who enjoys adventuring and travel.
* Gary Schwartz as Bravo Fox, who enjoys performing.
* Louise Vallance (Stevie Vallance) as Whazzat Kangaroo, the youngest Zooble who encourages kids to enjoy music and dance.
* Ben Vereen as Mayor Ben, a snow leopard who stars as the host of the show explaining what kind of adventure the Zoobles will be having. Apart from the opening he rarely interacts with any of the other characters.

===Minor characters===
* Roger Behr as Limerick Leprechaun and Peter Possum
* Roger Peltz as Rhymin&#x27; Simon and the Genie
* Crosby the Dog as Crosby
* Suzy Gilstrap as Sandy
* Robert Shields as Elmo the Clown
* Patty Maloney as Ergo
* Helen Lambros as the Witch
* Vinson Crump as Vince
* Norman Merrill as Dr. Feelright 
* Caleb Chung as Bert Backtrack

In addition, Grinn, Schwartz and Vallance have also played some minor characters. Schwartz played the gorilla in &quot;A Camping We Will Go&quot; (revealed in a blooper reel) and Grinn played Bravo&#x27;s Vaudeville friend Charlie Google in &quot;Vaudeville Star&quot;. Due to this, in the respective episodes, neither Bravo nor Bill appear. Vallance voiced Gilda the Tooth Fairy in &quot;When You Wish Upon a Tooth Fairy&quot;.

==Background and production==
Premiering on September 15, 1986, &quot;Zoobilee Zoo&quot; was produced and directed by Steve Binder. The show&#x27;s concept was developed by Hallmark Entertainment, which partnered with children&#x27;s production company DIC Enterprises.

In 1992, The Learning Channel picked up the show as part of its &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; lineup for preschoolers.

Episodes were released on a wide array of VHS tapes—the most recent series released in 1997—but not yet released to DVD. In 2000, three new direct-to-video episodes and soundtracks were released, and the stage show &quot;Zoobilee Zoo Live!&quot; toured briefly.

==Reception==
&quot;Zoobilee Zoo&quot; was well-received critically, but earned only modest viewer ratings. It was praised by the National Education Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers and the National Association of Elementary School Principals. In addition, it was endorsed by the Action for Children&#x27;s Television (ACT).

==Episodes==
Episodes with an asterisk (*) contain Michael Sheehan as Bill Der Beaver. All other segments feature Sandey Grinn in the role.

<doc id="213115" wikidata="Q5430552" url="?curid=213115" title="Fairlight Glen">
<text>Fairlight Glen lies about east of the fishing port of Hastings and west of the small village of Fairlight Cove on the East Sussex coast. It is a wooded area forming part of the Hastings Country Park Nature Reserve and leading down to Covehurst Bay. This is a naturist beach, but is shared by non-naturist visitors. The name Covehurst Bay is not normally used for the beach, but is marked on OS maps.

The beach is mainly shingle with large boulders and some patches of sand, particularly at low tide. The main cove lies between lower cliff areas formed in major cliff collapses some time in the past. There are no facilities or buildings of any kind on the beach, nor in the country park on the cliffs above. The harbour arm of Hastings is just visible at low tide, as is the nuclear power station at Dungeness a few miles further east.
The beach can be reached by walking from Hastings along the hilly clifftop coast path until a signpost points out a pathway leading down the cliff to the cove. There is currently a detour around Ecclesbourne Glen due to a landslip

The beach can also be reached from Firehills, a coastguard station and viewpoint, with parking for visitors to the park. From here it is a steep 20 minute walk downhill west along the coast path.

It is normally possible to walk along the beach to Hastings, but this may be cut off at high tide; the journey is an arduous one, involving extensive walking on loose pebbles and the debris from cliff falls. It also possible, at low tide only, to walk east along the beach to Fairlight Cove and Petts Level. Both these routes may be blocked by cliff falls which happen regularly on this coast.
The high cliffs are sandstone and clay which is subject to erosion. Access to the beach was officially closed when the original wooden steps leading down from the coast path were swept away in a landslip. Alternative steps have been cut into the path by users; as of June 2021 the path was safe to walk, but the visitor should be prepared for a bit of a climb Anyone contemplating swimming should be aware of hidden rocks and the absence of lifeguards or normal rescue services. Occasionally people have been rescued by helicopter from the beach or cliffs.

<doc id="213121" wikidata="Q13785" url="?curid=213121" title="Cavite">
<text>Cavite, officially the Province of Cavite (; Chavacano: &quot;Provincia de Cavite&quot;), is a province of the Philippines located in the Calabarzon region. On the southern shores of Manila Bay and southwest of Manila, it is one of the most industrialized and fastest-growing provinces in the Philippines. As of 2020, it has a population of 4,344,829, making it the most populated province in the country if the independent cities of Cebu are excluded from Cebu&#x27;s population figure.

The &quot;de facto&quot; capital and seat of the government of the province is Trece Martires, although Imus is the official (&quot;de jure&quot;) capital while the City of Dasmariñas is the largest city in the province.

For over 300 years, the province played an important role in both the country&#x27;s colonial past and eventual fight for independence, earning it the title &quot;Historical Capital of the Philippines&quot;. It became the cradle of the Philippine Revolution, which led to the renouncement of Spanish colonial control, finally culminating in the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June12, 1898 in Kawit. The old provincial capital, Cavite City also hosted docks for the Manila galleon, becoming an essential part of commerce between Asia and Latin America.

Originally an agricultural province, its northern cities of Bacoor, Imus, and Dasmariñas (with a combined population of 1,864,560 at the 2020 Census) are now suburbs of Metro Manila due to increasing urbanization in the late 20th century. This province forms part of the Greater Manila Area.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cavite&quot; comes from the Hispanicized form of &quot;kawit&quot; (alternatively &quot;kalawit&quot;), Tagalog for &quot;hook&quot;, in reference to the small hook-shaped peninsula jutting out to Manila Bay. The name originally applied to the peninsula, &quot;Cavite La Punta&quot; (now Cavite City) and the adjacent lowland coastal area of &quot;Cavite Viejo&quot; (now Kawit, reverting to the original native spelling). The peninsula was also known in the pre-colonial era as &quot;Tangway&quot;, from Tagalog for &quot;peninsula&quot;.

Edmund Roberts, in his 1821 memoir, stated that the &quot;natives&quot; called it &quot;Caveit&quot; due to the &quot;crooked point of land extending into the sea&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
The present Cavite City was once a mooring place for Chinese junks that came to trade with the settlements around Manila Bay. The land was formerly known as &quot;Tangway&quot;. Archeological evidence in coastal areas shows prehistorical settlements.

===Spanish colonial period===
The Spanish colonizers who arrived in the late 16th century saw the unusual tongue of land jutting out on Manila Bay and saw its deep waters as the main staging ground where they could launch their bulky galleons. It would later become the most important port linking the colony to the outside world through the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade. In 1571, Spanish colonizers established the port and City of Cavite and fortified the settlement as a first line of defense for the city of Manila. Galleons were built and fitted at the port and many Chinese merchants settled in the communities of Bacoor and Kawit, opposite the Spanish city to trade silks, porcelain and other oriental goods.

&quot;A defensive curtained wall was constructed the length of Cavite&#x27;s western side,&quot; beginning from the entrance, &quot;La Estanzuela&quot;, and continuing to the end of the peninsula, &quot;Punta de Rivera&quot;, with the eastern shore unprotected by a wall. Cavite contained government offices, churches, mission buildings, Spanish homes, Fort San Felipe and the Rivera de Cavite shipyard. Docks were in place to construct galleons and galleys, but without a dry dock, ships were repaired by careening along the beach.

Fort San Felipe, La Fuerza de San Felipe, was built between 1609 and 1616. This quadrilateral structure of curtained walls, with bastions at the corners, contained 20 cannons facing the seashore. Three infantry companies, 180 men each, plus 220 Pampangan infantry, garrisoned the fort.

The galleons &quot;Espiritu Santo&quot; and &quot;San Miguel&quot;, plus six galleys were constructed between 1606 and 1616. From 1729 to 1739, &quot;the main purpose of the Cavite shipyard was the construction and outfitting of the galleons for the Manila to Acapulco trade run.&quot;

The vibrant mix of traders, Spanish seamen from Spain and its Latin-American colonies, as well as local residents, gave rise to the use of pidgin Spanish called Chabacano. A great number of Mexican men had settled at Cavite, spread throughout Luzon, and had integrated with the local Philippine population. Some of these Mexicans became Tulisanes (Bandits) that led peasant revolts against Spain. Mexicans weren&#x27;t the only Latin Americans in Cavite, as there were also a fair number of other Latin Americans, one such was the Puerto Rican, Alonso Ramirez, who became a sailor in Cavite, and published the first Latin American novel called &quot;Infortunios de Alonso Ramirez&quot; The years: 1636, 1654, 1670, and 1672; saw the deployment of 70, 89, 225, and 211 Latin-American soldiers from Mexico at Cavite.

In 1614, the politico-military jurisdiction of Cavite was established. As with many other provinces organized during the Spanish colonial era, Cavite City, the name of the capital, was applied to the whole province, Cavite. The province covered all the present territory except for the town of Maragondon, which used to belong to the Corregimiento of Mariveles. Maragondon was ceded to Cavite in 1754 when Bataan province was created from Pampanga province. Within Maragondon is a settlement established in 1660 by Christian Papuan exiles brought in by the Jesuits from Ternate in the Maluku Islands, and named this land &quot;Ternate&quot; after their former homeland.

Owing to its military importance, Cavite had been attacked by foreigners in their quest to conquer Manila and the Philippines. The Dutch made a surprise attack on the city in 1647, pounding the port incessantly, but were repulsed. In 1762, the British occupied the port during their two-year control in the Philippines.

In the 17th century, &quot;encomiendas&quot; (Spanish Royal land grants) were given in Cavite and Maragondon to Spanish conquistadores and their families. By the end of the 1700s, Cavite was the main port of Manila and was a province of 5,724 native families and 859 Spanish Filipino families.

The religious orders began acquiring these lands, with some donated, enlarging vast haciendas (estates) in Cavite during the 18th and 19th centuries, enriching themselves. These haciendas became the source of bitter conflicts between the friar orders and Filipino farmers and pushed a number of Caviteños to live as outlaws. This opposition to the friar orders was an important factor that drove many Cavite residents to support reform, and later, independence.

In 1872, Filipinos launched their revolt against Spain. Three Filipino priests—Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora—were implicated in the Cavite mutiny when 200 Filipinos staged a rebellion within Spanish garrisons. On August 28, 1896, when the revolution against Spain broke out, Cavite became a bloody theater of war. Led by Emilio Aguinaldo, Caviteños made lightning raids on Spanish headquarters, and soon liberated the entire province through the Battle of Alapan. Aguinaldo commanded the Revolution to its successful end – the proclamation of the First Republic of the Philippines on June 12, 1898, in Kawit.
During the Spanish–American War, American forces attacked the Spanish squadron in Cavite. The Spanish defeat marked the end of Spanish rule in the country. A captured Spanish cannon from the Cavite arsenal now sits in Village Green Park in Winnetka, Illinois, United States of America.

===Japanese occupation===

In May 1942, after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor Island, the Japanese Imperial forces occupied Cavite and made their presence felt in each town of the province and Cavite City itself, as well as in the young city of Tagaytay established in the 1930s.

After surviving the Bataan Death March and released from Capas, Tarlac concentration camp United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) Col. Mariano Castañeda, returned to Cavite and secretly organized the guerilla forces in the province.

The Japanese authorities pressured him to accept the position as Provincial Governor of Cavite, he refused many times over until his excuses did not work, much against his will he was forced to accept the position by the Japanese, and by thinking that it would be beneficial to further organize the resistance movement as Governor by day and a guerilla commander by night. Eventually, the Japanese discovered his guerilla connection and raided his house in the attempt to capture him, but he escaped along with Col. Lamberto Javalera by swimming the Imus river up to Salinas, Bacoor and finally joined his comrades in the field in Neneng, the General Headquarters of the Fil American Cavite Guerilla Forces (FACGF) located in Dasmariñas.

At this time due to his organizational skills the FACGF raised a regiment in each of the administrative units and also created attached special battalions. Overall, three special battalions, one medical battalion, one signal company, one hospital unit, and Division GHQ and Staff were raised to provide administrative and combat support. Later on, the FACGF, with a peak of 14,371 Enlisted Men and 1,245 officers, grew into a formidable force to take on the omnipresent rule of the Japanese in the province. At its peak the force contained 14 infantry regiments:

*1st Infantry Regiment, Imus (Col. Lorenzo Saulog)
*2nd Infantry Regiment, Bacoor (Col. Francisco Guererro)
*3rd Infantry Regiment, Silang (Col. Dominador Kiamson) 
*4th Infantry Regiment, Dasmariñas (Col. Estanislao Mangubat Carungcong)
*5th Infantry Regiment, Barangay Anabu, Imus (Col. Raymundo Paredes)
*6th Infantry Regiment, Cavite City (Col. Amado Soriano)
*7th Infantry Regiment, Alfonso (Col. Angeles Hernais)
*8th Infantry Regiment, Naic (Col. Emilio Arenas)
*9th Infantry Regiment, Mendez (Col. Maximo Rodrigo) 
*10th Infantry Regiment Kawit (Col. Hugo Vidal) 
*11th Infantry Regiment Imus (Col. Maximo Reyes)
*12th Infantry Regiment, Amadeo (Col. Daniel Mediran) 
*13th Infantry Regiment, Rosario (Col. Ambrosio Salud)
*14th Infantry Regiment, Brgy. Paliparan, Dasmariñas (Col. Emiliano De La Cruz)

On January 31, 1945, the liberation of the province of Cavite started with the combined forces of the American 11th Airborne Division under General Joseph Swing and Col. Harry Hildebrand and the valiant Caviteño guerilleros of the Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces, which liberated the province of Cavite from the Japanese occupiers, and protected at all costs the National Highway 17 (Aguinaldo Highway) from Tagaytay City to Las Piñas that serve as the vital supply route of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division, paving the way towards the road to the bitter but victorious Battle of Manila.

=== Philippine independence era ===
The economic growth of the country began to creep its way to the province following the end of the Second World War and the restoration of independence. Given its proximity to Manila, the province soon began to feel a transformation into an economic provider of food and industrial goods not just for Metro Manila but for the whole of the country. In 1954, Trece Martires City was created out as a planned capital city from portions of Tanza, Indang, Naic, and General Trias. Despite the transfer of capital status to Imus in 1979, it retains many offices of the provincial government, acting thus as the de facto capital of the province. Also, Tagaytay&#x27;s high location and cool temperatures would enable it to become a secondary summer capital and a vacation spot especially during the Christmas season, given its proximity to the Manila area.

The economy of Cavite remained largely agricultural during the decades after the war, from the 1940s to the 1980s, with attempts to create industrial estates in the early 1970s largely falling flat in light of the Crony Capitalism and economic crises of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

====During the Marcos administration====

The Philippines&#x27; gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being one of the early landmark events. Economic analysts generally attribute this to the ramp-up on loan-funded government spending to promote Ferdinand Marcos’ 1969 reelection campaign, although Marcos blamed the 1968 formation of the Communist Party of the Philippines as the reason for the social unrest of the period. There were clashes between government and communist protesters in the rural areas and the western highlands of Cavite.

Another conflict faced by the Philippines throughout the last part of the 20th century had some of its roots in Cavite - the moro conflict, which was largely sparked by outrage in the wake of exposes about the Jabidah Massacre. The exposes told the story of how a group of moro men were recruited by the military for Operation Merdeka, Marcos&#x27; secret plan to invade Sabah and reclaim it from Malaysia, and trained them on the island of Corregidor, which is administered by Cavite province. When for various reasons the recruits decided that they no longer wanted to follow their officers&#x27; orders, their officers allegedly shot all the recruits to death, with only one survivor managing to live by feigning death. The exposes angered the Philippines&#x27; Muslim minority enough to trigger the Moro conflict, eventually leading to the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

In 1972, one year before the expected end of his last constitutionally allowed term as president in 1973, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law. This allowed Marcos to remain in power for fourteen more years, during which Cavite went through many social and economic ups and downs.

The excesses of the Marcos Family prompted opposition from various Filipino citizens despite the risks of arrest and torture. Among the prominent Caviteño oppositionists were Armed Forces Colonel Bonifacio Gillego, who spoke out against human rights abuses by the military and later exposed the fact that Ferdinand Marcos had faked most of his military medals. Another was Roman Catholic Priest Fr. Joe Dizon, who led protest actions against government corruption and human rights abuses during martial law in the Philippines, political dynasties, and the pork barrel system and brought social issues to the attention of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines. Both Gillego and Dizon are honored at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who fought authoritarian rule under Marcos. Other Caviteños honored there include Philippine Navy Captain Danilo Vizmanos, musician Benjie Torralba, activists Modesto &quot;Bong&quot; Sison, Florencio Pesquesa, and Artemio Celestial, Jr., and Nemesio Prudente who would later become president of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.

Presidential Decree No. 1 of 1972 grouped the Provinces of the Philippines into administrative regions, and Cavite was organized into Region IV. The Luzon mainland provinces of this region - Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon - were prioritized for industrialization, and large amounts of agricultural land in Cavite were acquired for conversion into industrial estates throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. However, these government-owned or corporate-owned estates were unsuccessful at first, and many of them became unused lands well into the Philippine economic collapse of the early 1980s. Old Cavite residents who were primarily engaged in agriculture were displaced and left the province, replaced by a rising number of residents from the capital region.

Rosario was the first Cavite town to have several large industrial projects, including a refinery set up by FilOil Refinery Corporation. An influx of new residents into the north and west parts of Carmona led to the separation of these portions into a new town, General Mariano Alvarez, in 1981. The migration had begun in 1968, when the Carmona Resettlement Project was established under the People&#x27;s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) - an effort to resettle illegal settlers from around the Quezon Memorial Park area in Quezon City. A site in Carmona was selected, and by the mid-1970s, the resettlement area soon attracted poor and middle class migrants alike from Quezon City, Manila, Makati and Parañaque. Their clamor to have a municipality of their own resulted in the creation of General Mariano Alvarez. Bacoor, given its proximity to Metro Manila, saw the building of the first residential villages during this time, providing accommodation the rising number of workers from the nearby capital.

One geographical feature of Cavite, Mount Sungay, was significantly altered in 1979 when First Lady Imelda Marcos ordered the construction of the Palace in the Sky, a mansion originally intended as a guesthouse for former California Governor Ronald Reagan (who never arrived). This drastically reduced the height of the mountain, which had once been a landmark that helped guide sailors into Manila bay. The mansion remained unfinished after the People Power Revolution in 1986 that toppled the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos. The new government renamed it the People&#x27;s Park in the Sky, to show the excesses of the ousted regime.

===Contemporary===
In 2002, Region IV was split into two parts: Region IV-A, known as Calabarzon; and Region IV-B, known as Mimaropa. Cavite was made part of Region IV-A, which is also known as the Southern Tagalog Mainland.

==Geography==

Cavite is surrounded by Laguna province to the east, Metro Manila to the northeast, and Batangas province to the south. To the west lies the South China Sea. It is located within the Greater Manila Area, not to be confused with adjacent Metro Manila, the defined capital region.

Cavite is the second-smallest province in the Calabarzon region, only after Rizal. Cavite occupies a land area of , which is approximately of Calabarzon&#x27;s total land area, of the regional area and of the total land area of the Philippines. The municipalities of Maragondon and Silang have the biggest land areas, comprising and respectively, while the municipality of Noveleta has the smallest land area as indicated by or of the provincial total and area.

===Topography and slope===

Situated at the entrance of Manila Bay, Cavite is characterized by rolling hinterlands punctuated by hills; a shoreline fronting Manila Bay at sea level; and a rugged portion at the boundary with Batangas where the Dos Picos mountains are located. The province has two mountain ranges.

Cavite is divided into four physiographical areas, namely: the lowest lowland area, the lowland area, the central hilly area, and the upland mountainous area.

* The lowest lowland area is the coastal plain in particular. These areas have extremely low ground level of elevation compared to the high tide level of about from the mean sea level (msl). These are the cities of Cavite, Bacoor and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, northern part of Carmona and eastern part of Ternate.
* The lowland area consists of the coastal and alluvial plains. These areas have flat ground slopes of less than 0.5% and low ground elevation of . The alluvial plain can be found in the city of Imus and the southern part of General Trias. These municipalities form the transition area between the coastal plain and the central hilly area. It also covers some areas of Bacoor, Carmona, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, and Tanza.
* The third topography type is the central hilly area, generally found on the mountain foot slope. It forms the rolling tuffaceous plateau. This topography includes steep hills, ridges and elevated inland valley. The plateau is characterized with ground elevation ranging from to nearly . Its ground slope ranges from 0.5 to 2%. The cities of Trece Martires and Dasmariñas and the municipalities of General Emilio Aguinaldo, General Mariano Alvarez, western part of Ternate, northern parts of Amadeo, Indang, Silang, Magallanes and Maragondon have this kind of topography.
* The last topography type is upland mountainous area, found in the city of Tagaytay and the municipalities of Alfonso, Mendez, southern parts of Amadeo, Indang, Silang, Magallanes and Maragondon. They are situated at a very high elevation above with slopes of more than 2%. The Tagaytay ridge has an average elevation of with Mount Sungay at , the highest elevation in the province at . The mountain was much higher before with an elevation of , topped by rock formations that resembled horns (&quot;Sungay&quot; in Tagalog) hence the name. The prominence of the mountain was leveled in half during the construction of People&#x27;s Park in the Sky during the Marcos administration.

===Islands===
* Balot Island, located at the mouth of Ternate River
* Caballo Island
* Corregidor
* El Fraile Island
* Carabao Island
* La Monja Island, located west of Corregidor
* Limbones Island, located off the Maragondon coast near the Batangas border
* Pulo ni Burunggoy (now &quot;Island Cove Resort&quot;; formerly &quot;Covelandia&quot;) located in Bacoor Bay
* Santa Amalia Island, located Northwest of Corregidor
===Land resources and distribution===
Cavite&#x27;s land resources are categorized into two: forest lands and alienable and disposable lands. Forest lands are being maintained as they play a great role in the ecological balance of the province aside from the fact that they are home to numerous flora and fauna that needs to be protected and preserved. Correspondingly, the alienable and disposable lands are the built-up areas as well as production areas. These lands are intended for urban, economic and demographic developments.

====Forest lands====
Cavite province lies in the western monsoon forest zone. This location is very beneficial for the formation of tropical rainforests, which are characteristically made through natural vegetation. In 2007, the existing forest area within the province totaled only to . These forest areas were categorized as Protected Landscape under the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS) and the rest, unclassified forest (Non-NIPAS). A total of are located within the Mounts Palay-Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape, a protected area in Ternate and Maragondon created by Proclamation Number 1594 on October 26, 1976. The park lies at the border of Cavite and Batangas and encompasses three peaks, Palay-Palay, Pico de Loro and Mataas na Gulod. The five unclassified forests are found along Tagaytay Ridge, Maragondon, Magallanes, Ternate and Alfonso. The other mountain peaks in the province are Mt. Buntis, Mt. Nagpatong, Mt. Hulog and Mt. Gonzales (Mt. Sungay).

Cavite&#x27;s forest provides an abundance of different forest products. Bamboo, a member of the grass family, is one of the most available forest products found in the municipalities of Ternate, Magallanes, Maragondon and General Aguinaldo throughout the year.

====Alienable and disposable lands====
These lands are being used in various ways, either for agriculture, residences, open areas, etc. Based on the Cavite Provincial Physical Framework Plan 2005–2010, Cavite&#x27;s alienable and disposable lands are further classified into production lands and built-up areas. Production lands in Cavite are intended for agriculture, fishery, and mining. On the other hand, built-up areas are mainly for residential areas, commercial, industrial and tourism areas.

====Production land-use====

Majority of production land-use is for agriculture. Considering that 50.33% of the total provincial land area is engaged in agriculture, it can be generalized that in spite of rapid urbanization in the province, Cavite remains to have an agricultural economy that makes food security attainable. Some of the major crops being produced in the province are rice, corn, coffee, coconuts, cut flowers and vegetables.

Included in the agricultural land use are livestock farms that range from piggery, poultry, goat and cattle farms. The climatic suitability of Cavite makes the province ideal for integrated farming, having crops and livestock raising in one farm.

Fishery is also another major component of the agricultural sector. Having rich marine resources and long coastlines, the province is home to numerous fishery activities providing livelihood to many Caviteños. In some lowland and even upland areas, fishery, in the form of fish ponds are also producing a large amount of fish products. Some areas in Cavite are also engaged in fish processing and production of fish products like fish sauce.

Mining is the third component of production land-use in the province. As of 2009, there are 15 mining and quarrying areas operating in Cavite. Extraction includes filling materials, gravel, and sand.

====Built-up areas====

The built-up areas are mainly composed of residential and industrial sites. This also includes commercial and business areas where commerce is transpiring. According to the 2007 Census of Population and Housing by the Philippine Statistics Authority, there are 611,450 occupied housing units in Cavite.

Moreover, according to the Housing and Land-Use Regulatory Board, there are around 1,224 housing subdivisions with issued license to sell in the province until 2009 which occupies an area of .

Meanwhile, the industrial sector also develops rapidly in the province. For 2009, operational industrial estates cover around . Tourism establishments are also considered built-up areas such as golf courses, leisure farms, resorts and the likes.

===Water resources===
The hydrological network of the province is composed of seven major rivers and its tributaries. These river systems generally flows from the highlands of Tagaytay and Maragondon to Manila Bay. Numerous springs, waterfalls and rivers found in the upland areas of the province, have been developed for tourism. In the lowland areas, hundreds of artesian wells and deep wells provide water supply for both residential and irrigation purposes.

Cavite shoreline stretches about . The communities located along the coast are Cavite City, Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate. The richness of Cavite&#x27;s coastal resources is a major producer of oysters and mussels. The fishing industry also produces shrimp and &quot;bangus&quot; (milkfish). The western coastline are lined with pale gray sand beaches popular with tourists. Thus, fishery and tourism contribute to the economic activity of the province.


====Major rivers====
These rivers are known to have various tributaries passing through the municipalities of the province:

===Soil properties===
Cavite is composed of several soil types according to soil surveys conducted by the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM). Classification of soil types in a specific area is a very important consideration in identifying its most fitted land-use. This way, utmost productivity can be achieved.

The lowland area of Cavite is generally composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam. It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while those in the upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant in the southern part of Bacoor and Imus bordering Dasmariñas. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of Rosario, Tanza, Naic and Ternate are lined with Guadalupe sand.

The central area principally consists of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This is recommended for diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to root crops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown in this type of soil. Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.

The type of soils that dominate the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Santa Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.

===Mineral resources and reserves===

The greater parts of Cavite are composed of volcanic materials, tuff, cinders, basalt, breccias, agglomerate and interbeddings of shales, and sandstones. The dormant and active volcanoes (Taal) are within these volcanic areas and have been the sources of volcanic materials which form the Tagaytay Cuesta. The drainage systems are deeply entrenched in the tuffs, eroding thin interbedded sandstones and conglomerate rocks which are the sources of little reserves of sand and gravel in the larger stream. Adobe stone quarries also flourish in the tuff areas.

Cavite coastal areas have marl and conglomerate sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks which are prominent in the high, mountainous regions of western part of the province. Black sands are found in Kawit while Noveleta has its own salt products. Magallanes has gravel deposits while reserves of sand and gravel materials are found in Alfonso, Carmona, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, Naic, Ternate, Maragondon and Silang.

===Administrative divisions===
Cavite comprises 15 municipalities and 8 cities:



===Climate===
Cavite belongs to Type 1 climate based on the Climate Map of the Philippines by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Being a Type 1, Cavite has two pronounced seasons – the dry season, which usually begins in November and ends in April, and the rainy season, which starts in May and ends in October. The Köppen Climate Classification sub-type for this climate is &quot;Am&quot; (Tropical Monsoon Climate).
==Demographics==
Cavite had a total population of 4,344,829 in the 2020 census, making it the most populous (if independent cities are excluded from Cebu), and the second most densely populated province in the country. The tremendous increase can be observed in the year 1990 when industrialization was introduced in the province. Investors established their businesses in different industrial estates that magnetized people to migrate to Cavite due to job opportunities the province offers. Another factor attributed to the increase of population is the mushrooming of housing subdivisions. Since Cavite is proximate to Metro Manila, people working in the metropolitan area choose to live in the province together with their families. Natural increase also contributes to the increase in population. The population density of the province based on the 2020 census was .

Among the cities and municipalities in Cavite, the city of Dasmariñas has the biggest population with 703,141 people while the municipality of Magallanes has registered the smallest population with 23,851 people.

Cavite is classified as predominantly urban having 90.69 percent of the population concentrated in the urban areas, while 9.21 percent of the population reside in the rural areas.

===Religion===
==== Christianity ====
In line with national statistics, Christianity is the predominant faith in the province, composed of Catholics, Protestants, and other Independent Christian groups. The majority (70%) of the population are Roman Catholic under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Imus. Our Lady of the Pillar is the titular patroness of the province since the Diocese of Imus was created in 1961.

Adherents of the Philippine Independent Church, also known as the Aglipayan Church, under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Cavite are particularly found in the towns where historically the Philippine Revolution and anti-clericalist sentiments are strong.

The Eastern Orthodox Church presence in Cavite province was a part of the Philippine Orthodox Church here in the Philippines under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Moscow and its own Orthodox Diocese province in Southeast Asia the Diocese of the Philippines and Vietnam. Many Orthodox community lives throughout the province especially in the city of Tagaytay.

==== Iglesia Ni Cristo ====
The largest minority in the province ,subdivided in 2 ecclesiastical district (Cavite and Cavite South ).
Has numerous chapels the exact significance presence forming 4% followers. 
The strong presence of other Christian denominations and sects such as the mainline Protestant Evangelical Churches, Christian Fellowships, Confessional churches and other Christian sects are also evident throughout the province. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are in Cavite. Remarkably, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has established its key institutions in the province such as the Adventist University of the Philippines, Adventist International Institute of Advanced Studies, Southern Asia-Pacific Division, and Cavite Mission. Meanwhile, the Members Church of God International (MCGI) has established coordinating centers throughout the province and a local convention center situated in Biga, Silang, Cavite

==== Islam ====
With the influx of Filipino Muslim migrants from the Mindanao, local Caviteño &quot;Balik Islam&quot; or reverts, and some non-Filipino expats, their OFW spouses and children returning from Muslim countries, Sunni Islam of either the Shafii or Hanbali schools-of-thought has become evident in various areas of the province, and accounts for the majority of the non-Christian population.

Mosques, prayer halls, and prayer rooms catering to the community exist in places where local Muslim Caviteños live and work; especially in the cities of Bacoor, Imus, and Dasmariñas, as well as the municipality of Rosario.

Interreligious dialogue and communal relations between the majority Christians and minority Muslims are peaceful and amicable, with some families consisting of both Christian and Muslim members.

==== Other faiths ====
Non-Abrahamic faiths include native Tagalog anitism, animism, Sikhism, and Hinduism. Among the local Chinese and Chinese-Filipino communities, Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism are followed.

===Languages===

The main languages spoken are Tagalog and English, with the former also used alongside a native Cavite dialect that has variants in each municipality of the province. Due to the proximity of Metro Manila cities bordering Cavite to the north, a significant number of people from farther provinces have migrated to Cavite, resulting in minor yet notable use of Bicolano, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Kapampangan, Waray, Maranao, Maguindanaon, and Tausug languages.

==== Chavacano in Cavite ====
Chavacano, or Chabacano, is a Spanish-based creole language known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano was originally spoken by the majority of Caviteños living in Cavite City and Ternate after the arrival of the Spaniards three centuries ago. Various groups in the area, with different linguistic backgrounds, adopted a pidgin language—mainly with Spanish vocabulary—to communicate with one another. As children in Cavite grew up with this pidgin as their native language, it evolved into a creole language.

Now used almost exclusively in Cavite City and coastal Ternate, Chabacano reached its widest diffusion and greatest splendor during the Spanish and American periods of Filipino history, when newspapers and literary works flourished. Cavite Chabacano was relatively easy to speak, as it was essentially a simplified version of Castilian morphology patterned after Tagalog syntax. Gradually and naturally, it acquired sounds present in the Spanish phonological system. After World War II, creole Spanish speakers in the capital of the archipelago disappeared. Today, around 30,000 Caviteños, mostly elderly, still speak Chabacano. The language is now taught in elementary schools in both Cavite City and Ternate as part of the K-12 national curriculum from first to third grade, fostering a new generation of speakers and writers in the province.

==Culture==
Aside from the celebrations of town fiestas, the province of Cavite celebrates festivals as forms of thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest. Some of these festivals are also observed in honor of the historical legacies passed from one generation to another generation. In fact, the province fetes the Kalayaan Festival which is given a great social importance in commemoration of the heroism of its people. The annual &quot;Fiesta de la Reina del Provincia de Cavite&quot; is a grandiose fiesta celebration in honor of the patroness of the province during the Spanish period and before the Diocese of Imus was created, the &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga&quot;. The image is enshrined at San Roque Church in Cavite City. Her feastday is celebrated every 2nd and 3rd Sunday of November. The titular patroness of the province of Cavite since 1961 is Our Lady of the Pillar or Nana Pilar. Her feast day is celebrated ever October 11 and 12.

Traditions and fiesta celebrations include &quot;Mardicas&quot;, a war dance held in Ternate town. &quot;Karakol&quot; street dancing with a fluvial procession is usually held in coastal towns. There is also a pre-colonial ritual called the &quot;Sanghiyang&quot; as a form of thanksgiving and to heal the sick. Another cultural tradition is the &quot;Live via Crucis or Kalbaryo ni Hesus&quot; held during Holy Week. The &quot;Maytinis&quot; or word prayer that is annually held in Kawit every December 24 before the beginning of the midnight Mass.

Previously, it was also home to the Bacoor City Strikers basketball team of the MPBL.

AsiaBasket held a tournament in Dasmariñas in November 2023 at the Dasmariñas Arena, which also hosted a selection of Philippine Basketball Association games.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===

The province is predominantly an agriculture province. The province&#x27;s economy is largely dependent on agriculture. Despite urbanization and industrialization, still, a significant number of inhabitants are engaged into agribusinesses. The data gathered from Office of the Provincial Agriculturist shows that though the province lies in the industrial belt, the agricultural land is about 49.38% or of the total land area of the Province. This is bigger than that of the declared agricultural lands in 2008 ().

The municipality of Maragondon has the biggest area intended for agriculture, accounts for 14.57% of the total provincial agricultural lands while Cavite City has no longer available land for agriculture related activities and industries. If based on total agricultural lands, we may say that the major players in agriculture in the province are Maragondon, Silang, Indang, Naic and Alfonso. Of the eight districts in the province, the top three with the widest agricultural area are 7th District comprising or 61.85% of the total agricultural areas with 27,115 farmers followed by 6th District with 17.40% or having 8,701 farmers and 5th District comprising with 10,295 farmers. The municipality of Silang has the most farmers. The municipality of Maragondon only ranks 3rd in terms of number of farmers. This can be attributed to highly mechanized operations and vast plantations of rice. The same is true with General Trias and Naic, known as the rice producing municipalities in Cavite. The number of farmers increased by 6.5% that corresponds to around 3,097 farmers. The increase in the number of farmers was due to worldwide recession which led to work displacement of some inhabitants. Silang is dominated by pineapple and coffee plantations as well as with cut flower production.

===Industry and commerce===
Cavite has twelve economic zones. The largest economic zone under development is located in General Trias, the PEC Industrial Park with intended for garments, textiles, semiconductors, food processing and pharmaceuticals.

Mt. Pico De Loro is the highest part of Cavite at 664 meters above sea level and is noted for its 360-degree view at its summit and a cliff known as Parrot&#x27;s Beak or Monolith that mountaineers would also like to climb. Mt. Marami, within the same mountain range, located at Magallanes town is also a mountaineering location due to its &quot;silyang bato&quot; (en. Chair of rocks) at its summit.

There are twenty-two accredited tourism establishments and three accredited tour guides. There are also tour packages being arranged with the Department of Tourism. Centuries old traditions and the very rich culture of Cavite have been the source of great pride to Caviteños.

==Transportation==
During the Spanish colonial period, Cavite hosted the principal port of Manila and served as the country&#x27;s gateway to the world.

In the mid-19th century, Cavite, particularly the Cavite Peninsula in the north, was a stop for ships from South America before free trade opened up.

===Roads===
Cavite&#x27;s total road network comprises roughly . Of these, the national roads are mostly paved with concrete or asphalt and are relatively in good condition with some portions in need of rehabilitation. Provincial roads stretches to an approximate total length of . Most of these roads are concrete, some are paved with asphalt and the rest remain gravel roads. Majority of the municipal/city roads are paved with concrete, while barangay roads consist of 46.7% concrete and asphalt roads and 53.3% earth and gravel roads.

There are three main highways traversing the province: Aguinaldo Highway runs in a general north–south direction which includes the Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway segment in the south; the Governor&#x27;s Drive runs in a general east–west direction; the Antero Soriano Highway runs within the coastal towns on the northwest. The existing road length computed in terms of road density with respect to population at the standard of per 1,000 population has a deficit of .

In 1985, the tolled Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX) was opened, which lessened the heavy volume of vehicles on Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor. This project decreased the traffic congestion in Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor, so travel time from Imus to Baclaran/Pasay is lessened to only one hour.

In 2013, the Kaybiang Tunnel, the country&#x27;s longest underground highway tunnel at was opened along the Ternate–Nasugbu Road piercing through Mt. Pico De Loro&#x27;s north ridge, and shortens the travel time from Manila to the western coves of Cavite and Nasugbu, Batangas.

Currently, Cavite province is served by three Department of Public Works and Highways offices: Cavite 1st, Cavite 2nd and Cavite Sub District Engineering Offices.

===Proposed/ongoing transportation projects===

====Sangley International Airport====
The Department of Transportation had &quot;no objection&quot; to an offer building a airport complex on reclaimed land in Sangley Point. The upcoming international airport was pursued as a joint venture between investors, including Chinese enterprises, and the Cavite LGU.

====Cavite–Laguna and Cavite–Tagaytay–Batangas Expressways====

The Cavite–Laguna Expressway (CALAX) is an under-construction expressway that will cross the provinces of Cavite and Laguna in the Philippines. The construction of the four-lane long expressway will connect CAVITEx in Kawit to South Luzon Expressway in Biñan, Laguna. When constructed, it is expected to ease the traffic in the Cavite–Laguna region, particularly in Aguinaldo Highway, Santa Rosa–Tagaytay Road and Governor&#x27;s Drive. As of 2024, it is partially operational from Biñan to Silang, Cavite.

Cavite–Tagaytay–Batangas Expressway is also a proposed expressway connects with CALAX from Silang, Cavite to Nasugbu, Batangas. CTBEx is a future alternative route for tourists going to Tagaytay and Nasugbu.

====LRT Line 1 Cavite Extension Project====
The LRT Line 1 South Extension Project or Cavite Extension Project, through southern Metro Manila to the Province of Cavite has been identified as an integral link of the Rail Transit Network by the Metro Manila Urban Transportation Integration Study (MMUTIS), and the extension project was originally planned as the first litratation of Line 6 in the 1990s. It is one of the priority projects of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC, now the Department of Transportation) and LRTA. It is also a flagship project of the Office of the President.

The project aims to expand the existing LRT Line 1 service southward to the cities of Parañaque, Las Piñas and the city of Bacoor in Cavite. The route of the light railway system that will start from Baclaran to Niog was planned to carry a capacity of 40,000 passengers per direction per hour. A groundbreaking ceremony for LRT Line 1 South Extension Project was held on May 4, 2017 and construction started on May 7, 2019 after the right-of-way was &quot;free and clear&quot; of obstructions. Once it is fully operational, Cavite will be served by the LRT-1 (via Niog station.

, phase 1 is 98.2% complete. Department of Transportation Executive Assistant Jonathan Gesmundo announced the construction of 8 additional stations to the current 20 LRT-1 stations with operations of LRT-1 Cavite Extension Phase 1 are expected by mid-November 2024. Meanwhile, phases 2 and 3 will begin operations by 2031.
This is one of the three rapid transit line projects outside Metro Manila. The said project will serve approximately 1.9 million commuters in Pasay, Parañaque, Las Piñas, and Bacoor.

====LRT Line 6 Project====
The proposed LRT Line 6 project would further extend the LRT system by another 19 kilometers all the way to Dasmariñas from the proposed end in Niog in Bacoor, Cavite.

The mass transit system would pass along the Aguinaldo Highway and would have stations in Niog, Tirona station, Imus station, Daang Hari station, Salitran station, Congressional Avenue station, and Governor&#x27;s Drive station. The project will improve passenger mobility and reduce the volume of vehicular traffic in the Cavite area by providing a higher capacity mass transit system. It also aims to spur economic development along the extension corridor. 

When the original project was shelved in 2018, a similar proposal was submitted by Prime Asset Ventures Inc., and its chairman, Manny Villar, proposed a 47.2-kilometer railway system that links the southern Metro Manila to the major cities in Cavite.

<doc id="213126" wikidata="Q690567" url="?curid=213126" title="Yunnanozoon">
<text>Yunnanozoon lividum (Yunnan + Greek ζῷον &quot;zôion&quot; (animal), with species name Latin &quot;lividum&quot;; (lead-coloured), referring to preserved colour of specimens) is an extinct species of bilaterian animal from the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang biota of Yunnan province, China. Its affinities have been long the subject of controversy.

== Description ==

The body of &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot; was fusiform, with specimens ranging from in length. The body was strongly laterally compressed, meaning that it was taller than it was wide. A segmented dorsal unit was present on the top of the body. The first segment of which was triangular, while the other segments were approximately rectangular. Axial stripes also ran down the body in the region immediately below the dorsal unit. Towards the front of the animal were 7 pairs of filamentous arches. These arches were covered by sac-like structures which had openings between them. Towards the back of the body a tube-like structure was present, possibly the gut, with four pairs of enigmatic circular structures (possibly gonads) were present at the mid-point of the body. The front half of the body had rod-like structures running along the top and bottom, which were probably sclerotized.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Yunnanozoon&quot; was described by Hou, Ramskold &amp; Bergstrom in 1991, who considered its placement to be &quot;incertae sedis&quot; within Metazoa. The placement of &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot; has been controversial, with various studies suggesting placements as a cephalochordate, a stem-chordate, a hemichordate, a stem-vertebrate, a stem-deuterostome, an ambulacrarian, a bilaterian of uncertain placement, as a protostome of uncertain position, or a relative of Ecdysozoa.

In 1995, Jerzy Dzik placed &quot;Yunannozoon&quot; into its own class, Yunnanozoa. In 1999, another genus of yunnanozoan, &quot;Haikouella&quot; described from the same deposits as &quot;Yannonzoon,&quot; with the species &quot;Haikouella lanceolata.&quot; A second species of the genus &quot;Haikouella jianshanensis&quot; was described in 2003. The describers of &quot;Haikouella&quot; distinguished it from &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot; based on the number of filamentous arches and circular structures, and the placement of structure proposed to be pharyngeal teeth. However a comprehensive study of yunnanozoans in 2015 found that the number of filamentous arches and circular structures were the same in all yunnanozoans examined and that the supposed &quot;pharyngeal teeth&quot; were instead remnants of other structures, suggesting that there was only one species, &quot;Yunnanozoon lividum,&quot; with both &quot;Haikouella&quot; species being junior synonyms of it.

The same comprehensive 2015 study considered &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot; to be a member of Bilateria of uncertain placement. A 2022 study of the filamentous arches using advanced imaging techniques suggested that they were &quot;composed of cartilage within an extracellular matrix of micofibrils&quot;, suggesting that yunannozoans were stem-vertebrates.

A 2024 study motivated by a reinterpretation of the fossil &quot;Pikaia&quot; placed &quot;Yunnanozoon&quot; as a transitional stem-chordate form between a paraphyletic Vetulicolia and the more crownward Chordata as shown on this simplified cladogram:

== Ecology ==
&quot;Yunannozoon&quot; is suggested to have used its filamentous arches to feed with the openings on the side of the body being used to expel water.

<text>The Boston Navy Yard, originally called the Charlestown Navy Yard and later Boston Naval Shipyard, was one of the oldest shipbuilding facilities in the United States Navy. It was established in 1801 as part of the recent establishment of the new U.S. Department of the Navy in 1798. After 175 years of military service, it was decommissioned as a naval installation on 1 July 1974.

The property is administered by the National Park Service, becoming part of Boston National Historical Park. Enough of the yard remains in operation to support the moored USS &quot;Constitution&quot; (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;) of 1797, built as one of the original six heavy frigates for the revived American navy, and the oldest warship still commissioned in the United States Navy and afloat in the world. , a 1943 World War II-era &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyer serving as a museum ship, is also berthed here. The museum area includes a dock which is a stop on the MBTA Boat water transport system. Among local people in the area and the National Park Service, it is still known as the Charlestown Navy Yard.

The South Boston Naval Annex was located along the waterfront in South Boston, an annex of the Navy Yard from 1920 to 1974. Other annexes of the Navy Yard during World War II were the Chelsea Naval Annex (formerly the Green Shipyard, now the Fitzgerald Shipyard), East Boston Naval Annex, and Boston Naval Yard Fuel Depot Annex.

==History==
The earliest naval shipbuilding activities in Charlestown, Massachusetts across the Charles River and Boston Harbor to the north from the city of Boston, began during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). The Charlestown Arsenal of United States Army was established in 1794. Shortly thereafter, in 1800, the land for the Charlestown Navy Yard was purchased by the United States government and the yard itself was established. The yard built the first U.S. ship of the line, in 1814, and at least twelve small vessels for the American Civil War, but was primarily a repair and storage facility until the 1890s, when it started to build steel ships for the &quot;New Navy&quot;. By then, it was called the Boston Navy Yard.

On 24 June 1833, the staff and dignitaries including then Vice President Martin Van Buren, Secretary of War Lewis Cass, Secretary of the Navy Levi Woodbury, and many Massachusetts officials, witnessed &quot;one of the great events of American naval history&quot;: the early United States frigate was inaugurating the first naval drydock in New England designed by prominent civil engineer Loammi Baldwin Jr.

The ropewalk supplied cordage used in the Navy from the time it opened in 1837 until the Yard closed in 1975. After the Civil War (1861–1865), the Yard was downgraded to an Equipment and Recruit Facility.

In the late 1880s and 1890s, the Navy began expanding again bringing into service new modern steel-hulled steam-powered warships and that brought new life to the Yard. In the first years of the 20th century, a second drydock was added. During World War II (1939/1941–1945), it worked to fix British Royal Navy warships and merchant transports damaged by the Nazi Germans when crossing the North Atlantic Ocean. On 27 September 1941—Liberty Fleet Day—Boston launched two destroyers, USS &quot;Cowie&quot; and the USS &quot;Knight&quot;. Even before the U.S. entered the Second World War after the Pearl Harbor attack on 7 December 1941, a month before in November, Boston was one of four United States naval shipyards selected to build s under the Lend-Lease military assistance program for the Royal Navy. Since the United States was at war when these ships were finally completed, some were later requisitioned and used by the United States Navy as destroyer escorts.

In the post war period, the shipyard modified World War II ships for Cold War (1945–1991) service through Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM). The Korean War (1950–1953), and Vietnam War (1964–1975) did not bring much work to the yard since it was so far from the fighting. The Yard closed after the Vietnam War.

It was also the location of the Marine Barracks Boston.

==Dry Docks and Slipways==

==Ships built at Boston Navy Yard==
== Current use ==
When ideas were floated for redevelopment of the yard, one of the people&#x27;s popular idea was to have the yard turned into a construction yard for oil tankers. Ultimately, these plans fell through, and the site became part of the Boston National Historical Park. Its mission is, &quot;to interpret the art and history of naval shipbuilding&quot;.

The Boston Navy Yard hosts many attractions, including Charlestown Naval Shipyard Park. The fully commissioned and the museum ship are tied up at Pier 1 and open to the public. The Navy Yard also hosts the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; Museum. Dry Dock No. 1 is still used for ship maintenance for &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;Cassin Young&quot;. In May 2015, &quot;Constitution&quot; entered the dry dock for three years of repairs.

The Yard is toward the north end of the Freedom Trail. The MBTA Boat stops at nearby Pier 4, providing easy visitor access to the Yard. The campus of the MGH Institute of Health Professions occupies seven buildings in the Yard, including classroom, office, and clinical space. Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and multiple Massachusetts General Hospital research laboratories occupy the perimeter.

<text>The University of Aberdeen (abbreviated Aberd. in post-nominals; ) is a public research university in Aberdeen, Scotland. It was founded in 1495 when William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen and Chancellor of Scotland, petitioned Pope Alexander VI on behalf of James IV, King of Scots to establish King&#x27;s College, making it one of Scotland&#x27;s four ancient universities and the fifth-oldest university in the English-speaking world. Along with the universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, the university was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.

The university as it is currently constituted was formed in 1860 by a merger between King&#x27;s College and Marischal College, a second university founded in 1593 as a Protestant alternative to the former. The university&#x27;s iconic buildings act as symbols of wider Aberdeen, particularly Marischal College in the city centre and the crown steeple of King&#x27;s College in Old Aberdeen. There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King&#x27;s College campus dominates the section of the city known as Old Aberdeen, which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university&#x27;s foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King&#x27;s College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university&#x27;s Foresterhill campus is next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and houses the School of Medicine and Dentistry as well as the School of Medical Sciences. Together these buildings form one of Europe&#x27;s largest health campuses. The annual income of the institution for 2023–24 was £264 million of which £56.9 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £188.9 million.

Aberdeen has educated a wide range of notable alumni, and the university played key roles in the Scottish Reformation, Scottish Enlightenment, and the Scottish Renaissance. Five Nobel laureates have since been associated with the university: two in Chemistry, one in Physiology or Medicine, one in Physics, and one in Peace.

==History==
===King&#x27;s and Marischal Colleges===

There appears to have existed in Old Aberdeen, from a very early period, a &quot;studium generate,&quot; or university, attached to the episcopal chapter of the See of Aberdeen. It is said to have been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and although, according to Hector Boece, it still existed at the period when King&#x27;s College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way ceased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed to serve, since King James IV, in his letter to Pope Alexander VI, requesting him to found a university in Old Aberdeen, mentions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound ignorance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that part of his kingdom.

The first university in Aberdeen, King&#x27;s College, formally The university and King&#x27;s College of Aberdeen (Collegium Regium Aberdonense), was founded on 10 February 1494 by William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen, Chancellor of Scotland, and a graduate of the University of Glasgow drafting a request on behalf of King James IV to Pope Alexander VI resulting in a papal bull being issued. It seems that James was keen to ensure that Scotland had as many universities as England at the time, and it was to possess all the privileges enjoyed by those of Paris and Bologna, two of the most highly favoured in Europe. The university, modelled on that of the University of Paris and intended principally as a law school, soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, Hector Boece, the first principal appointed in 1500. Its aim was to train doctors, teachers and clergy who would serve the communities of northern Scotland, as well as lawyers and administrators for the Scottish Crown. It was a collegiate foundation with 36 full-time staff and students and walls protecting it from the outside world. In 1497 the college established the first chair of medicine in the English-speaking world.

The first book (there was no printing press in Scotland at the time) to be printed in Edinburgh and in Scotland was the Aberdeen Breviary, which was written by both Elphinstone and Boece in 1509.

Following the Scottish Reformation in 1560, King&#x27;s College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change. George Keith, the fifth Earl Marischal, was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of Peter Ramus and Andrew Melville. In April 1593 he founded a second university in the &#x27;New Town&#x27;, Marischal College. It is also possible the founding of the Fraserburgh University in nearby Fraserburgh by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century university prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge).

Initially, Marischal College offered the principal of King&#x27;s College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused – the first blow in a developing rivalry. Marischal College, in the commercial heart of the city (rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of Old Aberdeen), was quite different in nature and outlook. For example, it was more integrated into the life of the city, such as allowing students to live outwith the college. The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes in court, but also in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen. Duncan Liddell endowed the first chair in mathematics at Marischal College in 1613, but the first professor was not appointed until 1626.

As the institutions put aside their differences, a process of attempted (but unsuccessful) mergers began in the 17th century. During this time, both colleges made notable intellectual contributions to the Scottish Enlightenment. Both colleges supported the Jacobite rebellion and following the defeat of the 1715 rising were largely purged by the authorities of their academics and officials.

===King Charles&#x27; University (1641–61) and the merger of the two colleges (1860)===

The nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the &quot;Caroline University of Aberdeen&quot;, a merger initiated by Charles I in 1641, which united the two colleges for twenty years. Following the civil conflicts of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, a more complete unification was attempted following the ratification of Parliament by Oliver Cromwell during the interregnum in 1654. This united university survived until the Restoration whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by Charles II and the two colleges reverted to independent status. Charles I is still recognised as one of the university&#x27;s founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King&#x27;s College.

The Aberdeen Philosophical Society (known locally as the Wise Club) was created by Thomas Reid, George Campbell, David Skene, John Gregory, John Stewart, and Robert Traill, and held its first meeting in the Old Red Lion Inn on 12 January 1758. From its inception, the society was an intimate, private body whose members were drawn exclusively from the learned professions, and this feature differentiated it from the more open and socially inclusive societies like the Glasgow Literary Society or the Select Society of Edinburgh. Over 133 papers were given and discussed at the meeting, and many of these formed the basis of books subsequently published. The society was eventually disbanded in March 1773. The society and its individual members played a key role in the Scottish Enlightenment, and it was the most important forum for the promotion of enlightened thought and values in Aberdeen. The Philosophical Society was revived in 1840, with the object of receiving and debating original scientific, literary and philosophical papers from its members; however, the decision was taken on 13 September 1939 to discontinue its meetings, chiefly in view of the difficulties posed by the war, although it does not appear to have been ever formally wound up.

The Free Church of Scotland founded Christ&#x27;s College in Aberdeen in 1843 for the training of ministers. An extravagant Gothic building, with a commanding oriel window and tower, was erected for the college at the western end of Union Street in 1850. Linked to the college was a museum and library (containing 17,000 volumes). Following the church reunion of 1929, Christ&#x27;s College became a Church of Scotland college and was integrated into the University of Aberdeen. The college building is no longer used by either the church or the university, and the college is contained completely within the buildings of King&#x27;s College, maintaining its own divinity library. The university hosted its first meeting of the British Science Association in 1859. Having no suitable meeting place to host the meeting, the town raised the money themselves by personal subscription and built the Music Hall. It was capable of holding about 2,500 people and so successful was the meeting that associate membership, necessary to gain access to the proceedings, had to be capped. Prominent among the local organisers were Professors James Clerk Maxwell (Natural Philosophy) and James Nicol (Geology) of Marischal College. Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, took on the role of president for the year. The young Maxwell himself, still only 28, spoke on three different subjects, one being a presentation of his newly discovered law of molecular velocities in a gas. The &#x27;Maxwell distribution law&#x27;, as it is now known, is the law of physics with the strongest Aberdeen connection. In addition, Sir Charles Lyell, president of the Geological Section of the British Academy, and a champion Charles Darwin&#x27;s work, made one of the first announcements that Darwin had undertaken a body of work on evolution and was about to release his findings. The organisers felt that they might be risking something in holding the meeting much further north than they had done before but in the event the Aberdeen meeting was the most well attended the BA had ever had.

Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. William Ogilvie, known as the Rebel Professor, proposed a paper on the union and reform of the two colleges in 1787, but the proposals were rejected by seven (known as the &#x27;seven wise Masters&#x27;) out of ten professors at King&#x27;s. The evolving examination system and university research now required much higher academic standards from the students. The two colleges in Aberdeen merged on 15 September 1860 in accordance with the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858, which also created a new medical school at Marischal College. The 1858 Act of Parliament stated the &quot;united University shall take rank among the Universities of Scotland as from the date of erection of King&#x27;s College and University.&quot; The university is thus Scotland&#x27;s third oldest and the United Kingdom&#x27;s fifth oldest university.

The transference of the arts classes from Marischal to King&#x27;s College required the extension of King&#x27;s at the cost of £20,000. This included the rebuilding of two sides of the quadrangle for the class-rooms (1862) and the erection of the library (1870), which for many years had occupied the nave of the chapel.

In 1873, university students voted against university degrees being open to women. However, all faculties were open to women in 1892, and in 1894 the first 20 matriculated females began their studies at the university. Four women graduated in arts by 1898, and by the following year, women made up a quarter of the faculty.

===The modern university===

The closing of the quadrangle of Marischal College was completed during the university&#x27;s quatercentenary in 1906, which was officially opened by Edward VII and Alexandra, and which saw some of the most extravagant celebrations and expressions of civic pride ever demonstrated in Aberdeen. Four days of festivities took place across the city, which included church services, banquets, torchlight processions, and fireworks displays. In all, the cost of the four days of festivities was the modern equivalent of £1.34 million. The ceremony saw the granting of honorary degrees to over a hundred public and academic figures from across the academic world. In an extravagant display of luxury, Lord Strathcona, the then chancellor of the university, spent £8518 in entertaining around 2500 invited guests in a tent specially designed for the occasion. After having received an honorary degree (LLD) in 1905, Thomas Hardy celebrated Aberdeen as &#x27;a University which can claim in my opinion to an exceptional degree that breadth of view &amp; openness of mind that all Universities profess to cultivate, but many stifle&#x27;. Hardy wrote a poem for a special number of the student publication, &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, in celebration of the quatercentenary of the university.&#x27;I looked and thought, &quot;All is too gray and cold

To wake my place-enthusiasms of old!&quot;

Till a voice passed: &quot;Behind that granite mien

Lurks the imposing beauty of a Queen.&quot;

I looked anew; and saw the radiant form

Of Her who soothes in stress, who steers in storm,

On the grave influence of whose eyes sublime

Men count for the stability of the time&#x27;In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King&#x27;s College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King&#x27;s College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King&#x27;s lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in brutalist style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
During the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King&#x27;s College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum (Marischal College has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a £57 million new university library (the Sir Duncan Rice Library) opened in autumn 2011 at the King&#x27;s College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012. Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King&#x27;s College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.

In February 2020, the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) found that in approving a financial settlement agreement with the former Principal Sir Ian Diamond, the university failed to make best use of public funds or exercise good governance. As a result of the investigation, the university was ordered to repay £119,000 of grant finance to the SFC and undertake an externally-facilitated examination of its governance and culture.

==== Modern Languages ====
On 5 December 2023 it was announced that a working group, chaired by Professor Karl Leydecker, had been set up to look at the future of teaching of modern languages at the University. It was looking at three options, &quot;all of which involve the end of single honours French, Gaelic, German and Spanish&quot;, and was engaging in consultation with student and faculty. It was stated that departmental &quot;income does not cover even the direct costs of staff delivering Modern Languages provision before any central costs ... leading to a projected deficit for Modern Languages of £1.64m in 2023/24.&quot; The financial statements were contested by staff and UCU. At an online meeting of the University Senate on 6 December, senators voted 78–15 in favour of a motion which &quot;called for an immediate halt in the consultation process until an overall plan is presented in detail to Senate for appropriate scrutiny.&quot; Five senators abstained. On 8 December The Gaudie reported that staff had been sent &#x27;Risk of Redundancy&#x27; letters which stated that staff who are made redundant would receive four months pay. This contrasts with the University&#x27;s severance policy which states that &quot;the maximum redundancy package available to staff is 12 months of pay or £100,000; whatever is lower.&quot;

A group of academics from the department released a statement which described the proposed changes as &quot;institutional vandalism&quot;. They continued &quot;The management&#x27;s self-destructive plan would see the University of Aberdeen become the first ancient university in the world not to offer language degrees in one of the most monolingual countries&quot; 

A University statement said: &quot;Our difficulty is that this academic year, following longer term declining demand in the UK for traditional specialist language study, a total of just five students began Single Honours across our four Modern Language programmes including Gaelic.&quot;

A public petition to save Modern Languages gained over 18,600 signatures. After the submission of two motions calling to protect languages degrees at the University of Aberdeen, a debate took place in Scottish Parliament, where the University was urged to explore alternative options. EU consulates also spoke out in favour of the languages programmes., as well as scome of Scotland&#x27;s best-known folk music starts. The local UCU branch successfully balloted for strike action at the University, in support of Modern Languages degrees. Staff-led business proposals were positively received and the consultation on Modern Languages was ended in March 2024 with the removal of risk of compulsory redundancies.

==Buildings and campuses==
The university&#x27;s main campus is at King&#x27;s College in Old Aberdeen, where the original buildings are still in use in addition to many 20th century buildings. A second campus at Foresterhill accommodates the School of Medicine, Medical Science and Nutrition. In addition, there are smaller facilities at other sites such as the Royal Cornhill Hospital to the west of the city centre, and the Rowett Institute in Bucksburn.

=== Current campuses ===

====King&#x27;s College====
The King&#x27;s College campus covers an area of some 35 hectares around the ancient King&#x27;s College buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university&#x27;s built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of Aberdeen city centre. The university does not own all the buildings on the &quot;campus&quot; which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on custom from the university community) and it is best thought of as a district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by First Aberdeen and from northern Aberdeenshire or Aberdeen bus station by various routes operated by Stagecoach Bluebird.

The historic King&#x27;s College buildings form a quadrangle with an interior court, two sides of which have been rebuilt and expanded with a library wing in the 19th century. The Crown Tower and the chapel, the oldest parts, date from around 1500. The original foundation contained the chapel, the Great Hall and living accommodation, with its own kitchen and brewery, a well in the quadrangle, and a college garden to provide herbs and vegetables. The Grammar School was just outside the walls, in front of the college. The Crown Tower is surmounted by a structure about 40 ft (12 m) high, consisting of a six-sided lantern and Imperial crown, both sculptured, and resting on the intersections of two arched ornamental slips rising from the four corners of the top of the tower. This crown, also known as the &quot;Crown of Kings&quot;, frequently acts as a symbol of the university. The choir of the chapel contains original oak-canopied stalls, miserere seats, and lofty open screens in the French flamboyant style. They were preserved by the college&#x27;s Principal during the Reformation, who fought off local barons who had attacked the nearby St Machar&#x27;s Cathedral. The Cromwell Tower, created between 1658 and 1662 opposite the Crown Tower, was originally built as residential accommodation, but an observatory was built on top in 1826. The library wing was converted into an exhibition and conference venue in the 1990s and today also houses the university&#x27;s Business School.

The first of the modern age of construction in the King&#x27;s campus began with the construction in 1913 of the New Building (now known as &quot;New King&#x27;s&quot;), largely in a similar architectural style to the old buildings. A large manse located on the lawn opposite King&#x27;s College was removed before the First World War. New King&#x27;s groups to form a yet larger quadrangle-like green for the campus also bordered by the High Street, King&#x27;s and Elphinstone Hall, a traditional 1930 replacement for the Great Hall. The Elphinstone Hall was subsequently used as a dining facility but is now used for graduations, examinations, fairs, and other large university events.However, most students and staff spend relatively little time in these historic buildings, with a large number of modern ones housing most facilities and academic departments. Most date from the second half of the 20th century. Some of these echo the existing architecture of Old Aberdeen, such as the Fraser Noble Building with its distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King&#x27;s College. Other buildings were constructed of stone in the 1950s (e.g. the Taylor Building and Meston Building). A number of other buildings are designed in the brutalist style, such as the Arts Lecture Theatre and adjoining William Guild Building, opened in 1969 to house the School of Psychology. Also on the site is the Cruickshank Botanic Garden which was presented to the university in 1899 and is open to the public.

The Powis Gateway forms the east gate and archway from College Bounds, Old Aberdeen. These oriental style towers with minarets have provoked much interest over the years. At one time there was a portrait of John Leslie dressed in Turkish costume, on the walls of Powis House, but there is no obvious connection between the estate and the Middle East. The gateway is also adorned with panels bearing the coats of arms of the Lairds of Powis. The Estate of Powis was owned by the Frasers—their crest is shown on the towers—until the marriage of an heiress to a Leslie. Powis House was built by Hugh Leslie. The house was the home of John Leslie, Professor of Greek at Kings College. It was subsequently owned by the Burnett family. In 1936, J.G. Burnett sold most of the estate to Aberdeen Town Council who built a housing estate in the area comprising over 300 residences.

The Sir Duncan Rice Library was designed by Danish architects Schmidt Hammer Lassen and completed in 2011. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in September 2012 and named after Duncan Rice, a previous Principal of the university. This seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass, replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university&#x27;s main library and can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors. In addition to expanded facilities it also houses public exhibition space and the university&#x27;s historic collections, comprising more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts collected over five centuries since the university&#x27;s foundations. Other libraries are in the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences). The university&#x27;s library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books.

The most recent building is the Science Teaching Hub. Completed in 2021, the building contains laboratories for subjects including biological sciences, chemistry, geosciences and medical sciences.

The Aberdeen Sports Village, located across King Street from the Old Aberdeen campus, houses sports facilities and the aquatics centre.

====Foresterhill====

The university&#x27;s Foresterhill Campus is located approximately to the east of the Old Aberdeen campus and is home to the university&#x27;s Life Sciences and Medicine facilities. It is co-located with Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Royal Aberdeen Children&#x27;s Hospital and Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, all teaching hospitals operated by regional health board NHS Grampian. The campus accommodates the School of Medicine, Medical Science and Nutrition; the School of Psychology; and the School of Biological Sciences. It also includes the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, the Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, and Institute of Education for Medical &amp; Dental Sciences.

The Foresterhill site is managed jointly with NHS Grampian. The university has had a presence at Foresterhill since around 1938, and the management of the site was formalised in 1997 by the completion of an operational agreement between the two parties.

====Doha, Qatar====
A new campus in Doha, Qatar was established in May 2017. Known as AFG College with the University of Aberdeen, it is a partnership with Al Faleh Group for Educational and Academic Services (AFG). The courses currently offered are accounting, finance and business management. The campus Principal is Brian Buckley.

==== Marischal College ====

Marischal College is a neo-Gothic building, having been rebuilt in 1836–41, and greatly extended several years later. Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle as additions to the buildings were opened by Edward VII in 1906 and form the current facade from Broad Street. The building is widely considered to be one of the best examples of neo-Gothic architecture in Great Britain; the architect, Alexander Marshall Mackenzie was a native of Aberdeen as well as an alumnus of the university. The Mitchell Tower at the rear is named for the benefactor (Dr Charles Mitchell) who paid for the graduation hall. The opening of this tower in 1895 was part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the university.

Until 1996, Marischal College housed the Departments of Molecular &amp; Cell Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which had been there for many decades. From 1996, the departments moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus. Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King&#x27;s College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict.

The majority of the building was leased to Aberdeen City Council in 2008, with significant re-development taking place to allow the council to occupy it as its new administrative headquarters. Occupation of the rear portion of the building is retained by the university including the former Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall, which was used previously for graduation and other academic ceremonies before moving to Elphinstone Hall at King&#x27;s College.

====Hilton====
A small campus at Hilton became part of the university estate following a merger in 2001 between the university and the Aberdeen campus of the Northern College of Education, and temporarily became home to the university&#x27;s Faculty of Education. It was less than a mile southwest of King&#x27;s College campus. Following the renovation of the MacRobert Building at King&#x27;s College to house the School of Education (completed in 2005), the Hilton campus was closed and sold to developers. The campus was demolished and the land is now occupied by a residential development called &quot;The Campus&quot;.

==Organisation and administration==

===Governance===
In common with the other ancient universities in Scotland, the university&#x27;s structure of governance is largely regulated by the Universities (Scotland) Acts of 1858. This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the General Council of senior academics and graduates, the University Court responsible for finances and administration, and the Academic Senate (&quot;Senatus Academicus&quot;)—the university&#x27;s supreme academic body.
There are correspondingly three main officers of the university. It is nominally headed by the chancellor, a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the Bishop of Aberdeen, but as a result of the Scottish Reformation holders are now elected for life by the General Council. There is also a rector of the university, who chairs the University Court and is elected by the students for a three-year term to represent their interests. There are also four assessors, ten masters, including the principal and vice principal, and the factor or procurator.

The administrative head and chief executive of the university is its principal and vice-chancellor. The principal acts as chair of the &quot;Senatus Academicus&quot;, and his status as vice-chancellor enables him to perform the functions reserved to the chancellor in the latter&#x27;s absence, such as the awarding of degrees.

===University officials===

The university&#x27;s three most significant officials are its chancellor, principal, and rector, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.

The chancellor is the nominal head of the university. The chancellor since 2013 is Queen Camilla. She is the first female chancellor of the university. The chancellor, or, if necessary, his or her deputy, confers degrees on graduates and chairs the university&#x27;s General Council.

The principal and vice-chancellor of the university is Professor George Boyne. He joined the university on 1 August 2018 and was officially installed in his role on 16 January 2019.

The rector of the university has been—since 1860—elected by the students to serve a three-year term of office; before that, the office was appointed. The rector&#x27;s duties are to chair meetings of the University Court and to represent student views on that body. In November 2024, Iona Fyfe, a Scottish folk singer, was elected by the student body of the university as the new rector. Other notable Aberdeen rectors have included Winston Churchill, Andrew Carnegie, H. H. Asquith, Maggie Chapman and Clarissa Dickson Wright, who was Aberdeen&#x27;s first female rector.

==== The University Court ====
This body was created by the commissioners during the merger of King&#x27;s and Marischal in 1870. It was part of a series of reforms introduced to rectify the method of government, with the Court acting as a court of appeal from the Senatus. The Court originally consisted of six members; the rector, representing the students, the principal, and one assessor each to the chancellor, the rector, the General Council and the Senatus. However, today the Court consists of many more members. The Court&#x27;s principal role is to oversee the management of the revenue, property and other resources of the university.

==== &quot;Senatus Academicus&quot; ====
The Academic Senate (Latin: &quot;Senatus Academicus&quot;) is the supreme academic body for the university. Its members include all the professors of the university, certain senior readers, a number of senior lecturers and lecturers and elected student senate representatives. It is responsible for authorising degree programmes and issuing all degrees to graduates, and for managing student discipline. The president of the Senate is the university principal.

===Schools and Institutes===

The university is divided into 12 schools which are organised within a broad range of disciplines, with the larger schools sub-divided into three teaching colleges.

Multi-disciplinary institutes and research centres allow the university&#x27;s experts to collaborate on pioneering research projects.

===Finances===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Aberdeen had a total income of £264 million (2022/23 – £268.6 million) and total expenditure of £188.9 million (2022/23 – £259.3 million). Key sources of income included £91.3 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £96.9 million), £76.8 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £80.4 million), £56.9 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £56.3 million), £5.1 million from investment income (2022/23 – £3.4 million) and £3.8 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £0.7 million).

At year end, Aberdeen had endowments of £65.3 million (2023 – £58.6 million) and total net assets of £431 million (2023 – £352.4 million).

==Symbols of the university==
The university&#x27;s coat of arms is an integral part of the current logo, which along with the colours burgundy and white, is used extensively on campus signage, printed materials, and online.
===Coat of arms===
The university&#x27;s coat of arms incorporates those of the founders and locations of the two colleges it is derived from. In the top left quadrant are the arms of the burgh of Old Aberdeen, with the addition of a symbol of knowledge being handed down from above. Top right are those of George Keith, the fifth Earl Marischal. Bottom left are those of Bishop William Elphinstone. The bottom right quarter is a simplified version of the three castles which represent the city of Aberdeen (this symbol of the city also appears prominently on the arms of The Robert Gordon University).

===Motto===
The motto of the University of Aberdeen is &quot;Initium Sapientiae Timor Domini&quot;, which translates from Latin as &quot;The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord&quot;. It is a quote from the Old Testament of the Bible, Psalm 111, verse 10. It also appears in the Book of Proverbs (9:10). The motto can be seen at the archway beside New King&#x27;s on the High Street at the King&#x27;s College campus, as well as other campus locations and in formal settings such as on graduation certificates.

===Tartan===

A university tartan was created in 1992 as part of the celebrations for the 500th anniversary of the university which took place in 1995. The tartan was designed by the Weavers Incorporation of Aberdeen and Harry Lindley and incorporates colours from the university&#x27;s coat of arms.

===Academic dress===

Academic dress has been worn in the University of Aberdeen since mediaeval times. Aberdeen shared with the other ancient universities the wearing of scarlet gowns (&quot;toga rubra&quot;) and a trencher for undergraduates, but by the middle of the twentieth century its use amongst the students had faded. Bursars formerly wore a black gown, and were made to perform menial services about college. Female students wore a trencher with scarlet tassels, while male students wore black tassels.

Academic dress is usually worn only at formal occasions, such as at graduation, Founder&#x27;s Day, or academic processions which take place for ceremonial reasons. For undergraduate degrees (e.g. MA, BSc, LLB etc.), a long black gown is worn with a hood of black silk and lined with silk in a colour which varies depending on discipline. For example, the lining is white silk for all Master of Arts degrees, green silk for Bachelor of Science in pure sciences, and crimson silk for MBChB. A black mortarboard is also worn. For master&#x27;s degrees (e.g. MSc, MLitt etc.) a long black gown is worn, with a white silk hood lined in a colour that varies by discipline. For PhD, the doctor&#x27;s scarlet robe is worn with black facings and sleeve lining, along with a black &quot;John Knox&quot; cap. For other doctoral degrees (e.g. EdD, LLD etc.), the scarlet robe has facings and sleeve linings in a different colour.

==Academics==
=== Term ===
The academic year at Aberdeen was originally based upon the Scottish Term and Quarter Days, beginning with Martinmas (October – November), Candlemas (January – March), and ending with Whitsunday (April – June). However, today the academic term is divided into two semesters, the First Half-Session and the Second-Half Session, beginning in September and ending in May. Written examinations are sat in November and April and May, and graduation is celebrated either in November or at the end of June.

===Rankings and reputation===

Aberdeen is consistently ranked among the top 200 universities in the world and is ranked within the top 20 universities in the United Kingdom according to The Guardian. In the 2019 &quot;Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings&quot;, Aberdeen was ranked 31st in the world for impact on society. Aberdeen was also named the 2019 Scottish University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide. Over 75 per cent of the university&#x27;s research was classified as &#x27;world leading&#x27; or &#x27;internationally excellent&#x27; in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework.

Its highest internationally ranked subject is Divinity and Religious Studies, which is ranked at joint 25th in the world and 7th in the UK. It also has an excellent reputation for medical research and many of its subjects are ranked in top 10 in the UK, including Accounting &amp; Finance (ranked 4th in the UK, Complete 2021), Civil Engineering (10th in the UK, Complete 2021), Computing Science (9th in the UK, Guardian 2021), Dentistry (9th in the UK, Complete 2020; 1st in the UK, Guardian 2021), Education (9th in the UK, Complete 2021), Electrical and Electronic Engineering (8th in the UK, Complete 2020), Law (6th in the UK, Complete 2021; 10th in the UK, Guardian 2021), Medicine (4th in the UK, Complete 2021; 2nd in the UK, Guardian 2021), Linguistics (5th in the UK, Complete 2021), Musics (10th in the UK, Guardian 2021), Physics (7th in the UK, Guardian 2021), Sociology (10th in the UK, Guardian 2021), and Sports Science (2nd in the UK, Complete 2021; 10th in the UK, Guardian 2021). Economics was ranked 11th in the UK by Times Subject Rankings and 12th in the UK by Complete University Guide 2019.

===Admissions===
Aberdeen was ranked 9th for the average entry tariff by the Complete University Guide 2021 and 10th in the UK for the average entry tariff by Guardian 2025 rankings.

The university has one of the smallest percentages of students from lower-class backgrounds, being ranked fifth from bottom for class equality. The university participates in widening access schemes such as the Children&#x27;s University, REACH Scotland, Access Aberdeen, and ASPIRENorth, in order to promote a more widespread uptake of those traditionally under-represented at university.

=== Lecture series ===
The Gifford Lectures, established in 1887 by Adam Gifford, began at the university (along with the other ancient universities in Scotland) with E.B Tylor&#x27;s lecture on the Natural History of Religion between 1889 and 1991. Since then, over 30 Gifford Lectures have been given at the university, with some distinguished figures including Hannah Arendt, Alfred North Whitehead, Karl Barth, Paul Tillich, Michael Polanyi, N.T. Wright, and Jaroslav Pelikan.

A public lecture series was held in 2011 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the publication of the King&#x27;s James Bible. The university is also host to the annual Andrew Carnegie Lecture Series which began in 2014, with the first lecture given by Matthew Barzun.

The Elphinstone Institute hosts its own monthly lecture series, which began in 2016, in the MacRobert Building, with lectures usually given on local or Scottish topics. (The Elphinstone Institute also organises The Toulmin Prize, a short-fiction competition with a North East Scotland focus that is open to amateur writers.) The School of Engineering also hosts the RV Jones Distinguished Lecture Series which provides invited lectures from distinguished speakers in areas of engineering related to research within the School of Engineering.

== Libraries and Museums ==

The library was first located in the nave of King&#x27;s College Chapel and then moved to a new site in the college in 1870. The current library contains one of the most extensive university library collections in the United Kingdom, with over a million volumes and a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts, including the Hortus sanitatis. The library at Aberdeen was given the right of legal deposit under the Statute of Anne (1710) but this was rescinded in 1837, and as a result has a rare collection of pre-Victorian novels.
The core of the original library at King&#x27;s College was formed from Elphinstone&#x27;s books that he left to the university. The books were originally housed in a room in the south east tower (now the round tower). They were then moved to a building on the south side of Kings College Chapel, and in 1773 to the west end of the chapel. They were located in 1870 to a new building as illustrated. This library was extended in 1885, with galleries being installed in 1912, reading desks in 1932 and a mezzanine floor in 1964. The Queen Mother Library had been the university&#x27;s main library since 1965, and the original library in King&#x27;s College was replaced with the King&#x27;s College Conference Centre in 1991. The Queen Mother Library was refurbished and expanded in 1982.

The Sir Duncan Rice Library was officially opened on 24 September 2012 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, replacing the Queen Mother Library. It was designed by the Danish architectural firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen at the cost of £57 million. The building sits on a base of Scottish stone. The ground floor is double-height with seven floors above. The building is clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass. In the interior void spaces are located centrally. Contrasting with the geometric exterior, the central atrium formed by the void spaces has an organic form, shifting in location across the levels. It has won numerous awards for its architecture.

The university also has the Taylor Law Library which is located in the Taylor Building in Old Aberdeen, and the Medical Library on the Foresterhill Campus, which covers the Medicine and Medical Sciences disciplines. Christ&#x27;s College also possesses its own Divinity library.

The university maintains several museums and galleries, open free to the public. The university&#x27;s collections are internationally renowned and are recognised as of national significance by the Scottish Government. Originating in the eighteenth century, they now have over 300,000 items across a wide range of Human Culture, Medicine and Health, and Natural History. The Zoology Museum is officially classified as a Recognised Collection of national significance to Scotland and features displays from protozoa to the great whales, including taxidermy, skeletal material, study skins, fluid-preserved specimens and models.

==Student life==
As of the university had students, of which were postgraduates. In 2009/10 students represented 120 countries with about 46% men, 54% women. Of all of undergraduates, 19% were mature students (i.e. aged 25 years or more). The university has more than 550 different undergraduate degree programmes and more than 120 postgraduate taught programmes.

=== Students&#x27; Association ===
The student body is represented by a students&#x27; association known as Aberdeen University Students&#x27; Association (AUSA). Additionally, the elected Rector of the University of Aberdeen serves along with the AUSA president and another sabbatical officer as students&#x27; representatives on the University Court.

AUSA does not operate a traditional students&#x27; union, instead operating out of a university building, The Students Union Building, formerly The Hub, helping to support students and provide events and studying space. A large students&#x27; union formerly occupied an impressive granite building on the corner of Gallowgate and Upperkirkgate in the city centre, opposite Marischal College, but it closed in 2003. A second, smaller union opened at nearby Littlejohn Street a couple of years later, but by 2010 it too had closed.

The organisation has been involved in the creation of &quot;The Hub&quot;, a university-owned dining and social centre created by an extensive renovation of the former Central Refectory at the King&#x27;s College campus. It provides facilities for the whole university community (students and staff) and opened in 2006. A more traditional social space, the Butchart Student Centre, opened in 2009. It acts as the HQ of the Students&#x27; Association and provides a wide range of student facilities, but due to city council licensing regulations there is no bar. The Butchart Centre includes facilities for student societies and offices. The Butchart Centre was converted from what had been the campus sports centre before the opening of the Aberdeen Sports Village nearby. AUSA operates out of the Johnston Building.

&quot;BookEnds&quot; which sells second-hand books with profits going towards charity was initially established in the Butchart Recreation Centre but now operates in the AUSA building.

===Student societies and organisations===

There are over a hundred clubs and societies formally affiliated with the students&#x27; association. The students&#x27; association is responsible for sport at the university, which is managed by the Aberdeen University Sports Union, an AUSA committee. All registered students are eligible to join any of these clubs or societies.

The university&#x27;s oldest student organisation is the Aberdeen University Debater, founded by JF Maclennan in 1848 as the King&#x27;s College Debating Society. In 1871, a Literary Society was started by WM Ramsay, and four years later a Choral Society came to life. In 1884, the society also took the first steps towards the introduction of a students&#x27; representative council under support from Alexander Bain, the then Rector. The creation of the Union in 1895 provided a new debating chamber in Marischal College and the society&#x27;s first permanent home. The chamber beneath Mitchell Hall in Marischal College is Scotland&#x27;s oldest purpose-built debating chamber.

In 1998, an alumni fund called the Aberdeen Future Fund was founded, run by the Development Trust. It has raised over £2.5 million of unrestricted funds. Past projects have included a book fund for the Heavy Demand section in the library, providing &quot;Safe Campus&quot; leaflets, contributing to the student hardship fund, providing training mannequins for Clinical Skills, the organ for King&#x27;s College Chapel, and funding for intramural sports.

==== Sports clubs and the Sports Union ====
The students&#x27; association is responsible for sport at the university, which is managed by the Aberdeen University Sports Union, an AUSA committee. Established in 1889, it is affiliated to the BUCS and SSS and encompasses over fifty sports clubs. There are large playing fields at the back of King&#x27;s College and also Aberdeen Sports Village, a partnership between the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen City Council and sportscotland. It opened on 22 August 2009. An extension containing the aquatics centre opened on 5 May 2014.

The Aberdeen University Football Club was formed in 1872, and currently competes in the SJFA North First Division. The Aberdeen University Rugby Football Club was founded in 1871, and has a long history of producing both Scottish and British Lions players.

The annual boat race between Aberdeen University Boat Club and Robert Gordon University Boat Club has been competed for since 1995. The University of Aberdeen has lost only four times, in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2013.

Aberdeen Sports Village served as one of the official pre-games training venues of the Cameroon Olympic Team prior to the London 2012 Olympic Games.

==== Music ====
There are a large number of ensembles at the University of Aberdeen. Some are directed by academic staff, while others are run by students both in and out of the department and include; Balinese Gamelan, Baroque Ensemble, Big Band, Cantores ad Portam, Chapel Choir, Choral Society, Concert Band, String Orchestra and Symphony Orchestra.

The Aberdeen Student Show is a musical and theatrical show, usually with a strong comedy element, staged every year since 1921. Its purpose is to raise money for charity, as part of the Aberdeen Students&#x27; Charities Campaign. A number of its writers, performers and musicians have gone on to greater renown in the fields of theatre, media and the arts.

==== Student media ====
The first successful university newspaper, &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, began under the auspices of the University of Aberdeen Debating Society in 1883. The &quot;Alma Mater&quot; was replaced by &quot;The Gaudie&quot;, which has been in circulation since 1934, and is currently free-of-charge. The Gaudie is recognised as one of the oldest student newspapers in Scotland and the United Kingdom.

The University of Aberdeen also hosts a chapter of Her Campus, a magazine targeted at female students.

Other student media organisations include Granite City TV and Aberdeen Student Radio (ASR).

===Celebrations and festivals===

In 2020, the WayWORD Festival was launched by the university&#x27;s WORD Centre for Creative Writing. This yearly programme celebrates the arts through readings, performances, workshops and discussion panels. It has featured notable headliners including Val McDermid, Irvine Welsh and Douglas Stuart.

Until 2019, each year a student-led torcher parade was held. First held in 1889, it was the largest of its kind in Europe. Student groups and societies build floats and parade in fancy dress through the city centre to raise money for local charities. Traditionally spectators donated money in the form of coppers, a colloquial term for 1p and 2p coins.

===University accommodation===

Halls of residence are managed by the university. Two large concentrations of university accommodation are provided on the campus in Old Aberdeen and one mile north at the Hillhead Student Village, accessible by a walk through Seaton Park.

Campus accommodation in the heart of Old Aberdeen consists of self-catered King&#x27;s Hall and Elphinstone Road Halls.

The university has a &quot;First-Year Accommodation Guarantee&quot; providing that the student accept their firm offer before a set date prior to the beginning of term. In 2014–15, the university ran out of rooms and had to resort to temporary accommodation. The university continues to monitor accommodation costs and where possible offers discretionary support to students, to improve access to higher education.

Halls of residence include:

* Adam Smith House
* Elphinstone Road Flats
* Fyfe House
* Grant Court
* Hector Boece Court
* Keith House
* Kings Hall
* New Carnegie Court
* North Court
* South House
* Wavell House

The first modern halls of residence built by the university on the King&#x27;s College campus was Crombie halls, named after James Edward Crombie. They opened in 1960. The Crombie-Johnston halls were closed in 2017 following a decline in demand for catered accommodation.

The Elphinstone Road halls were completed in 1992.

== Traditions ==

=== &quot;Sponsio Academica&quot; ===
The Sponsio Academica is the oath, originally in Latin, taken by students matriculating into the four ancient Scottish universities (Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Aberdeen and Glasgow). This tradition now has been digitised at Aberdeen and is agreed to as part of an online matriculation process. Originally, new students matriculated in Mitchell Hall where the Chancellor would give a welcoming address.

Since 1888 the School of Medicine has used a form of the Sponsio Academica for graduating students to affirm in response to the discontinuation of the oath hitherto taken by students in all faculties:&quot;I solemnly declare that as a Graduate of Medicine of the University of Aberdeen, I will exercise my profession to the best of my knowledge and ability, for the good of all persons whose health may be placed in my care, and for the public weal; that I will hold in due regard the honourable traditions and obligations of the Medical Profession, and will do nothing inconsistent therewith; and that I will be loyal to the University and endeavour to promote its welfare and maintain its reputation.&#x27;

=== Founders&#x27; Day ===
Usually held annually in February, on Founders&#x27; Day, the university community pays tribute to its historic origins as an ancient university and in particular, the role played by William Elphinstone and other benefactors in the establishment of the university. The ceremony begins with an academic procession through the university and concludes with a service in King&#x27;s College Chapel. Talks are given by university lecturers and invited guests. A candle is lit in the chapel to give thanks to Elphinstone and the other patron fathers.

=== Installing of the rector ===
The rector, an ancient post dating back to the foundation of the university in 1495, is the students&#x27; representative, particularly in welfare matters, and sits on the University Court.

Tradition dictates that the University of Aberdeen&#x27;s new rector must ride through Old Aberdeen aloft a bull carried at shoulder height by students of the university. The ceremony includes a colourful academic procession representing civic, student and academic life in Aberdeen. University staff and students, along with representatives from the City and Aberdeenshire Councils, Incorporated Trades, MSPs, and alumni, attend the ceremony which is followed by a reception in the King&#x27;s Conference Centre.

The reception culminates with the new Rector being carried by the student mascot, Angus the Bull, from King&#x27;s College to the St Machar Bar in the High Street of Old Aberdeen, where tradition also dictates that he buy a round of drinks for his student supporters.

=== Bajan ===
Bajan, a medieval term (literally &#x27;yellow beak&#x27; – bec jaune), describing trainees in the pre-student year, was traditionally applied to Aberdeen University first year undergraduates. Female undergraduates were referred to as &quot;bajanellas&quot;. Second year students were called &#x27;Semis&#x27;, and these usually played jokes upon or clashed with bajans. Semis would usually tear first year&#x27;s gowns.

These terms were based on the four years of the degree:

* B first year (bajan)
* S second year (semi)
* T third year (tertian)
* M fourth year (magistrand)

<text>James Addison Baker III (born April 28, 1930) is an American attorney, diplomat and statesman. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 10th White House chief of staff and 67th United States secretary of the treasury under President Ronald Reagan and the 61st U.S. secretary of state before returning as the 16th White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush.

Born in Houston, Baker attended the Hill School and Princeton University before serving in the United States Marine Corps. After graduating from the University of Texas School of Law, he pursued a legal career. He became a close friend of George H. W. Bush and worked for Bush&#x27;s unsuccessful 1970 campaign for the United States Senate. After the campaign, he served in various positions for President Richard Nixon. In 1975, he was appointed Under Secretary of Commerce for Gerald Ford. He served until May 1976, ran Ford&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign, and unsuccessfully sought election as the Attorney General of Texas.

Baker ran Bush&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the 1980 Republican presidential nomination, but made a favorable impression on the Republican nominee, Ronald Reagan. Reagan appointed Baker as his White House chief of staff, and Baker remained in that position until 1985, when he became the secretary of the Treasury. As treasury secretary, he arranged the Plaza Accord and the Baker Plan. He resigned as treasury secretary to manage Bush&#x27;s successful 1988 campaign for president. After the election, Bush appointed Baker to the position of secretary of state. As secretary of state, he helped oversee U.S. foreign policy during the end of the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union, as well as during the Gulf War. After the Gulf War, Baker served another stint as White House chief of staff from 1992 to 1993.

Baker remained active in business and public affairs after Bush&#x27;s defeat in the 1992 presidential election. He served as a United Nations envoy to Western Sahara and as a consultant to Enron. During the Florida recount following the 2000 presidential election, he managed George W. Bush&#x27;s legal team in the state. He served as the co-chairman of the Iraq Study Group, which Congress formed in 2006 to study Iraq and the ongoing Iraq War. He serves on the World Justice Project and the Climate Leadership Council. Baker is the namesake of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. Since the death of Henry Kissinger in 2023, he is currently the oldest living former United States secretary of state, as well as the earliest serving.

==Early life, education, and pre-political career==
James Addison Baker III was born in Houston at 1216 Bissonnet St., the son of James A. Baker Jr. (1892–1973) and Ethel Bonner (née Means) Baker (August 6, 1894 – April 26, 1991). His father was a partner of Houston law firm Baker Botts. Baker has a sister, Bonner Baker Moffitt. His grandfather was attorney and banker Captain James A. Baker, and his great-grandfather was jurist and politician Judge James A. Baker.

Baker attended the Kinkaid School in Houston, before graduating from the Hill School, a boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1952 after completing a 188-page senior thesis, titled &quot;Two Sides of the Conflict: Bevin vs. Bevan&quot;, under the supervision of Walter P. Hall. He was a member of Phi Delta Theta. Baker was a member of the United States Marine Corps from 1952 to 1954, attaining the rank of first lieutenant as a naval gunfire officer serving in the Mediterranean Sea aboard the . He remained in the Marine Corps Reserve until 1958, and rose to the rank of captain. He earned a Bachelor of Laws (1957) from the University of Texas School of Law and began to practice law in Texas.

From 1957 to 1975, he practiced law at Andrews &amp; Kurth after the anti-nepotism policy of his family firm, Baker Botts, prevented him from being offered a job there.

==Early political career==
Baker&#x27;s first wife, the former Mary Stuart McHenry, was active in the Republican Party, working on the congressional campaigns of George H. W. Bush. Originally, Baker had been a Democrat but too busy trying to succeed in a competitive law firm to worry about politics, and considered himself apolitical. His wife&#x27;s influence led him to politics and the Republican Party. George H.W. Bush and Baker were regular tennis partners at the Houston Country Club in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and when Bush decided to vacate his congressional seat and run for the U.S. Senate in 1970, he supported Baker&#x27;s decision to run in his place. However, Baker changed his mind about running for Congress when his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer; she died in February 1970.

Bush then encouraged Baker to become active in politics to help deal with the grief of his wife&#x27;s death, something that Bush himself had done when his daughter, Pauline Robinson Bush (1949–1953), died of leukemia. Baker became chairman of Bush&#x27;s Senate campaign in Harris County, Texas. Though Bush lost to Lloyd Bentsen in the election, Baker continued in politics, becoming the finance chairman of the Texas Republican Party in 1971. The following year, he was selected as Gulf Coast Regional Chairman for the Richard Nixon presidential campaign. In 1973 and 1974, in the wake of the Nixon administration&#x27;s implosion over Watergate, Baker returned to full-time law practice at Andrews &amp; Kurth.

Baker&#x27;s time away from politics was brief, however. In August 1975, he was appointed Under Secretary of Commerce by President Gerald Ford, succeeding John K. Tabor. He served until May 1976, and was succeeded by Edward O. Vetter. Baker resigned to serve as campaign manager of Ford&#x27;s unsuccessful 1976 election campaign. In 1978, with George H. W. Bush as his campaign manager, Baker ran unsuccessfully for Attorney General of Texas, losing to future Texas governor Mark White.

==Reagan administration==
=== White House Chief of Staff (1981–1985) ===
In 1981, Baker was named White House Chief of Staff by President Ronald Reagan, in spite of the fact that Baker managed the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford in 1976 and of George Bush in 1980 opposing Reagan. He served in that capacity until 1985. Baker is considered to have had a high degree of influence over the first Reagan administration, particularly in domestic policy.

In 1982, conservative activists Howard Phillips (founder of the Conservative Caucus) and Clymer Wright of Houston joined in an unsuccessful effort to convince Reagan to dismiss Baker as chief of staff. They claimed that Baker, a former Democrat and a Bush political intimate, was undermining conservative initiatives in the administration. Reagan rejected the Phillips-Wright request. Around 1983 Baker became heavily dispirited and tired due to the weight of his job; he attempted to become National Security Advisor, a change to which Reagan initially agreed, but some of Reagan&#x27;s other advisers dissuaded him from naming Baker to the position. According to his wife, Baker was &quot;so anxious to get out of [his job]&quot; that he gave some consideration to the prospect of becoming Commissioner of Baseball, but he ultimately did not pursue that.

Baker managed Reagan&#x27;s 1984 re-election campaign in which Reagan polled a record 525 electoral votes total (of a possible 538), and received 58.8% of the popular vote to Walter Mondale&#x27;s 40.6%.

=== Secretary of the Treasury ===

In 1985, Reagan named Baker as United States Secretary of the Treasury, in a job-swap with then-Secretary Donald Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer who became chief of staff. Reagan rebuked Phillips and Wright for having waged a &quot;campaign of sabotage&quot; against Baker.

In 1985, Baker received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

During the Reagan administration, Baker also served on the Economic Policy Council, where he played an instrumental role in achieving the passage of the administration&#x27;s tax and budget reform package in 1981. He also played a role in the development of the American Silver Eagle and American Gold Eagle coins, which both were released in 1986.

Baker also served on Reagan&#x27;s National Security Council, and remained Treasury Secretary until 1988, during which time he also served as campaign chairman for George H. W. Bush&#x27;s successful presidential bid.

==Bush administration==
=== Secretary of State ===

President George H. W. Bush appointed Baker Secretary of State in 1989. Baker served in this role through 1992. From 1992 to 1993, he served as Bush&#x27;s White House chief of staff, the same position that he had held from 1981 to 1985 during the first Reagan administration.
In May 1990, Soviet Union&#x27;s reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited the U.S. for talks with President Bush; there, he agreed to allow a reunified Germany to be a part of NATO. He later revealed that he had agreed to do so because James Baker promised that NATO troops would not be posted to eastern Germany and that the military alliance would not expand into Eastern Europe. On February 9, 1990, Baker, as the US Secretary of State, assured Gorbachev: &quot;If we maintain a presence in a Germany that is a part of NATO, there would be no extension of NATO’s jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east&quot;.
 But Bush ignored his assurances and later pushed for NATO&#x27;s eastwards expansion. In the Bush administration, Baker was a proponent of the notion that the USSR should be kept territorially intact, arguing that it would be destabilizing to have the USSR&#x27;s nuclear arsenal in multiple new states. Bush and US defence secretary Dick Cheney were proponents for Soviet dissolution. 
Soviet states forced action by holding referendums on independence. 
In 1991, the USSR dissoluted.

When Ukraine became independent, Baker sought to ensure that Ukraine would give up its nuclear weapons. On 5 December 1994, the Budapest Memorandum was signed.

On January 9, 1991, during the Geneva Peace Conference with Tariq Aziz in Geneva, Baker declared that &quot;If there is any user of (chemical or biological weapons), our objectives won&#x27;t just be the liberation of Kuwait, but the elimination of the current Iraqi regime...&quot; Baker later acknowledged that the intent of this statement was to threaten a retaliatory nuclear strike on Iraq, and the Iraqis received his message.
Baker helped to construct the 34-nation alliance (Coalition of the willing) that fought alongside the United States in the Gulf War.

Baker also spent considerable time negotiating one-on-one with the parties in order to organize the Madrid Conference of October 30 – November 1, 1991, in an attempt to revive the Israeli–Palestinian peace process through negotiations involving Israel and the Palestinians, as well as Arab countries, including Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.

Baker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991.

==== Policies on the Israeli-Arab conflict ====

Before the US presidential election on November 8, 1988, he and a team of some Middle Eastern policies experts created a report detailing the Palestine-Israel interactions. His team included Dennis Ross and many others who were soon appointed to the new Bush administration.

Baker blocked the recognition of Palestine by threatening to cut funding to agencies in the United Nations. As far back as 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) issued a &quot;declaration of statehood&quot; and changed the name of its observer delegation to the United Nations from the PLO to Palestine.

Baker warned publicly, &quot;I will recommend to the President that the United States make no further contributions, voluntary or assessed, to any international organization which makes any changes in the PLO&#x27;s status as an observer organization.&quot;

In May 1989, he gave a speech at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He called for Israel to &quot;lay aside once and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel&quot;, cease the construction of Israeli settlements in West Bank and Gaza, forswear annexation of more territory, and to treat Palestinians &quot;as neighbors who deserve political rights&quot;. Israeli officials and public were highly offended due to the tone of his speech, though his address called for little more than his predecessors.

Baker soon decided that Aaron David Miller and Daniel Kurtzer would be his principal aides in Middle Eastern policies. All three have been reported as leaning toward the policies of the Israeli Labor Party.

Baker was notable for making little and slow efforts towards improving the state of Israeli-Palestinian relations. When Bush was elected, he only received 29% of Jewish voters&#x27; support, and his reelection was thought to be imminent, so there was little pressure on the administration to make bold moves in diplomatic relations with Israel. Israeli leaders initially thought that Baker had a poor grasp of Middle Eastern issues – a perception exacerbated by his use of the term &quot;Greater Israel&quot; – and viewed Israel as a &quot;problem for the United States&quot; according to Moshe Arens. Baker proved willing to confront Israeli officials on statements they made contrary to American interests. After Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the United States of &quot;building its policy on a foundation of distortion and lies,&quot; Baker banned Netanyahu from entering the State Department building, and refused to meet with him personally for the remainder of his tenure as secretary.

During his first eight months under the Bush administration, there were five meetings with the PLO. All serious issues that Palestine sought to discuss, such as elections and representation in the Israeli government, were delegated to Egypt for decisions to be made.

More tensions rose in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. Amidst the growing support of Saddam Hussein in Palestinian communities, due to his opposition toward Israel, and his invasion of Kuwait, and the beginning of the Gulf War, Baker decided that he would make some moves towards developing communications between Israel and Palestinians.

Baker became the first American statesman to negotiate directly and officially with Palestinians in the Madrid Conference of 1991, which was the first comprehensive peace conference that involved every party involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict and the conference was designed to address all outstanding issues.

After this landmark event, he did not work to further improve Arab-Israeli relations. The administration forced Israel to halt the development of the 6,000 planned housing units, but the 11,000 housing units already under construction were permitted to be completed and inhabited with no penalty. In the meantime, Baker also tried to negotiate with the Syrian president Hafez al-Assad, in order to achieve a lasting peace between Israel and Syria.

However, Baker has been criticized for spending much of his tenure in a state of inaction regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which arguably led to further infringements on Palestinian rights and the growing radicalism of Arabs and Israelis.

=== White House Chief of Staff (1992–1993) ===
The 1992 election was complicated by the on-again-off-again candidacy of Ross Perot, who would end up taking 19% of the popular vote. In August, following the Democratic Convention, with Bush trailing Clinton in the polls by 24 points, Bush announced that Baker would return to the White House as chief of staff and as head of the re-election campaign. However, despite having run two winning campaigns for Ronald Reagan and one for Bush, Baker was unsuccessful in the second campaign for Bush, who lost to Clinton by 370 electoral votes to 168.

==Post-cabinet career==

===1993–2000===
In 1993, Baker became the honorary chair of the James A. Baker III Institute of Public Policy at Rice University in Houston, Texas.

Also in 1993, the Enron Corporation hired Baker as a consultant within a month of his departure from the White House, and Enron said that Baker would have an opportunity to invest in any projects he developed. During his time at Enron, Baker tried to warn against the company&#x27;s involvement with the Dabhol Power Station in India. Many of Baker&#x27;s concerns proved correct, and the project became a key factor in the company&#x27;s downfall.

Also in 1993, Baker joined Baker Botts as a senior partner, as well as the Carlyle Group (with the title of senior counsel).

In 1995, Baker published his memoirs of service as Secretary of State in a book entitled &quot;The Politics of Diplomacy: Revolution, War and Peace, 1989–1992&quot; ().

In March 1997, Baker became the Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Western Sahara. In June 2004, he resigned from this position, frustrated over the lack of progress in reaching a complete settlement acceptable to both the government of Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front. He left behind the Baker II plan, accepted as a suitable basis of negotiations by the Polisario and unanimously endorsed by the Security Council, but rejected by Morocco.

In addition to the numerous recognitions received by Baker, he was presented with the prestigious Woodrow Wilson Award for public service on September 13, 2000, in Washington, D.C.

=== 2000 presidential election and recount ===
In 2000, Baker served as chief legal adviser for George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential election campaign and oversaw the Florida recount. The 2008 film &quot;Recount&quot; covers the days following the controversial election. Baker was interviewed during the making of the film, and British actor Tom Wilkinson portrayed him in it.

=== Roles during the Bush administration and Iraq War ===
Baker also advised George W. Bush on Iraq. When the U.S. occupation of Iraq began in 2003 he was one of the Bush administration&#x27;s first choices to direct the Coalition Provisional Authority, but he was deemed too old. In December 2003, President George W. Bush appointed Baker as his special envoy to ask various foreign creditor nations to forgive or restructure $100 billion in international debts owed by the Iraq government which had been incurred during the tenure of Saddam Hussein.

&quot;State of Denial&quot;, a book by investigative reporter Bob Woodward, says that White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card urged President Bush to replace Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld with Baker following the 2004 presidential election. Bush later confirmed that he made such an offer to Baker but that he declined. Bush would appoint another G. H. W. Bush administration veteran, Robert Gates, instead, after the 2006 midterm elections. Baker was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008.

On March 15, 2006, Congress announced the formation of the Iraq Study Group, a high-level panel of prominent former officials charged by members of Congress with taking a fresh look at America&#x27;s policy on Iraq. Baker was the Republican co-chairman along with Democratic Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, to advise Congress on Iraq. The Iraq Study Group examined a number of ideas, including one that would create a new power-sharing arrangement in Iraq that would give more autonomy to regional factions. On October 9, 2006, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; quoted co-chairman Baker as saying &quot;our commission believes that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives, the ones that are out there in the political debate, of &#x27;stay the course&#x27; and &#x27;cut and run&#x27;&quot;.

=== Donald Trump ===
Baker voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election and did so again in the 2020 election. During a 2016 memorial service for Nancy Reagan, he commented to former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney that he believed there were parallels between the rise of Trump and the rise of Reagan. He later gave informal advice to Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign and suggested the appointment of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.

Baker told his biographers that his preference for Trump was firm, basing it on his commitment to the Republican party and his feeling that, as they paraphrased, &quot;it was worth it to get conservative judges, tax cuts, and deregulation.&quot; Despite his consistent intentions, he did briefly question his approach in 2019, after considering the Democratic primary candidate Joe Biden to be a possible choice. He denied his wavering, telling his biographers: &quot;Don&#x27;t say I will vote for Joe Biden,&quot; because he didn&#x27;t want to abandon or hurt the Republican party. After the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, Baker told his biographers, during a forum at the Hamilton Lugar School at Indiana University, that he did not &quot;buy into&quot; Trump&#x27;s attacks on the results, despite his own past litigating the 2000 election on behalf of George W. Bush. 

===Other advisory positions===

Baker serves on the Honorary Council of Advisers for the U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce. The Atlantic Council also lists Baker, along with other former executive branch appointees, among its Honorary Directors.

Baker serves as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

Baker is a leader of the Climate Leadership Council, along with Henry Paulson and George P. Shultz. In 2017, this group of &quot;Republican elder statesmen&quot; proposed that conservatives embrace a fee and dividend form of carbon tax (in which all revenue generated by the tax is rebated to the populace in the form of lump-sum dividends), as a policy to deal with anthropogenic climate change. The group also included Martin S. Feldstein and N. Gregory Mankiw.

Baker began service on the Rice University board of trustees in 1993.

==Personal life==
Baker met his first wife, the former Mary Stuart McHenry, of Dayton, Ohio, while on spring break in Bermuda with the Princeton University rugby team. They married in 1953. Together they had four sons, including James Addison Baker IV (1954), a partner at Baker Botts as well as Stuart McHenry Baker (1956), John Coalter Baker (1960), and Douglas Bland Baker (1961) of Baker Global Advisory. 

Mary Stuart Baker died of breast cancer on February 18, 1970.

Though he goes by James A. Baker III, Baker is technically the fourth such name in his family line. Baker&#x27;s grandfather removed his own &quot;Jr.&quot; sometime in the 1870s before the birth of Baker&#x27;s father. His firstborn son retained the ordering as James A. Baker IV.

In 1973, Baker and Susan Garrett Winston, a divorcée and a close friend of Mary Stuart, were married. Winston had two sons and a daughter with her former husband. In September of 1977, she and Baker had a daughter, Mary Bonner Baker.

Raised as a Presbyterian, Baker became an Episcopalian after his marriage to Susan and attends St. Martin&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Houston. In 2012, he collaborated with the Andrew Doyle, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas, to negotiate a compromise on the issue of same-sex marriage within the diocese.

On June 15, 2002, Virginia Graeme Baker, the seven-year-old granddaughter of Baker, daughter of Nancy and James Baker IV, drowned due to suction entrapment in a spa. To promote greater safety in pools and spas, Nancy Baker gave testimony to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and James Baker helped form an advocacy group, which led to the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool And Spa Safety Act (15 USC 8001). Another granddaughter, Rosebud Baker, is a stand-up comedian.
