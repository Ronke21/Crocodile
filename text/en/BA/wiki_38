<text>The English language has incorporated various loanwords, terms, phrases, or quotations from the German language. A loanword is a word borrowed from a donor language and incorporated into a recipient language without translation. It is distinguished from a calque, or loan translation, where a meaning or idiom from another language is translated into existing words or roots of the host language. Some of the expressions are relatively common (e.g., &quot;hamburger&quot;), but most are comparatively rare. In many cases, the loanword has assumed a meaning substantially different from its German forebear.

English and German both are West Germanic languages, though their relationship has been obscured by the lexical influence of Old Norse and Norman French (as a consequence of the Norman conquest of England in 1066) on English as well as the High German consonant shift. In recent years, however, many English words have been borrowed directly from German. Typically, English spellings of German loanwords suppress any umlauts (the superscript, double-dot diacritic in &quot;Ä&quot;, &quot;Ö&quot;, &quot;Ü&quot;, &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, and &quot;ü&quot;) of the original word or replace the umlaut letters with &quot;Ae&quot;, &quot;Oe&quot;, &quot;Ue&quot;, &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;oe&quot;, &quot;ue&quot;, respectively (as is done commonly in German speaking countries when the umlaut is not available; the origin of the umlaut was a superscript E).

German words have been incorporated into English usage for many reasons:
*German cultural artifacts, especially foods, have spread to English-speaking nations and often are identified either by their original German names or by German-sounding English names.
*Developments and discoveries in German-speaking nations in science, scholarship, and classical music have led to German words for new concepts, which have been adopted into English: for example the words &quot;doppelgänger&quot; and &quot;angst&quot; in psychology.
*Discussion of German history and culture requires some German words.
*Some German words are used in English narrative to identify that the subject expressed is in German, e.g., &quot;Frau&quot;, &quot;Reich&quot;.

As languages, English and German descend from the common ancestor language West Germanic and further back to Proto-Germanic; because of this, some English words are essentially identical to their German lexical counterparts, either in spelling (&quot;Hand&quot;, &quot;Sand&quot;, &quot;Finger&quot;) or pronunciation (&quot;fish&quot; = &quot;Fisch&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot; = &quot;Maus&quot;), or both (&quot;Arm&quot;, &quot;Ring&quot;); these are excluded from this list.

German common nouns fully adopted into English are in general not initially capitalized, and the German letter &quot;ß&quot; is generally changed to &quot;ss&quot;.

== German terms commonly used in English ==
Most of these words will be recognized by many English speakers; they are commonly used in English contexts. Some, such as &quot;wurst&quot; and &quot;pumpernickel&quot;, retain German connotations, while others, such as &quot;lager&quot; and &quot;hamburger&quot;, retain none. Not every word is recognizable outside its relevant context. A number of these expressions are used in American English, under the influence of German immigration, but not in British English.

== German terms mostly used for literary effect ==
There are a few terms which are recognised by many English speakers but are usually only used to deliberately evoke a German context:

* Autobahn – particularly common in British English and American English referring specifically to German motorways.
* – lit. &quot;attention&quot;
* and Fräulein – woman and young woman or girl, respectively, in English. Indicating marital state, with Frau – Mrs. and &quot;Fräulein&quot; – Miss; in Germany, however, the diminutive &quot;Fräulein&quot; lapsed from common usage in the late 1960s. Regardless of marital status, a woman is now commonly referred to as &quot;Frau&quot;, because from 1972 the term &quot;Fräulein&quot; has been officially phased out for being politically incorrect and should only be used if expressly authorized by the woman concerned.
* Führer (umlaut is usually dropped in English) – always used in English to denote Hitler or to connote a fascistic leader – never used, as is possible in German, simply and unironically to denote a (non-fascist) leader or guide (e.g. Bergführer: mountain guide, Stadtführer: city guide [book], Führerschein: driving licence, Geschäftsführer: managing director, Flugzeugführer: Pilot in command)
* Gott mit uns – meaning &quot;God be with us&quot;, the motto of the Prussian king was used as a morale slogan amongst soldiers in both World Wars. It was bastardized as &quot;Got mittens&quot; by American and British soldiers, and is usually used nowadays, because of the German defeat in both wars, derisively to mean that wars are not won on religious grounds.
* – &quot;hands up&quot;
* – in modern German either the equivalent of Mr. (Mister), to address an adult man, or &quot;master&quot; over something or someone (e.g. &quot;Sein eigener Herr sein&quot;: to be his own master). Derived from the adjective &quot;hehr&quot;, meaning &quot;honourable&quot; or &quot;senior&quot;, it was historically a nobleman&#x27;s title, equivalent to &quot;Lord&quot;. (&quot;Herr der Fliegen&quot; is the German title of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.) In a religious context it refers to God.
* Ich bin ein Berliner – famous quotation by John F. Kennedy
* Leitmotif (German spelling: &quot;Leitmotiv&quot;) – any sort of recurring theme, whether in music, literature, or the life of a fictional character or a real person.
* Meister – used as a suffix to mean expert (&quot;Maurermeister&quot;) or master; in Germany it means also champion in sports (&quot;Weltmeister&quot;, &quot;Europameister&quot;, &quot;Landesmeister&quot;)
* – no
* – meaning &quot;Out!&quot; – shortened (colloquial) (depending on where the speaker is, if on the inside &quot;get out!&quot; = &quot;hinaus&quot;, if on the outside &quot;come out!&quot; = &quot;heraus&quot;). It is the imperative form of the German verb &quot;hinausgehen&quot; (getting out (of a room/house/etc.)) as in the imperative &quot;gehen Sie raus&quot;!).
* Reich – from the Middle High German &quot;rich&quot;, as a noun it means &quot;empire&quot; or &quot;realm&quot;, cf. the English word &quot;bishopric&quot;. In titles as part of a compound noun, for example &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot;, it is equivalent to the English word &quot;national&quot; or possibly &quot;federal&quot; (the words &quot;Reich&quot; and &quot;Bund&quot; are somewhat exchangeable in recent history, with the exception of the Nazi state which continued to call itself Reich despite abolishing states). For instance &quot;Reichsbahn&quot; ([German] National/Federal Railway), or &quot;Reichspost&quot; (National/Federal Postal Service), specifically indicating in either case that the respective institutions were organised by central authority (called the German Reich at the time), not the states. To some English – and German – speakers, &quot;Reich&quot; in English strongly connotes Nazism and is sometimes used to suggest fascism or authoritarianism, e.g. &quot;Herr Reichsminister&quot; used as a title for a disliked politician.
* Ja – yes
* – a German term that connotes an emphatic &quot;yes&quot; – &quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; in English. It is often equated to &quot;yes, sir&quot; in Anglo-American military films, since it is also a term typically used as an acknowledgement for military commands in the German military.
* Schnell! – &quot;Quick!&quot; or &quot;Quickly!&quot;
* Kommandant – commander (in the sense of &quot;person in command&quot; or commanding officer, regardless of military rank), used often in the military in general (&quot;Standortkommandant&quot;: base commander), on battleships and U-boats (&quot;Schiffskommandant&quot; or &quot;U-Boot-Kommandant&quot;), sometimes used on civilian ships and aircraft.
* Wunderbar – wonderful

==Terms rarely used in English==

* Ampelmännchen
* Besserwisser – someone who always &quot;knows better&quot;
* Bockmist, lit. &quot;billy goat&#x27;s dung&quot;, meaning &quot;nonsense&quot; or &quot;rubbish&quot;
* – literally &quot;egg-laying wool-milk-sow&quot;, a hypothetical solution, object or person fulfilling unrealistically many different demands; also referring sometimes to a (really existing) object, concept or person like this, for example a multi-tool or exceptionally versatile person (jack of all trades)
* Fahrvergnügen – &quot;driving pleasure&quot;; introduced in a Volkswagen advertising campaign
* , &quot;vicarious shame&quot;, the shame felt for the behavior of someone else

* – &quot;ghost driver&quot;, a wrong-way driver; one who drives in the direction opposite to that prescribed for the given lane.

* – smut, dirt, filth
* – &quot;above all&quot;, originally from &quot;Deutschland über alles&quot;, the first line of Hoffmann von Fallersleben&#x27;s poem &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot; (The Song of the Germans); see also Über alles (disambiguation).

<doc id="217289" wikidata="Q1430192" url="?curid=217289" title="Undergraduate education">
<text>Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and before postgraduate education, usually in a college or university. It typically includes all postsecondary programs up to the level of a bachelor&#x27;s degree. For example, in the United States, a student pursuing an associate or bachelor&#x27;s degree is known as an undergraduate student while a student who has already obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree and is pursuing a higher degree (masters, doctorate) is a &quot;graduate student&quot;. Upon completion of courses and other requirements of an undergraduate program, the student would earn the corresponding degree. In some other educational systems, undergraduate education is postsecondary education up to and including the level of a master&#x27;s degree; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.

==By country==
===Africa===
====Nigeria====
In Nigeria, undergraduate degrees (excluding Medicine, Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Engineering, Law and Architecture) are four-year-based courses. Medicine (MBBS) and Architecture normally take six years to complete studies while Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Law and Engineering courses take five years to complete studies, usually, all six years are taken to improve their chances. Undergraduate nursing degrees or diplomas usually take two to four years and sometimes 5 years to complete, whereas graduate degrees are an additional two years or more.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, the undergraduate system usually has a three-year undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degree, with two or three majors. (There are exceptions, such as the medical qualification (MBChB), which is six years, and Engineering which is four.) A fourth year, known as an Honours year, is considered a post-graduate degree. It is usually course-driven, although may include a project or thesis.

===Americas===
====Brazil====
Brazil follows the major traits of the continental European system; free public schools are available from kindergarten up to postgraduation, both as a right established in Article 6, &quot;caput&quot; of the Brazilian Constitution and as a duty of the State in Article 208, Items I, IV and V, of the Brazilian Constitution. Students choose their specific course of studies before joining the university. Admission to university is obtained by means of a competitive entrance exam known as Vestibular (a concept somewhat similar to the &quot;Baccalauréat&quot; in France). A later system introduced in 2009, adopted by most federal universities, uses the high school national examination (ENEM) result as part or a replacement of the Vestibular grade. Depending on the chosen course, upon graduating the student is granted: a technologist diploma, three years to complete, a bachelor&#x27;s degree&#x27;s diploma, which usually takes four or, in the case of Law, Veterinary, Geology and Engineering, five years to complete; or a professional diploma, which normally require five or, in the case of medicine, six years to complete.

====United States====
In the United States, undergraduate education refers to a student who is studying for a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The most common bachelor&#x27;s degrees are Bachelor of Arts (BA/AB) and Bachelor of Science (BS/SB), but other degrees such as Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Music (BM), Bachelor of Social Work (BSW), Bachelor of Engineering/Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BEng/BSE), Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), Bachelor of Business Administration/Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BBA/BSBA), Bachelor of Education (Ed.B), Bachelor of Liberal Arts (BLA/ALB), and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) are also possible. Most commonly these degrees require four years of full-time study after high school. An additional accolade to the bachelor&#x27;s degree is the Honours degree.

Unlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and instead are completed at a graduate level, after earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medical schools require a set of courses that must be taken before enrollment.

Students can also choose to attend a two-year community college before further study at a four-year college or university. In most states, community colleges are operated either by a division of the state university or by local special districts subject to guidance from a state agency. Community colleges award associate degrees of different types, some intended to prepare students to transfer to four-year institutions (e.g. Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)), and others intended to provide vocational skills and training for students wishing to enter into or advance in a profession. In some states considerable attention has been given to make sure that community college courses in fact prepare the students for the continuation courses they will encounter at the local college; this process of bringing courses into sequence is called articulation. Some community colleges have automatic enrollment agreements with a local college or university, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the university provides the remaining years of study, sometimes all on one campus. The community colleges award associate degrees, while universities and colleges award the bachelor&#x27;s. However, some community colleges, such as Brazosport College in Lake Jackson, Texas offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees along with associate degrees. Conversely, some universities such as the University of Delaware also award associate degrees.

In the United States, &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot; are terms used differently in different states; New York&#x27;s terminology is especially confusing (see University of the State of New York). A university is usually larger than a college, and has programs at the graduate level, but the distinction is not clear-cut. Some colleges (like Smith College) award graduate degrees, for example, and some colleges are larger than some universities. Some states have requirements a college must meet before it is allowed to call itself a university. Institutions seeking to grow have pursued various steps to turn two-year junior colleges into community colleges, community colleges into four-year colleges, awarding baccalaureate degrees, sometimes while still a community college, and colleges into universities, with graduate (post-baccalaureate) programs.

===Asia===
====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh, three-year undergraduate programs are known as Degree (Pass) courses and four-year undergraduate programs are known as Honours courses.

====Hong Kong====

In Hong Kong, the English system is followed. Students sit for the Certificate of Education examinations at around sixteen years of age, and the Advanced-level, or A-level examinations at around eighteen, then follow by three years of undergraduate education, except for a few specific fields, such as medicine, nursing and law. This is due to be changed, with five-year secondary education and two-year matriculation examination combined and shortened to six years matriculation, and undergraduate education lengthened to four years. Students may be able to receive general education in their first years in universities, more akin to the North American system. The first batch of students under the new system will enter universities in 2012.

Alternatives are undergraduate certificates or diplomas, with some equivalent to associate degree in educational level.

====India====

India&#x27;s higher education system is the third largest in the world, next to the United States and China. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission, which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the centre and the state. Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 15 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

In India, the graduation system is classified into two parts: Undergraduate (UG) and Postgraduate (PG). It takes three or four years to complete an undergraduate degree. The three-year undergraduate programs are mostly in the fields of arts, commerce, science etc., and the four-year programs are mostly in the fields of technology, engineering, pharmaceutical sciences, agriculture etc. However, for medicine, law and architecture, the period has been five years. The possessor of the first UG is referred to as graduate and that of the PG degree as post-graduate. Other than UG and PG there are various 1 to 2 year diploma courses available.

Indian higher education system has expanded at a fast pace by adding nearly 20,000 colleges and more than 8 million students in a decade from 2000–01 to 2010–11. As of 2020, India has over 1000 universities, with a break up of 54 central universities, 416 state universities, 125 deemed universities, 361 private universities, 7 Institute under State Legislature Act, and 159 Institutes of National Importance which include IIMs, AIIMS, IITs, IIITs, IISERs and NITs among others. Other institutions include 52,627 colleges as government degree colleges, private colleges, standalone institutes and post-graduate research institutions, functioning under these universities as reported by the MHRD in 2020. Colleges may be Autonomous, i.e. empowered to examine their own degrees, up to PhD level in some cases, or non-autonomous, in which case their examinations are under the supervision of the university to which they are affiliated; in either case, however, degrees are awarded in the name of the university rather than the college.

==== Japan ====
Undergraduate education in Japan requires four years, which is divided into two stages; associate degree&#x27;s level first-half two years and bachelor&#x27;s level second-half two years.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees are awarded only by universities and NIAD-QE.

==== Pakistan ====
In Pakistan, it generally requires four years to complete a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Arts, Sciences, Dentistry, Engineering or Business Administration such as BA, BS, BDS, BE/BS/BSc Engineering or BBA and five years for bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine (MBBS), Physiotherapy (DPT), Pharmacy (Pharm.D) and Architecture (B.Arch.) after successfully completing 12 years of schooling. 4 years bachelor&#x27;s degree is offered in various universities of Pakistan such as COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT), University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore (UET Lahore), University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila (UET Taxila), National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NU).

The modern educational system comprises the following five stages: The Primary school lasting five years for children 5–10 years old in grades one to five; a Middle school of three years for children 10 to 13 years old, covering grades six through eight; a two-year secondary, or Matriculation consists of grades nine and ten, for children 13 to 15 years old; a two-year higher secondary, or Intermediate college, leading to an F.A. in arts or F.Sc. in science; and a fifth stage covering college and university programs leading to baccalaureate, professional, master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees. The pre-primary or preparatory classes, called kachi (literally, unripe) or Nursery school, were formally integrated into the education system in 1988.

===Europe===
====England, Northern Ireland, and Wales====

Students in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland may usually enter university from the age of eighteen, often having studied A-levels and thus having had thirteen to fifteen years of schooling. Occasionally students who finish A Level or equivalent qualifications early (after skipping a year in school on the grounds of academic giftedness) may enter below this age but large universities are now setting minimum age limits of 16 or 17 after a number of well publicised &quot;child prodigies&quot; were found to be emotionally and mentally unprepared for university life.

Applications for undergraduate courses in UK higher education are made through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).

For their first degree, most students read for the degree of bachelor, which usually takes three years; however, in the sciences and engineering, integrated courses covering both undergraduate level and advanced degree level leading to the degree of master, usually taking four years and including a research project or dissertation, are popular. Given the integrated nature of these programs someone who gains a master&#x27;s degree via an integrated program is not usually admitted to the degree of bachelor.

Master&#x27;s degrees conferred after extended programs are not to be conflated with the degree of Master of Arts conferred at Oxbridge and Dublin, which is not a substantive qualification, but reflects the ancient practice of those three universities of promoting Bachelors of Arts to Masters of Arts (and thus full membership of the university) six or seven years after matriculation.

Honours degrees and integrated master&#x27;s degrees are awarded with 1st, upper 2nd, lower 2nd or 3rd class honours. If a student passes the course but fails to do so sufficiently well for third class honours to be awarded he will be awarded with an ordinary degree. It is possible to use the abbreviation &quot;Hons&quot; after the degree postnominals to indicate that the degree has been passed with honours and is not an ordinary degree.

Many universities offer sandwich courses or an extramural year, which offer work placements for a short period of time in a relevant industry before students complete their studies. Taking a sandwich course may make the course last a year longer than it would otherwise.

With very few exceptions, nearly all universities with the power to award degrees are heavily state financed. However, they also rely on tuition fees set by the government at a maximum index-linked level, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds. UK students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance with repayment contingent on income. Unlike in other European countries, the British government does not own the universities&#x27; assets and university staff are not civil servants. United Kingdom universities are therefore better described as autonomous, intellectually-independent institutions with public funding, rather than public universities per se. The crown does not control syllabi, with the exception of teacher training. The crown restricts the power to award degrees to those with a royal charter, in the case of traditional universities, or authorization from the Secretary of State for Universities, in the case of modern universities. Universities accredited in foreign countries, such as Richmond University are, however, free to operate.

====European Bologna systems====

In many countries, the English distinction between a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree is being introduced by the Bologna process. Under the new Bologna reform, universities in Europe are introducing the Bachelor level (BA or BS) degree, often by dividing a five-year Master-level program into two parts (three-year Bachelor&#x27;s + two-year Master&#x27;s), where students are not obligated to continue with the second Master&#x27;s-degree part. These new bachelor&#x27;s degrees are similar in structure to British bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

If there is a separate undergraduate degree, higher degrees (License, Master, Doctorat) can be gained after completing the undergraduate degree. In the traditional German system, there were no undergraduate degrees in some fields, such as engineering: students continued to Master&#x27;s level education without any administrative breakpoints, and employers would not consider half-finished master&#x27;s degrees.

The Bachelor&#x27;s phase in The Netherlands can be fulfilled either at university or at a university of applied sciences. These two institutions differ from each other in the level students learn abstract concepts. Education at universities is aimed at research and fundamental principles while at universities of applied sciences it concentrates on applying knowledge in a vocation. Universities of applied sciences typically do not offer master and PhD programs.

====Scotland ====
Students in Scotland usually enter university in the year they turn eighteen, with many starting at seventeen; courses take a year longer than in the rest of the UK.

At the older universities the degree of Master of Arts is conferred in the arts subjects after four years while the newer universities instead confer the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts conferred by the Ancient Scottish Universities is equivalent to the degree of Bachelor of Arts at other universities and does not require the level of study necessitated for the other degrees of master awarded by these universities. The degree instead reflects the ancient traditions of these universities.

In the sciences, students usually read for the degree of bachelor, which usually takes four years. However, as with the rest of the UK, integrated master&#x27;s degrees are popular in science and engineering, although in Scotland they last for five years. Degree classification is the same as in the rest of UK.

====Other European systems====
In many other, particularly continental European systems, an &quot;undergraduate&quot; degree in the American sense does not exist. Because students are expected to have received a sound general education at the secondary level, in a school such as a gymnasium or lycee, students in Europe enroll in a specific course of studies they wish to pursue upon entry into a university. In the US, students only specialize in a &quot;major&quot; during the last years of college. Specializing in a field of study upon entry into a university means most students graduate after four to five years of study. The fields available include those only taught as graduate degrees in the US, such as law or medicine.

In the traditional system of Germany, there is a vocational degree (diploma FH) that is similar in length, and is also considered an academic degree. Though it is designed as a specialist degree, in contrast to the Diplom degree at &quot;university&quot;, which claims to be more generalist. Germany itself, however, is currently abolishing the legal distinction between and university. They are both translated as university and they both provide bologna-compliant and equivalent postgraduate degrees.

Not obligatory and sometimes applied at universities in the Netherlands are the propaedeutic exams. The entire curriculum of the first two semesters of the bachelor&#x27;s programme is part of the propaedeutic exams. In most bachelor&#x27;s studies, students are required to obtain their propaedeutic certificate within three semesters after starting the course. A propaedeutic certificate also counts as a requirement for participating in a university level bachelor&#x27;s study. The propaedeutic exams have the purpose of assessing whether a student has the appropriate capacities in order to complete the course.

At some Swedish universities (such as the Royal Institute of Technology), PhD courses are sometimes referred to as &quot;graduate courses&quot;, whereas courses for other students (up to master level) sometimes are referred to as &quot;undergraduate courses&quot;. The system at many Finnish universities is similar.

In the French system, the first degree of tertiary education was reached two years after the baccalauréat. Amongst these degrees the university-delivered DEUG has disappeared, whereas Diplôme universitaire de technologie, Brevet de Technicien Supérieur or classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles still exist. According to the Bologna process, this two-year curriculum will be replaced by the three-year &quot;licence&quot;, yet existing.

<doc id="217291" wikidata="Q473719" url="?curid=217291" title="Dodgeball">
<text>Dodgeball is a team sport in which players on two opposing teams try to throw balls and hit opponents while avoiding being hit themselves. The objective of each team is to eliminate all members of the opposing team by hitting them with thrown balls, catching a ball thrown by an opponent, or inducing an opponent to commit a violation, such as stepping outside the court.

The sport is mostly played in schools under varying rules, and also formally as an international sport, under rules that vary among international governing bodies, such as the World Dodgeball Federation (WDBF), which runs the Dodgeball World Championship and the World Dodgeball Association (WDA). USA Dodgeball is the governing entity for dodgeball in the United States, with member leagues and clubs across the nation.

==Equipment==

There are many different ball types used around the world, including rubber, &quot;no-sting&quot; rubber, foam and cloth; versions made with rubber or polyvinyl chloride are termed utility balls. USA Dodgeball uses all ball types across multiple tournaments held by them and their member organizations. The World Dodgeball Federation (WDBF) used primarily foam for their first World Championships, but starting with 2022, both cloth and foam categories were introduced.

The WDBF specifies the use of six balls with six players per side for their World Championships. Various rule sets governing number of balls and players are used around the world depending on the court size, level of play, and the organization&#x27;s discretion.

The WDA specifies the use of five balls; certain national rule sets, such as in Austria, specify six. Amateur games typically use from three to ten balls, the number tailored to the size of the court and the number of players. More balls generally adds to the amount of action in a game, but can result in stalemate with many blocks. If there are too few balls, the element of stealth is removed, as players can see all the balls that might hit them.

==Court==

Dodgeball can be played on any surface that has clearly marked boundaries and a center line, such as a basketball or volleyball court or fenced area. Elite Dodgeball specifies a court by , where a zone wide at the junction of the areas is a neutral zone.

Games can also be played outdoors on a soccer pitch or football field. The WDBF organizes games on beaches and USA Dodgeball hosts tournaments at trampoline parks. WDBF specifies a court by with no neutral zone.

The attacking lines and center lines are of vital importance. A team can stand in its attacking area and throw the balls to opponents.

== Matchplay ==
=== Length of game ===
Informal matches of dodgeball are typically played until all players on one side are out. In WDBF guidelines, matches last a total of 40 minutes. These are split into two 20-minute halves, during which as many sets as possible are played. A set lasts until all players on one side are out. One point is awarded for every set won. Teams switch sides at halftime.

=== Starting the game ===
In informal dodgeball, balls are initially distributed to players by one of the following methods:

*By even distribution to the two teams.
*By being lined up on the central dividing line.

In this latter option, players then rush toward the center line to grab one of the balls. This is called the opening rush. It is never legal to immediately throw such a ball at an opponent; a player grabbing a ball on the center line retreats or throws it back to a teammate.

In WDBF regulations, the ball must be returned behind an &quot;attack line&quot;, roughly a third of the way from the back of court. Players may only run for the balls on the left side of the court, while the middle ball will be contested.

=== Gameplay ===
Following distribution, players aim to hit one another. A ball is considered &quot;live&quot; from the moment it leaves a player&#x27;s hand up until it touches the floor, wall, or ceiling, when it becomes &quot;dead&quot;. If a player is hit by an opponent&#x27;s live ball, they are &quot;out&quot;; if the ball is dead, there is no hit. If a player catches a live ball, the opponent who threw the ball is out and a player on the catcher&#x27;s team is &quot;revived&quot; from the outbox; however, if they fail to secure the catch, leading to them dropping the ball, the failed catcher is out.

In WDBF regulations, players may &quot;block&quot; a throw with another ball. In this situation, the thrown ball remains live, as it has not hit the floor or a wall, and so can be caught or can still hit a player out. If the blocker drops the ball used to block, they have failed to keep their ball secure and are out.

Dead balls that leave the court can only be returned to players by each team&#x27;s designated ball retrievers. Stepping outside the court, including stepping on a boundary line or entering the opponents&#x27; zone, is a violation. Other violations include kicking a ball, displaying bad sportsmanship, and stalling (having a ball for over ten seconds and doing nothing with it). The penalty is that the violator is out.

===Optional rules===

Optional rules may be in effect in informal games of dodgeball or in open matches by agreement:

# &quot;Head shots&quot; (thrown balls that hit an opposing player in the head) may either result in the thrower being out, or the person being hit being out, or neither.
# In &quot;jailball&quot;, players who are out go to &quot;jail&quot; behind the opponents&#x27; back line. They can return to the game if they:
#* Capture a dead ball, or
#* Capture a dead ball and throw it and hit an opponent.
# In games played on a basketball court, thrown balls that hit the backboard or go into the goal (even if deflected by a player or another ball) may have special status, such as returning all eliminated teammates to the court.
# When there are so few players on the court that dodging the ball is easy, &quot;No Lines&quot; may be declared. This means that there are no team zones; players can go anywhere on the court to get a better shot at an opponent.
# Rules may also vary regarding what happens when a ball is caught. In some variations, the thrower is out but no teammate of the catcher is revived, and in others, the thrower is not even out.

==Tactics==
The following basic tactics are useful:

* Thrower location: Move toward the neutral zone to attack; stay on the back line when not attacking. Do not stand in another player&#x27;s line of sight. Do not turn your back to the opponents.
* Coordinated attack: Call out to teammates to coordinate multiple attacks on the same opponent, preferably from very different angles. Number the opponents, left-to-right, and call out an attack target by number.
* Throwing technique: Throw with one hand. Aim below the waist to avoid getting caught or making a head shot. Throw when the opponent is distracted. Learn to throw balls so that they curve.

Many local teams and international teams develop their own tactics and calling systems specific to their style of play. These become more complex in higher leagues, which often requires specific training for the players in calling positions such that they can make rapid, tactical decisions.

==Competitions==
The main dodgeball competition is the Dodgeball World Championship, held by the World Dodgeball Federation (WDBF). The competition takes place annually since 2012. It was initially an open event, but stopped being an open event as the membership grew, and now works by qualification. In 2021, WDBF&#x27;s membership reached 80 members, all also members of the relevant continental federations.

== Variations ==
=== Circle dodgeball ===
In some elementary schools in the United States, a version is played using a circular court. The team outside the circle has the ball or balls, and the team inside must evade the thrown balls. The players who are hit with the ball may change places with the person who hit them, or they may be out of the game and the last person remaining unhit may be the winner. There are variants.

=== Similar games in other countries ===
* A game similar to dodgeball was reportedly played by Mongol warriors after the Battle of Mohi in 1241, using the severed heads of defeated Hungarians.
* In Sweden, there is a version called &quot;killerboll&quot; (&quot;killer ball&quot;) where the player who has the ball is limited to three steps before throwing. Whoever is hit by the ball may return to the game if the player who knocked them out is hit.
* In Iran, this game has long been one of the common cultural theses called “vassati” (وسطی). People of every age group are familiar with the game and especially they play it when going on a picnic. A player from the middle team who is hit by the ball is out of the game and the game continues in each set until all the players in the middle team get out of the field, although the player who is out can return to the game when their teammates catch the ball.
* On the Indian subcontinent, a variation of the game is played called &quot;Sekan-tadi&quot; (सेकन-तड़ी). This is slang used for &quot;slamming the hip.&quot; Other names are எறி பந்து, Gend Tadi and Maram Pitti. 
* In China, a variation of the game is played called &quot;Diu Sha Bao&quot; (丢沙包). Instead of a ball, the game is played with a small round sand bag, which is also known as the &quot;Sha Bao&quot; (沙包).
* In Belgium and The Netherlands, a variation is known as “Tussen Twee Vuren” (“Between Two Fires”), which is commonly played in schools. It is also called &quot;trefbal&quot; (hit ball).
* In Poland, a variation is known as &quot;Dwa Ognie&quot; (&quot;Two Fires&quot;), which used to be common in schools.
* In Afrikaans South African schools, a variation named &quot;brandbal&quot; (burning ball) is played with a tennis ball inside a designated area such as a rugby field or tennis court. The objective is for the person in possession of the ball to hit any other player with the ball, in which case the person last hit becomes the next one chasing and hitting the others. A secondary objective is to hit players by throwing as hard as possible, leading to the &quot;burning&quot; sensation.
* In Brazil, dodgeball is known as &quot;queimado&quot; and usually features rules similar to jailball, including players that go out to &quot;jail&quot; behind the opponents&#x27; back line. It can be played with a single ball as well.
* In Estonia the game is called &quot;rahvastepall&quot;—&quot;the nationsball&quot;. It is played with one ball.

==Criticism==
The notion that gameplay resembles assault or is too aggressive has led to lawsuits and calls to eliminate the game from school physical education programs.

==World records==
* University of California, Irvine, reclaimed the record for largest game of dodgeball on September 25, 2012, with 6,084 participants. The previous largest game of dodgeball had been played by 4,979 participants at the University of Alberta on February 3, 2012.
* The longest recorded game of dodgeball was played on April 27–29, 2012, at the Castleton State College in Vermont; it lasted for 41 h 3 min 17 s.

<doc id="217293" wikidata="Q554683" url="?curid=217293" title="Arctinus of Miletus">
<text>Arctinus of [[Miletus]] or Arctinus Milesius () was a Greek epic poet whose reputation is purely legendary, as none of his works survive. Traditionally dated between 775 BC and 741 BC, he was said to have been a pupil of Homer. His father was Teleus son of Nauteus.
Phaenias of Eresus placed him in the 7th century BC and claimed that he was defeated by Lesches of Pyrrha in competition. One of the &quot;cyclic poets&quot;, Arctinus composed the epics &quot;Aethiopis&quot; and &quot;Sack of Troy&quot;, which were contributions to the Trojan War cycle, and possibly &quot;Naupactia&quot;.

These poems are lost, but an idea of the first two can be obtained from the &quot;Chrestomathy&quot; ascribed (probably wrongly) to Proclus the Neo-Platonist of the 5th century AD.

The &quot;Aethiopis&quot; (Αἰθιοπίς), in five books, is so called from the Aethiopian Memnon, who became the ally of the Trojans after the death of Hector. According to Proclus, the poem took up the narrative from the close of the &quot;Iliad&quot;:

:&quot;The Amazon Penthesilea arrives to aid the Trojans in war. She is the daughter of Ares and a Thracian by birth. Achilles kills her while she is fighting at her best, and the Trojans bury her. Achilles kills Thersites, who railed at him and reproached him for loving Penthesileia.”

The &quot;Aethiopis&quot; concluded with the death and burial of Achilles and the dispute between Ajax and Odysseus for his arms.

&quot;The Sack of Troy&quot; (&quot;Iliou Persis&quot;) told the stories of the Trojan Horse, Sinon, and Laocoön, the capture of the city, and the departure of the Greeks pursued by the anger of Athena at the rape of Cassandra by Ajax the Lesser. The &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, usually ascribed to Lesches, bridged the gap in the story-line between &quot;Aethiopis&quot; and the &quot;Sack of Troy&quot;.

<text>A shadow is a dark area on a surface where light from a light source is blocked by an object. In contrast, shade occupies the three-dimensional volume behind an object with light in front of it. The cross section of a shadow is a two-dimensional silhouette, or a reverse projection of the object blocking the light.

== Point and non-point light sources ==

A point source of light casts only a simple shadow, called an &quot;umbra&quot;. For a non-point or &quot;extended&quot; source of light, the shadow is divided into the umbra, penumbra, and antumbra. The wider the light source, the more blurred the shadow becomes. If two penumbras overlap, the shadows appear to attract and merge. This is known as the shadow blister effect.

The outlines of the shadow zones can be found by tracing the rays of light emitted by the outermost regions of the extended light source. The umbra region does not receive any direct light from any part of the light source and is the darkest. A viewer located in the umbra region cannot directly see any part of the light source.

By contrast, the penumbra is illuminated by some parts of the light source, giving it an intermediate level of light intensity. A viewer located in the penumbra region will see the light source, but it is partially blocked by the object casting the shadow.

If there is more than one light source, there will be several shadows, with the overlapping parts darker, and various combinations of brightnesses or even colors. The more diffuse the lighting is, the softer and more indistinct the shadow outlines become until they disappear. The lighting of an overcast sky produces few visible shadows.

The absence of diffusing atmospheric effects in the vacuum of outer space produces shadows that are stark and sharply delineated by high-contrast boundaries between light and dark.

For a person or object touching the surface where the shadow is projected (e.g. a person standing on the ground, or a pole in the ground) the shadows converge at the point of contact.

A shadow shows, apart from distortion, the same image as the silhouette when looking at the object from the sun-side, hence the mirror image of the silhouette seen from the other side.

== Astronomy ==

The names umbra, penumbra and antumbra are often used for the shadows cast by astronomical objects, though they are sometimes used to describe levels of darkness, such as in sunspots. An astronomical object casts human-visible shadows when its apparent magnitude is equal or lower than -4. The only astronomical objects able to project visible shadows onto Earth are the Sun, the Moon, and in the right conditions, Venus or Jupiter. Night is caused by the hemisphere of a planet facing its orbital star blocking its sunlight.

A shadow cast by the Earth onto the Moon is a lunar eclipse. Conversely, a shadow cast by the Moon onto the Earth is a solar eclipse.

== Daytime variation ==
The sun casts shadows that change dramatically through the day. The length of a shadow cast on the ground is proportional to the cotangent of the sun&#x27;s elevation angle—its angle &quot;θ&quot; relative to the horizon. Near sunrise and sunset, when &quot;θ&quot; = 0° and &quot;cot(θ)&quot; = ∞, shadows can be extremely long. If the sun passes directly overhead (only possible in locations between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn), then &quot;θ&quot; = 90°, &quot;cot(θ)&quot; = 0, and shadows are cast directly underneath objects.

Such variations have long aided travellers during their travels, especially in barren regions such as the Arabian Desert.

== Propagation speed ==
The farther the distance from the object blocking the light to the surface of projection, the larger the silhouette (they are considered proportional). Also, if the object is moving, the shadow cast by the object will project an image with dimensions (length) expanding proportionally faster than the object&#x27;s own rate of movement. The increase of size and movement is also true if the distance between the object of interference and the light source are closer. 
Eventually, this speed may exceed the speed of light. However, this does not violate special relativity as shadows do not carry any information or momentum.

Although the edge of a shadow appears to &quot;move&quot; along a wall, in actuality the increase of a shadow&#x27;s length is part of a new projection that propagates at the speed of light from the object of interference. Since there is no actual communication between points in a shadow (except for reflection or interference of light, at the speed of light), a shadow that projects over a surface of large distances (light years) cannot convey information between those distances with the shadow&#x27;s edge.

== Color ==
Visual artists are usually very aware of colored light emitted or reflected from several sources, which can generate complex multicolored shadows. Chiaroscuro, sfumato, and silhouette are examples of artistic techniques which make deliberate use of shadow effects.

During the daytime, a shadow cast by an opaque object illuminated by sunlight has a bluish tinge. This happens because of Rayleigh scattering, the same property that causes the sky to appear blue. The opaque object is able to block the light of the sun, but not the ambient light of the sky which is blue as the atmosphere molecules scatter blue light more effectively. As a result, the shadow appears bluish.

== Dimension ==

A shadow occupies a three-dimensional volume of space, but this is usually not visible until it projects onto a reflective surface. A light fog, mist, or dust cloud can reveal the 3D presence of volumetric patterns in light and shadow.

Fog shadows may look odd to viewers who are not used to seeing shadows in three dimensions. A thin fog is just dense enough to be illuminated by the light that passes through the gaps in a structure or in a tree. As a result, the path of an object&#x27;s shadow through the fog becomes visible as a darkened volume. In a sense, these shadow lanes are the inverse of crepuscular rays caused by beams of light, they&#x27;re caused by the shadows of solid objects.

Theatrical fog and strong beams of light are sometimes used by lighting designers and visual artists who seek to highlight three-dimensional aspects of their work.

== Inversion ==
Oftentimes shadows of chain-linked fences and other such objects become inverted (light and dark areas are swapped) as they get farther from the object. A chain-link fence shadow will start with light diamonds and shadow outlines when it is touching the fence, but it will gradually blur. Eventually, if the fence is tall enough, the light pattern will go to shadow diamonds and light outlines.

== Photography ==

In photography, which is essentially recording patterns of light, shade, and color, &quot;highlights&quot; and &quot;shadows&quot; are the brightest and darkest parts, respectively, of a scene or image. Photographic exposure must be adjusted (unless special effects are wanted) to allow the film or sensor, which has limited dynamic range, to record detail in the highlights without them being washed out, and in the shadows without their becoming undifferentiated black areas.

On satellite imagery and aerial photographs, taken vertically, tall buildings can be recognized as such by their long shadows (if the photographs are not taken in the tropics around noon), while these also show more of the shape of these buildings.

== Analogous concepts ==
&quot;Shadow&quot; as a term is often used for any occlusion or blockage, not just those with respect to light. For example, a rain shadow is a dry area, which with respect to the prevailing wind direction, is beyond a mountain range; the elevated terrain impedes rainclouds from entering the dry zone. An acoustic shadow occurs when a direct sound has been blocked or diverted around a given area.

== Cultural aspects ==
Shadows often appear in mythical or cultural contexts. Sometimes in a malevolent light, other times not.
An unattended shade was thought by some cultures to be similar to that of a ghost. The name for the fear of shadows is &quot;sciophobia&quot; or &quot;sciaphobia&quot;.

Chhaya is the Hindu goddess of shadows.

In heraldry, when a charge is supposedly shown &quot;in the shadow&quot; (the appearance is of the charge merely being outlined in a neutral tint rather than being of one or more tinctures different from the field on which it is placed), it is technically described as &quot;umbrated&quot;. Supposedly, only a limited number of specific charges can be so depicted.

Shadows are often linked with darkness and evil; in common folklore, like shadows who come to life, are often evil beings trying to control the people they reflect. The film Upside-Down Magic features an antagonistic shadow spirit who possesses people.

Ancient Egyptians surmised that a shadow, which they called šwt (shut), contains something of the person it represents because it is always present. Through this association, statues of people and deities were sometimes referred to as shadows.

In Islam, shadows are a sign of submission to God. The Quran emphasizes that everything in the heavens and the earth, including shadows, prostrates to the Almighty in awe and obedience: &quot;Do they not see how everything that Allah has created casts its shadow, inclining to the right and to the left, prostrating to Allah while they are humble?&quot; (Quran 16:48). Similarly, the Quran states, &quot;And to Allah prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth, willingly or by compulsion, and their shadows [as well] in the mornings and the afternoons&quot; (Quran 13:15). Shadows, in this context, are a testament to the divine order and unity of creation.

In a commentary to The Egyptian Book of the Dead (BD), Egyptologist Ogden Goelet, Jr. discusses the forms of the shadow: &quot;In many BD papyri and tombs the deceased is depicted emerging from the tomb by day in shadow form, a thin, black, featureless silhouette of a person. The person in this form is, as we would put it, a mere shadow of his former existence, yet nonetheless still existing. Another form the shadow assumes in the BD, especially in connection with gods, is an ostrich-feather sun-shade, an object which would create a shadow.&quot;

== Energy generating ==
Scientists from the National University of Singapore presented a shadow-effect energy generator (SEG), which consists of cells of gold deposited on a silicon wafer attached on a plastic film. The generator has a power density of 0.14 μW cm−2 under indoor conditions (0.001 sun).

<text>David Binning Monro, FBA (16 November 183622 August 1905) was a Scottish Homeric scholar, Provost of Oriel College, Oxford, and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University.

==Life==
David Monro was born in Edinburgh, the grandson of Alexander Monro &quot;tertius&quot;, professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh, whose own father, Alexander Monro &quot;secondus&quot; (1733–1817), and grandfather, Alexander Monro &quot;primus&quot; (1697–1767), had both filled the same position. David Monro was educated at the University of Glasgow, where he was influenced by Edmund Law Lushington to become a classical scholar. In 1854, he attended Brasenose College, Oxford and, later in the same year transferred to Balliol College, Oxford, where he was a Snell exhibitioner. In 1859, he was elected Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford; although he entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn the following year, he became lecturer and then tutor at Oriel. In 1882, he became Provost of the College, and he held this office until his death at Heiden, Switzerland. He also served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from October 1901 to 1904.

==Academic work==
Monro was a polymath and polyglot who possessed considerable knowledge of music, painting and architecture. His favourite study was Homer, and his &quot;A Grammar of the Homeric Dialect&quot; (2nd ed., 1891) established his reputation as an authority on the subject. He edited the last twelve books of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, with valuable appendices on the composition of the poem, its relation to the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the cyclic poets, the history of the text, the dialects, and the Homeric house; a critical text of the poems and fragments (&quot;Homeri opera et reliquiae&quot;, 1896); &quot;Homeri opera&quot; (1902, with T. W. Allen, in the Scriptorum Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxoniensis); and an edition of the &quot;Iliad&quot; with notes for schools.
Monro&#x27;s article on Homer, written for the 9th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, was revised by him for later versions before he died. He also wrote &quot;The Modes of Ancient Greek Music&quot; (1894).

== Death ==
On 22 August 1905, Monro died of heart disease in Heiden, Switzerland. He is buried in Holywell Cemetery in Oxford.

== Collections ==

Upon Monro&#x27;s death in 1905, a number of his friends purchased, by subscription, over 1000 volumes from his library in his memory. These works were on Homeric studies and were mainly 19th century. They were presented to the Bodleian Libraries in Oxford.

Monro himself had left Oriel College c.1000 volumes on comparative philology and mythology, most of which are now on permanent loan to the library of the Taylor Institution in Oxford. He left his books on Greek Music and Mathematics, and editions of William Thackeray and Matthew Arnold, to friends.

<doc id="217304" wikidata="Q271634" url="?curid=217304" title="Pica (genus)">
<text>Pica is a genus of seven species of birds in the family Corvidae in both the New World and the Old. It is one of several corvid genera whose members are known as magpies.

&quot;Pica&quot; have long tails and have predominantly black and white markings. For instance, one species travels throughout Europe to Asia, one lives in western North America, one stays within California, one is confined to southwestern Saudi Arabia, and another one comes from North Africa. The last two species are often considered subspecies of the Eurasian. They were previously considered closely related to the blue and green magpies of Asia, but research suggests their closest relatives are the Eurasian crows.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pica&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. He derived the name by tautonymy from the specific epithet of the Eurasian magpie &quot;Corvus pica&quot; which was introduced by Linnaeus in 1758. &quot;Pica&quot; is the Latin word for the Eurasian magpie.

In 2018, a molecular phylogenetic study found that the Eurasian magpie consisted of multiple species including the Maghreb magpie, the Asir magpie, the black-rumped magpie and the oriental magpie.

===Species===
The genus contains seven living species:






===Fossil species===

Two prehistoric species of &quot;Pica&quot; are currently known: &quot;Pica mourerae&quot;, from fossils found in Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary strata on Mallorca, and &quot;Pica praepica&quot;, from Early Pleistocene strata of Bulgaria.

<doc id="217305" wikidata="Q83204" url="?curid=217305" title="Triumvirate">
<text>A triumvirate () or a triarchy is a political institution ruled or dominated by three individuals, known as triumvirs (). The arrangement can be formal or informal. Though the three leaders in a triumvirate are notionally equal, the actual distribution of power may vary. 

The term can also be used to describe a state with three different military leaders who all claim to be the sole leader.

Informally, the term &quot;triumvirate&quot; may be used for any association of three.

Under the influence of the Soviet Union, the term troika (Russian: for &quot;group of three&quot;) may be used for &quot;triumvirate&quot;.

==Pre-modern triumvirates==
===Biblical===
In the Bible, triumvirates occurred at some notable events in both the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and New Testament. In the Book of Exodus, Moses, his brother Aaron and their nephew or brother-in-law, Hur, acted this way during the Battle of Refidim against the Amalekites. Later in Exodus 24, when Moses was away on Mount Sinai, Aaron and Hur were left in charge of all the Israelites.

In the Gospels, Peter, James, and his brother John were a leading trio among the Twelve Apostles on three specific occasions during the public ministry of Jesus: at the resurrection of the daughter of Jairus, the transfiguration of Jesus, and his agony in the Garden in Gethsemane. Later, in the time of the early Church, the triumvirate of the leading apostles changed slightly after the former James&#x27;s death: it became composed of Peter, John, and James, brother of Jesus, known collectively also as the three &quot;Pillars of the Church&quot;.
=== Ancient China ===
During the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), statesmen Huo Guang (d. 68 BCE), Jin Midi (d. 86 BCE), and Shangguan Jie 上官桀 (d. 80 BCE) formed a triumvirate following the death of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) and the installation of the child emperor Zhao.

Despite the Three Excellencies—including the Grand chancellor, Grand Secretariat, and irregularly, the Grand Commandant—representing the most senior ministerial positions of state, this triumvirate was supported by the economic technocrat and imperial secretary Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE), their political lackey. The acting chancellor, Tian Qianqiu, was also easily swayed by the decisions of the triumvirate.

The Three Excellencies existed in Western Han (202 BCE – 9 CE) as the Grand Chancellor, Grand Secretariat, and Grand Commandant, but the Grand Chancellor was viewed as senior to the Grand Secretariat while the post of Grand Commandant was vacant for most of the dynasty. After Emperor Guangwu established the Eastern Han (25–220 CE), the Grand Commandant was made a permanent official while the Minister over the Masses replaced the Grand Chancellor and the Minister of Works replaced the Grand Secretariat. Unlike the three high officials in Western Han when the Grand Chancellor was senior to all, these new three senior officials had equal censorial and advisory powers. When a young or weak-minded emperor ascended to the throne, these Three Excellencies could dominate state affairs. There were also other types of triumvirates during the Eastern Han; for example, at the onset of the reign of Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189), the General-in-chief Dou Wu (d. 168), the Grand Tutor Chen Fan (d. 168), and another prominent statesman Hu Guang (91–172) formed a triumvirate nominally in charge of the Privy Secretariat, when in fact it was a regent triumvirate that was overseeing the affairs of state and Emperor Ling.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva form the theological triumvirate of the Trimurti, representing the balanced forces of creation, preservation, and destruction, respectively. Their female counterparts and consorts, the goddesses Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati, make up the parallel Tridevi.

===Pagaruyuang===
Triumvirates during the Pagaruyung era in the Minangkabau Highlands were known as &quot;Rajo Tigo Selo,&quot; or &quot;the three reigning kings.&quot; The &quot;Rajo Tigo Selo&quot; was descended from the same line in the same dynasty and ruled at the same reigning time. It consisted of three kings, the &quot;Rajo Alam&quot; who ruled the government and diplomatic affairs, the &quot;Rajo Adaik&quot; who ruled the customs and the &quot;Rajo Ibadaik&quot; who acted as a Grand Mufti.

===Ancient Rome===

During the Roman Republic, (or ) were special commissions of three men appointed for specific administrative tasks apart from the regular duties of Roman magistrates.

The term &quot;triumvirate&quot; is most commonly used by historians of ancient Rome to refer to two political alliances during the crisis of the Roman Republic:

* The informal First Triumvirate of Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Licinius Crassus, formed in 60 BCE or 59 BCE as an alliance among three prominent politicians and lasting until the death of Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BCE, who were not &quot;triumviri&quot; in the usual Roman sense.
* The Second Triumvirate (the ) of Octavian (later Caesar Augustus), Mark Antony, and Lepidus, formed in 43 BCE as an official, legally established institution, formally recognized by the Roman Senate in the Lex Titia and lasted de facto until the fall of Lepidus in 36 BCE, de jure until 32 BCE.

===Tamil===
Tamil Triumvirate refers to the triumvirate of Chola, Chera, and Pandya who dominated the politics of the ancient Tamil country. Sivaperuman, Murugan, and Agatiyar are considered the triumvirate of the Tamil language and Sangam literature.

=== Rum Seljuks ===

In 1246, Rum Seljuk sultan Kaykaus II was invited to Güyük Khan&#x27;s coronation. Instead, he sent Kilij Arslan IV, who went to Karakorum with a delegation. Two years later, he was accompanied by a Mongolian military unit of 2000 soldiers and returned to Anatolia with a jarlig given by Guyuk declaring him sultan. He was recognized as sultan in Sivas, Erzincan, Diyarbakır, Malatya, Harput. Later, a meeting was held, resulting in an accord where the three brothers (Kaykaus, Kilij, and Kayqubad) would share the throne. A &quot;khutbah&quot; was read on their behalf, and coins were struck in their names. However, influenced by some emirs, Kilij Arslan did not accept this and went into conflict with Kaykaus but suffered an unexpected defeat. On 14 June 1249, he was caught and brought to his brother. However, he was well received and returned together to Konya. Both were enthroned alongside Kayqubad II. Thus a period of joint rule began from 1249 until 1254. Kaykaus controlled the capital, Konya, and everything further west, and the coast at Antalya, up to Ankara. Kilij Arslan was allocated everything to the east of Konya up to Erzurum. Kayqubad was granted minor estates on a scale sufficient for his personal expenses.

==Modern triumvirates==
The title was revived a few times for (short-lived) three-headed political &#x27;magistratures&#x27; in post-feudal times.

===Ottoman Empire===

The Three Pashas also known as &quot;Ottoman Triumvirate&quot; effectively ruled the Ottoman Empire during World War I: Mehmed Talaat Pasha (1874–1921), the Grand Vizier (prime minister) and Minister of the Interior; Ismail Enver Pasha (1881–1922), the Minister of War; and Ahmed Djemal Pasha (1872–1922), the Minister of the Navy.

===Modern Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina is ruled by a three-member Presidency.

===Early modern and modern France===

While French Huguenots had derisively bestowed the name Triumvirate on the alliance formed in 1561 between Catholic Francis, Duke of Guise, Anne de Montmorency, and Jacques d&#x27;Albon during the French Wars of Religion, in later years the term would be used to describe other arrangements within France.

At the end of the 1700s, when the French revolutionaries turned to several Roman magistrature names for their newly created institutions, the three-headed collective head of state was named the &quot;Consulat&quot; (1799–1804), a term in use for two-headed magistratures since Antiquity; furthermore it included an office of &quot;First Consul&quot; who was not an equal, but the de facto solo head of state and government – a position Napoleon Bonaparte chose to convert openly into the First French Empire in 1804.

Prior to Napoleon and during the Terror from 1793 to 1794 Maximilien Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, and Georges Couthon, as members of the governing Committee of Public Safety, were accused by their political opponents of forming an unofficial triumvirate, pointing out the first triumvirate of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus which led to the end of the Roman Republic. Although officially all members of the committee shared equal power the three men&#x27;s friendship and close ideological base led their detractors to declaim them as &quot;triumvirs&quot; which was used against them in the coup of &quot;9 Thermidor&quot; (27 July 1794).

===Pre-Independent India===
In the early days of the national struggle and before Gandhi, the Indian National Congress was known to be under Lal-Bal-Pal i.e. Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, often dubbed Lokmanya Tilak.

===Czechoslovakia===

The Czechoslovak National Council, an organization founded in Paris in 1916 by Czech and Slovak émigrés during World War I to liberate their homeland from Austria-Hungary, consisted of the triumvirate of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk as a chairman, Edvard Beneš, who joined Masaryk in exile in 1915, as the organization&#x27;s general secretary, and Milan Rastislav Štefánik, a Slovak who was an aviator in the French Army, designating to represent Slovak interests in the national council. During the closing weeks of the war, the Czechoslovak National Council was formally upgraded to a provisional government and its members were designated to hold top offices in the First Czechoslovak Republic.

===Indonesia===
According to the Article 8 paragraph (3) from the Constitution of Indonesia, there are three head of government institutions that can act as a &quot;temporary&quot; triumvirate only if there are vacancies in the position of president and vice president at the same time (e.g. both president and vice president were assassinated, sick, not doing their duties, died, or resigned). They are Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Home Affairs, and Minister of Defense. Those three ministers can act for president and vice president together for maximum 30 days.

After that, during the term of the triumvirate, the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly must elect a new president and vice president from the two pairs of candidates nominated by the political party or coalition of political parties whose candidates were the winner and the runner-up in the previous presidential election. The newly elected president and vice president will continue the remaining term of former president and vice president that were elected from previous general election, not five years.

===Modern Israel===
* 2008–2009: Then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tzipi Livni were sometimes referred to as a triumvirate.
* 2012: The leadership of Shas, the ultra-orthodox Sepharadi political party of Israel, was given by its spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and the Council of Torah Sages, to a triumvirate formed by the convicted Aryeh Deri, who decided to return to politics after a thirteen-year hiatus, the former party leader Eli Yishai and Ariel Atias.

===Benin===

* 13 April 1970 until 26 October 1972: After the contentious 1970 presidential elections, the country of Benin (then known as the Republic of Dahomey) adopted a Presidential Council which included the three main political figures in the country: Hubert Maga, Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and Sourou-Migan Apithy. In addition, the formal office of President would rotate between the three of them beginning with Hubert Maga. After one successful change of leadership, military leader Mathieu Kérékou staged a coup and overthrew the Presidential Council becoming the leader of the country until 1991.

===Soviet Union===
:&quot;See also List of Troikas in the Soviet Union&quot;
In the context of the Soviet Union, the term troika (Russian: for &quot;group of three&quot;) is used for &quot;triumvirate&quot;.
* May 1922 – April 1925: When Vladimir Lenin suffered his first stroke in May 1922, a Troika was established to govern the country in his place, although Lenin briefly returned to the leadership from 2 October 1922 until a severe stroke on 9 March 1923 ended his political career. The Troika consisted of Joseph Stalin, Lev Kamenev, and Grigory Zinoviev. The Troika broke up in April 1925, when Kamenev and Zinoviev found themselves in a minority over their belief that socialism could only be achieved internationally. Zinoviev and Kamenev joined forces with Leon Trotsky&#x27;s Left Opposition in early 1926. Later, Kamenev, Zinoviev and Trotsky would all be murdered on Stalin&#x27;s orders.
* 13 March – 26 June 1953: After the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953, power was shared between Georgy Malenkov, Lavrenty Beria, and Vyacheslav Molotov.
* 14 October 1964 – 16 June 1977: After the removal of Nikita Khrushchev in October 1964, the Soviet Union went through a period of collective leadership. Power was initially shared between General Secretary (until 1966 First Secretary) Leonid Brezhnev, Premier Alexei Kosygin, and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (nominal &quot;de jure&quot; head of state) Anastas Mikoyan. Mikoyan was replaced by Nikolai Podgorny in 1965.

===Modern Italy===
In the Roman Republic (1849), the title of two sets of three joint chiefs of state in the year 1849:
* 29 March – 1 July 1849: Carlo Armellini (1777–1863), Giuseppe Mazzini (1805–1872), and &quot;Conte&quot; Aurelio Saffi (1819–1890)
* 1–4 July 1849: Aurelio Saffi (again), Alessandro Calandrelli (1805–1888), and Livio Mariani (1793–1855)
Almost immediately following the Roman Republic, the Red Triumvirate governed the restored Papal States from 1849 to 1850:
* 1 August 1849 – 12 April 1850: Cardinals Gabriele della Genga Sermattei (1801–1861), Lodovico Altieri (1805–1867), and (1801–1877)

===Modern Greece===
* After the downfall of the first King of Greece, the Bavarian Otto, on 23 October 1862, and Dimitrios Voulgaris&#x27; unsuccessful term (23 October 1862 – 30 January 1863) as president of the Provisional Government, a Triumvirate (30 January – 30 October 1863) was established consisting of the same Dimitrios Voulgaris, the renowned Admiral Konstantinos Kanaris and Benizelos Roufos, which acted as a regency until the arrival of the new monarch, the first &quot;King of the Hellenes&quot;, George I.
* A triumvirate was established to head the Theriso revolt of 1905 in autonomous Crete, consisting of Eleftherios Venizelos (later Prime Minister of Greece) in charge of organisational matters, Konstantinos Foumis in charge of finances and Konstantinos Manos, the former mayor of Chania, in charge of military affairs.
* A triumvirate was set up during the First World War in September 1916, to head the &quot;Provisional Government of National Defence&quot; in Thessaloniki. It consisted of the popular liberal statesman Eleftherios Venizelos, General Panagiotis Danglis and Admiral Pavlos Koundouriotis. This &quot;Triumvirate of National Defence&quot; functioned as a collective head of government, although effective control was in Venizelos&#x27; hands. With the abdication of King Constantine I in June 1917 and the reunification of the country under Venizelos, the triumvirate was dissolved. The Triandria municipality in Thessaloniki is named after this triumvirate.
* A triumvirate was set up on 13 September 1922 to lead the military revolt against the royalist government in Athens in the aftermath of the Asia Minor Disaster. It was composed of Colonels Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas, and Commander Dimitrios Fokas. The triumvirate assumed the government of Greece on 15 September, and would control the country until it laid down its powers on 2 January 1924. Plastiras however quickly became the dominant figure among the triumvirate, and was eventually labelled as the &quot;Chief of the Revolution&quot;.

<text>Michael Pointer (born 22 July 1956) is an English drummer. He is known for his work in the neo-prog bands Marillion and Arena.

==Career==
Pointer was the original drummer and a founding member of Marillion. He appeared on the band&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; (1982) and debut LP &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; (1983). He was sacked from the band following the album&#x27;s UK tour and ultimately replaced by Ian Mosley. Lead singer Fish later told &quot;Classic Rock&quot; that Pointer had been dismissed because he had &quot;never liked Mick&#x27;s drumming&quot;, &quot;his timing was awful&quot; and &quot;everybody was developing except him&quot;.

After his acrimonious departure from Marillion, Pointer did not perform music for another ten years. Instead, he became a kitchen designer, something he had served an apprenticeship in as a teenager. Pointer eventually founded the British progressive band Arena, in which he continues to play with keyboardist Clive Nolan (from Pendragon). He is Nolan&#x27;s business partner in his record label.

Pointer later gathered a band for &quot;Mick Pointer&#x27;s &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; tour&quot;, comprising Brian Cummins (Carpet Crawlers) on vocals, Nick Barrett (Pendragon) on lead guitar, Mike Varty (Credo) on keyboards and Ian Salmon (Arena) on bass guitar, to perform Marillion&#x27;s debut album for its 25th anniversary. Pointer had originally intended to call it &quot;Mick Pointer, ex-Marillion&quot;; however, the remaining members of the band objected to him using the name, and threatened him with legal action.

<text>In mathematics, a stochastic matrix is a square matrix used to describe the transitions of a Markov chain. Each of its entries is a nonnegative real number representing a probability. It is also called a probability matrix, transition matrix, &quot;substitution matrix&quot;, or Markov matrix. The stochastic matrix was first developed by Andrey Markov at the beginning of the 20th century, and has found use throughout a wide variety of scientific fields, including probability theory, statistics, mathematical finance and linear algebra, as well as computer science and population genetics. There are several different definitions and types of stochastic matrices:

*A right stochastic matrix is a square matrix of nonnegative real numbers, with each row summing to 1 (so it is also called a row stochastic matrix).
*A left stochastic matrix is a square matrix of nonnegative real numbers, with each column summing to 1 (so it is also called a column stochastic matrix).
*A &quot;doubly stochastic matrix&quot; is a square matrix of nonnegative real numbers with each row and column summing to 1.
*A substochastic matrix is a real square matrix whose row sums are all formula_1
In the same vein, one may define a probability vector as a vector whose elements are nonnegative real numbers which sum to 1. Thus, each row of a right stochastic matrix (or column of a left stochastic matrix) is a probability vector. Right stochastic matrices act upon row vectors of probabilities by multiplication from the right (hence their name) and the matrix entry in the -th row and -th column is the probability of transition from state to state . Left stochastic matrices act upon column vectors of probabilities by multiplication from the left (hence their name) and the matrix entry in the -th row and -th column is the probability of transition from state to state . 

This article uses the right/row stochastic matrix convention. 

== History ==

The stochastic matrix was developed alongside the Markov chain by Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician and professor at St. Petersburg University who first published on the topic in 1906. His initial intended uses were for linguistic analysis and other mathematical subjects like card shuffling, but both Markov chains and matrices rapidly found use in other fields.

Stochastic matrices were further developed by scholars such as Andrey Kolmogorov, who expanded their possibilities by allowing for continuous-time Markov processes. By the 1950s, articles using stochastic matrices had appeared in the fields of econometrics and circuit theory. In the 1960s, stochastic matrices appeared in an even wider variety of scientific works, from behavioral science to geology to residential planning. In addition, much mathematical work was also done through these decades to improve the range of uses and functionality of the stochastic matrix and Markovian processes more generally.

From the 1970s to present, stochastic matrices have found use in almost every field that requires formal analysis, from structural science to medical diagnosis to personnel management. In addition, stochastic matrices have found wide use in land change modeling, usually under the term Markov matrix.

==Definition and properties==
A stochastic matrix describes a Markov chain over a finite state space with cardinality .

If the probability of moving from to in one time step is , the stochastic matrix is given by using as the -th row and -th column element, e.g.,

formula_2

Since the total of transition probability from a state to all other states must be 1,

formula_3

thus this matrix is a right stochastic matrix.

The above elementwise sum across each row of may be more concisely written as , where is the -dimensional column vector of all ones. Using this, it can be seen that the product of two right stochastic matrices and is also right stochastic: . In general, the -th power of a right stochastic matrix is also right stochastic. The probability of transitioning from to in two steps is then given by the -th element of the square of :

formula_4

In general, the probability transition of going from any state to another state in a finite Markov chain given by the matrix in steps is given by .

An initial probability distribution of states, specifying where the system might be initially and with what probabilities, is given as a row vector.

A &quot;stationary&quot; probability vector is defined as a distribution, written as a row vector, that does not change under application of the transition matrix; that is, it is defined as a probability distribution on the set which is also a row eigenvector of the probability matrix, associated with eigenvalue 1:

formula_5

It can be shown that the spectral radius of any stochastic matrix is one. By the Gershgorin circle theorem, all of the eigenvalues of a stochastic matrix have absolute values less than or equal to one. Additionally, every right stochastic matrix has an &quot;obvious&quot; column eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue 1: the vector used above, whose coordinates are all equal to 1. As left and right eigenvalues of a square matrix are the same, every stochastic matrix has, at least, a row eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue 1 and the largest absolute value of all its eigenvalues is also 1. Finally, the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem (applied to the compact convex set of all probability distributions of the finite set ) implies that there is some left eigenvector which is also a stationary probability vector.

On the other hand, the Perron–Frobenius theorem also ensures that every irreducible stochastic matrix has such a stationary vector, and that the largest absolute value of an eigenvalue is always 1. However, this theorem cannot be applied directly to such matrices because they need not be irreducible.

In general, there may be several such vectors. However, for a matrix with strictly positive entries (or, more generally, for an irreducible aperiodic stochastic matrix), this vector is unique and can be computed by observing that for any we have the following limit,

formula_6

where is the -th element of the row vector . Among other things, this says that the long-term probability of being in a state is independent of the initial state . That both of these computations give the same stationary vector is a form of an ergodic theorem, which is generally true in a wide variety of dissipative dynamical systems: the system evolves, over time, to a stationary state.

Intuitively, a stochastic matrix represents a Markov chain; the application of the stochastic matrix to a probability distribution redistributes the probability mass of the original distribution while preserving its total mass. If this process is applied repeatedly, the distribution converges to a stationary distribution for the Markov chain.

Stochastic matrices and their product form a category, which is both a subcategory of the category of matrices and of the one of Markov kernels.

== Example: Cat and mouse ==

Suppose there is a timer and a row of five adjacent boxes. At time zero, a cat is in the first box, and a mouse is in the fifth box. The cat and the mouse both jump to a random adjacent box when the timer advances. For example, if the cat is in the second box and the mouse is in the fourth, the probability that &quot;the cat will be in the first box and the mouse in the fifth after the timer advances&quot; is one fourth. If the cat is in the first box and the mouse is in the fifth, the probability that &quot;the cat will be in box two and the mouse will be in box four after the timer advances&quot; is one. The cat eats the mouse if both end up in the same box, at which time the game ends. Let the random variable &quot;K&quot; be the time the mouse stays in the game.

The Markov chain that represents this game contains the following five states specified by the combination of positions (cat,mouse). Note that while a naive enumeration of states would list 25 states, many are impossible either because the mouse can never have a lower index than the cat (as that would mean the mouse occupied the cat&#x27;s box and survived to move past it), or because the sum of the two indices will always have even parity. In addition, the 3 possible states that lead to the mouse&#x27;s death are combined into one:

* State 1: (1,3)
* State 2: (1,5)
* State 3: (2,4)
* State 4: (3,5)
* State 5: game over: (2,2), (3,3) &amp; (4,4).

We use a stochastic matrix, formula_7 (below), to represent the transition probabilities of this system (rows and columns in this matrix are indexed by the possible states listed above, with the pre-transition state as the row and post-transition state as the column). For instance, starting from state 1 – 1st row – it is impossible for the system to stay in this state, so formula_8; the system also cannot transition to state 2 – because the cat would have stayed in the same box – so formula_9, and by a similar argument for the mouse, formula_10. Transitions to states 3 or 5 are allowed, and thus formula_11 .

formula_12

===Long-term averages===

No matter what the initial state, the cat will eventually catch the mouse (with probability 1) and a stationary state π = (0,0,0,0,1) is approached as a limit. To compute the long-term average or expected value of a stochastic variable formula_13, for each state formula_14 and time formula_15 there is a contribution of formula_16. Survival can be treated as a binary variable with formula_17 for a surviving state and formula_18 for the terminated state. The states with formula_18 do not contribute to the long-term average.

===Phase-type representation===
As State 5 is an absorbing state, the distribution of time to absorption is discrete phase-type distributed. Suppose the system starts in state 2, represented by the vector formula_20. The states where the mouse has perished don&#x27;t contribute to the survival average so state five can be ignored. The initial state and transition matrix can be reduced to,

formula_21 

and 

formula_22

where formula_23 is the identity matrix, and formula_24 represents a column matrix of all ones that acts as a sum over states.

Since each state is occupied for one step of time the expected time of the mouse&#x27;s survival is just the sum of the probability of occupation over all surviving states and steps in time,

formula_25

Higher order moments are given by

formula_26

<text>Cray Inc., a subsidiary of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, is an American supercomputer manufacturer headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It also manufactures systems for data storage and analytics. Several Cray supercomputer systems are listed in the TOP500, which ranks the most powerful supercomputers in the world.

In 1972, the company was founded by computer designer Seymour Cray as Cray Research, Inc., and it continues to manufacture parts in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, where Cray was born and raised. After being acquired by Silicon Graphics in 1996, the modern company was formed after being purchased in 2000 by Tera Computer Company, which adopted the name Cray Inc. In 2019, the company was acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $1.3 billion.

==History==

===Background: 1950–1972===
In 1950, Seymour Cray began working in the computing field when he joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in Saint Paul, Minnesota. There, he helped to create the ERA 1103. ERA eventually became part of UNIVAC, and began to be phased out.

In 1960, he left the company, a few years after former ERA employees set up Control Data Corporation (CDC). He initially worked out of the CDC headquarters in Minneapolis, but grew upset by constant interruptions by managers. He eventually set up a lab in his hometown of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, about 85 miles to the east. Cray had a string of successes at CDC, including the CDC 6600 and CDC 7600.

===Cray Research Inc. and Cray Computer Corporation: 1972–1996===

When CDC ran into financial difficulties in the late 1960s, development funds for Cray&#x27;s follow-on CDC 8600 became scarce. When he was told the project would have to be put &quot;on hold&quot; in 1972, Cray left to form his own company, Cray Research, Inc. Copying the previous arrangement, Cray kept the research and development facilities in Chippewa Falls, and put the business headquarters in Minneapolis. The company&#x27;s first product, the Cray-1 supercomputer, was a major success because it was significantly faster than all other computers at the time. The first system was sold within a month for $8.8 million. Seymour Cray continued working, this time on the Cray-2, though it ended up being only marginally faster than the Cray X-MP, developed by another team at the company.

Cray soon left the CEO position to become an independent contractor. He started a new Very Large Scale Integration technology lab for the Cray-2 in Boulder, Colorado, Cray Laboratories, in 1979, which closed in 1982; undaunted, Cray later headed a similar spin-off in 1989, Cray Computer Corporation (CCC) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he worked on the Cray-3 project—the first attempt at major use of gallium arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors in computing. However, the changing political climate (collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the end of the Cold War) resulted in poor sales prospects. Ultimately, only one Cray-3 was delivered, and a number of follow-on designs were never completed. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1995. CCC&#x27;s remains then became Cray&#x27;s final corporation, SRC Computers, Inc.

Cray Research continued development along a separate line of computers, originally with lead designer Steve Chen and the Cray X-MP. After Chen&#x27;s departure, the Cray Y-MP, Cray C90 and Cray T90 were developed on the original Cray-1 architecture but achieved much greater performance via multiple additional processors, faster clocks, and wider vector pipes. The uncertainty of the Cray-2 project gave rise to a number of Cray-object-code compatible &quot;Crayette&quot; firms: Scientific Computer Systems (SCS), American Supercomputer, Supertek, and perhaps one other firm. These firms did not intend to compete against Cray and therefore attempted less expensive, slower CMOS versions of the X-MP with the release of the COS operating system (SCS) and the CFT Fortran compiler; they also considered the Cray Time Sharing System operating system, developed at United States Department of Energy national laboratories (LANL/LLNL), before joining the broader trend toward adoption of Unixes. Today, Cray OS is a specialized version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
A series of massively parallel computers from Thinking Machines Corporation, Kendall Square Research, Intel, nCUBE, MasPar and Meiko Scientific took over the 1980s high performance market. At first, Cray Research denigrated such approaches by complaining that developing software to effectively use the machines was difficult – a true complaint in the era of the ILLIAC IV, but becoming less so each day. Cray eventually realized that the approach was likely the only way forward and started a five-year project to capture the lead in this area: the plan&#x27;s result was the Digital Equipment Corporation Alpha-based Cray T3D and Cray T3E series, which left Cray as the only remaining supercomputer vendor in the market besides NEC&#x27;s SX architecture by 2000.

Most sites with a Cray installation were considered members of the &quot;exclusive club&quot; of Cray operators. Cray computers were considered quite prestigious because Crays were extremely expensive machines, and the number of units sold was small compared to ordinary mainframes. This perception extended to countries as well: to boost the perception of exclusivity, Cray Research&#x27;s marketing department had promotional neckties made with a mosaic of tiny national flags illustrating the &quot;club of Cray-operating countries&quot;.

New vendors introduced small supercomputers, known as minisupercomputers (as opposed to superminis) during the late 1980s and early 1990s, which out-competed low-end Cray machines in the market. The Convex Computer series, as well as a number of small-scale parallel machines from companies like Pyramid Technology and Alliant Computer Systems were particularly popular. One such vendor was Supertek, whose S-1 machine was an air-cooled CMOS implementation of the X-MP processor. Cray purchased Supertek in 1990 and sold the S-1 as the Cray XMS, but the machine proved problematic; meanwhile, the not-yet-completed S-2, a Y-MP clone, was later offered as the Cray Y-MP (later becoming the Cray EL90) which started to sell in reasonable numbers in 1991–92—to mostly smaller companies, notably in the oil exploration business. This line evolved into the Cray J90 and eventually the Cray SV1 in 1998.

In December 1991, Cray purchased some of the assets of Floating Point Systems, another minisuper vendor that had moved into the file server market with its SPARC-based Model 500 line. These symmetric multiprocessing machines scaled up to 64 processors and ran a modified version of the Solaris operating system from Sun Microsystems. Cray set up Cray Research Superservers, Inc. (later the Cray Business Systems Division) to sell this system as the Cray S-MP, later replacing it with the Cray CS6400. In spite of these machines being some of the most powerful available when applied to appropriate workloads, Cray was never very successful in this market, possibly due to it being so foreign to its existing market niche.

CCC was building the Cray-3/SSS when it went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 1995.

===Silicon Graphics ownership: 1996–2000===
In February 1996, Cray Research was acquired by Silicon Graphics (SGI) for $740 million.

In May 1996, SGI sold the Superservers business to Sun. Sun then turned the UltraSPARC-based &quot;Starfire&quot; project then under development into the extremely successful Sun Enterprise 10000 range of servers. SGI used several Cray technologies in its attempt to move from the graphics workstation market into supercomputing. Key among these was the use of the Cray-developed HIPPI computer bus and details of the interconnects used in the T3 series. SGI&#x27;s long-term strategy was to merge its high-end server line with Cray&#x27;s product lines in two phases, code-named &quot;SN1&quot; and &quot;SN2&quot; (SN standing for &quot;Scalable Node&quot;). The SN1 was intended to replace the T3E and SGI Origin 2000 systems and later became the &quot;SN-MIPS&quot; or SGI Origin 3000 architecture. The SN2 was originally intended to unify all high-end/supercomputer product lines including the T90 into a single architecture. This goal was never achieved before SGI divested itself of the Cray business, and the SN2 name was later associated with the &quot;SN-IA&quot; or SGI Altix 3000 architecture.

In October 1996, founder Seymour Cray died as a result of a traffic accident.

In 1998, under SGI ownership, one new Cray model line, the Cray SV1, was launched. This was a clustered SMP vector processor architecture, developed from J90 technology.

On March 2, 2000, Cray was sold to Tera Computer Company, which was renamed Cray Inc.

===Post-Tera merger: 2000–2019===
After the Tera merger, the Tera MTA system was relaunched as the Cray MTA-2. This was not a commercial success and shipped to only two customers. Cray Inc. also unsuccessfully badged the NEC SX-6 supercomputer as the Cray SX-6 and acquired exclusive rights to sell the SX-6 in the US, Canada, and Mexico.

In 2002, Cray Inc. announced its first new model, the Cray X1 combined architecture vector processor / massively parallel supercomputer. Previously known as the &quot;SV2&quot;, the X1 is the result of the earlier &quot;SN2&quot; concept originated during the SGI years. In May 2004, Cray was announced to be one of the partners in the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s fastest-computer-in-the-world project to build a 50 teraFlops machine for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Cray was sued in 2002 by Isothermal Systems Research for patent infringement. The suit claimed that Cray used ISR&#x27;s patented technology in the development of the Cray X1. The lawsuit was settled in 2003. As of November 2004, the Cray X1 had a maximum measured performance of 5.9 teraflops, being the 29th fastest supercomputer in the world. Since then the X1 has been superseded by the X1E, with faster dual-core processors.

On October 4, 2004, the company announced the Cray XD1 range of entry-level supercomputers which use dual-core 64-bit Advanced Micro Devices Opteron central processing units running Linux. This system was previously known as the OctigaBay 12K before Cray&#x27;s acquisition of that company. The XD1 provided one Xilinx Virtex II Pro field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with each node of four Opteron processors. The FPGAs could be configured to embody various digital hardware designs and could augment the processing or input/output capabilities of the Opteron processors. Furthermore, each FPGA contains a pair of PowerPC 405 processors which can add to the already considerable power of a single node. The Cray XD1, although moderately successful, was eventually discontinued.

In 2004, Cray completed the Red Storm system for Sandia National Laboratories. Red Storm was to become the jumping-off point for a string of successful products that eventually revitalized Cray in supercomputing. Red Storm had processors clustered in 96 unit cabinets, a theoretical maximum of 300 cabinets in a machine, and a design speed of 41.5 teraflops. Red Storm also included an innovative new design for network interconnects, which was dubbed SeaStar and destined to be the centerpiece of succeeding innovations by Cray. The Cray XT3 massively parallel supercomputer became a commercialized version of Red Storm, similar in many respects to the earlier T3E architecture, but, like the XD1, using AMD Opteron processors.

On August 8, 2005, Peter Ungaro was appointed CEO. Ungaro had joined Cray in August 2003 as Vice President of Sales and Marketing and had been made Cray&#x27;s President in March 2005.

Introduced in 2006, the Cray XT4 added support for DDR2 memory, newer dual-core and future quad-core Opteron processors and utilized a second generation SeaStar2 communication coprocessor. It also included an option for FPGA chips to be plugged directly into processor sockets, unlike the Cray XD1, which required a dedicated socket for the FPGA coprocessor.

On November 13, 2006, Cray announced a new system, the Cray XMT, based on the MTA series of machines. This system combined multi-threaded processors, as used on the original Tera systems, and the SeaStar2 interconnect used by the XT4. By reusing ASICs, boards, cabinets, and system software used by the comparatively higher volume XT4 product, the cost of making the very specialized MTA system could be reduced. A second generation of the XMT is scheduled for release in 2011, with the first system ordered by the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS).

In 2006, Cray announced a vision of products dubbed &quot;Adaptive Supercomputing&quot;. The first generation of such systems, dubbed the &quot;Rainier Project&quot;, used a common interconnect network (SeaStar2), programming environment, cabinet design, and I/O subsystem. These systems included the existing XT4 and the XMT. The second generation, launched as the XT5h, allowed a system to combine compute elements of various types into a common system, sharing infrastructure. The XT5h combined Opteron, vector, multithreaded, and FPGA compute processors in a single system.

In April 2008, Cray and Intel announced they would collaborate on future supercomputer systems. This partnership produced the Cray CX1 system, launched in September the same year. This was a deskside blade server system, comprising up to 16 dual- or quad-core Intel Xeon processors, with either Microsoft Windows HPC Server 2008 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux installed.

By 2009, the largest computer system Cray had delivered was the Cray XT5 system at National Center for Computational Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. This system, with over 224,000 processing cores, was dubbed &quot;Jaguar&quot; and was the fastest computer in the world as measured by the LINPACK benchmark at the speed of 1.75 petaflops until being surpassed by the Tianhe-1A in October 2010. It was the first system to exceed a sustained performance of 1 petaflops on a 64-bit scientific application.

In May 2010, the Cray XE6 supercomputer was announced. The Cray XE6 system had at its core the new Gemini system interconnect. This new interconnect included a true global-address space and represented a return to the T3E feature set that had been so successful with Cray Research. This product was a successful follow-on to the XT3, XT4 and XT5 products. The first multi-cabinet XE6 system was shipped in July 2010. The next generation &quot;Cascade&quot; systems were designed make use of future multicore and/or manycore processors from vendors such as Intel and Nvidia. Cascade was scheduled to be introduced in early 2013 and designed to use the next-generation network chip and follow-on to Gemini, code named &quot;Aries&quot;.

In early 2010, Cray also introduced the Cray CX1000, a rack-mounted system with a choice of compute-based, GPU-based, or SMP-based chassis. The CX1 and CX1000 product lines were sold until late 2011.

In 2011, Cray announced the Cray XK6 hybrid supercomputer. The Cray XK6 system, capable of scaling to 500,000 processors and 50 petaflops of peak performance, combines Cray&#x27;s Gemini interconnect, AMD&#x27;s multi-core scalar processors, and Nvidia&#x27;s Tesla GPGPU processors. In October 2012 Cray announced the Cray XK7 which supports the Nvidia Kepler GPGPU and announced that the ORNL Jaguar system would be upgraded to an XK7 (renamed &quot;Titan&quot;) and capable of over 20 petaflops. Titan was the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer as measured by the LINPACK benchmark until the introduction of the Tianhe-2 in 2013, which is substantially faster.

In 2011 Cray also announced it had been awarded the $188 million Blue Waters contract with the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, after IBM had pulled out of the delivery. This system was delivered in 2012 and was the largest system to date, in terms of cabinets and general-purpose x86 processors, that Cray had ever delivered.

In November 2011, the Cray Sonexion 1300 Data Storage System was introduced and signaled Cray&#x27;s entry into the high performance storage business. This product used modular technology and a Lustre file system.

In 2011, Cray launched the OpenACC parallel programming standard organization. In 2019, Cray announced that it was deprecating OpenACC, and will support OpenMP.
However, in 2022, the Cray Fortran compiler still supported OpenACC, in part due to its usage in the ICON climate simulation code.

In April 2012, Cray announced the sale of its interconnect hardware development program and related intellectual property to Intel for $140 million.

On November 9, 2012, Cray announced the acquisition of Appro International, Inc., a California-based privately held developer of advanced scalable supercomputing solutions. As of 2012 the #3 provider on the Top100 supercomputer list, Appro builds some of the world&#x27;s most advanced high performance computing (HPC) cluster systems. In 2012, Cray also opened a subsidiary in China.

===Subsidiary of Hewlett Packard Enterprise: 2019–present===
On September 25, 2019, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) acquired the company for $1.3 billion.

In October 2020, HPE was awarded the contract to build the pre-exascale EuroHPC computer LUMI, in Kajaani, Finland. The contract, worth €144.5 million, is for an HPE Cray EX system, with a theoretical maximum performance of 550 petaflops. Once fully operational, LUMI will become one of the fastest supercomputers in the world.

On June 28, 2022, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) inaugurated the nation’s newest weather and climate supercomputers, two HPE Cray supercomputers installed and operated by General Dynamics (GDIT). Each supercomputer operates at 12.1 petaflops.

On November 18, 2024, the US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) unveiled an HPE Cray supercomputer for use in nuclear weapons analysis and inertial confinement fusion design. The supercomputer is housed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and was ranked at #1 in the TOP500 supercomputer list in the November 2024 edition. HPE Cray supercomputers were listed in 7 of the top 10 positions on the list, including the #1, #2, and #3 positions.

<text>There are two species of passerine birds commonly called chough ( ) that constitute the genus Pyrrhocorax of the Corvidae (crow) family of birds. These are the red-billed chough (&quot;Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax&quot;) and the Alpine chough (or yellow-billed chough) (&quot;Pyrrhocorax graculus&quot;). The white-winged chough of Australia, despite its name, is not a true chough but rather a member of the family Corcoracidae and only distantly related.

The choughs have black plumage and brightly coloured legs, feet and bills and are resident in the mountains and rocky sea-cliffs of southern Eurasia and North Africa. They have long broad wings and perform spectacular aerobatics. Both species pair for life and display fidelity to their breeding sites, which are usually caves or crevices in a cliff face. They build a lined stick nest and lay three to five eggs. They feed, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey, supplemented by vegetable material or food from human habitation, especially in winter.

Changes in agricultural practices, which have led to local population declines and range fragmentation, are the main threats to this genus, although neither species is threatened globally.

==Taxonomy==
There are just two species in the genus, red-billed chough and alpine chough. The first to be described was the red-billed chough, named as &quot;Upupa pyrrhocorax&quot; by Linnaeus in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758. His genus &quot;Upupa&quot; contained species that had a long curved bill and a short blunt tongue. These included the northern bald ibis and the hoopoe, birds now known to be completely unrelated to the choughs.

The Alpine chough was described as &quot;Corvus graculus&quot; by Linnaeus in the 1766 edition of the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Although &quot;Corvus&quot; is the crow genus to which the choughs&#x27; relatives belong, the English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall considered the chough to be sufficiently distinct to be moved to the a genus, &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;, which he described in his 1771 &quot;Ornithologia Britannica&quot;. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;purrhos&quot; (, &quot;flame-coloured&quot;) and &quot;korax&quot; (, &quot;Raven, crow&quot;).

The fossil record from the Pleistocene of Europe includes a form similar to the Alpine chough, and sometimes categorised as an extinct subspecies of that bird, and a prehistoric form of the red-billed chough, &quot;P. p. primigenius&quot;. There are eight generally recognised extant subspecies of red-billed chough, and two of Alpine, although all differ only slightly from the nominate forms. The greater subspecies diversity in the red-billed species arises from an early divergence of the Asian and geographically isolated Ethiopian races from the western forms.

Traditionally, the closest relatives of the choughs have been thought to be the jackdaws &quot;Coloeus&quot; and the typical crows &quot;Corvus&quot;, but more recent genetic studies have suggested the choughs are basal to a group of Asian jay genera (&quot;Crypsirina, Dendrocitta, Platysmurus, Temnurus&quot;), or most recently, basal in the entire Corvidae. The genus &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot; species differ from &quot;Corvus&quot; in that they have brightly coloured bills and feet, smooth, not scaled tarsi, and very short, dense nasal feathers. Choughs have uniformly black plumage, lacking any paler areas as seen in some of their relatives. 

The two &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot; are the main hosts of two specialist chough fleas, &quot;Frontopsylla frontalis&quot; and &quot;F. laetus&quot;, not normally found on other corvids.

===Etymology===
&quot;Chough&quot; was originally an alternative onomatopoeic name for the jackdaw, &quot;Corvus monedula&quot;, based on its call. The similar red-billed chough, formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as &quot;Cornish chough&quot; and then just &quot;chough&quot;, the name transferring from one species to the other.

The Australian white-winged chough &quot;Corcorax melanorhamphos&quot;, despite its similar shape and habits, is in a separate family Corcoracidae only moderately related to the Corvidae and not notably to the true choughs, and is an example of convergent evolution.

==Distribution and habitat==

Choughs breed in mountains, from Morocco and Spain eastwards through southern Europe and the Alps, across Central Asia and the Himalayas to western China. The Alpine chough is also found in Corsica and Crete and the red-billed chough has populations in Ireland, the UK, the Isle of Man, Brittany and two areas of the Ethiopian Highlands. Both species are non-migratory residents throughout their range, only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countries.

These birds are mountain specialists, although red-billed choughs also use coastal sea cliffs in Ireland, Great Britain and Brittany, feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or machair; the small population on La Palma, one of the Canary Islands, is also coastal. The red-billed chough more typically breeds in mountains above in Europe, in North Africa and in the Himalayas. In that mountain range it reaches in the summer, and has been recorded at altitude on Mount Everest. The Alpine chough breeds above in Europe, in Morocco, and in the Himalayas. It has nested at , higher than any other bird species, and it has been observed following mountaineers ascending Mount Everest at an altitude of .

Where the two species occur in the same mountains, the Alpine species tends to breed at a higher elevation than its relative, since it is better adapted for a diet at high altitudes.

==Description==
The choughs are medium-sized corvids; the red-billed chough is 39–40 centimetres (15–16 in) in length with a 73–90 centimetres (29–35 in) wingspan, and the Alpine chough averages slightly smaller at 37–39 (14.5–15.5 in) length with a wingspan. These birds have black plumage similar to that of many &quot;Corvus&quot; crows, but they are readily distinguished from members of that genus by their brightly coloured bills and legs. The Alpine chough has a yellow bill and the red-billed chough has a long, curved, red bill; both species have red legs as adults. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile of each species has a duller bill and legs than the adult and its plumage lacks the glossiness seen in older birds. Other physical distinctions are summarised in the table below.

The two choughs are distinguishable from each other by their bill colour, and in flight the long broad wings and short tail of the red-billed give it a silhouette quite different from its slightly smaller yellow-billed relative. Both species fly with loose deep wing beats, and frequently use their manoeuvrability to perform acrobatic displays, soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces then diving and rolling with fanned tail and folded wings.

The red-billed chough&#x27;s loud, ringing &quot;chee-ow&quot; call is similar in character to that of other corvids, particularly the jackdaw, although it is clearer and louder than the call of that species. In contrast, the Alpine chough has rippling &quot;&quot; and whistled &quot;sweeeooo&quot; calls quite unlike the crows. Small subspecies of both choughs have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===

Choughs are monogamous, and show high partner and site fidelity. Both species build a bulky nest of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is constructed on a ledge, in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in man-made locations like abandoned buildings, quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.

Both species lay 3–5 normally whitish eggs blotched with brown or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after two to three weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41 days for red-billed.

The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the Alpine it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.

===Feeding===

In the summer, both choughs feed mainly on invertebrates such as beetles, snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and fly larvae. Ants are a favoured food of the red-billed chough. Prey items are taken from short grazed pasture, or in the case of coastal populations of red-billed chough, areas where plant growth is hindered by exposure to coastal salt spray or poor soils. The chough&#x27;s bill may be used to pick insects off the surface, or to dig for grubs and other invertebrates. The red-billed chough typically excavates to in the thin soils of its feeding areas, but it may dig to in suitable conditions.

Plant matter is also eaten, and red-billed chough will take fallen grain where the opportunity arises; it has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. Alpine choughs rely more on fruit and berries at times of year when animal prey is limited, and will readily supplement their winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Both &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot; species feed in flocks on open areas, often some distance from the breeding cliffs, particularly in winter. Feeding trips may cover distance and in altitude. In the Alps, the development of skiing above has enabled more Alpine choughs to remain at high levels in winter.

Where their ranges overlap, the two chough species may feed together in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively &quot;Gagea&quot; bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in Juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region and at the same time of year, which dig for food in the soil of the villages&#x27; terraced pastures.

===Natural threats===

Predators of the choughs include the peregrine falcon, golden eagle, and the Eurasian eagle-owl. The common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain red-billed choughs prefer to nest near lesser kestrel colonies. This falcon, which eats only insects, provides a degree of protection against larger predators and the chough benefits in terms of a higher breeding success. The red-billed chough is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.

The choughs host bird fleas, including two &quot;Frontopsylla&quot; species, which are &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot; specialist. Other parasites recorded on choughs include a cestode &quot;Choanotaenia pirinica&quot;, and various species of chewing lice in the genera &quot;Brueelia&quot;, &quot;Menacanthus&quot; and &quot;Philopterus&quot;. Blood parasites such as &quot;Plasmodium&quot; have been found in red-billed choughs, but this is uncommon and apparently does little harm. Parasitism levels are much lower than in some other passerine groups.

==Status==

Both &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot; species have extensive geographical ranges and large populations; neither is thought to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and they are therefore evaluated as being of Least Concern. However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small and isolated.

Both choughs occupied more extensive ranges in the past, reaching to more southerly and lower altitude areas than at present, with the Alpine chough breeding in Europe as far south as southern Italy, and both the decline and range fragmentation continue. Red-billed choughs have lost ground in most of Europe, and Alpine choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent. In the Canary Islands, the red-billed chough is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred, and the Alpine was lost from the archipelago altogether.

The causes of the decline include the fragmentation and loss of open grasslands to scrub or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species&#x27; preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.

The red-billed chough, which breeds at lower levels, has been more affected by human activity, and the declines away from its main Alpine breeding areas have seen it categorised as &quot;vulnerable&quot; in Europe. Only in Spain is it still common, and it has recently expanded its range in that country by nesting in old buildings in areas close to its traditional mountain breeding sites.

==In culture==
Although these are mainly mountain species with limited interactions with humans, the red-billed chough has a coastal population in the far west of its range, and has cultural connections particularly with Cornwall, where it appears on the Cornish Coat of Arms. A legend from that county says that King Arthur did not die but was transformed into a red-billed chough, and hence killing this bird was unlucky.

The red-billed chough was formerly reputed to be a habitual thief of small objects from houses, including burning wood or lighted candles, which it would use to set fire to haystacks or thatched roofs.

As a high altitude species with limited contact with humans until the development of mountain tourism activities, the Alpine chough has little cultural significance. It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s &quot;Catalogue d&#x27;oiseaux&quot; (&quot;Bird catalogue&quot;), a piano piece written in 1956–58. &quot;Le chocard des alpes&quot; (&quot;The Alpine Chough&quot;) is the opening piece of Book 1 of the work.

A group of choughs may be referred to fancifully or jocularly as a &quot;chattering&quot; or &quot;clattering&quot;. (See also: List of collective nouns)

<text>Ian F. Mosley (born 16 June 1953) is an English drummer. He is best known for his long-time membership of the neo-prog band Marillion, which he joined for their second album, &quot;Fugazi&quot;, released in 1984. He had previously been an in-demand session drummer. Mosley&#x27;s abilities have been widely praised, including by former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett, Meshuggah drummer Tomas Haake and critic John Franck of AllMusic. &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; has characterised him as a &quot;drumming great&quot;.

== Early life ==
Mosley studied percussion at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama under teacher Gilbert Webster and, aged 18, played in the orchestra for the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. His first professional band was Darryl Way&#x27;s Wolf, and played drums on the 1973 albums &quot;Canis Lupus&quot; and &quot;Saturation Point&quot;, and the third album &quot;Night Music&quot; from 1974. He later played on the track &quot;Finale&quot; on the 1978 album &quot;Concerto for Electric Violin&quot;. More session work followed in the Netherlands. In 1975, Mosley played on the album &quot;Birds&quot; by Dutch band Trace, before joining Gordon Giltrap Band and played on the 1979 album &quot;The Peacock Party&quot; and the following tour. In 1981, Mosley joined former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett and played on the &quot;Cured&quot; tour, recordings later released on the live album &quot;Time Lapse&quot;. Mosley played on the 1983 album &quot;Highly Strung&quot; and the following tour. Mosley also played on Hacketts album &quot;Till We Have Faces,&quot; before joining Marillion.

== Career ==

===Marillion===
Mosleys first concert with Marillion was 27 October 1983 in Aberystwyth. The band was writing their second album at Rockfield Studios in Wales, and Mosley joined Marillion as a session drummer, after a long search for a replacement for drummer and founding member Mick Pointer, who had left the band acrimoniously in April 1983. Mosley was the fifth drummer to play for Marillion and was frontman Fish&#x27;s choice for the role, who had been unhappy with the band&#x27;s previous drummers.

Music critic John Franck stated Mosley&#x27;s &quot;spot-on drumming was the perfect foil for Marillion&#x27;s meticulous musicianship&quot;. He is still a member of Marillion.

===Other projects===
In 1985, Mosley recorded drums on the track &quot;Dream Within A Dream&quot; on Propagandas &quot;A Secret Wish&quot;.

In 1994, Mosley played on John Wesleys debut album, &quot;Under the Red and White Sky&quot; on the tracks &quot;None So Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Thirteen Days.&quot; Marillion members Mark Kelly played keyboards and produced the album, and Steve Rothery played a guitar solo on &quot;Thirteen Days.&quot;

In 1996, Mosley and Pete Trewavas recorded an instrumental album at Marillions own studio the Racket Club with French guitarist and keyboardist Sylvian Gouvernaire (from the French prog rock band Arrakeen). The project was called Iris, and the album &quot;Crossing the Desert&quot; was released in April 1996 on the Racket Records label. Science fiction artist Danny Flynn provided the artwork.

In 2001, Mosley joined saxophonist Ben Castle, son of entertainer Roy Castle, and they recorded a jazz-themed album together, &quot;Postmankind&quot;. The album also featured guest performances by John Etheridge, Steve Hackett and Marillion members Steve Rothery and Pete Trewavas.

Mosley played on fellow Marillion bandmate Pete Trewavas&#x27; and Eric Blackwood&#x27;s Edison&#x27;s Children album &quot;In The Last Waking Moments...&quot;, playing drums on the epic 16 minute &quot;The Awakening.&quot;

== Musical style ==
Mosley&#x27;s drumming skills have been praised by Steve Hackett, who has described him as &quot;a phenomenal drummer&quot; and &quot;phenomenally fast&quot;. He has also said that Mosley&#x27;s economy on the drums is &quot;every bit the equal&quot; to Phil Collins, Hackett&#x27;s former Genesis bandmate.

Mosley has been cited as an influence by Tomas Haake, drummer of Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah.

Mosley has stated that he enjoys &quot;playing arrangements kind of in a classical format, which is in movements&quot; but, despite his membership of several progressive rock bands over the course of his career, he does not believe in music labels and distances himself from the &quot;progressive label&quot; that &quot;involves lyrics that quote dancing gnomes, Stonehenge and fairytales, etc.&quot;

Mosley&#x27;s drumming is the subject of a book, &quot;A guide to the unique drumming style of Ian Mosley – Marillion&#x27;s Heartbeat&quot;, written by drummer and Marillion fan, Mark Pardy.

In 2019, Mosley published his collected memoirs under the title &quot;Do I Owe You Money? – The Collected Memoirs of Ian Mosley&quot;.

<text>The Ottoman Interregnum or Ottoman Civil War (, ) was a civil war in the Ottoman Empire between the sons of Sultan Bayezid I following their father&#x27;s defeat and capture by Timur in the Battle of Ankara on 20 July 1402. Although Timur confirmed Mehmed Çelebi as sultan, Mehmed&#x27;s brothers İsa Çelebi, Musa Çelebi, Süleyman Çelebi, and later, Mustafa Çelebi, refused to recognize his authority, each claiming the throne for himself. This resulted in civil war. The Interregnum would last a little under 11 years, culminating in the Battle of Çamurlu on 5 July 1413, when Mehmed Çelebi emerged as victor, crowned himself Sultan Mehmed I, and restored the empire.

==Civil war==

===Isa and Mehmed===
Civil war broke out among the sons of Sultan Bayezid I upon his death in 1403. His oldest son, Süleyman, with his capital at Edirne, ruled the recently conquered Bulgaria, all of Thrace, Macedonia and northern Greece. The second son, İsa Çelebi, established himself as an independent ruler at Bursa and Mehmed formed a kingdom at Amasya. War broke out between Mehmed and İsa, and following the battles of Ermeni-beli and Ulubad (March–May 1403), Isa fled to Constantinople and Mehmed occupied Bursa. The subsequent battle at Karasi between Mehmed and Isa resulted in a victory for Mehmed and Isa fleeing to Karaman. Isa was later killed in a bath by agents of Mehmed.

===Suleyman enters civil war===
Meanwhile, the other surviving son of Bayezid, Musa Çelebi, who was captured at the Battle of Ankara, was released by Timur into the custody of Yakub of Germiyan. Mûsa was freed, after Mehmed made a request for his brother&#x27;s release. Following Isa&#x27;s death, Süleyman crossed the straits with a large army. Initially, Süleyman was successful. He invaded Anatolia, capturing Bursa (March 1404) and Ankara later that year.

During the stalemate in Anatolia, which lasted from 1405–1410, Mehmed sent Musa across the Black Sea to Thrace with a small force to attack Suleyman&#x27;s territories in south-eastern Europe. This maneuver soon recalled Suleyman to Thrace, where a short but sanguinary contest between him and Mûsa ensued. At first Suleyman had the advantage, winning the battle of Kosmidion in 1410, but in 1411 his army defected to Mûsa at Edirne. Suleyman was captured, given to Musa&#x27;s bodyguard, Koyun Musasi, and strangled to death on 17 February 1411. Mûsa was now the ruler of the Ottoman dominions in Thrace.

===Mehmed and Musa===
Manuel II Palaiologos, the Byzantine emperor, had been the ally of Suleyman; Mûsa therefore besieged Constantinople. Manuel called on Mehmed to protect him, and Mehmed&#x27;s Ottomans now garrisoned Constantinople against Musa&#x27;s Ottomans of Thrace. Mehmed made several unsuccessful sallies against his brother&#x27;s troops, and was obliged to re-cross the Bosporus to quell a revolt that had broken out in his own territories. Mûsa now pressed the siege of Constantinople. Mehmed returned to Thrace, and obtained the assistance of Stefan Lazarevic, the Serbian Despot.

The armies of the rival Ottoman brothers met on the plain of Chamurli (today Samokov, Bulgaria). Hassan, the Agha of the Janissaries of Mehmed, stepped out before the ranks and tried to get the troops to change sides. Mûsa rushed towards Hassan and killed him, but was himself wounded by an officer who had accompanied Hassan. Mûsa&#x27;s Ottomans fought well, but the battle was won by Mehmed and his allies. Mûsa fled, was later captured and strangled. With Mûsa dead, Mehmed was the sole surviving son of the late Sultan Bayezid I and became Sultan Mehmed I.

The Interregnum was a striking example of the fratricide that would become common in Ottoman successions.

==Political titles==
During the Interregnum, only Mehmed minted coins titling himself &quot;Sultan&quot;. His brother Suleyman&#x27;s coins called himself, &quot;Emir Suleyman b. Bayezid&quot;, while Musa&#x27;s coins stated, &quot;Musa b. Bayezid&quot;. No coins of Isa&#x27;s have survived.

<text>Mark Colbert Kelly (born 1961) is an Irish keyboardist and a member of the neo-prog band Marillion.

==Biography==
Kelly was born on 9 April 1961 and was raised in Ireland until he moved to England with his parents in 1969. 

Kelly was an electronics student while performing part-time in the progressive/psychedelic band Chemical Alice, who released their EP &quot;Curiouser and Curiouser&quot; in 1981. He was invited to join Marillion when they supported Chemical Alice, replacing founding keyboardist Brian Jelliman. His first performance with the band was at the Great Northern at Cambridge on 1 December 1981. He has appeared on every Marillion studio album. Kelly also appeared on John Wesley&#x27;s album &quot;Under the Red and White Sky&quot; in 1994 and on Jump&#x27;s album &quot;Myth of Independence&quot; in 1995 on production and keyboards.

Kelly has played keyboards with Travis for their headlining set at the Isle of Wight Festival (10–12 June 2005), and at T in the park in 2005. He played Keyboards for Edison&#x27;s Children&#x27;s new album &quot;In The Last Waking Moments...&quot; (featuring fellow Marillion member Pete Trewavas and Eric Blackwood), for the song &quot;The &quot;Other&quot; Other Dimension&quot; as well as performing vocals with Steve Hogarth and Andy Ditchfield (DeeExpus) on the Edison&#x27;s Children track &quot;The Awakening&quot; in 2011.

Kelly is credited with inventing online crowdfunding to fund the recording of Marillion&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, following a fan-funded Marillion tour of the United States in 1997, and pioneered many of the ideas copied by other music artists since. Kelly was made Co-CEO of the Featured Artists Coalition, an organization which represents the interests of music artists in the digital age. Kelly stood down as a director of the FAC in 2018. From 2009 until 2020 Kelly was an elected performer-director of PPL.

In 2016, he was cast as a guest keyboardist in Ayreon&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;The Source&quot;.

In September 2020, Kelly released a single &quot;Amelia&quot; with his new solo band, Mark Kelly&#x27;s Marathon. The debut album was released in November 2020.

<doc id="217320" wikidata="Q127437" url="?curid=217320" title="Carl Schurz">
<text>Carl Schurz (; March 2, 1829 – May 14, 1906) was a German-American revolutionary and an American statesman, journalist, and reformer. He migrated to the United States after the German revolutions of 1848–1849 and became a prominent member of the new Republican Party. After serving as a Union general in the American Civil War, he helped found the short-lived Liberal Republican Party and became a prominent advocate of civil service reform. Schurz represented Missouri in the United States Senate and was the 13th United States Secretary of the Interior.

Born in the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s Rhine Province, Schurz fought for democratic reforms in the German revolutions of 1848–1849 as a member of the academic fraternity association Deutsche Burschenschaft. After Prussia suppressed the revolution Schurz fled to France. When police forced him to leave France he migrated to London. Like many other &quot;Forty-Eighters&quot;, he then migrated to the United States, settling in Watertown, Wisconsin, in 1852. After being admitted to the Wisconsin bar, he established a legal practice in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He also became a strong advocate for the anti-slavery movement and joined the newly organized Republican Party, unsuccessfully running for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin. After briefly representing the United States as Minister (ambassador) to Spain, Schurz served as a general in the American Civil War, fighting in the Battle of Gettysburg and other major battles.

After the war, Schurz established a newspaper in St. Louis, Missouri, and won election to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first German-born American elected to that body. Breaking with Republican President Ulysses S. Grant, Schurz helped establish the Liberal Republican Party. The party advocated civil service reform, sound money, low tariffs, low taxes, and an end to railroad grants, and opposed Grant&#x27;s efforts to protect African-American civil rights in the Southern United States during Reconstruction. Schurz chaired the 1872 Liberal Republican convention, which nominated a ticket that unsuccessfully challenged President Grant in the 1872 presidential election. Schurz lost his own 1874 re-election bid and resumed his career as a newspaper editor. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1878.

After Republican Rutherford B. Hayes won the 1876 presidential election, he appointed Schurz as his Secretary of the Interior. Schurz sought to make civil service based on merit rather than political and party connections and helped prevent the transfer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the War Department. Schurz moved to New York City after Hayes left office in 1881 and briefly served as the editor of the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; and later became the editorial writer for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. He remained active in politics and led the &quot;Mugwump&quot; movement, which opposed nominating James G. Blaine in the 1884 presidential election. Schurz opposed William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s bimetallism in the 1896 presidential election but supported Bryan&#x27;s anti-imperialist campaign in the 1900 presidential election. Schurz died in New York City in 1906.

==Early life==

Carl Christian Schurz was born on March 2, 1829, in Liblar (now part of Erftstadt), in Rhenish Prussia, the son of Marianne (née Jussen), a public speaker and journalist, and Christian Schurz, a schoolteacher. He studied at the Jesuit Gymnasium of Cologne, and learned piano under private instructors. Financial problems in his family obligated him to leave school a year early, without graduating. Later he graduated from the gymnasium by passing a special examination and then entered the University of Bonn.

== Revolution of 1848 ==
At Bonn, he developed a friendship with one of his professors, Gottfried Kinkel. He joined the nationalistic Studentenverbindung Burschenschaft Franconia at Bonn, which at the time included among its members Friedrich von Spielhagen, Johannes Overbeck, Julius Schmidt, Carl Otto Weber, Ludwig Meyer and Adolf Strodtmann. In response to the early events of the revolutions of 1848, Schurz and Kinkel founded the &quot;Bonner Zeitung&quot;, a paper advocating democratic reforms. At first Kinkel was the editor and Schurz a regular contributor.

These roles were reversed when Kinkel left for Berlin to become a member of the Prussian Constitutional Convention. When the Frankfurt rump parliament called for people to take up arms in defense of the new German constitution, Schurz, Kinkel, and others from the University of Bonn community did so. During this struggle, Schurz became acquainted with Franz Sigel, Alexander Schimmelfennig, Fritz Anneke, Friedrich Beust, Ludwig Blenker and others, many of whom he would meet again in the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War.

During the 1849 military campaign in Palatinate and Baden, he joined the revolutionary army, fighting in several battles against the Prussian Army. Schurz was adjunct officer of the commander of the artillery, Fritz Anneke, who was accompanied on the campaign by his wife, Mathilde Franziska Anneke. The Annekes would later move to the U.S., where each became Republican Party supporters. Anneke&#x27;s brother, Emil Anneke, was a founder of the Republican party in Michigan. Fritz Anneke achieved the rank of colonel and became the commanding officer of the 34th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Civil War; Mathilde Anneke contributed to both the abolitionist and suffrage movements of the United States.

When the revolutionary army was defeated at the fortress of Rastatt in 1849, Schurz was inside. Knowing that the Prussians intended to kill their prisoners, Schurz managed to escape and travelled to Zürich. In 1850, he returned secretly to Prussia, rescued Kinkel from prison at Spandau and helped him to escape to Edinburgh, Scotland. Schurz then went to Paris, but the police forced him to leave France on the eve of the coup d&#x27;état of 1851, and he migrated to London. Remaining there until August 1852, he made his living by teaching the German language.

==Migration to America==

While in London, Schurz married fellow revolutionary Johannes Ronge&#x27;s sister-in-law, Margarethe Meyer, in July 1852 and then, like many other Forty-Eighters, migrated to the United States. Living initially in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Schurzes moved to Watertown, Wisconsin, where Carl nurtured his interests in politics and Margarethe began her seminal work in early childhood education.

In Wisconsin, Schurz soon became immersed in the anti-slavery movement and in politics, joining the Republican Party. In 1857, he ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for lieutenant governor. In the Illinois campaign of the next year between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, he took part as a speaker on behalf of Lincoln—mostly in German—which raised Lincoln&#x27;s popularity among German-American voters. In 1858, Schurz was admitted to the Wisconsin bar and began to practice law in Milwaukee. Beginning 1859, his law partner was Halbert E. Paine. With Paine&#x27;s encouragement, Schurz took more of an interest in politics and public speaking than in law. In the state campaign of 1859, Schurz made a speech attacking the Fugitive Slave Law, arguing for states&#x27; rights. In Faneuil Hall, Boston, on April 18, 1859, he delivered an oration on &quot;True Americanism&quot;, which, coming from an alien, was intended to clear the Republican party of the charge of &quot;nativism&quot;. Wisconsin Germans unsuccessfully urged his nomination for governor in 1859. In the 1860 Republican National Convention, Schurz was spokesman of the delegation from Wisconsin, which voted for William H. Seward. Despite this, Schurz was on the committee which brought Lincoln the news of his nomination.

After Lincoln&#x27;s election and in spite of Seward&#x27;s objection, Lincoln sent Schurz as minister to Spain in 1861, in part because of Schurz&#x27;s European record as a revolutionary. While there, Schurz did not manage to cause any lasting impact on the Spanish authorities regarding the conflict. He returned to the US in early 1862 to join the Union army.

==American Civil War==

During the American Civil War, Schurz served with distinction as a general in the Union Army. Persuading Lincoln to grant him a commission, Schurz was made a brigadier general of Union volunteers in April 1862. In June, he took command of a division, first under John C. Frémont, and then in Franz Sigel&#x27;s corps, with which he took part in the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862. He was promoted to major general in 1863 and was assigned to lead a division in the XI Corps at the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, both under General Oliver O. Howard. A bitter controversy began between Schurz and Howard over the strategy employed at Chancellorsville, resulting in the routing of the XI Corps by the Confederate corps led by Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. Two months later, the XI Corps again broke during the first day of Gettysburg. Containing several German-American units, the XI Corps performance during both battles was heavily criticized by the press, fueling anti-immigrant sentiments.

Following Gettysburg, Schurz&#x27;s division was deployed to Tennessee and participated in the Battle of Chattanooga. There he served with the future Senator Joseph B. Foraker, John Patterson Rea, and Luther Morris Buchwalter, brother to Morris Lyon Buchwalter. Senator Charles Sumner (R-MA) was a Congressional observer during the Chattanooga Campaign. Later, Schurz was put in command of a Corps of Instruction at Nashville. He briefly returned to active service, where in the last months of the war he was with Sherman&#x27;s army in North Carolina as chief of staff of Henry Slocum&#x27;s Army of Georgia. He resigned from the army after the war ended in April 1865.

In the summer of 1865, President Andrew Johnson sent Schurz through the South to study conditions. They then quarreled because Schurz supported General Slocum&#x27;s order forbidding the organization of militia in Mississippi. Schurz delivered a report to the U.S. Senate documenting conditions in the South which concluded that Reconstruction had succeeded in restoring the basic functioning of government but failed in restoring the loyalty of the people and protecting the rights of the newly legally emancipated who were still considered the slaves of society. It called for a national commitment to maintaining control over the South until free labor was secure, arguing that without national action, Black Codes and violence including numerous extrajudicial killings documented by Schurz were likely to continue. The report was ignored by the President, but it helped fuel the movement pushing for a larger congressional role in Reconstruction and holding Southern states to higher standards.

==Newspaper career==

In 1866, Schurz moved to Detroit, where he was chief editor of the &quot;Detroit Post&quot;. The following year, he moved to St. Louis, becoming editor and joint proprietor with Emil Preetorius of the German-language &quot;Westliche Post&quot; (Western Post), where he hired Joseph Pulitzer as a cub reporter. In the winter of 1867–1868, he traveled in Germany; and gave an account of his interview with Otto von Bismarck in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;. He spoke against &quot;repudiation&quot; of war debts and for &quot;honest money&quot;—code for going back on the gold standard—during the presidential campaign of 1868.

==U.S. Senator==

In 1868, he was elected to the United States Senate from Missouri, becoming the first German American in that body. He earned a reputation for his speeches, which advocated fiscal responsibility, anti-imperialism, and integrity in government. During this period, he broke with the Grant administration, starting the Liberal Republican movement in Missouri, which in 1870 elected B. Gratz Brown governor.

After William P. Fessenden&#x27;s death, Schurz became a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs where Schurz opposed Grant&#x27;s Southern policy as well as his bid to annex Santo Domingo. Schurz was identified with the committee&#x27;s investigation of arms sales to and cartridge manufacture for the French army by the United States government during the Franco-Prussian War.

In 1869, he became the first U.S. Senator to offer a Civil Service Reform bill to Congress. During Reconstruction, Schurz was opposed to federal military enforcement and protection of African American civil rights, and held nineteenth century ideas of European superiority and fears of miscegenation.

In 1870, Schurz helped form the Liberal Republican Party, which opposed President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s annexation of Santo Domingo and his use of the military to destroy the Ku Klux Klan in the South under the Enforcement Acts.

In 1872, he presided over the Liberal Republican Party convention, which nominated Horace Greeley for President. Schurz&#x27;s own choice was Charles Francis Adams or Lyman Trumbull, and the convention did not represent Schurz&#x27;s views on the tariff. Schurz campaigned for Greeley anyway. Especially in this campaign, and throughout his career as a Senator and afterwards, he was a target for the pen of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; artist Thomas Nast, usually in an unfavorable way. The election was a debacle for the Greeley supporters. Grant won by a landslide, and Greeley died shortly after election day in November, before the Electoral College had even met.

Schurz lost the 1874 Senatorial election to Democratic Party challenger and former Confederate Francis Cockrell. After leaving office, he worked as an editor for various newspapers. In 1875, he assisted in the successful campaign of Rutherford B. Hayes to regain the office of Governor of Ohio. In 1877, Schurz was appointed United States Secretary of the Interior by Hayes, who had been by then been elected President of the United States. Although Schurz honestly attempted to reduce the effects of racism toward Native Americans and was partially successful at cleaning up corruption, his recommended actions towards American Indians &quot;in light of late twentieth-century developments&quot; were repressive. Indians were forced to move into low-quality reservation lands that were unsuitable for tribal economic and cultural advancement. Promises made to Indian chiefs at White House meetings with President Rutherford B. Hayes and Schurz were often broken.

==Secretary of the Interior==
In 1876, he supported Hayes for President, and Hayes named him Secretary of the Interior, following much of his advice in other cabinet appointments and in his inaugural address. In this department, Schurz put into force his belief that merit should be the principal consideration in appointing people to jobs in the Civil Service. He was not in favor of permitting removals except for cause, and supported requiring competitive examinations for candidates for clerkships. His efforts to remove political patronage met with only limited success, however. As an early conservationist, he prosecuted land thieves and attracted public attention to the necessity of forest preservation.

During Schurz&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of the Interior, a movement to transfer the Office of Indian Affairs to the control of the War Department began, assisted by the strong support of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. Restoration of the Indian Office to the War Department, which was anxious to regain control in order to continue its &quot;pacification&quot; program, was opposed by Schurz, and ultimately the Indian Office remained in the Interior Department. The Indian Office had been the most corrupt office in the Interior Department. Positions in it were based on political patronage and were seen as granting license to use the reservations for personal enrichment. Because Schurz realized that the service would have to be cleansed of such corruption before anything positive could be accomplished, he instituted a wide-scale inspection of the service, dismissed several officials, and began civil service reforms whereby positions and promotions were to be based on merit not political patronage.

Schurz&#x27;s leadership of the Indian Affairs Office was at times controversial. While certainly not an architect of forced displacement of Native Americans, he continued the practice. In response to several nineteenth-century reformers, however, he later changed his mind and promoted an assimilationist policy.

==Later life==

Upon leaving the Interior Department in 1881, Schurz moved to New York City. That year German-born Henry Villard, president of the Northern Pacific Railway, acquired the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; and turned the management over to Schurz, Horace White and Edwin L. Godkin. Schurz left the &quot;Post&quot; in the autumn of 1883 because of differences over editorial policies regarding corporations and their employees.

In 1884, he was a leader in the Independent (or Mugwump) movement against the nomination of James Blaine for president and for the election of Grover Cleveland. From 1888 to 1892, he was general American representative of the Hamburg American Steamship Company. In 1892, he succeeded George William Curtis as president of the National Civil Service Reform League and held this office until 1901. He also succeeded Curtis as editorial writer for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in 1892 and held this position until 1898. In 1895 he spoke for the Fusion anti-Tammany Hall ticket in New York City. He opposed William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, speaking for sound money and not under the auspices of the Republican party; he supported Bryan four years later because of anti-imperialism beliefs, which also led to his membership in the American Anti-Imperialist League.

True to his anti-imperialist convictions, Schurz exhorted McKinley to resist the urge to annex land following the Spanish–American War. He authored an opinion piece warning that prominent imperialists would take in &quot;Spanish- Americans, with all the mixtures of Indian and negro blood, and Malays and other unspeakable Asiatics, by the tens of millions!&quot; In the 1904 election he supported Alton B. Parker, the Democratic candidate. Carl Schurz lived in a summer cottage in Northwest Bay on Lake George, New York which was built by his good friend Abraham Jacobi.

==Death and legacy==
Schurz died at age 77 on May 14, 1906, in New York City, and is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Sleepy Hollow, New York.

Schurz&#x27;s wife, Margarethe Schurz, was instrumental in establishing the kindergarten system in the United States.

Schurz is famous for saying: &quot;; if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right.&quot;

He was portrayed by Edward G. Robinson as a friend of the surviving Cheyenne Indians in John Ford&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Cheyenne Autumn.&quot;

==Works==

Schurz published a volume of speeches (1865), a two-volume biography of Henry Clay (1887), essays on Abraham Lincoln (1899) and Charles Sumner (posthumous, 1951), and his &quot;Reminiscences&quot; (posthumous, 1907–09). His later years were spent writing the memoirs recorded in his &quot;Reminiscences&quot; which he was not able to finish, reaching only the beginnings of his U.S. Senate career. Schurz was a member of the Literary Society of Washington from 1879 to 1880.

<text>Physical education, often abbreviated to Phys. Ed. or PE, and sometimes informally referred to as gym class or simply just gym, is a subject taught in schools around the world. PE is taught during primary and secondary education and encourages psychomotor, cognitive, and effective learning through physical activity and movement exploration to promote health and physical fitness. When taught correctly and in a positive manner, children and teens can receive a storm of health benefits. These include reduced metabolic disease risk, improved cardiorespiratory fitness, and better mental health. In addition, PE classes can produce positive effects on students&#x27; behavior and academic performance. Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising. Researchers in 2007 found a profound gain in English Arts standardized test scores among students who had 56 hours of physical education in a year, compared to those who had 28 hours of physical education a year.

Many physical education programs also include health education as part of the curriculum. Health education is the teaching of information on the prevention, control, and treatment of diseases.

== Curriculum in physical education ==
A highly effective physical education 
program aims to develop physical literacy through the acquisition of skills, knowledge, physical fitness, and confidence. Physical education curricula promote healthy development of children, encourage interest in physical activity and sport, improve learning of health and physical education concepts, and accommodate for differences in student populations to ensure that every child receives health benefits. These core principles are implemented through sport participation, sports skill development, knowledge of physical fitness and health, as well as mental health and social adaptation.

Physical education curriculum at the secondary level includes a variety of team and individual sports, as well as leisure activities. Some examples of physical activities include basketball, soccer, volleyball, track and field, badminton, tennis, walking, cycling, and swimming. Chess is another activity that is included in the PE curriculum in some parts of the world. Chess helps students to develop their cognitive thinking skills and improves focus, while also teaching about sportsmanship and fair play. Gymnastics and wrestling activities offer additional opportunities for students to improve the different areas of physical fitness including flexibility, strength, aerobic endurance, balance, and coordination. Additional activities in PE include football, netball, hockey, rounders, cricket, four square, racing, and numerous other children&#x27;s games. Physical education also teaches nutrition, healthy habits, and individuality of needs.

==Pedagogy==
The main goals in teaching modern physical education are:
* To expose children and teens to a wide variety of exercise and healthy activities. Because P.E. can be accessible to nearly all children, it is one of the only opportunities that can guarantee beneficial and healthy activity in children.
* To teach skills to maintain a lifetime of fitness as well as health.
* To encourage self-reporting and monitoring of exercise.
* To individualize duration, intensity, and type of activity.
* To focus feedback on the work, rather than the result.
* To provide active role models.

It is critical for physical educators to foster and strengthen developing motor skills and to provide children and teens with a basic skill set that builds their movement repertoire, which allows students to engage in various forms of games, sports, and other physical activities throughout their lifetime.

These goals can be achieved in a variety of ways. National, state, and local guidelines often dictate which standards must be taught in regards to physical education. These standards determine what content is covered, the qualifications educators must meet, and the textbooks and materials which must be used. These various standards include teaching sports education, or the use of sports as exercise; fitness education, relating to overall health and fitness; and movement education, which deals with movement in a non-sport context.

These approaches and curricula are based on pioneers in PE, namely, Francois Delsarte, Liselott Diem, and Rudolf von Laban, who, in the 1800s focused on using a child&#x27;s ability to use their body for self-expression. This, in combination with approaches in the 1960s, (which featured the use of the body, spatial awareness, effort, and relationships) gave birth to the modern teaching of physical education.

Recent research has also explored the role of physical education for moral development in support of social inclusion and social justice agendas, where it is under-researched, especially in the context of disability, and the social inclusion of disabled people.

=== Technology use in physical education ===
Many physical education classes utilize technology to assist their pupils in effective exercise. One of the most affordable and popular tools is a simple video recorder. With this, students record themselves, and, upon playback, can see mistakes they are making in activities like throwing or swinging. Studies show that students find this more effective than having someone try to explain what they are doing wrong, and then trying to correct it.

Educators may also use technology such as pedometers and heart rate monitors to make step and heart rate goals for students. Implementing pedometers in physical education can improve physical activity participation, motivation and enjoyment.

Other technologies that can be used in a physical education setting include video projectors and GPS systems. Gaming systems and their associated games, such as the Kinect, Wii, and Wii Fit can also be used. Projectors are used to show students proper form or how to play certain games. GPS systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting, and active exergames can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of a classroom setting. Exergames, or digital games that require the use of physical movement to participate, can be used as a tool to encourage physical activity and health in young children.

Technology integration can increase student motivation and engagement in the Physical Education setting. However, the ability of educators to effectively use technology in the classroom is reliant on a teacher&#x27;s perceived competence in their ability to integrate technology into the curriculum.

Beyond traditional tools, recent AI advancements are introducing new methods for personalizing physical education, especially for adolescents. AI applications like adaptive coaching are starting to show promise in enhancing student motivation and program effectiveness in physical education settings.

== By location ==
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is suggested that young children should be participating in 60-minutes of exercise per day at least 3 times per week in order to maintain a healthy body. This 60-minute recommendation can be achieved by completing different forms of physical activity, including participation in physical education programs at school. A majority of children around the world participate in Physical Education programs in general education settings. According to data collected from a worldwide survey, 79% of countries require legal implementation of PE in school programming. Physical education programming can vary all over the world.

===Asia===
==== Philippines ==== 
In the Philippines, P.E. is mandatory for all years in school, unless the school gives the option for a student to do the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme instead for their fifth and sixth year. Some schools have integrated martial arts training into their physical education curriculum.

==== Singapore ====
A Biennial compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school to assess pupils&#x27; physical fitness in Singapore. This includes a series of fitness tests. Students are graded by a system of gold, silver, bronze, or as a fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional two months in the country&#x27;s compulsory national service training if they attain bronze or fail.

=== Europe ===
==== Ireland ====
In Ireland, one is expected to do two semesters worth of 80-minute PE classes. This also includes showering and changing times. So, on average, classes are composed of 60–65 minutes of activity.

==== Poland ====
In Poland, pupils are expected to do at least three hours of PE a week during primary and secondary education. Universities must also organise at least 60 hours of physical education classes in undergraduate courses.

==== Sweden ====
In Sweden, the time school students spend in P.E. lessons per week varies between municipalities, but generally, years 0 to 2 have 55 minutes of PE a week; years 3 to 6 have 110 minutes a week, and years 7 to 9 have 220 minutes. In upper secondary school, all national programs have an obligatory course, containing 100 points of PE, which corresponds to 90–100 hours of PE during the course (one point per hour). Schools can regulate these hours as they like during the three years of school students attend. Most schools have students take part in this course during the first year and offer a follow-up course, which also contains 100 points/hours.

==== United Kingdom ====

In England, pupils in years 7, 8, and 9 are expected to do two hours of exercise per week. Pupils in years 10 and 11 are expected to do one hour of exercise per week.

In Wales, pupils are expected to do two hours of PE a week.

In Scotland, Scottish pupils are expected to have at least two hours of PE per week during primary and lower secondary education.

In Northern Ireland, pupils are expected to participate in at least two hours of physical education (PE) per week during years 8 to 10. PE remains part of the curriculum for years 11 and 12, though the time allocated may vary.

=== North America ===
==== Canada ====
In British Columbia, the government has mandated in the grade one curriculum that students must participate in physical activity daily five times a week. The educator is also responsible for planning Daily Physical Activity (DPA), which is thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity a day (not including curriculum physical education classes). The curriculum also requires students in grade one to be knowledgeable about healthy living. For example, they must be able to describe the benefits of regular exercise, identify healthy choices in activities, and describe the importance of choosing healthy food. 

Ontario, Canada has a similar procedure in place. On October 6, 2005, the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) implemented a DPA policy in elementary schools, for those in grades 1 through 8. The government also requires that all students in grades 1 through 8, including those with special needs, be provided with opportunities to participate in a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained, moderate to vigorous physical activity each school day during instructional time.

==== United States ====
The 2012 &quot;Shape Of The Nation Report&quot; by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (part of SHAPE America) and the American Heart Association found that while nearly 75% of states require physical education in elementary through high school, over half of the states permit students to substitute other activities for their required physical education credit, or otherwise fail to mandate a specific amount of instructional time. According to the report, only six states (Illinois, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, and Vermont) require physical education at every grade level. A majority of states in 2016 did not require a specific amount of instructional time, and more than half allow exemptions or substitution. These loopholes can lead to reduced effectiveness of the physical education programs.

Zero Hour is a before-school physical education class first implemented by Naperville Central High School. In the state of Illinois, this program is known as Learning Readiness P.E. (LRPE). The program was based on research indicating that students who are physically fit are more academically alert, experience growth in brain cells, and enhancement in brain development. NCHS pairs a P.E. class that incorporates cardiovascular exercise, core strength training, cross-lateral movements, as well as literacy and math strategies which enhance learning and improve achievement.

<doc id="217326" wikidata="Q130716" url="?curid=217326" title="Fugazi (album)">
<text>Fugazi is the second studio album by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released in 1984. Produced by Nick Tauber, it was recorded between November 1983 and February 1984 at various studios and was the first to feature drummer Ian Mosley, following the dismissal of the band&#x27;s original drummer Mick Pointer.

The album is titled after a military slang term well known at the time of release. According to AllMusic, the album &quot;streamlined the intricacies of the group&#x27;s prog rock leanings in favour of a more straight-ahead hard rock identity&quot;. Built upon the success of its predecessor, &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, &quot;Fugazi&quot; reached the UK top five and was certified Gold.

==Background and recording==
Following their first album and its support tour, Marillion found themselves behind schedule, under pressure from EMI Records to deliver a second album. Producer Nick Tauber worked the band hard, having them stop into various rehearsal and recording studios to write songs, and to find a drummer. All three drummers to date - Mick Pointer, Andy Ward and John Marter - had been fired. American drummer Jonathan Mover auditioned in London in September 1983, and two days later was performing with Marillion in Germany.

Marillion settled into Rockfield Studios in Wales to compose some songs. According to an interview with Mover, the various band members had been working separately on songs when the band&#x27;s front man, Fish, asked whether they agreed with his new idea that it should be a concept album like Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;. The more veteran band members said &quot;maybe,&quot; but new drummer Mover said it was a bad idea, that the current crop of songs was not connected by any theme, and would have to be scrapped. According to Mover, Fish took this as a challenge to his authority and he was fired from the band. Fish recalled, &quot;Jonathan Mover left me cold, but the musicians loved him because he was super-technical. I felt I was being railroaded. All he could talk about was drums, and he didn’t fit in to the band&#x27;s social element.&quot; Mover received a writing credit for the single &quot;Punch and Judy&quot;.

The production schedule ran so late that Marillion had to begin their album support tour with new drummer Ian Mosley before the album was ready.

Reflecting on his guitar work on the album in a 2022 interview, Steve Rothery said, &quot;The thing about the sound of &quot;Fugazi&quot; is because at the time it was recorded there was a fashion to make everything very clean and bright sounding. So for me some of the guitars on &quot;Fugazi&quot; are too bright, there is not enough warmth in the sound. By the time we did &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; in Berlin with Chris Kimsey, who obviously worked with the Rolling Stones, I think I had the best of both worlds: I had that full, chiming sound but recorded in such a way that it wasn&#x27;t brittle sounding like some of the sounds in &quot;Fugazi&quot;.&quot;

==Release==

===Critical reception===
As Marillion used ten different studios to record the album and the line-up had undergone a change, &quot;Fugazi&quot; proved to be a slightly incoherent follow-up to &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, which was noticed in the retrospective review by John Franck of AllMusic. He awarded the album a four-star rating, singling out such songs as &quot;Assassing&quot;, &quot;Incubus&quot;, and &quot;Fugazi&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, Eduardo Rivadavia observed:

&quot;Fugazi&quot; proved just as diverse, ambitious, even preposterous (in the best possible prog-rock sense) as &quot;Script&quot;. They matched epic, complex musicianship with oblique wordplay to perfection on the likes of &quot;Assassing&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw&quot;, &quot;Incubus&quot;, and the title track – all of which would become perennial concert favorites for years to come. If anything, the new album was, at once, more polished (in terms of both production standards and song arrangements) and a tad less consistent than its predecessor, unquestionably falling short of heightened expectations on the somewhat less-than-stellar &quot;Emerald Lies&quot; and certainly the subpar &quot;She Chameleon&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Fugazi&quot; reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart, spending a total of 20 weeks there. It was certified Gold by the BPI on 9 July 1985 for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. The album produced two singles which became top 30 hits, &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; (UK no. 29) and &quot;Assassing&quot; (UK no. 22).

===Formats and reissues===
The album was initially released on LP, 12&quot; picture disc and cassette. The first CD issue appeared sometime afterwards.

As part of a series of Marillion&#x27;s first eight studio albums, EMI Records re-released &quot;Fugazi&quot; on 23 February 1998 with 24-bit digital remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus tracks. The remastered version was also made available without the bonus disc in 2000 and again in 2005 as a Japanese mini-LP replica.

A new 180g heavy-weight vinyl pressing identical to the original 1984 edition was released in 2012.

On 31 August 2021 a deluxe edition of Fugazi was released via Parlophone as a 3CD/Blu-ray set along with a 4LP boxed version. The deluxe edition includes a completely new remix of the original studio album and a live concert recorded in Montreal, Canada on 20 June 1984 (which had previously been partially available on &quot;Real to Reel&quot;), as well as, on the Blu-ray disc, new high-resolution stereo and 5.1 surround remixes by Avril Mackintosh and Andy Bradfield. The set also includes a &#x27;making of&#x27; documentary containing interviews with all then band members as well as their track by track breakdowns of the genesis of each of the songs. Also included is a live concert from 1984 that was filmed and broadcast by Swiss TV.

==Sleeve artwork==
In 2012, &quot;Gigwise&quot; chose the sleeve design by Mark Wilkinson as 29th in its countdown of the &quot;Greatest Album Artwork of All Time&quot;. Holly Frith wrote: &quot;Despite the arguable quality of their music, Marillion most certainly gave a shit about their album artwork and this multi-tiered image of a young man suffering an apparent overdose is their most startling, brilliant and thought-provoking.&quot;

<doc id="217327" wikidata="Q1663709" url="?curid=217327" title="Johannes Rudbeckius">
<text>Bishop Johannes Rudbeckius or &quot;Johannes Rudbeck&quot; (3 April 1581 – 8 August 1646) was bishop at Västerås, Sweden from 1619 until his death and personal chaplain to King Gustavus II Adolphus.

==Biography==
Being a member of the Rudbeck family, Johannes was born in Ormesta, Almby parish, outside Örebro, Sweden. He was the son of Johan Pedersson Rudbeck (1550-1603) and Christina Pedersdtr Bose. He was a student at Uppsala University in 1598 and at University of Wittenberg received his Master of Philosophy in 1603. He was a professor of mathematics at Uppsala from 1604, professor of Hebrew from 1609 and professor of theology from 1611.

He was made Bishop in the Diocese of Västerås in 1618. In his capacity of bishop, he was restlessly active in organising. He founded the Swedish system of parish registers, ordering his parsons to file comments on every person in the parish. In 1623 he founded the first gymnasium, a school of secondary education in Sweden. He also founded the first school for girls in Sweden, Rudbeckii flickskola, in 1632. Rudbeckius was considered politically suspect by his superiors but his reforms were gradually introduced in the whole country.

==Personal life==
With his second wife Magadalena Malin Carlsdotter (1602–1649), he had a son Olaus Rudbeck (1630–1702), who was a noted scientist of the 17th century. His grandson Olof Rudbeck the Younger (1660–1740) was a scientist, botanist and ornithologist. Bishop Rudbeckius&#x27; granddaughter, Wendela Rudbeck (1668–1710), married Peter Olai Nobelius (1655–1707) from whom descended Alfred Nobel (1833–1896).

<text>&quot;Plutonian Ode&quot; is a poem written by American Beat poet Allen Ginsberg in 1978 against the arms race and nuclear armament of the superpowers. It is heavily inspired by Gnosticism which Ginsberg came to know after reading Hans Jonas&#x27;s book on the subject.

Philip Glass&#x27; Symphony No. 6 is based on and includes parts of this poem.

It was first published in &quot;The CoEvolution Quarterly / Journal for the Protection of All Beings&quot; co-issue, Fall 1978.

<doc id="217341" wikidata="Q44579" url="?curid=217341" title="Clutching at Straws">
<text>Clutching at Straws is the fourth studio album by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released on June 22, 1987. It was the last album with lead singer Fish, who left the band in 1988, and is a concept album.

Although &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; did not achieve the sales of its predecessor, the number one album &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;, spending 15 weeks on the UK album chart (the shortest chart residency of any of Marillion&#x27;s first four studio albums), it was still an immediate commercial success, becoming the second highest charting Marillion album by entering the chart at number two. It produced three UK Top 40 singles: &quot;Incommunicado&quot;, &quot;Sugar Mice&quot; and &quot;Warm Wet Circles&quot;.

The album has received critical acclaim, being listed in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Best Recordings of the Year&quot;, it has been described by AllMusic as an &quot;unheralded masterpiece&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 37 in its countdown of the &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Prog Magazine&quot; rated it #47 on their &quot;100 Greatest Prog Albums of all Time.&quot; In 1999, a 2-CD &#x27;Remastered Version&#x27; with additional B-sides and demos was released, including detailed liner notes from all of the original members including Fish.

==Concept==
The character of Torch (supposedly a descendant of the Jester from earlier album sleeves) is a 29-year-old out-of-work man whose life is a mess. He seeks comfort mostly in alcohol to numb himself. He is trying, but failing, to forget what lies at his feet—a failed marriage, being a deadbeat father, and his lack of commercial success as a singer in a band. As he gets drunk, he also writes about his surroundings and his laments. Since Torch has no other real outlet at his disposal, he ends up in bars, hotel rooms, and on the road, screaming and drunk, thus, he is described as beyond redemption or hope.

Marillion took a break after their tour in support of the album (with Fish eventually quitting) after it was released. The song &quot;Incommunicado&quot; describes the pitfalls of the business, and how pressures in real life exerted by the band&#x27;s US label Capitol Records were crushing in from outside for them to either succeed or get dropped by the company, which would happen to Marillion anyway a few years later.

==Cover artwork==
The front and back covers of the album describe Fish&#x27;s inspiration for the album&#x27;s lyrics as well as some of his heroes. There are allusions to them throughout the album. The setting is in a British pub (the Bakers Arms in Colchester), and the people represented are the following:

*On the front from left to right: Robert Burns, Dylan Thomas, Truman Capote and Lenny Bruce
*On the back from left to right: John Lennon, James Dean and Jack Kerouac

Sleeve artist Mark Wilkinson has expressed his disappointment with the sleeve, which he intended to be more detailed and feature more characters but was rushed due to the release date of the album being brought forward:

&quot;It was torture to do. Especially as I got a call almost by the day from EMI or John (manager John Arnison) that if I missed this deadline, the time slot would go, and the tour / album symbiosis put in jeopardy. Somehow I did it, clutching at sleep! EMI were relieved. Fish seemed OK. The rest of the band were a bit unmoved, it was so different to the previous sleeves. I was bloody disappointed! I loved this album, still do. It was some kind of pinnacle as far as I am concerned. Probably my favourite of theirs. And I felt cheated! It was not the sleeve I had imagined. You don&#x27;t win them all, believe me!&quot;

==Critical reception==
In 1987, David Hepworth wrote in &quot;&quot;Q&quot;&quot;, &quot;Musically, &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; doesn&#x27;t depart far from the educated arrangements of previous albums. However somebody has been applying a stop watch to the individual songs and to the solos within them; thus we have eleven distinct songs, each with its own melodic virtues and most with quite acceptable hook lines barked out by Fish... There are tracks here that could have snuck into Sting&#x27;s live act quite easily.&quot;

John Franck of AllMusic described the album as &quot;perhaps Marillion&#x27;s most unheralded masterpiece&quot; which &quot;showcases some of the band&#x27;s most satisfying compositions, including the magnificent &#x27;Warm Wet Circles&#x27; and &#x27;That Time of the Night (The Short Straw)&#x27; ... Tour opener &#x27;Slainte Mhath&#x27; is simple and elegant, building to its dramatic crescendo only to be upstaged by &#x27;Sugar Mice&#x27; – quite simply, one of Marillion&#x27;s best commercial singles ever&quot;. &quot;The Last Straw&quot; was also praised as a &quot;stunning closer&quot; to the album.

In 2015, while including &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; in the &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that &quot;Marillion&#x27;s fourth album balanced melody and melodrama&quot; and commented on the &quot;atmospheric production and guitarist Steve Rothery&#x27;s spacious, relatively restrained guitar (which split the difference between Genesis&#x27; Steve Hackett and U2&#x27;s the Edge)&quot;.

==Formats and re-issues==
The album was originally released on cassette, vinyl LP, 12&quot; picture disc and was the first Marillion album to be released on compact disc. In 1999, the album was re-released in a remastered version, with the addition of a second CD consisting of demo tapes from the writing sessions for the then-planned untitled and subsequently aborted fifth album, right before Fish left. Much of the leftover musical material was then used on the official fifth Marillion album &quot;Seasons End,&quot; with new lyrics penned by John Helmer and the new singer Steve Hogarth, while some of the original lyrics for the music ended up in one form or another on Fish&#x27;s solo albums – for example, the &quot;Voice in the Crowd&quot; concept would inform much of &quot;Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;. The remastered edition was later also made available without the bonus disc.

A new 180-gram vinyl pressing was released in September 2013 by EMI. It was identical to the original vinyl release from 1987, namely &#x27;Going Under&#x27; was not included.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Fish, Mark Kelly, Ian Mosley, Steve Rothery and Pete Trewavas.

;LP version


The CD version of the album includes the bonus track &quot;Going Under&quot; (2:47) between &quot;That Time of the Night&quot; and &quot;Just for the Record&quot;. This was not included on the vinyl or cassette versions.

<doc id="217342" wikidata="Q727244" url="?curid=217342" title="Polish involvement in the Iraq War">
<text>On March 17, 2003, then Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski announced that Poland would send about 2,000 troops to the Persian Gulf to take part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Polish soldiers had been present in the region since July 2002 and combat was first confirmed on March 24. These formed the fourth of the larger military contributions to the forces arrayed against Iraq (with the United States, Great Britain and Australia).

==Forces committed==
The original Polish contingent contained:

* 70 soldiers from the JW Grom SOF unit, already deployed to the region, before March 2003. These were joined by another 56 men, just before the invasion.
* The logistic support ship ORP &quot;Kontradmirał Xawery Czernicki&quot; which served as a base for special operations, included 50+ crew as well as the navy SOF unit &quot;JW Formoza&quot;.
* 74 chemical-contamination personnel from 4 Brodnicki Pułk Chemiczny (4. Chemical Warfare Regiment from Brodnica).
* Another 53 men strong chemical-contamination contingent was ready to be sent to Turkey, but because of the quick victory it was stopped one day before departure.

In April 2005, Poland had 2,500 troops deployed in Iraq, and was also commanding a number of other coalition troops within the Polish-led Multinational Division Central-South.

==Operations by Polish forces==
Polish commandos took part in security operations on Iraqi oil platforms. Fearing a repeat of the destruction of Iraqi oil wells in the Gulf War by Saddam Hussein, this operation aimed to prevent similar acts that would have led to pollution of the region and loss of infrastructure.

Polish special forces performed the operation of securing the port of Umm Qasr.

==International relations==
In 2003, controversy erupted between Poland and France when Polish forces found French Roland surface-to-air missiles that the international press reported that Polish officers claimed had been manufactured in 2003. France pointed out that the latest Roland missiles were manufactured in the early 1990s and thus the manufacturing date was necessarily an error (it turned out it was probably the expiry date that was indicated), and affirmed that it had never sold weapons to Iraq in violation of the embargo. Investigations by the Polish authorities came to the conclusion that the persons responsible for the scandal were low level commanders; Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne, the Polish Army&#x27;s intelligence service, had not verified their claims before they were leaked to the press.

The Foreign Minister of Poland, Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz, stated in July 2003, &quot;We have never hidden our desire for Polish oil companies to finally have access to sources of commodities&quot; and was criticized for that by many fellow politicians and Polish popular opinion.

<doc id="217343" wikidata="Q3990742" url="?curid=217343" title="Thomas write rule">
<text>In computer science, particularly the field of databases, the Thomas write rule is a rule in timestamp-based concurrency control. It can be summarized as &quot;ignore outdated writes&quot;.

It states that, if a more recent transaction has already written the value of an object, then a less recent transaction does not need to perform its write since the more recent one will eventually overwrite it.

The Thomas write rule is applied in situations where a predefined logical order is assigned to transactions when they start. For example, a transaction might be assigned a monotonically increasing timestamp when it is created. The rule prevents changes in the order in which the transactions are executed from creating different outputs: The outputs will always be consistent with the predefined logical order.

For example, consider a database with 3 variables (A, B, C), and two atomic operations C := A (T1), and C := B (T2). Each transaction involves a read (A or B), and a write (C). The only conflict between these transactions is the write on C. The following is one possible schedule for the operations of these transactions:

:formula_1

If (when the transactions are created) T1 is assigned a timestamp that precedes T2 (i.e., according to the logical order, T1 comes first), then only T2&#x27;s write should be visible. If, however, T1&#x27;s write is executed after T2&#x27;s write, then we need a way to detect this and discard the write.

One practical approach to this is to label each value with a write timestamp (WTS) that indicates the timestamp of the last transaction to modify the value. Enforcing the Thomas write rule only requires checking to see if the write timestamp of the object is greater than the time stamp of the transaction performing a write. If so, the write is discarded

In the example above, if we call TS(T) the timestamp of transaction T, and WTS(O) the write timestamp of object O, then T2&#x27;s write sets WTS(C) to TS(T2). When T1 tries to write C, it sees that TS(T1) &lt; WTS(C), and discards the write. If a third transaction T3 (with TS(T3) &gt; TS(T2)) were to then write to C, it would get TS(T3) &gt; WTS(C), and the write would be allowed.

<text>Restrepia, abbreviated Rstp in horticultural trade, is a small genus of 50 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), closely related to &quot;Pleurothallis&quot;. Named in honor of Don Jose Restrepo, it tends to be more showy than most other Pleurothallids. They are found primarily at higher altitudes in the cool, damp montane forests of the Andes and Venezuela, with some into Central America up to southern Mexico.

== Description ==

These tiny epiphytic and rarely lithophytic orchids lack pseudobulbs. The erect, thick, leathery leaf is elliptic-ovate in shape. The aerial roots seem like fine hairs.

The flowers develop one at a time at the base of the leaf. They are borne on a slender peduncle, originating from the base of the back of the leaf. The long dorsal sepal is erect and ends in a somewhat thicker club-shaped tip. They have fused lateral sepals (synsepals) which may be quite colorful : white, yellow, rose, purple, orange or tan with red, brown or purple overlaid frequently with contrasting reddish-purple spots or stripes. The long, lateral petals equally end in a thickened club-shaped tip. The long lip is ovoid and widest its apex. It shows the same variations in color and markings.

They are generally of tufted habit and white sheathed stems with fine papery bracts. Under the right conditions, they can be in flower all year long. They propagate by spreading and forming new plantlets, called keikis, from the base of mature leaves.

Several species, such as &quot;Restrepia muscifera&quot;, are very variable in size, shape and color. No two populations are the same.

<text>Mark Fuhrman (born February 5, 1952) is a former detective of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). He is primarily known for his part in the investigation of the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in the O. J. Simpson murder case. 

In 1995, Fuhrman was called to testify regarding his discovery of evidence in the Simpson case, including a bloody glove recovered at Simpson&#x27;s estate. During the trial, witnesses claimed that during the 1980s, Fuhrman frequently described African Americans with a racist epithet, claims he denied. In response, Simpson&#x27;s defense team produced recorded interviews with Fuhrman and witnesses proved that he had repeatedly used racist language during those interviews. As a result, the defense claimed that Fuhrman had committed perjury and was not a credible witness. The credibility of the prosecution has been cited as one reason Simpson was acquitted. The defense claimed that Fuhrman planted key evidence as part of a racially motivated plot against Simpson. When asked under oath (with the jury not present), Fuhrman declined to answer all questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment right. These questions included whether he planted or manufactured evidence.

Fuhrman retired from the LAPD in 1995. In 1996, he pleaded no contest to perjury for his false testimony related to his use of racial epithets. Fuhrman has claimed that he is not a racist and apologized for his use of racist language. Some of his former coworkers who are minorities have expressed support for him. Fuhrman maintains that he did not plant or manufacture evidence in the Simpson case, and Simpson&#x27;s defense team did not present any evidence to contradict this claim.

Since his retirement from the LAPD, Fuhrman has written true crime books and hosted talk radio.

==Life before the O. J. Simpson murder trial==
Fuhrman was born in Eatonville, Washington on February 5, 1952, and attended Peninsula High School in Gig Harbor, Washington. Fuhrman&#x27;s parents divorced when he was seven years old, and his mother remarried briefly. In 1970, aged 18, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, where he was trained as a machine gunner and military policeman. He served during the Vietnam War era, although his service in the Vietnam theater was restricted to being assigned to the , an amphibious assault ship stationed offshore. Having attained the rank of sergeant, he was honorably discharged in 1975. After leaving the military, Fuhrman entered the Los Angeles Police Academy and graduated in 1975.

In 1981, Fuhrman requested leave for workers&#x27; compensation. During a psychiatric interview regarding this claim, Fuhrman expressed racist sentiments, stating that he stopped enjoying military service because of alleged insubordination from Mexican-Americans and African-Americans, whom he described as &quot;niggers&quot;. Fuhrman received workers&#x27; compensation and remained on paid leave until 1983. During this time, Fuhrman attempted to leave the police force permanently and receive a stress disability pension. In a 1982 psychiatric interview, he claimed that he had &quot;tortur[ed] suspects and con[ned] internal affairs detectives&quot;, that he would choke suspects and break their arms and legs &quot;if necessary&quot;, and that he had pounded suspects&#x27; faces to &quot;mush&quot;. Fuhrman claimed that he was afraid he would kill someone if he were returned to street patrol. Although several psychiatrists recommended that he be removed from duty completely, and others recommended that he not be allowed to carry a gun, the City of Los Angeles argued that Fuhrman&#x27;s statements were merely part of an elaborate ruse to win a pension. In 1983, Fuhrman lost his case, and a subsequent appeal to Superior Court was rejected; therefore, Fuhrman returned to active duty as a police officer.

In 1985, Fuhrman responded to a domestic violence call between retired NFL football player O. J. Simpson and his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. In 1989, a statement by Fuhrman about this call resulted in Simpson&#x27;s arrest for spousal abuse. Fuhrman was promoted to detective in 1989. In October 1994, he worked to prove the innocence of Arrick Harris, an African-American male who Fuhrman believed had been falsely implicated for murder. Fuhrman retired from the LAPD in early 1995, after serving as a police officer for 20 years.

==Role in the O. J. Simpson murder trial==
===Background===
During Simpson&#x27;s and Brown&#x27;s eight-year marriage, Simpson repeatedly physically abused her and threatened to kill her, leading her to call the police on several occasions. Fuhrman responded to one of these calls and encountered Brown hiding in her Mercedes as Simpson was trying to break the windshield with a baseball bat. In a 2016 interview with Ezra Edelman in &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;, Fuhrman claimed that he twice asked Simpson to put the bat down, and when Simpson refused, Fuhrman got his baton out and threatened him with violence if he continued. Simpson then obeyed and apologized, and Fuhrman offered Brown the chance to press charges so he could arrest Simpson; when she declined, Fuhrman went away telling her, &quot;It&#x27;s your life.&quot;

Brown and Ron Goldman were murdered outside Brown&#x27;s Brentwood, Los Angeles, condominium on the night of June 12, 1994. Robert Riske and his partner were the first police officers on the scene in the early morning of June 13, and Riske found a bloody left-hand glove at the scene. At least 14 officers and supervisors, some of whom arrived on the scene before Fuhrman, reported seeing only one glove. Fuhrman and his superior, Ronald Phillips, were the first detectives to arrive; Fuhrman&#x27;s partner, Brad Roberts, arrived later. Fuhrman was familiar with Simpson and Brown because of the 1985 domestic violence call. Fuhrman left Brown&#x27;s condominium with Ronald Phillips and lead detectives Tom Lange and Philip Vannatter, and went to Simpson&#x27;s Rockingham residence. At the Simpson residence, Fuhrman found a number of blood drops in and on a white Ford Bronco parked outside. Fuhrman then climbed over the wall of the property in order to let in the other detectives. They later testified that they entered Simpson&#x27;s estate without a search warrant due to exigent circumstances – specifically, a concern that Simpson himself might have been harmed.

In Simpson&#x27;s guest house, detectives found Kato Kaelin, who told detectives that he had heard thumping sounds earlier in the night. An investigation of the property by Fuhrman produced a second bloody glove, which was later determined to be the right-hand mate of the glove found at the murder scene. The glove found on the Simpson estate, which – according to DNA testing – was soaked with the blood of both victims, was considered to be one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the prosecution. When Simpson was asked to put on the gloves during the trial, they appeared to be too small for him. The reasons for this have been debated. Simpson was arrested on June 17. On July 8, a preliminary hearing determined that there was sufficient evidence for Simpson to stand trial. On July 22, Simpson pleaded not guilty.

===Defense team&#x27;s strategy===
In an article by Jeffrey Toobin in the July 25 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the defense revealed that they planned to play &quot;the race card&quot;. Specifically, Simpson&#x27;s defense team alleged that Fuhrman planted the glove found at Simpson&#x27;s estate as part of a racially motivated effort to frame Simpson for the murders. The article detailed Fuhrman&#x27;s prior use of racist language and claims of violence made during his 1981–1982 psychiatric interviews. Although Fuhrman&#x27;s psychiatric reports were later ruled inadmissible in the case because they were determined to be too old to have direct relevance, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; article was published before jury selection was finalized or jury sequestration had taken place. Potential jurors were asked how much exposure to the Simpson case they received from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (among other media outlets) as part of the jury selection process. They were also asked their opinions of Fuhrman and other witnesses who had testified at the preliminary hearing.

The trial began on January 24, 1995, and Fuhrman took the witness stand for the prosecution on March 9. During cross-examination on March 15, attorney F. Lee Bailey asked Fuhrman whether he had used the word &quot;nigger&quot; in the previous 10 years, to which Fuhrman replied that he had not. The defense tried to introduce witnesses and audiotape evidence to prove that Fuhrman had lied under oath, that he had a particular animus against interracial couples, that he had a history of perpetrating violence against African-Americans, and that he had a history of being willing to fabricate evidence or testimony. In accordance with the California Evidence Code, the prosecution sought to exclude this evidence by arguing that it was too inflammatory and could prejudice the predominantly black jury. Although they conceded that Fuhrman used racial epithets on the tape, the prosecution suggested that the remainder of the material was merely exaggerated &quot;puffing and blowing&quot;.

On August 31, Judge Lance Ito ruled that evidence could be introduced to prove that Fuhrman had lied about use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, but that claims of violence and police misconduct were inadmissible. On September 5, the defense produced multiple witnesses and audiotapes to establish that Fuhrman had used the word &quot;nigger&quot; within the last 10 years. The tape eventually resulted in a perjury charge against Fuhrman, to which he pleaded no contest. First, Laura Hart McKinny took the stand. Between 1985 and 1994, Fuhrman gave taped interviews to McKinny, a writer working on a screenplay about female police officers. Fuhrman was working as a consultant for McKinny on the understanding that he would be paid $10,000 if a movie were produced. The recordings contain 41 instances of the word &quot;nigger&quot; used as recently as 1988, including references in which Fuhrman claims to have perpetrated violence against African-Americans. In the recordings, he also says he thinks it is sometimes necessary to lie as a police officer and that he has given testimony about events he did not actually witness.

After McKinny, witness Kathleen Bell testified. She had met Fuhrman at a Marine recruiting station in 1985 or 1986, where she claimed that he expressed animus against interracial couples and said, &quot;If I had my way, all the niggers would be gathered together and burned.&quot; Next, witness Natalie Singer, whose roommate had dated Fuhrman around 1987, testified that Fuhrman had told her, &quot;The only good nigger is a dead nigger.&quot; On the television show &quot;Leeza&quot;, Singer later said that Fuhrman had also said, &quot;Yeah, we work with niggers and gangs. You can take one of these niggers, drag &#x27;em into the alley and beat the shit out of them and kick them. You can see them twitch. It really relieves your tension.&quot; However, Ito restricted her from giving her complete statement during the trial. Roderic Hodge then testified that while he was in police custody in 1987, Fuhrman had said to him, &quot;I told you we would get you, nigger.&quot; Ultimately, the jury was allowed to hear only two excerpts from the Fuhrman tapes, which did not include the inflammatory violent content or material related to potential misconduct. Jurors heard Fuhrman say, &quot;We have no niggers where I grew up&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s where niggers live.&quot; With the jury absent on September 6, the defense asked Fuhrman whether he had ever falsified police reports or planted or manufactured evidence in the Simpson case. Although he had earlier responded &quot;No&quot; when asked this question, this time, on his lawyer&#x27;s advice, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

During his closing argument, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran called Fuhrman &quot;a lying, perjuring, genocidal racist&quot;, likening him to Adolf Hitler. He argued that Fuhrman had planted the bloody glove on Simpson&#x27;s estate as part of a racially motivated plot against Simpson, which could be traced back to Fuhrman&#x27;s first encounter with the interracial couple in 1985. Although there was no evidence to suggest that Fuhrman had planted the glove, his perjury about his use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; was widely seen as severely damaging the prosecution&#x27;s credibility in front of the mostly black jury, especially in the wake of the Rodney King trial, and has been cited as one of the main reasons Simpson was acquitted.

===Aftermath===
Fuhrman&#x27;s words on the tapes resulted in his being widely condemned, including by the prosecution. His use of racial epithets and accusations that he had planted evidence became a focal point of the trial and attracted enormous media attention that for a time eclipsed coverage of the crime itself, such that Ron Goldman&#x27;s father, Fred Goldman, sarcastically told the media, &quot;This is now the Fuhrman trial. It is not the trial of O. J. Simpson, the man accused of murdering my son and Nicole.&quot;

After the trial, there was widespread pressure on Los Angeles County district attorney Gil Garcetti to bring perjury charges against Fuhrman. Garcetti initially refused, saying that Fuhrman&#x27;s use of racist language was &quot;not material to the case&quot;, a major element of proving perjury. As many members of Garcetti&#x27;s office made public statements on the issue, Garcetti, citing the high emotions in his office about the case, opted to give the decision to prosecute to Dan Lungren, the California Attorney General, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.

On July 5, 1996, Lungren announced that he would file perjury charges against Fuhrman and soon thereafter offered Fuhrman a plea bargain. On October 2, Fuhrman accepted the deal and pleaded no contest to the charges. He was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and fined $200. Fuhrman is the only person to have been convicted of criminal charges related to the Simpson case. His probation ended early in 1998, and his felony charges were expunged 18 months later.

In an October 1996 television interview with Diane Sawyer, Fuhrman said he did not plant evidence in the Simpson case. He said he is not a racist, and apologized for his use of racist language. He said he had forgotten about the existence of the audiotapes and that they were merely part of a misguided effort to have a fictional screenplay produced. A police investigation of the claims of violence on the tapes found that Fuhrman had grossly exaggerated, and many of his minority former coworkers have expressed support for Fuhrman and said they do not believe he is a racist.

In his book &quot;&quot;, Vincent Bugliosi argues that planting the glove would have required a far-reaching and unlikely conspiracy between Fuhrman and other police officers. Anyone involved in such a conspiracy would have been risking their life, because Article 128 of the California Penal Code states that anyone who fabricates evidence in a death penalty as the Brown and Goldman murder case might have can be sentenced to death themselves. Bugliosi further argues that Fuhrman was one of the victims in the case and that his lying under oath about racial epithets did not rise to the level of indictable perjury, because it was immaterial to the actual facts of the case.

==Post-trial career==
===&quot;Murder in Brentwood&quot;===
After retiring from the LAPD in early 1995, Fuhrman moved to Sandpoint, Idaho. He wrote a book about the Simpson case, called &quot;Murder in Brentwood&quot; (1997, ), which includes a foreword by Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor of the Charles Manson case. In the book, Fuhrman apologized for the racist remarks on the audiotapes, terming them &quot;immature, irresponsible ramblings&quot; made because of a desire to make money; he contends that the tapes were merely part of a screenplay. He argued that Lungren had charged him to garner black support for a planned campaign for governor of California, in 1998.

Despite being told that Lungren&#x27;s case was &quot;flimsy at best&quot;, Fuhrman said that he felt that he had no choice but to plead no contest. He claimed that he could not afford to mount an adequate defense; he already owed thousands of dollars in legal bills, and the city&#x27;s Police Protective League would not help him pay them. He also claimed that he could not pay the living expenses for a trial that would take several months (or years, in case of an appeal). He also believed that he could not get a fair trial in the racially charged climate of the time, and he thought that an acquittal would have caused a riot which would have been similar to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. He also wanted to protect his family from harassment by the press.

Fuhrman has stated that he believes that the LAPD could have arrested Simpson on the afternoon of June 13, based on the blood evidence and his apparently contradictory statements during questioning; however, he believes that senior LAPD officials did not want to take a chance on being wrong about Simpson and they wanted to wait until the preliminary genetic evidence came in. Fuhrman argues that several errors which were made by his LAPD colleagues permitted the defense team to allege that there was suspicious police conduct at Nicole Brown Simpson&#x27;s residence. For instance, Fuhrman has claimed that the initial search warrant which was submitted by one of the detectives who was investigating the case, Phillip Vannatter, was too short and it did not include enough details regarding the probable cause and the evidence which was on hand at the time. Fuhrman has also argued that major pieces of evidence were mishandled and he also believes that his colleagues did not realize that their every move would be scrutinized in court due to the nature of the case.

Fuhrman asserts that the police and the prosecution made other errors that reduced the chances of a guilty verdict. For example, Fuhrman and his partner, Brad Roberts, found a bloody fingerprint on the north walkway gate of Nicole Brown Simpson&#x27;s house. According to Fuhrman, at least some of it belonged to the suspect, because there was enough blood at the scene to suggest that the suspect was bleeding. This piece of evidence was potentially critical; Simpson claimed that he&#x27;d cut himself on the night of the murders but he hadn&#x27;t been to his ex-wife&#x27;s house in a week. Had the fingerprint been tied to Simpson in any way, it could have been a crippling blow to his defense. It also could have contradicted the defense team&#x27;s allegation that Fuhrman planted the glove, since Fuhrman did not know nor did he have a reason to know that it was Simpson&#x27;s blood; however, the fingerprint was destroyed at some point and at trial, it was only mentioned superficially. In fact, Fuhrman later discovered that Vannatter and Lange did not even know that the fingerprint was there because they never read Fuhrman&#x27;s notes. Roberts could have offered testimony that would have corroborated the existence of the fingerprint and several of Fuhrman&#x27;s other observations, but the leading prosecutor Marcia Clark never asked him to testify. This rankled Fuhrman almost as much as Vannatter&#x27;s and Lange&#x27;s failure to read his notes; Fuhrman believed that Clark decided not to call Roberts to avoid embarrassing Vannatter on the stand.

Fuhrman has said that he feels that the prosecution abandoned him once the tapes were made public. He said that he pleaded the Fifth Amendment after he could not get the prosecution to call him to the stand for a redirect prior to the playing of the tapes for the jury. Fuhrman has said that once the tapes came out, his reputation as a credible witness would have been nearly beyond rehabilitation. Fuhrman felt that Judge Lance Ito allowed the defense to control the trial. For instance, like Bugliosi, Fuhrman insists that relevant case law demanded that Ito foreclose the defense from asking him about racial slurs, since any potential relevance was outweighed by the prospect of prejudice against the prosecution&#x27;s case. Fuhrman also asserts that Ito should have never been assigned to the case in the first place, because Ito was married to Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; York, an LAPD captain who had been Fuhrman&#x27;s superior officer in the past. In the Fuhrman tapes which were recorded by Laura McKinny, Fuhrman disparages York&#x27;s appearance and he also suggests that she used her sex to advance her career in the police force. Fuhrman felt that Ito should have been challenged by the prosecution or he should have voluntarily recused himself from the case on that basis. Although the prosecutors had asked Ito to step down, they later withdrew their request out of fear that it would result in a mistrial.

===Other books===
For his next book, &quot;Murder in Greenwich&quot; (1998, ), Fuhrman investigated the then-unsolved 1975 murder of Martha Moxley and he theorized that the murderer was Michael Skakel, nephew of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Skakel was convicted of Moxley&#x27;s murder in June 2002, but later, his conviction was overturned. The book was adapted for a 2002 television movie starring Christopher Meloni as Fuhrman.

In 2001, Fuhrman published &quot;Murder in Spokane: Catching a Serial Killer&quot; (), which investigated a serial killer&#x27;s spree in Spokane, Washington. In 2003, he published &quot;Death and Justice: An Exposé of Oklahoma&#x27;s Death Row Machine&quot; (), critical of the state&#x27;s handling of capital punishment cases. In 2005, Fuhrman published &quot;Silent Witness: The Untold Story of Terri Schiavo&#x27;s Death&quot; ( ), which emphasized gaps in the medical and legal records that might allow for the possibility that Schiavo was murdered.

In 2006, Fuhrman published &quot;A Simple Act of Murder: November 22, 1963&quot; (), about the John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. In it, Fuhrman advanced a theory challenging the single-bullet theory while still maintaining that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. He claimed that the Warren Commission was forced to ratify the single-bullet theory for political reasons. However, he said that a dent in the chrome above the windshield of the presidential limousine used that day vindicated the story told by John Connally that the first shot that hit President John F. Kennedy did not also hit him. In 2009, he published &quot;The Murder Business: How the Media Turns Crime Into Entertainment and Subverts Justice&quot; (), which addressed the fine line between crime reporting and entertainment.

==Radio and television commentary==
Fuhrman is a forensic and crime scene expert for Fox News, and he has been a frequent guest of Fox commentator Sean Hannity. He was also the host of the &quot;Mark Fuhrman Show&quot; on KGA-AM in Spokane. The show covered local and national topics and included guest callers. The show ended after the sale of the station by Citadel Broadcasting Corp. of Las Vegas to Mapleton Communications, LLC, of Monterey, California.

==Personal life==
Fuhrman has been married three times. He was a collector of various war memorabilia and medals.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;Murder in Greenwich&quot;, Fuhrman is portrayed by Christopher Meloni. In &quot;American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson&quot;, Fuhrman is portrayed by Steven Pasquale. He was portrayed by Alexander Man in Joshua Newton&#x27;s film &quot;Nicole &amp; O.J.&quot;. In &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, he is mentioned by character Sam Wilson. In &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; he is described as a &quot;hero cop&quot; by Frank Reynolds, a character who frequently exhibits racist tendencies.

<text>Stelis, or leach orchids, is a large genus of orchids, with perhaps 500 species. The generic name &quot;Stelis&quot; is the Greek word for &#x27;mistletoe&#x27;, referring to the epiphytic habit of these species. These mainly epiphytic (rarely lithophytic) plants are widely distributed throughout much of South America, Central America, Mexico, the West Indies and Florida.
&quot;Stelis&quot; is abbreviated Ste. in the horticultural trade.

Many of the older species were named by Lindley, Ruiz &amp; Pavon and Reichenbach, while many of the recent species were named by Carlyle A. Luer. An orchid of the genus &quot;Stelis&quot; was probably the first American orchid ever to be brought to Europe. An herbarium specimen was depicted in 1591 in Tabernaemontanus&#x27; herbal book.

==Description==
A single oblanceolate leaf develops from narrow, leathery outgrowths from a creeping stem.

Most species grow long, dense racemes of small to minute flower in diverse shades of white. Other colors are rare. These flowers are photosensitive, only opening in the sunlight. Some close completely at night.

The three symmetrically rounded sepals generally form a triangle with a small central structure, made up of the column, small petals and small lip, though slight variation to this theme does occur.

This genus is not common in cultivation.

==Taxonomy==
Cladistic research (by A. Pridgeon, R. Solano and M. Chase) has shown that the genus &quot;Stelis&quot; is monophyletic. But the distinction with several &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; subgenera is blurred (see Reference).

They are closely related to the massive genus &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; and &quot;Masdevallia&quot;. Although vegetatively the species show much variety, the flowers show a basic uniformity and are very similar throughout. Apatostelis , Dialissa , Humboldtia and Steliopsis are generally included into &quot;Stelis&quot;.

==History==
The genus &quot;Stelis&quot; was discovered with Charles Plumier, a French priest and botanist who was sent by Louis XIV, King of France, to study the flora of the Antilles in around 1690. He collected numerous species in Dominica (Caribbean island) and other islands, and published his findings in a catalogue called &quot;Nova Plantarum Americanarum Genera&quot; in 1703. Later on, Nikolaus von Jacquin, a Dutch botanist who collected extensively in the Caribbean, published his findings in two separate works. In 1760, he published the first one called &quot;Enumeratio Systematica Plantarum quas in Insulis Caribeis,&quot; where he described the same plant as Plumier´s polynomial (&quot;Epidendrum ophioglossoides&quot;). In 1763, he published a more detailed second work called &quot;Selectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia&quot;. Here, Jacquin describes a plant of his own herbarium with the same name (&quot;E. ophioglossoides&quot;)

Afterwards, on the “Expedición Botánica Española” (Spanish Botanic Expedition) sent by King Carlos III to study the flora of Peru and Chile, Hipolito Ruiz and Joseph Pavon complete results established 11 small plants of a new genus which they named &quot;Humboltia&quot; in honor of the renowned German explorer and naturalist Alexander Von Humboldt. In 1799, Olof Swartz, a Swedish botanist, studied the genus proposed by Ruiz and Pavon and found that it had been already used by Vahl to designate a Leguminosae. Because of this, he proposed the name &quot;Stelis&quot; in replacement of &quot;Humboltia.&quot; The species &quot;Epidendrum ophioglossoides&quot; was later moved to the genus &quot;Stelis&quot; by Swarz, and it is now the type species of the genus.

<text>In computer science, a timestamp-based concurrency control algorithm is a optimistic concurrency control method. It is used in some databases to safely handle transactions using timestamps.

==Operation==

===Assumptions===
* Every timestamp value is unique and accurately represents an instant in time.
* A higher-valued timestamp occurs later in time than a lower-valued timestamp.

===Generating a timestamp===
A number of different approaches can generate timestamps
* Using the value of the system&#x27;s clock at the start of a transaction as the timestamp.
* Using a thread-safe shared counter that is incremented at the start of a transaction as the timestamp.
* A combination of the above two methods.

===Formal definition===
Each transaction (formula_1) is an ordered list of actions (formula_2). Before the transaction performs its first action (formula_3), it is marked with the current timestamp, or any other strictly totally ordered sequence: formula_4. Every transaction is also given an initially empty set of transactions upon which it depends, formula_5, and an initially empty set of old objects which it updated, formula_6.

Each object formula_7 in the database is given two timestamp fields which are not used other than for concurrency control: 

* formula_8 is the timestamp of the last transaction that read the value of the object ( formula_9, where formula_10 is the last transaction that read the value of the object).
* formula_11 is the timestamp of the last transaction that updated the value of the object ( formula_12, where formula_13 is the last transaction that updated the value of the object).

For all formula_1:

===Informal definition===
Whenever a transaction initiated, it receives a timestamp. The transaction&#x27;s timestamp indicates when the transaction was initiated. These timestamps ensure that transactions affect each object in the same sequence of their respective timestamps. Thus, given two operations that affect the same object from different transactions, the operation of the transaction with the earlier timestamp must execute before the operation of the transaction with the later timestamp. However, if the operation of the wrong transaction is actually presented first, then it is aborted and the transaction must be restarted.

Every object in the database has a read timestamp, which is updated whenever the object&#x27;s data is read, and a write timestamp, which is updated whenever the object&#x27;s data is changed.

If a transaction wants to read an object, 
* but the transaction started &quot;before&quot; the object&#x27;s write timestamp it means that something changed the object&#x27;s data after the transaction started. In this case, the transaction is canceled and must be restarted.
* and the transaction started &quot;after&quot; the object&#x27;s write timestamp, it means that it is &quot;safe&quot; to read the object. In this case, if the transaction&#x27;s timestamp is after the object&#x27;s read timestamp, the read timestamp is set to the transaction&#x27;s timestamp.

If a transaction wants to write to an object, 
* but the transaction started &quot;before&quot; the object&#x27;s read timestamp it means that something has had a look at the object, and we assume it took a copy of the object&#x27;s data. So we can&#x27;t write to the object as that would make any copied data invalid, so the transaction is aborted and must be restarted.
* and the transaction started &quot;before&quot; the object&#x27;s write timestamp it means that something has changed the object since we started our transaction. In this case we use the Thomas write rule and simply skip our write operation and continue as normal; the transaction does not have to be aborted or restarted
* otherwise, the transaction writes to the object, and the object&#x27;s write timestamp is set to the transaction&#x27;s timestamp.

== Physically unrealizable ==
The behavior is physically unrealizable if the results of transactions could not have occurred if transactions were instantaneous. The following are the only two situations that result in physically unrealizable behavior: 

# Transaction T tries to read X but TS(T) &lt; WT(X). Reason: It means that X has been written to by another transaction after T began.
# Transaction T tries to write X but TS(T) &lt; RT(X). Reason: It means that a later transaction read X before it was written by T.

==Recoverability==
Note that timestamp ordering in its basic form does not produce recoverable histories. Consider for example the following history with transactions formula_36 and formula_37:

:formula_38

This could be produced by a TO scheduler, but is not recoverable, as formula_37 commits even though having read from an uncommitted transaction. To make sure that it produces recoverable histories, a scheduler can keep a list of other transactions each transaction has &quot;read from&quot;, and not let a transaction commit before this list consisted of only committed transactions. To avoid cascading aborts, the scheduler could tag data written by uncommitted transactions as &quot;dirty&quot;, and never let a read operation commence on such a data item before it was untagged. To get a strict history, the scheduler should not allow any operations on dirty items.

==Implementation issues==

===Timestamp resolution===
This is the minimum time elapsed between two adjacent timestamps. If the resolution of the timestamp is too large (coarse), the possibility of two or more timestamps being equal is increased and thus enabling some transactions to commit out of correct order. For example, for a system that creates one hundred unique timestamps per second, two events that occur 2 milliseconds apart may be given the same timestamp even though they occurred at different times.

===Timestamp locking===
Even though this technique is a non-locking one, in as much as the object is not locked from concurrent access for the duration of a transaction, the act of recording each timestamp against the Object requires an extremely short duration lock on the Object or its proxy.

<text>Alfred Edmund Brehm (; 2 February 1829 – 11 November 1884) was a German zoologist, writer, director of zoological gardens and the son of Christian Ludwig Brehm, a famous pastor and ornithologist. His multi-volume book &quot;Brehms Tierleben&quot;, which he co-authored with Eduard Pechuël-Loesche, Wilhelm Haacke, and Richard Schmidtlein, became a household word for popular zoological literature.

==Early life==

Alfred Brehm grew up in the small Thuringian village of Unterrenthendorf as the son of the pastor Christian Ludwig Brehm, and of his second wife Bertha née Reiz. Christian Ludwig Brehm made a name for himself as an ornithologist by publications and through an extensive collection of stuffed birds. The collection, held in the parsonage and consisting of over 9,000 dead birds, offered a glimpse into the world of European birds. As a boy he helped expand his father by collecting specimens and became an excellent marskman. His father&#x27;s research gave the younger Brehm an interest in zoology, but at first he wanted to become an architect. In the spring of 1844 he began to study with a builder in Altenburg. He continued his studies there until September 1846, when he left for Dresden in order to study architecture; however, he stopped after two semesters because Baron Johann Wilhelm von Müller, a well-known ornithologist, was looking for a companion for an African expedition. Brehm joined the expedition on 31 May 1847 as a secretary and as a collecting assistant to von Müller. The expedition took him to Egypt, the Sudan, and the Sinai Peninsula; the discoveries made were so important that, at age 20, Brehm was made a member of the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina.

==Career==

After his return, in 1853 he started to study natural sciences at the University of Jena. Like his brother Reinhold, he became active with the student corps Saxonia Jena; because of his expedition to North Africa, he received the nickname Pharaoh from his corps brothers. He graduated after four semesters in 1855 and in 1856 went on a two-year journey to Spain with his brother Reinhold. Afterwards he settled down in Leipzig as a freelance writer and wrote many essays in the service of science popularization for &quot;Die Gartenlaube&quot; and other magazines. Soon, Brehm became one of Germany&#x27;s most popular naturalists and science writers, focusing on zoological themes.

Apart from this, he undertook an expedition to Norway and Lapland in 1860.

In May 1861 Brehm married his cousin Mathilde Reiz, with whom he had five children. Since he wanted to travel, in 1862 he accepted the invitation of Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to accompany him on a trip to Abyssinia. On this trip Brehm met the artist Robert Kretschmer who would assist him in his later books. Afterwards, Brehm travelled to Africa as well as to Scandinavia and Siberia. His essays and expedition reports from the animal world were well received by the educated bourgeoisie; because of this, he was commissioned by the editor of the Bibliographisches Institut, Herrmann Julius Meyer, to write a large multivolume work on the animal world. This book became known worldwide as &quot;Brehms Tierleben&quot; (or, in English, &quot;Brehm&#x27;s Life of Animals&quot;). Although Brehm&#x27;s ethology is no longer seen as correct in all details, the title of his work is still a catchphrase.

Brehm&#x27;s life was full with writing, scientific expeditions and lecture tours. Despite this, in 1862, he accepted the post of first director of the Zoological Garden of Hamburg and kept this position until 1867. Afterwards he went to Berlin, where he opened an aquarium. He remained with the aquarium until 1874. In 1876 he travelled to Siberia with Otto Finsch. In the winter of 1883 to 1884 Brehm planned a lecture tour to the US. Shortly before his departure, his four children contracted diphtheria. Since he could not afford to break his contract, Brehm, a widower since 1878, went ahead with his tour. At the end of January he received word of his youngest son&#x27;s death. After the hardship of this news Brehm relapsed into malaria, which he had caught in Africa in his expedition days. On 11 May 1884, he came back to Berlin. In order to find peace, he returned in July to his home town of Renthendorf, where he died on 11 November 1884. Today, the Brehm Memorial Museum is located there.

<text>In Computer Science, in the field of databases, non-lock concurrency control is a concurrency control method used in relational databases without using locking.

There are several non-lock concurrency control methods, which involve the use of timestamps on transaction to determine transaction priority:

<text>Masdevallia, abbreviated Masd in horticultural trade, is a large genus of flowering plants of the Pleurothallidinae, a subtribe of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). There are over 500 species, grouped into several subgenera. The genus is named for Jose Masdevall (?-1801), a physician and botanist in the court of Charles III of Spain.

== Range and morphology ==
These plants are found from Mexico to southern Brazil, but mostly in the higher regions (2,500-4,000 m ASL) of the Andes of Ecuador and Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. They may be epiphytes, terrestrials or growing as lithophytes on damp rocks.

The plants are characterized by an abbreviated to elongate and creeping rhizome that gives rise to stems that lack pseudobulbs. The stem bears a single, fleshy, erect to pendent, ovate to lanceolate leaf. The flowers are triangular and occur singly or in racemose inflorescences. They are characterized by a showy calyx and reduced corolla. The sepals are fused at the base and frequently caudate. The petals flank the semiterete column and the tongue-shaped lip is flexibly hinged to a free column foot.

== Cultivation ==
The species are sensitive to inappropriate cultural conditions and will show signs of stress by leaf spotting or dropping. They can generally be grown in pots with sphagnum or seedling grade wood chips although a few species produce descending inflorescences and are best accommodated in baskets. In both cases the rhizome should remain at the surface of the medium in order to prevent rot.

Most of these plants are from high altitude cloud forests and require very cool conditions and abundant moisture throughout the year. They cannot tolerate dryness, low humidity, or excessive temperatures and the plants are very easy to kill. They will simply drop all their leaves and suddenly collapse if allowed to dry completely or are exposed to high temperatures. Many members of this genus from very high altitude cloud forests defy cultivation. Most of the species from this genus are considered less difficult in cultivation than plants from the genus &quot;Dracula&quot;, and some of them are very easy to cultivate and have a &#x27;weedy&#x27; habit such as Veitch&#x27;s masdevallia, but the majority of these species are usually very difficult to maintain in cultivation unless the plants can be kept cool and moist all the time.

Low humidity conditions or watering the plants with a water source which contains high levels of dissolved salts will result in the leaves yellowing and rapidly dying from the tips back to the rhizome. The plants should be provided with rain water or distilled water or a very pure water source. The medium should always remain moist as the plants do not have any significant storage structures like most orchids.

== Selected species ==

* &quot;Masdevallia antonii&quot;
* &quot;Masdevallia davisii&quot; – Davis&#x27; masdevallia, orchid of the sun, &quot;qoriwaqanki&quot; (Quechua)

<text>In information technology and computer science, especially in the fields of computer programming, operating systems, multiprocessors, and databases, concurrency control ensures that correct results for concurrent operations are generated, while getting those results as quickly as possible.

Computer systems, both software and hardware, consist of modules, or components. Each component is designed to operate correctly, i.e., to obey or to meet certain consistency rules. When components that operate concurrently interact by messaging or by sharing accessed data (in memory or storage), a certain component&#x27;s consistency may be violated by another component. The general area of concurrency control provides rules, methods, design methodologies, and theories to maintain the consistency of components operating concurrently while interacting, and thus the consistency and correctness of the whole system. Introducing concurrency control into a system means applying operation constraints which typically result in some performance reduction. Operation consistency and correctness should be achieved with as good as possible efficiency, without reducing performance below reasonable levels. Concurrency control can require significant additional complexity and overhead in a concurrent algorithm compared to the simpler sequential algorithm.

For example, a failure in concurrency control can result in data corruption from torn read or write operations.

==Concurrency control in databases==
Comments:
# This section is applicable to all transactional systems, i.e., to all systems that use &quot;database transactions&quot; (&quot;atomic transactions&quot;; e.g., transactional objects in Systems management and in networks of smartphones which typically implement private, dedicated database systems), not only general-purpose database management systems (DBMSs).
# DBMSs need to deal also with concurrency control issues not typical just to database transactions but rather to operating systems in general. These issues (e.g., see &quot;Concurrency control in operating systems&quot; below) are out of the scope of this section.

Concurrency control in Database management systems (DBMS; e.g., Bernstein et al. 1987, Weikum and Vossen 2001), other transactional objects, and related distributed applications (e.g., Grid computing and Cloud computing) ensures that &quot;database transactions&quot; are performed concurrently without violating the data integrity of the respective databases. Thus concurrency control is an essential element for correctness in any system where two database transactions or more, executed with time overlap, can access the same data, e.g., virtually in any general-purpose database system. Consequently, a vast body of related research has been accumulated since database systems emerged in the early 1970s. A well established concurrency control theory for database systems is outlined in the references mentioned above: serializability theory, which allows to effectively design and analyze concurrency control methods and mechanisms. An alternative theory for concurrency control of atomic transactions over abstract data types is presented in (Lynch et al. 1993), and not utilized below. This theory is more refined, complex, with a wider scope, and has been less utilized in the Database literature than the classical theory above. Each theory has its pros and cons, emphasis and insight. To some extent they are complementary, and their merging may be useful.

To ensure correctness, a DBMS usually guarantees that only &quot;serializable&quot; transaction schedules are generated, unless &quot;serializability&quot; is intentionally relaxed to increase performance, but only in cases where application correctness is not harmed. For maintaining correctness in cases of failed (aborted) transactions (which can always happen for many reasons) schedules also need to have the &quot;recoverability&quot; (from abort) property. A DBMS also guarantees that no effect of &quot;committed&quot; transactions is lost, and no effect of &quot;aborted&quot; (rolled back) transactions remains in the related database. Overall transaction characterization is usually summarized by the ACID rules below. As databases have become distributed, or needed to cooperate in distributed environments (e.g., Federated databases in the early 1990, and Cloud computing currently), the effective distribution of concurrency control mechanisms has received special attention.

===Database transaction and the ACID rules===

The concept of a &quot;database transaction&quot; (or &quot;atomic transaction&quot;) has evolved in order to enable both a well understood database system behavior in a faulty environment where crashes can happen any time, and &quot;recovery&quot; from a crash to a well understood database state. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring lock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction&#x27;s programmer via special transaction commands). Every database transaction obeys the following rules (by support in the database system; i.e., a database system is designed to guarantee them for the transactions it runs):
*Atomicity - Either the effects of all or none of its operations remain (&quot;all or nothing&quot; semantics) when a transaction is completed (&quot;committed&quot; or &quot;aborted&quot; respectively). In other words, to the outside world a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the database) to be indivisible (atomic), and an aborted transaction does not affect the database at all. Either all the operations are done or none of them are.
*Consistency - Every transaction must leave the database in a consistent (correct) state, i.e., maintain the predetermined integrity rules of the database (constraints upon and among the database&#x27;s objects). A transaction must transform a database from one consistent state to another consistent state (however, it is the responsibility of the transaction&#x27;s programmer to make sure that the transaction itself is correct, i.e., performs correctly what it intends to perform (from the application&#x27;s point of view) while the predefined integrity rules are enforced by the DBMS). Thus since a database can be normally changed only by transactions, all the database&#x27;s states are consistent.
*Isolation - Transactions cannot interfere with each other (as an end result of their executions). Moreover, usually (depending on concurrency control method) the effects of an incomplete transaction are not even visible to another transaction. Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control.
*Durability - Effects of successful (committed) transactions must persist through crashes (typically by recording the transaction&#x27;s effects and its commit event in a non-volatile memory).

The concept of atomic transaction has been extended during the years to what has become Business transactions which actually implement types of Workflow and are not atomic. However also such enhanced transactions typically utilize atomic transactions as components.

===Why is concurrency control needed?===
If transactions are executed &quot;serially&quot;, i.e., sequentially with no overlap in time, no transaction concurrency exists. However, if concurrent transactions with interleaving operations are allowed in an uncontrolled manner, some unexpected, undesirable results may occur, such as:
# The lost update problem: A second transaction writes a second value of a data-item (datum) on top of a first value written by a first concurrent transaction, and the first value is lost to other transactions running concurrently which need, by their precedence, to read the first value. The transactions that have read the wrong value end with incorrect results.
# The dirty read problem: Transactions read a value written by a transaction that has been later aborted. This value disappears from the database upon abort, and should not have been read by any transaction (&quot;dirty read&quot;). The reading transactions end with incorrect results.
# The incorrect summary problem: While one transaction takes a summary over the values of all the instances of a repeated data-item, a second transaction updates some instances of that data-item. The resulting summary does not reflect a correct result for any (usually needed for correctness) precedence order between the two transactions (if one is executed before the other), but rather some random result, depending on the timing of the updates, and whether certain update results have been included in the summary or not.

Most high-performance transactional systems need to run transactions concurrently to meet their performance requirements. Thus, without concurrency control such systems can neither provide correct results nor maintain their databases consistently.

===Concurrency control mechanisms===

====Categories====
The main categories of concurrency control mechanisms are:
* Optimistic - Allow transactions to proceed without blocking any of their (read, write) operations (&quot;...and be optimistic about the rules being met...&quot;), and only check for violations of the desired integrity rules (e.g., serializability and recoverability) at each transaction&#x27;s commit. If violations are detected upon a transaction&#x27;s commit, the transaction is aborted and restarted. This approach is very efficient when few transactions are aborted.
* Pessimistic - Block an operation of a transaction, if it may cause violation of the rules (e.g., serializability and recoverability), until the possibility of violation disappears. Blocking operations is typically involved with performance reduction.
*Semi-optimistic - Responds pessimistically or optimistically depending on the type of violation and how quickly it can be detected.

Different categories provide different performance, i.e., different average transaction completion rates (&quot;throughput&quot;), depending on transaction types mix, computing level of parallelism, and other factors. If selection and knowledge about trade-offs are available, then category and method should be chosen to provide the highest performance.

The mutual blocking between two transactions (where each one blocks the other) or more results in a deadlock, where the transactions involved are stalled and cannot reach completion. Most non-optimistic mechanisms (with blocking) are prone to deadlocks which are resolved by an intentional abort of a stalled transaction (which releases the other transactions in that deadlock), and its immediate restart and re-execution. The likelihood of a deadlock is typically low.

Blocking, deadlocks, and aborts all result in performance reduction, and hence the trade-offs between the categories.

====Methods====
Many methods for concurrency control exist. Most of them can be implemented within either main category above. The major methods, which have each many variants, and in some cases may overlap or be combined, are:
#Locking (e.g., Two-phase locking - 2PL) - Controlling access to data by locks assigned to the data. Access of a transaction to a data item (database object) locked by another transaction may be blocked (depending on lock type and access operation type) until lock release.
#Serialization graph checking (also called Serializability, or Conflict, or Precedence graph checking) - Checking for cycles in the schedule&#x27;s graph and breaking them by aborts.
#Timestamp ordering (TO) - Assigning timestamps to transactions, and controlling or checking access to data by timestamp order.

Other major concurrency control types that are utilized in conjunction with the methods above include:

* Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) - Increasing concurrency and performance by generating a new version of a database object each time the object is written, and allowing transactions&#x27; read operations of several last relevant versions (of each object) depending on scheduling method.
* Index concurrency control - Synchronizing access operations to indexes, rather than to user data. Specialized methods provide substantial performance gains.
* Private workspace model (Deferred update) - Each transaction maintains a private workspace for its accessed data, and its changed data become visible outside the transaction only upon its commit (e.g., Weikum and Vossen 2001). This model provides a different concurrency control behavior with benefits in many cases.

The most common mechanism type in database systems since their early days in the 1970s has been &quot;Strong strict Two-phase locking&quot; (SS2PL; also called &quot;Rigorous scheduling&quot; or &quot;Rigorous 2PL&quot;) which is a special case (variant) of Two-phase locking (2PL). It is pessimistic. In spite of its long name (for historical reasons) the idea of the SS2PL mechanism is simple: &quot;Release all locks applied by a transaction only after the transaction has ended.&quot; SS2PL (or Rigorousness) is also the name of the set of all schedules that can be generated by this mechanism, i.e., these SS2PL (or Rigorous) schedules have the SS2PL (or Rigorousness) property.

===Major goals of concurrency control mechanisms===
Concurrency control mechanisms firstly need to operate correctly, i.e., to maintain each transaction&#x27;s integrity rules (as related to concurrency; application-specific integrity rule are out of the scope here) while transactions are running concurrently, and thus the integrity of the entire transactional system. Correctness needs to be achieved with as good performance as possible. In addition, increasingly a need exists to operate effectively while transactions are distributed over processes, computers, and computer networks. Other subjects that may affect concurrency control are recovery and replication.

====Correctness====

=====Serializability=====
For correctness, a common major goal of most concurrency control mechanisms is generating schedules with the &quot;Serializability&quot; property. Without serializability undesirable phenomena may occur, e.g., money may disappear from accounts, or be generated from nowhere. Serializability of a schedule means equivalence (in the resulting database values) to some &quot;serial&quot; schedule with the same transactions (i.e., in which transactions are sequential with no overlap in time, and thus completely isolated from each other: No concurrent access by any two transactions to the same data is possible). Serializability is considered the highest level of isolation among database transactions, and the major correctness criterion for concurrent transactions. In some cases compromised, relaxed forms of serializability are allowed for better performance (e.g., the popular &quot;Snapshot isolation&quot; mechanism) or to meet availability requirements in highly distributed systems (see &quot;Eventual consistency&quot;), but only if application&#x27;s correctness is not violated by the relaxation (e.g., no relaxation is allowed for money transactions, since by relaxation money can disappear, or appear from nowhere).

Almost all implemented concurrency control mechanisms achieve serializability by providing &quot;Conflict serializability&quot;, a broad special case of serializability (i.e., it covers, enables most serializable schedules, and does not impose significant additional delay-causing constraints) which can be implemented efficiently.

=====Recoverability=====
:See &quot;Recoverability&quot; in &quot;Serializability&quot;

Concurrency control typically also ensures the &quot;Recoverability&quot; property of schedules for maintaining correctness in cases of aborted transactions (which can always happen for many reasons). Recoverability (from abort) means that no committed transaction in a schedule has read data written by an aborted transaction. Such data disappear from the database (upon the abort) and are parts of an incorrect database state. Reading such data violates the consistency rule of ACID. Unlike Serializability, Recoverability cannot be compromised, relaxed at any case, since any relaxation results in quick database integrity violation upon aborts. The major methods listed above provide serializability mechanisms. None of them in its general form automatically provides recoverability, and special considerations and mechanism enhancements are needed to support recoverability. A commonly utilized special case of recoverability is &quot;Strictness&quot;, which allows efficient database recovery from failure (but excludes optimistic implementations.

====Distribution====
With the fast technological development of computing the difference between local and distributed computing over low latency networks or buses is blurring. Thus the quite effective utilization of local techniques in such distributed environments is common, e.g., in computer clusters and multi-core processors. However the local techniques have their limitations and use multi-processes (or threads) supported by multi-processors (or multi-cores) to scale. This often turns transactions into distributed ones, if they themselves need to span multi-processes. In these cases most local concurrency control techniques do not scale well.

=====Recovery=====

All systems are prone to failures, and handling &quot;recovery&quot; from failure is a must. The properties of the generated schedules, which are dictated by the concurrency control mechanism, may affect the effectiveness and efficiency of recovery. For example, the Strictness property (mentioned in the section Recoverability above) is often desirable for an efficient recovery.

=====Replication=====

For high availability database objects are often &quot;replicated&quot;. Updates of replicas of a same database object need to be kept synchronized. This may affect the way concurrency control is done (e.g., Gray et al. 1996).

== Concurrency control in operating systems ==

Multitasking operating systems, especially real-time operating systems, need to maintain the illusion that all tasks running on top of them are all running at the same time, even though only one or a few tasks really are running at any given moment due to the limitations of the hardware the operating system is running on. Such multitasking is fairly simple when all tasks are independent from each other. However, when several tasks try to use the same resource, or when tasks try to share information, it can lead to confusion and inconsistency. The task of concurrent computing is to solve that problem. Some solutions involve &quot;locks&quot; similar to the locks used in databases, but they risk causing problems of their own such as deadlock. Other solutions are Non-blocking algorithms and Read-copy-update.

<text>The Pleurothallidinae are a neotropical subtribe of plants of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) including 29 genera in more than 4000 species.

Naturally occurring species of this subtribe are among the more popular orchids of horticulturalists, especially the genera &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Dryadella&quot;, &quot;Masdevallia&quot; and &quot;Restrepia&quot;.

The following genera are considered monophyletic : &quot;Barbosella&quot; (including &quot;Barbrodia&quot;), &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Dresslerella&quot;, &quot;Dryadella&quot;, &quot;Lepanthes&quot;, &quot;Masdevallia&quot;, &quot;Platystele&quot;, &quot;Porroglossum&quot;, &quot;Restrepia&quot;, &quot;Scaphosepalum&quot;, &quot;Trisetella&quot;, and &quot;Zootrophion&quot;.

Many genera in the Pleurothallidinae were found polyphyletic, for example species attributed to the genus &quot;Pleurothallis &quot;are scattered across five clades.

<doc id="217358" wikidata="Q170800" url="?curid=217358" title="Pedro Calderón de la Barca">
<text>Pedro Calderón de la Barca (17 January 160025 May 1681) (, ; ; full name: &quot;Pedro Calderón de la Barca y Barreda González de Henao Ruiz de Blasco y Riaño&quot;) was a Spanish dramatist, poet, and writer. He is known as one of the most distinguished poets and writers of the Spanish Golden Age, especially for the many verse dramas he wrote for the theatre. Calderón has been termed &quot;the Spanish Shakespeare&quot;, the national poet of Spain, and one of the greatest poets and playwrights in the history of world literature. 

Calderón de la Barca was born into the minor Spanish nobility in Madrid, where he lived for most of his life. He served as soldier and a knight of the military and religious Order of Santiago, but later became a Roman Catholic priest. His theatrical debut was a history play about the life of King Edward III of England, was first performed on 29 June 1623 at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid, during the surprise visit to Spain of Charles, Prince of Wales to negotiate for a dynastic marriage alliance with the Spanish Habsburgs. 

As he continued writing verse dramas, Calderón&#x27;s favorite theatrical genres included mystery plays illustrating the doctrines of Transubstantiation and the Real Presence for performance during the Feast of Corpus Christi and both comedy of intrigue and tragic theatre rooted in many of the same plot devices as Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and in ethical dilemmas under the Spanish nobility&#x27;s code of honour. Born while the unwritten rules of Spanish Golden Age theatre were still being defined by Lope de Vega, Calderón pushed their limits even further by introducing radical and pioneering innovations that are now termed metafiction and surrealism. 

His masterpiece, &quot;La Vida es Sueño&quot; (&quot;Life is a Dream&quot;), combines a beauty and the beast plotline, a disguised woman reminiscent of Viola from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, surrealist concepts, romantic complications, and the threat of a dynastic civil war, while exploring the philosophical question of whether each individual&#x27;s fate has already been written without their involvement or if the future can be altered by free will. 

Calderón&#x27;s poetry and plays have since wielded an enormous global influence upon Romanticism, symbolism, literary modernism, expressionism, dystopian science fiction, and even postmodernism. His many admirers have included August Wilhelm Schlegel, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, John Dryden, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Fr. Félix Sardà y Salvany, Hugo von Hoffmannsthal, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Jorge Luis Borges, Konstantin Stanislavsky, and Boris Pasternak. Furthermore, through the inter-mediation of Borges, Calderón de la Barca has also influenced Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;Inception&quot;. 

In 1881, the Royal Spanish Academy awarded a gold medal to Irish poet Denis Florence MacCarthy for his highly praised and accurate literary translations of Calderón&#x27;s verse dramas into English. In 2021, a renewed search for Calderón&#x27;s missing remains gained media attention worldwide.

==Biography==
Pedro Calderón de la Barca was born in Madrid on Friday 17 January 1600, and was baptized in the parish of San Martín. His father, Diego Calderón, was a mountain hidalgo with family origins in Viveda, Cantabria and had inherited his own father&#x27;s position of secretary of the Council and Chief Accounting Office of the Treasury, serving in it the Spanish Habsburg Kings Felipe II and Felipe III, died in 1615. The playwright&#x27;s mother, Ana Gonzalez de Henao (or Henaut, Hainaut), had family roots in the Spanish Netherlands and was of either Flemish or Walloon descent. According to James Fitzmaurice-Kelly, she claimed origin from the De Mons of Hainault. His parents married in 1595. Pedro was the third of the six children that the marriage produced (three boys and three girls), of whom only four survived childhood: Diego, the first-born; Dorotea — nun in Toledo—; Pedro and Jusepe or José. These brothers were always welcome, as Diego Calderón stated in his will (1647):

However, they also had a natural brother, Francisco, who hid under the surname of &quot;González&quot; and was expelled from the father&#x27;s house by Don Diego, although he left written in 1615 that he be recognized as legitimate unless he had married &quot;with that woman he tried to marry&quot;, in which case he would be disinherited.

His mother died when Calderón was ten years old, in 1610. Calderón was then educated at the Jesuit Collegio in Madrid, the Colegio Imperial, with a view to taking orders; but instead, he studied law at Salamanca.

Between 1620 and 1622 Calderón won several poetry contests in honor of the feast day of St. Isidore, the patron saint of Madrid. Calderón&#x27;s debut as a playwright was &quot;Amor, honor y poder&quot; (&quot;Love, honor, and power&quot;), about the life of King Edward III of England, was performed at the Royal Alcázar of Madrid during the visit of Charles, Prince of Wales to unsuccessfully negotiate for a dynastic marriage with &quot;Infanta&quot; Maria Anna of Spain, on 29 June 1623.

This was followed by two other plays that same year: &quot;La selva confusa&quot; and &quot;Los Macabeos&quot;. Over the next two decades, Calderón wrote more than 70 plays, the majority of which were secular dramas written for the commercial theatres.

Calderón served in the Spanish Royal Army in Italy and Flanders between 1625 and 1635. By the time Lope de Vega died in 1635, Calderón was recognized as the foremost Spanish dramatist of the age. Calderón had also gained considerable favour in the court, and in 1636–1637 he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago by Philip IV, who had already commissioned from him a series of spectacular plays for the royal theatre in the newly built Buen Retiro palace. On 28 May 1640 he joined a company of mounted cuirassiers recently raised by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, took part in the Catalan campaign, and distinguished himself by his gallantry at Tarragona. His health failing, Calderón retired from the army in November 1642, and three years later was awarded a special military pension in recognition of his services in the field.

Calderón&#x27;s biography during the next few years is obscure. His brother, Diego Calderón, died in 1647. A son, Pedro José, was born to Calderón and an unknown woman between 1647 and 1649; the mother died soon after. Calderón committed his son to the care of his nephew, José, son of Diego. Perhaps for reasons relating to these personal trials, Calderón became a tertiary of the order of St Francis in 1650, and then finally joined the priesthood. He was ordained in 1651 and served as a parish priest at San Salvador Church in Madrid, which was later demolished as part of the 19th-century Spanish confiscations. According to a statement Calderón made a year or two later, he decided to give up writing secular drama for the commercial theatres.

Though he did not adhere strictly to this resolution, he now wrote mostly mythological plays for the palace theatres, and &quot;autos sacramentales&quot;—one-act allegories illustrating the Real Presence in the Eucharist—for performance during the feast of Corpus Christi. In 1662, two of Calderón&#x27;s &quot;autos&quot;, &quot;Las órdenes militares&quot; and &quot;Mística y real Babilonia&quot;, were the subjects of an investigation by the Spanish Inquisition; the former was censored, its manuscripts confiscated, and it remained banned until 1671.

Even so, Calderón was appointed honorary chaplain to Philip IV in 1663, and continued as chaplain to his successor. In his eighty-first year he wrote his last secular play, &quot;Hado y Divisa de Leonido y Marfisa&quot;, in honor of Charles II&#x27;s marriage to Maria Luisa of Orléans.

Notwithstanding his position at court and his popularity throughout Spain, near the end of his life Calderón struggled with financial difficulties, but with the motivation of the Carnival of 1680 he wrote his last work of comedy, &quot;Hado y divisa de Leonido y de Marfisa&quot;. He died on 25 May 1681, leaving only partially complete the &quot;autos sacramentales&quot; that he had been working on for that year. His burial was austere and unembellished, as he desired in his will: &quot;Uncovered, as if I deserved to satisfy in part the public vanities of my poorly spent life&quot;. In this manner he left the theatres orphaned in which he was considered one of the best dramatic writers of his time.

==Style==
===Theatrical innovator===
Calderón initiated what has been called the second cycle of Spanish Golden Age theatre. Whereas his predecessor, Lope de Vega, pioneered the dramatic forms and genres of Spanish Golden Age theatre, Calderón polished and perfected them. Whereas Lope&#x27;s strength lay in the spontaneity and naturalness of his work, Calderón&#x27;s strength lay in his capacity for poetic beauty, dramatic structure and philosophical and theological depth. Calderón was a perfectionist who often revisited and reworked his plays, even long after they were first performed.

His perfectionism was not just limited to his own work: several of his plays adapt and reimagine existing plays or scenes by other dramatists, improving their depth, complexity, and unity. Calderón excelled above all others in the genre of the &quot;auto sacramental&quot;, in which he showed a seemingly inexhaustible capacity to giving new dramatic forms to a given set of theological and philosophical constructs. Calderón wrote 120 &quot;comedias&quot;, 80 &quot;autos sacramentales&quot; and 20 short comedic works called &quot;entremeses&quot;.

As Goethe notes, Calderón tended to take special care with the dramatic structures of his plays. He usually included fewer scenes than other contemporary playwrights (such as Lope de Vega) so as to avoid any superfluous distractions from the essential focus of the plays. He also worked towards a greater stylistic uniformity by reducing the number of different metres in his plays.

Calderón realized that any play was a work of fiction, and that the structure of the baroque play was entirely artificial. He therefore, probably influenced by Cervantes, made regular use of metafictional techniques, such as making his characters joke about the clichés they are expected to slavishly follow.

Most famously in his masterpiece, &quot;La Vida es Sueño&quot;, Calderón uses an astrological prophecy made decades before the beginning of the play as a way to deliberately mislead the audience about how the plot will unfold. Calderón intended to subtly defend the Catholic doctrine of free will against the Calvinist doctrine of predestination and to depict the unwritten nature of each individual&#x27;s future based on their choices.

Although his poetry and plays leaned towards culteranismo, Calderón usually reduced the level and obscurity of that style by avoiding metaphors and references that uneducated viewers would not understand. However, he had a great influence anyway in later centuries upon Symbolism, for example by making a fall from a horse a metaphor for a fall into disgrace or dishonour.

===Themes===
Some of the most common themes of his plays were heavily influenced by his Classical Christian education by the Jesuits. For example, as a reader and great admirer of Scholastic theologians Saint Thomas Aquinas and Francisco Suárez, Calderón liked to confront reason against emotion, intellect against instinct, love against vengeance, and understanding against the will.

This is not to say, however, that Calderón has never had his critics. In an article for the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia, Harvard University Professor Jeremiah Ford wrote, &quot;Were one to contrast Shakespeare with Lope de Vega, he would discover that, while Shakespeare belongs to all men and all time, Lope is the particular property of Spain, and is bounded by national limitations. The character of Calderón is even more limited still; he is not only Spanish rather than universal, but, as a Spaniard, he typifies the sentiments and ideals of a narrowly restricted period, the seventeenth century. It may be added that in his theatre and in his daily life he was a model of the truly Christian and knightly poet of his period. The ideas most distinctive of his age which we see reflected in Calderón&#x27;s dramatic works are intense devotion to the Catholic Faith; absolute and unquestioning loyalty to the Spanish sovereign; and a highly developed, even much exaggerated, feeling of honour.&quot;

According to Richard E. Chandler and Kessel Schwartz, it is vital to realize, that despite the end of the Reconquista in 1492 many elements of Islamic Spain rooted in Sharia Law still persisted among the Christian population during the lifetime of Calderón; &quot;One must understand the point of honor (&quot;pundonor&quot;) and resulting social complications to understand the theatre of Calderón, or, in fact, any of the Golden Age dramatists. A man&#x27;s honor was a touchy point, based primarily upon a highly refined sentiment of conjugal fidelity but extended to include a man&#x27;s daughters, married or unmarried, or any other woman in his household. Also, honor had to be kept inviolate -- an extremely difficult thing to accomplish -- and if sullied, had to be avenged. Arising from the Spaniard&#x27;s sense of personal dignity and his desire to protect his reputation, it became a matter of pride and self-respect to cleanse tarnished honor, which even gossip could blemish. All male members of the household were responsible for protecting the family&#x27;s name, and no honorable gentleman could leave family honor unavenged. In relationships between the sexes, the code of honor became especially sinister and led to the most barbarous cruelties. A husband was permitted to kill his wife if she was even suspected of infidelity, and her lover had to be murdered to avoid a scandal. Love was the great game, and the responsibilities of a household of an attractive woman was a terrible burden and source of worry for the husband or father. One bloody vengeance called for another, and bloody feuds raged through entire families. The ladies, especially those of Calderón and Tirso, were highly susceptible to risqué situations and quite unafraid to run the risk of a compromising and dishonoring one. Calderón was a court poet and was consequently versed in all the intricacies of the honor code.&quot;

Jeremiah Ford continued, &quot;The point of honour, often carried to morbid extremes, provides the motif in such characteristic pieces as the &quot;Alcade de Zalamea&quot;, the &quot;Pintor de su deshonra&quot;, the &quot;Médico de su honra&quot;, and &quot;A secreto agravio secreta venganza&quot;. The actuating principle in these works can hardly appeal to us; we can feel little sympathy with a personage who methodically and in cold blood slays the one by whom his honour has been affronted. For us such an action is a perversion of the ideals of chivalry.&quot;

In contrast, Alexander A. Parker has argued, in an article of his own for Encyclopedia Britannica, that Calderón was actually a very harsh moral critic of Spanish culture at the time in which he lived, &quot;Accepting the conventions of the comedy of intrigue, a favourite form on the Spanish stage, he used them for a fundamentally serious purpose. &quot;La dama duende&quot; (1629; &#x27;The Phantom Lady&#x27;) is a neat and lively example. In &quot;Casa con dos puertas, mala es de guardar&quot; (1629; &#x27;A House with Two Doors Is Difficult to Guard&#x27;), the intrigues of secret courtship and the disguises that it necessitates are so presented that the traditional seclusion of women on which these intrigues are based is shown to create social disorder by breeding enmity and endangering love and friendship. &quot;No siempre lo peor es cierto&quot; (c. 1640; &#x27;The Worst Is Not Always True&#x27;) and &quot;No hay cosa como callar&quot; (1639; &#x27;Silence Is Golden&#x27;) mark the peak of this development; although the conventions of comedy remain, the overtones are tragic. Both plays also implicitly criticize the accepted code of honour. Calderón’s rejection of the rigid assumptions of the code of honour is evident also in his tragedies. In the famous &quot;El alcalde de Zalamea&quot;, the secrecy and the vengeance demanded by the code are rejected. This play also presents a powerful contrast between the aristocracy and the people: the degeneration of the aristocratic ideal is exposed, wealth is associated with manual labour, and honour is shown to be the consequence and prerogative of moral integrity regardless of class.&quot;

According to Richard E. Chandler and Kessel Schwartz, &quot;&quot;El médico de su honra&quot; is the most extreme of his honor tragedies. It revolves around a point of honor and recounts how a husband, suspecting his wife of infidelity, causes her veins to be opened. She bleeds to death, washing his dishonor away with her blood.&quot; 

While acknowledging that the plot of the same play has caused Calderón&#x27;s humanity to be questioned, Alexander A. Parker has written, &quot;The critics who allege that he approves of the murder of an innocent wife because honour demands it overlook the fact that the horror one feels at this deed is precisely what he intended.&quot;

In common with many writers from the Spanish Golden Age, his plays usually show his vital pessimism, that is only softened by his rationalism and his faith in the Christian God; the anguish and distress usually found his &quot;œuvre&quot; is better exemplified in one of his most famous plays, &quot;La vida es sueño&quot; (&quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;), in which Segismundo claims:

===Comedy of Intrigue===
According to Richard E. Chandler and Kessel Schwartz, &quot;Calderón&#x27;s &#x27;cape and sword&#x27; plays represent the perfection of a type introduced by Lope. They illustrate the type carried to the extreme of its possibilities, with unbelievably complicated plots worked out with mathematical precision. Lovers&#x27; intrigues, honor complications, sudden appearances, and many other tricks and devices are resorted to by the playwright to complicate and then to disentangle the story. In these plays, as well as in the honor tragedies, Calderón, the most profoundly Spanish poet of his epoch, speaks so intimately to the passions and ideals of the time that he often lacks the little universality which his contemporaries achieved... Although he lacked the spontaneity and variety of the Phoenix, he frequently equaled him and at times surpassed him in sheer beauty of poetry with rapturous heights which even Lope could not equal. He was more profound and philosophical than Lope. He was an aristocratic poet and, unlike Lope, did not slavishly cater to the demands of the public. Lope was the improviser, Calderón was the planner.&quot;

===&quot;Autos Sacramentales&quot;===

Indeed, his themes tended to be complex and philosophical, and express complicated states of mind in a manner that few playwrights have been able to manage. Like Baltasar Gracián, Calderón favoured only the deepest human feelings and moral dilemmas.

Since Calderón&#x27;s plays were usually produced at the court of the King of Spain, he had access to the most modern techniques regarding scenography. He collaborated with Cosme Lotti in developing complex scenographies that were integrated in some of his plays, specially his most religious-themed ones such as the &quot;Autos Sacramentales&quot;, becoming extremely complex allegories of moral, philosophical and religious concepts.

According to Richard E. Chandler and Kessel Schwartz, &quot;As a writer of &quot;Autos Sacramentales&quot;, Calderón is supreme. The &quot;Auto&quot;, cultivated since the time of Gil Vicente, is a one act play, generally allegorical in nature, which at one time or another treats the miracle of Transubstantiation. &quot;Autos&quot; were performed in Spain&#x27;s large cities during the Corpus Christi festival in the open air on temporary stages set up in some public square. Everyone, including the royalty, attended the public performances, which followed the Processional of the Host through the streets to the church. Some believe that these short pieces represent the best of the Calderonian theatre where his fertile imagination had free rein and his sincere religious motives and faith found their purest expression.&quot;
According to Russian Symbolist poet and dramatic theorist Vyacheslav Ivanov, &quot;Let us take a look at drama, which in modern history has replaced the spectacles of universal and holy events as reflected in miniature and purely signifying forms on the stages of the mystery plays. We know that classical French tragedy is one of triumphs of the transformational , decisive idealistic principle. Calderón, however, is different. In him, everything is but a signification of the objective truth of Divine Providence, which governs human destiny. A pious son of the Spanish Church, he was able to combine all the daring of naive individualism with the most profound realism of the mystical contemplation of divine things.&quot;

==Legacy==

Calderón&#x27;s fame dwindled during the 18th-century due to the anti-religious currents of both the Bourbon Reforms and the Enlightenment in Spain and, in 1765, a law was passed forbidding the performance of &quot;Autos&quot; on the Feast of Corpus Christi, officially for being, &quot;sacrilegious and in bad taste.&quot;

Within mere decades, though, Calderón was rediscovered in the Germanosphere by highly influential Jena Romantic poet and Indologist August Wilhelm Schlegel. Schlegel&#x27;s literary translations and high critical praise rekindled interest in Calderón, who, along with Shakespeare, became a banner figure, first for German Romanticism, and then for Romanticism in many other countries and languages. E. T. A. Hoffmann based his 1807 singspiel &quot;Liebe und Eifersucht&quot; on a stage play by Calderón, &quot;La banda y la flor&quot; (&quot;The Scarf and the Flower&quot;), as translated by Schlegel. In subsequent decades, Calderón was repeatedly translated into German, most notably by Johann Diederich Gries and Joseph von Eichendorff, and had an enthusiastic reception on the German and Austrian stages, particularly under the direction of Goethe, and Joseph Schreyvogel. Later significant German-language adaptations include the work of highly influential Austrian Symbolist poet, metafictional playwright, and Richard Strauss&#x27; favorite opera librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal; who made literary translations of &quot;La vida es sueño&quot; and &quot;El gran teatro del mundo&quot;.

During the 19th century in his homeland, Calderón de la Barca was embraced by adherents of Carlism and other opponents of the 1798-1924 mass confiscation and sale of Church property by the State, the expulsion of the religious orders, the ban on Classical Christian education, and the many other anti-Catholic policies of Liberal Spanish monarchs and their ministers. In 1881, during a controversial gathering at El Retiro, an urban park on the site of the demolished Royal palace where many of his plays were first performed, on the two hundredth anniversary of Calderón&#x27;s death, Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo raised a toast to the religious values of Calderón&#x27;s Spain and the supremacy of the Latino race over &quot;Germanic barbarity&quot;, by which Menéndez Pelayo meant anti-Catholic Spanish Krausist and the Hegelianist intellectuals.

Félix Sardà y Salvany, the author of the book &quot;Liberalism Is a Sin&quot;, and his fellow integrists and Carlists considered Calderón de la Barca to embody the most brilliant incarnation of the Spanish Catholic literary tradition.

During the pre-1917 Silver Age of Russian Poetry, highly influential Russian Symbolist poet and dramatic theorist Vyacheslav Ivanov, who was heavily influenced by German Romanticism, was accordingly an enthusiast for Calderón. On 19 April 1910, Vsevolod Meyerhold even staged Konstantin Balmont&#x27;s literary translation of Calderón&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Holy Cross&quot; during the weekly literary salon held inside Ivanov&#x27;s flat overlooking the Tauride Palace in St Petersburg. Many of the most important figures in Russian literature at the time were either present or acting in the play.

Although he is best known abroad as the Nobel Prize-winning author of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, Soviet dissident intellectual and former Ivanov protege Boris Pasternak produced acclaimed Russian translations of Calderón&#x27;s plays during the late 1950s. According to his mistress, Olga Ivinskaya, In working on Calderón he received help from Nikolai Mikhailovich Liubumov, a shrewd and enlightened person who understood very well that all the mudslinging and commotion over the novel would be forgotten, but that there would always be a Pasternak. I took finished bits of the translation with me to Moscow, read them to Liubimov at Potapov Street, and then went back to Peredelkino, where I would tactfully ask [Boris Leonidovich] to change passages which, in Liubimov&#x27;s view departed too far from the original. Very soon after the &quot;scandal&quot; was over, [Boris Leonidovich] received a first payment for the work on Calderón.

Following the end of the Spanish Civil War, Calderón was embraced as a national poet by the Francoist government. This, however, has not harmed his popularity in Spain in the years since the transition back to constitutional monarchy.

===English===
The persistent influence of both anti-Catholicism and anti-Spanish sentiment rooted in the Black Legend still means that even the existence of the Spanish Golden Age, let alone its literary, artistic, and cultural achievements, remain widely unknown in the English-speaking world. Both this ignorance and its cultural fallout were criticized even during the Black Legend&#x27;s Elizabethan era inception by Sir Philip Sidney, whose 1580 essay &quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot; expressed very high praise for the verse dramas he had attended during diplomatic missions in France, Spain, and Italy. Playwrights in Catholic Europe during the Counter-Reformation had revived Aristotle&#x27;s three Classical unities and Sidney for these and many other reasons considered them vastly superior to all the plays then being written and performed in England.

Despite this, Calderón&#x27;s plays were first translated and performed in English during his lifetime. For instance, the diary of Stuart Restoration courtier Samuel Pepys describes attending stage plays in London during 1667 which were free translations from Calderón. During the same era, Calderón&#x27;s many emulators in writing for the English stage included Poet Laureate of England John Dryden.

Centuries later, like his German Romantic colleagues, English Romantic poet Lord Byron repeatedly referenced Calderón, whom he viewed as &quot;a romantic figure&quot;. Byron&#x27;s friend and fellow Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley similarly had very high praise in his essays for Calderón and personally translated a substantial portion of &quot;El Mágico prodigioso&quot;.

Despite this, in his essay &quot;A Defence of Poetry&quot;, Shelley, as a staunch and vocal believer in Atheism, feminism, and the rejection of Christian morality, also expressed very harsh criticism for Calderón&#x27;s religious beliefs and his regular decision to confront the human mind and conscience successfully against the emotions, &quot;Calderón, in his religious &quot;autos&quot;, has attempted to fulfill some of the high conditions of dramatic presentation neglected by Shakespeare; such as establishing a relation between drama and religion, and the accommodating them to music and dancing; but he admits the observation of conditions still more important, and more is lost than gained by the substitution of the rigidly defined and ever-repeated idealism of a distorted superstition for the living impersonations of the truth of human passion.&quot;

Later in the same essay, however, Shelley concluded, &quot;The exertions of Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire, Rousseau, and their disciples, in favor of oppressed and deluded humanity, are entitled to the gratitude of mankind. Yet it is easy to calculate the degree of moral and intellectual improvement which the world would have exhibited, had they never lived. A little more nonsense would have been talked for a century or two; and perhaps a few more men, women, and children burnt as heretics. We might not at this moment have been congratulating each other on the abolition of the Inquisition in Spain. But it exceeds all imagination to conceive what would have been the moral condition of the world if neither Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Calderón, Lord Bacon, nor Milton, had ever existed; if Raphael and Michelangelo had never been born; if the Hebrew poetry had never been translated; if a revival of the study of Greek literature had never taken place; if no monuments of ancient sculpture had been handed down to us; and if the poetry of the religion of the ancient world had been extinguished together with its belief. The human mind could never, except by the intervention of these excitements, have been awakened to the invention of the grosser sciences, and that application of analytical reasoning to the aberrations of society, which it is now attempted to exalt over the direct expression of the inventive and creative faculty itself.&quot;

The poetic and accurate Victorian era translations of Irish Catholic poet Denis Florence MacCarthy were commenced because MacCarthy was a great admirer of Shelley and therefore took the latter&#x27;s high critical praise of Calderón in multiple essays very seriously.

George Ticknor declared in his &quot;History of Spanish Literature&quot; that MacCarthy &quot;has succeeded in giving a faithful idea of what is grandest and most effective in [Calderón&#x27;s] genius... to a degree which I had previously thought impossible. Nothing, I think, in the English language will give us so true an impression of what is most characteristic of the Spanish drama, and of Spanish poetry generally.&quot;

So highly regarded were MacCarthy&#x27;s translations that in 1881, he was awarded a medal by the Royal Spanish Academy on the two-hundredth anniversary of Calderón&#x27;s death.

Other translators of Calderón&#x27;s works into English have included Edward FitzGerald, Roy Campbell, Edwin Honig, Kenneth Muir &amp; Ann L. Mackenzie, Adrian Mitchell, and Gwynne Edwards.

A recent revival of interest in Calderón scholarship can be attributed to British reception, namely through the works of A. A. Parker (who considered &quot;La hija del aire&quot; to be his finest work), A. E. Sloman and more recently Bruce Wardropper.

=== Comedies ===
For a time the comedic works of Calderón were underestimated, but have since been reevaluated and have been considered as masterfully composed works as being classified in the genre of &quot;comedias de enredo&quot;, such as his works &quot;La dama duende (The Phantom Lady), Casa con dos puertas, mala es de guardar (A house with two doors is difficult to guard), or El galán fantasma (The Heroic Phantom).&quot;

==In popular culture==
* The 1997 Alejandro Amenábar science fiction film &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, which was later remade in Hollywood as &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, has drawn many comparisons to Calderón&#x27;s &quot;La vida es Sueño&quot;.
* Calderón de la Barca appears in the 1998 Captain Alatriste novel &quot;The Sun over Breda&quot; by Arturo Pérez-Reverte, which takes up the assumption that he served in the Spanish Royal Army at Flanders and depicts him helping the local librarian save books from the library in the burning town hall during the sack of Oudkerk.

<doc id="217360" wikidata="Q634646" url="?curid=217360" title="Misplaced Childhood">
<text>Misplaced Childhood is the third studio album by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released in 1985. It is a concept album loosely based on the childhood of Marillion&#x27;s lead singer, Fish, who was inspired by a brief incident that occurred while he was under the influence of LSD.

The album was recorded during the spring of 1985 at Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin and produced by Chris Kimsey, who had previously worked with the Rolling Stones. &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; is the group&#x27;s most commercially successful album, peaking immediately at number one in the UK charts and spending a total of 41 weeks on the chart. It ultimately gained the Platinum status. It features Marillion&#x27;s two most successful singles, the guitar-led rock ballad &quot;Kayleigh&quot;, which reached number two in the UK, and piano-led &quot;Lavender&quot;, which peaked at number five.

&quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was listed as the sixth best album of 1985 by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and chosen as the fourth greatest concept album of all time by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2003.

==Concept==
&quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was Marillion&#x27;s first full concept album consisting of two continuous pieces of music on the two sides of the vinyl record. The story has thematic elements of lost love, sudden success, acceptance, and lost childhood, along with an upbeat ending. As Fish explains, he conceived the concept during a 10-hour acid trip.

Several of the songs and titles contain notable autobiographical references; for example, &quot;Kayleigh&quot; references the breakdown of relationships as a whole but is centered around Fish&#x27;s past girlfriend named Kay Lee. Fish came up with the name Kayleigh in order to obscure the original name due to the song being too personal. Another example is &quot;Heart of Lothian&quot; (&quot;I was born with the heart of Lothian&quot;) which is a reference to a traditional region of Scotland – Fish himself being from Midlothian – and a reference to the Heart of Midlothian (Royal Mile) – a mosaic heart in the pavement of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile.

The theme of childhood is developed in &quot;Lavender&quot;, which is partly based on the traditional folk song &quot;Lavender Blue&quot;. Like &quot;Kayleigh&quot; it is a love song, but whereas &quot;Kayleigh&quot; was about the failure of an adult relationship, &quot;Lavender&quot; recalls the innocence of childhood.

==Packaging and cover art==
Like &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; and &quot;Fugazi&quot;, the original vinyl edition of &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was released in a gatefold sleeve. The artwork was created by Mark Wilkinson who was commissioned to the role on all Marillion albums and 12&quot; singles of the Fish-era.

The front cover features a soldier drummer portrayed by Robert Mead, a then-ten-year-old boy who lived next door to Wilkinson. Mead also appeared on the artwork of the album&#x27;s three hit singles, &quot;Kayleigh&quot;, &quot;Lavender&quot;, and &quot;Heart of Lothian&quot;, and can be seen in the music video for &quot;Kayleigh&quot;. The Jester from the two previous studio albums is imagined escaping through the window on the back cover.

==Release==
&quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 17 June 1985 by EMI Records on LP, 12&quot; picture disc and cassette and went on to be the band&#x27;s biggest selling album. It topped the UK Albums Chart, becoming the first and the only Marillion album to do so. It stayed on the charts for 41 weeks, the longest chart residency of any of the band&#x27;s albums. &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was certified Platinum by the BPI for sales in excess of 300,000 copies on 26 November 1985 just five months after the release. It was the 20th best selling album in the United Kingdom in 1985.

The album was also highly successful across mainland Europe reaching number 3 in Germany, number 6 in Switzerland and the Netherlands, the latter of which is where Marillion have one of their largest fanbases, and number 10 in Norway. In the United States, &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; came out on the Capitol Records label and reached number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, the highest position the band has ever achieved.

Three singles, &quot;Kayleigh&quot;, &quot;Lavender&quot; and &quot;Heart of Lothian&quot;, were released, with the first preceding the album. &quot;Kayleigh&quot; peaked at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart, turning out to be the biggest hit for Marillion and prompting the success of &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;. The two further singles were less successful but still ended up at high positions as &quot;Lavender&quot; reached number 5 and &quot;Heart of Lothian&quot; peaked at number 29.

===Remastering and reissues===
As part of a series of Marillion&#x27;s first eight studio albums, EMI Records re-released &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; on 17 October 1998 with 24-bit digital remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus tracks. The remastered version was also made available without the bonus disc in 2000 and again in 2005 as a Japanese mini-LP replica.

A new 180g heavy weight vinyl pressing identical to the original 1985 edition was released in 2013.

On 21 July 2017, a deluxe edition of &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was released via Parlophone as a 4CD/Blu-ray set along with a 4LP boxed version. The deluxe edition includes a new remaster, as well as, on the Blu-ray disc, new high-resolution stereo and 5.1 surround remixes by Steven Wilson. The set also includes a previously unreleased 1985 concert from Utrecht featuring a performance of &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; in its entirety, along with demos and rarities.

==Reception==


John Franck of AllMusic gave the album a 4.5 star rating. He retrospectively said that &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was &quot;not only the band&#x27;s most accomplished release to date, but also its most streamlined... With its lush production and punchy mix, the album went on to become the band&#x27;s greatest commercial triumph, especially in Europe where they would rise from theater attraction to bona fide stadium royalty&quot;. In 2015, Ryan Reed of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; called the record &quot;the cornerstone of the entire &#x27;neo-prog&#x27; movement&quot;.

===Accolades===

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; listed the album the sixth best LP of 1985. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; fourth on its list of &quot;Rock&#x27;s 30 Greatest Concept Albums&quot; in 2003, and named it one of the top 10 essential progressive rock releases of the 1980s in 2016. In the special edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot; released by &quot;Q Classic&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot;, the album was ranked number 17 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;. In 2014, it was included in &quot;Rhythm&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;30 most influential prog drumming albums&quot; at number 16. The album is ranked at #20 on &quot;Prog Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Prog Albums of All Time&quot; list.

===Legacy===
&quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; was the inspiration for comedian Will Smith&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival Fringe show of the same name in 2005, which also led to a successful tour in 2006. In 2006, former Marillion lead singer Fish performed a 20th anniversary tour of &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;, and a 30th anniversary tour was performed in 2015. The album was played in full, and the albums &quot;Return to Childhood&quot; and &quot;Farewell to Childhood&quot; were released as documents respectively.

==Promotion and tour==

Marillion supported &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; with a one-year tour which began before the album was released. The band made two promotional appearances on BBC Television, firstly on the &quot;Wogan&quot; talk show on 20 May 1985 and then on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; three days later, in both cases showcasing &quot;Kayleigh&quot;. The tour consisted of European, Japanese and North American legs. In live performances preceding the album Fish claimed as a teaser that the next LP would consist of only two tracks, &quot;Side 1&quot; and &quot;Side 2&quot;.

==Track listing==

*Tracks 6–17 on the 1998 remastered edition bonus disc are &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; album demos, recorded in February 1985 and previously unreleased.

<doc id="217361" wikidata="Q602137" url="?curid=217361" title="Antonio García Gutiérrez">
<text>Antonio García Gutiérrez (4 October 1813 – 26 August 1884) was a Spanish Romantic dramatist.

==Biography==
After having studied medicine in his native town, García Gutiérrez moved to Madrid in 1833 and earned a meager living by translating plays of Eugène Scribe and Alexandre Dumas, père. Lacking success, he was on the point of enlisting when he suddenly sprang into fame as the author of a play called &quot;El trovador&quot; (&quot;The Troubadour&quot;), which was played for the first time on 1 March 1836. His next great success was &quot;Simón Bocanegra&quot;, in 1843.
His &quot;Poesías&quot; (1840) and another volume of lyrics, &quot;Luz y tinieblas&quot; (1842), are comparatively minor, but the versification of his plays, and his power of analysing feminine emotions, have given García Gutiérrez a leading position among the Spanish dramatists of the 19th century.

Although recognized as one of the leaders of the Romantic movement in Spain, his plays were not immediately lucrative, and García Gutiérrez emigrated to Spanish America, working as a journalist in Cuba and Mexico, until 1850, when he returned to Spain.

After his return to Spain in 1850, however, García Gutiérrez became known all over Europe through Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (1853), adapted from &quot;El trovador&quot;. Verdi then adapted &quot;Simón Bocanegra&quot; into the opera &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; (1857).

The best works of his later period are a &quot;zarzuela&quot; titled &quot;El grumete&quot; (1853), &quot;La venganza catalana&quot; (1864), and &quot;Juan Lorenzo&quot; (1865). García Gutiérrez became head of the archaeological museum at Madrid, the city where he died.

<text>The orchid genus Dracula, abbreviated as Drac in horticultural trade, consists of 118 species native to Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. The name &quot;Dracula&quot; literally means &quot;little dragon&quot;, an allusion to the mythical Count Dracula, a lead character in numerous vampire novels and films. The name was applied to the orchid because of the blood-red color of several of the species, and the strange aspect of the long spurs of the sepals.
The plants were once included in the genus &quot;Masdevallia&quot;, but became a separate genus in 1978. This genus has been placed in the subtribe Pleurothallidinae.

==Description==
They are epiphytic and terrestrial species distributed in Central America and the northwest Andes. Almost half the species are found in Ecuador. They prefer shade and rather cool temperatures.

These caespitose orchids grow in tufts from a short rhizome, with a dense pack of stems. They lack pseudobulbs. On each stem grows one large, thin, plicate leaf with a sharply defined midrib. These glabrous, light to dark green leaves may be spongy, taking over the function of the missing pseudobulb. They are tipped with a mucro (a short tip).

The flower stalks grow either horizontally from the base of the plant or descend, often for great distances. A few species grow upright flower stalks. The long-tailed terminal flowers are basically triangular. The flowers are borne singly or successively. Three species (sodiroi, decussata/neisseniae, and papillosa) may have up to three simultaneously open flowers on a single stalk. In general, though, if there is more than one flower bud on the raceme, they open up with long intervals. These flowers have a weird aspect, due to the long tails on each sepal. The petals are small and somewhat thickened. Quite commonly, various species of &quot;Dracula&quot; are known for blooms resembling the faces of primates, a notable example being &quot;Dracula simia&quot;. However, this likeness to monkeys’ faces seems to be purely a natural coincidence to the primates living in the same forests. In fact, these flowers are pollinated by the common fungus gnat; the bloom’s lip is often quite large (for a &quot;Pleurothallid&quot;), and from the fungus gnat’s perspective, resembles an irresistible mushroom or fungus. Research by biologists at the University of Oregon indicates that &quot;D. lafleurii&quot; also possesses a uniquely volatile chemistry, similar to localized species of mushrooms. This mimicry attracts mushroom-associated flies which play a role in pollination. The basal part of the lip (hypochile) is cleft. The terminal part (epichile) is rounded and concave. The margins of the perianth are often fringed. There is a well-developed column with two pollinia. 
== Taxonomy ==
The species of &quot;Dracula&quot; have tentatively been divided into three subgenera, with sections and subsections within one of the subgenera.
*Subgenus &quot;Dracula&quot; : This subgenus contains all the species of the genus except two exceptional species (&quot;D. sodiroi&quot; and &quot;D. xenos&quot;)

**Section &quot;Dodsonia&quot; : Four species: &quot;Dracula dodsonii&quot;, &quot;D. insolita&quot;, &quot;D. iricolor&quot;, &quot;D. portillae&quot;
**Section &quot;Dracula&quot; : largest section
***Subsection &quot;Costatae&quot; : e.g. &quot;Dracula bella&quot;, &quot;D. vespertilio&quot;
***Subsection &quot;Dracula&quot; :
****Series &quot;Dracula&quot; : e.g. &quot;Dracula chimaera&quot;, &quot;D. tubeana&quot;, &quot;D. vampira&quot;

<doc id="217364" wikidata="Q902567" url="?curid=217364" title="Brave (Marillion album)">
<text>Brave is the seventh studio album by Marillion, released in 1994. It charted at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart, being the last of the band&#x27;s albums to reach the Top 10 in the United Kingdom until &quot;F E A R&quot; reached number 4 in 2016. The album is ranked at #29 on &quot;Prog Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Prog Albums of All Time.&quot;

==Background==
After trying and failing to reach a wider audience with the more pop-oriented &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot;, Marillion decided to go back to their roots and make a more progressive-oriented album again.

Back in the mid-eighties, Steve Hogarth heard an appeal on behalf of the police on a local radio broadcast about a teen-aged girl found wandering alone on Severn Bridge in England. When she was found, she was either incapable of or decided not to communicate with anyone who questioned her. After a while, the police took the decision to make an appeal on radio to see if anyone could identify her. Eventually, the girl was reclaimed by her family and taken back home. Hogarth made a note of this and kept it aside for many years until Marillion began working on what would later become their &quot;Brave&quot; album.

The band had written two songs &quot;Living with the Big Lie&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; when he was reminded of the girl on the bridge and the shape of the album began to happen in his mind. &quot;Living with the Big Lie&quot; is a song about how people seem to get used to things to the point of being totally desensitized and &quot;Runaway&quot; catalogues the plight of a young girl attempting to escape a dysfunctional home. Hogarth told the story to the band and suggested how the songs could tie together in a fictitious tale of a life that has undergone problems and horrors such as sexual abuse (an increasingly reported theme in the media at the time), isolation, drug addiction and breakdown, to the point of considering/attempting suicide.

==Recording==

The band recruited Dave Meegan as producer, who had previously worked with them as an assistant engineer on &quot;Fugazi&quot; (1984). EMI wanted the band to do a &quot;quick record&quot; to gain some revenue, but this project progressively escalated, taking the band nine months to write and produce, partly because of Meegan who would go through &#x27;every single new tape made every day&#x27; each night listening for any riff or melody which sounded good enough to be included in the album. The album was written at the Racket Club, Buckinghamshire between April 1992 and January 1993 and recorded between February and September 1993.

The band relocated to Marouatte Castle in France for the duration of the recording of &quot;Brave&quot;. The influence of these surroundings can be heard throughout the album in a lot of haunting atmospherics. They even went into a cave which lay in the nearby area and taped some cave sounds which were used as background ambiance on the album. This recording concept was later used by Marillion&#x27;s EMI labelmates Radiohead for their &quot;OK Computer&quot; album. They spent three months in Marouatte in total, but in the summer, they decamped to Liverpool’s Parr Street Studio to continue recording. Marillion spent another four months in Parr Street on top of the three months they’d spent in Marouatte. The mixing of the album was finished at the Sarm West Studio in London.

==Release==

Three singles from the album were released: &quot;The Great Escape&quot; was only released in the Netherlands in January 1994. &quot;The Hollow Man&quot;, released in March 1994, reached No.30 in the UK, and &quot;Alone Again in the Lap of Luxury&quot;, released in April 1994, didn’t even make the Top 50.

The double-LP vinyl release of &quot;Brave&quot; features a double groove on the final side of the album, providing two endings to the story of this concept album. The first groove plays &quot;The Great Escape&quot; as heard on the CD, followed by &quot;Made Again&quot;, providing the happy ending; the second groove plays &quot;The Great Escape (Spiral Remake)&quot; and 7 minutes of water noise, providing the downer ending. &quot;The Great Escape (Spiral Remake)&quot; was later included as a bonus track on the remastered re-issue, along with one minute of the water noise.

Richard Stanley directed a 50-minute film version of &quot;Brave&quot; which was released 6 February 1995. This film takes the downer ending presented by the second double groove.

==Live==

The Brave World Tour started in Liverpool at the Royal Court Theatre on 20 February 1994, and ended with two shows in Mexico City in September. On the Brave World Tour, the band played their new album from start to finish, with Hogarth acting out characters from the songs. This involved putting on lipstick to play the girl herself in &#x27;Goodbye to All That&#x27;, tying his hair into pigtails, and two men in balaclavas dragging him off stage at the end of &#x27;Hard as Love&#x27;. Drummer Ian Mosley said in 2018, &quot;The atmosphere in the concert halls was, like, &#x27;Fucking hell, what&#x27;s all this?&#x27; When we came on and did the encore and played songs that weren&#x27;t from &quot;Brave&quot;, it was a completely different show. You could physically see people sigh with relief.&quot; They have revisited the whole album twice during the years, playing it in full in 2002 and again in 2013 at the Marillion Weekends.

==Critical reception==

The album, which mixed classic symphonic progressive rock with standard rock, was ranked by &quot;Raw&quot; as one of the 20 greatest albums of 1994. In 2000 it was selected by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; as one of the &quot;30 Best Albums of the 90s&quot;, and by the same publication in 2003 as one of &quot;Rock&#x27;s 30 Greatest Concept Albums&quot;.

&quot;We lost a lot of fans on &quot;Brave&quot;,&quot; said Hogarth in 2018. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t well received. Everybody now looks back and goes, &#x27;What a great album.&#x27; But nobody was saying that the day it came out.&quot; Rothery added, &quot;I think it needed at least a year or two after its release before people saw it for what it was.&quot;

==Formats and re-issues==
The album was originally released on cassette, double-vinyl LP and CD. In 1998, as part of a series of Marillion&#x27;s first eight studio albums, EMI re-released &quot;Brave&quot; with remastered sound and a second disc containing bonus material, listed above. The remastered edition was later also made available without the bonus disc.

A new 180 gram vinyl pressing was released in May 2013 by EMI. It was identical to the original vinyl release from 1994, and included the double-grooved Side 4.

Brave was reissued in 2018 as the second in a series of deluxe box set editions of the eight albums the band made for EMI between 1982 and 1995. It is available in 4CD/Blu-Ray and 5LP vinyl box set form, both issued by Parlophone / RHINO on 9 March. The CD/BD version includes both the original stereo mix, new stereo and 5.1 mixes, and the complete live performance from Paris in April 1994, previously partially released on Made Again, newly mixed by Michael Hunter. The vinyl set includes the new stereo mix and the Paris show recording. The re-mix was done by Steven Wilson, who is a good friend of the band.

<doc id="217365" wikidata="Q716636" url="?curid=217365" title="Mr. Burns">
<text>Charles Montgomery Plantagenet Schicklgruber &quot;Monty&quot; Burns, usually referred to as Mr. Burns or C. Montgomery Burns, is a recurring character and antagonist in the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, voiced initially by Christopher Collins and since by Harry Shearer. He is the mostly evil, devious, greedy, and wealthy owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and, by extension, Homer Simpson&#x27;s boss. He is assisted at almost all times by Waylon Smithers, his loyal and sycophantic aide, adviser, confidant, and secret admirer. He is between 81 and 120 years old, though sometimes it is implied he is much older.

Although originally conceived as a one-dimensional, recurring dastardly villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons&#x27; lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Mr. Burns&#x27;s popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a stereotype of corporate America in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power, inability to remember his employees&#x27; names (including Homer&#x27;s, despite frequent interactions—which has become a recurrent joke) and lack of concern for their safety and well-being. Reflecting on his advanced age, Mr. Burns is given to expressing dated humor, making references to Jazz Age popular culture, and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to everyday life. Conan O&#x27;Brien has called Mr. Burns his favorite character to write for, due to his arbitrarily old age and extreme wealth. 

Mr. Burns&#x27;s trademark expression is the word &quot;Excellent...&quot;, muttered slowly in a low, sinister voice while steepling his fingertips. He occasionally orders Smithers to &quot;release the hounds&quot;, so as to let his vicious guard dogs attack any intruders, enemies, or even invited guests. Mr. Burns is Springfield&#x27;s richest and most-powerful citizen (and also the richest person in Springfield&#x27;s state; his current net worth has been given as $1.3 billion by &quot;Forbes&quot;, though it fluctuates wildly depending on the episode). He uses his power and wealth to do whatever he wants, usually without regard for consequences and without interference from the authorities. These qualities led &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine to rate him the 45th-greatest villain of all time. &quot;TV Guide&quot; named him #2 in their 2013 list of the 60 nastiest villains of all time. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him #8 of their &quot;40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time&quot;.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
Mr. Burns spends his time in his office at the nuclear plant, monitoring his workers via closed-circuit cameras installed throughout the plant. In &quot;Double, Double, Boy in Trouble&quot;, Mr. Burns revealed that he was the youngest of a wealthy family, with eleven children, and all his siblings died of suspicious causes (mostly related to eating poisoned baked potatoes), leading to him receiving the entire family fortune, although another episode reveals that his surviving younger brother is George Burns. At an early age, Mr. Burns left his family to live with a twisted and heartless billionaire who owned an &quot;atom mill&quot; in Shelbyville (implied to be his grandfather). He lived a life of privilege and would amuse himself by injuring immigrant laborers. Mr. Burns later attended Yale University, where he studied science and business, joined Skull and Bones, competed in the &quot;etherweight&quot; wrestling class, and graduated in the class of 1914. At his 25-year college reunion, he became romantically involved with the daughter of an old flame. She would later bear his child, Larry Burns, who was placed for adoption and would later enter Mr. Burns&#x27;s life briefly. Mr. Burns has been engaged at least three times: to a woman named Gertrude who died of loneliness and rabies, to Marge Simpson&#x27;s mother Jacqueline Bouvier, and to a meter maid named Gloria.

He later enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as a member of Springfield&#x27;s Flying Hellfish squad under Master Sergeant Abraham Simpson and saw action in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge. During the war, Mr. Burns, Abraham Simpson (father of Homer Simpson and grandparent to Lisa, Bart, and Maggie Simpson) and some of the soldiers found an expensive portrait in a manor in Germany. They locked it in a case and stated the last surviving member would get the painting (he and Abraham tied when the owner&#x27;s descendant came back for the painting). Later on, he was shipped to the Pacific Theater and was a co-pilot along with Abe Simpson and his brother, Cyrus. Mr. Burns and Abe were shot down by a kamikaze and stuck on an island. Curiously, in the episode “American History X-cellent”, he is arrested for art theft, and while he is getting his belongings checked at the prison, a prison guard finds a card that he mistakes as a Social Security card. Burns then yells out “That’s just an SS card you dummkopf!” According to The Simpsons Wiki, after Germany had invaded Poland, he joined the SS but he later defected, and then he started service for the US Army. At the end of World War II, he was personally hired by President Harry S. Truman to transport a specially printed trillion-dollar bill to Europe as the United States&#x27; contribution to the reconstruction of Europe. As the United States&#x27; richest citizen, Mr. Burns was thought to be the most trustworthy. Mr. Burns absconded with the bill and kept it in his possession for many years until it was lost to Fidel Castro in &quot;The Trouble with Trillions&quot;. In &quot;Homer the Smithers&quot;, it is revealed that Mr. Burns&#x27;s mother is still alive aged 122 years, although Mr. Burns dislikes speaking to her because she had an affair with President William Howard Taft and she refers to him as an &quot;improvident lackwit&quot;. Furthermore, because she is so old, the only things she can do (according to Smithers) are pick up the phone, dial, and yell.

Mr. Burns resides in a vast, ornate mansion on an immense estate called &quot;Burns Manor&quot;, on the corner of Mammon and Croesus Streets. It is protected by a high wall, an electrified fence, and a pack of vicious attack dogs known as &quot;The Hounds&quot;. Mr. Burns routinely subjects Springfield and its residents to his abuse and there is a general dislike of him throughout the town. Mr. Burns has blackmailed and bribed various officials in Springfield, including Mayor Quimby and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He employed his wealth to make an ultimately unsuccessful run for governor to prevent his plant from being closed for safety violations, only to be denied his chance to be Governor by Marge Simpson. He once blocked out the sun to force Springfield residents to increase their use of electricity produced by his nuclear plant and was subsequently shot by Maggie when he tried to steal candy from her.

In &quot;Rosebud&quot; from Season 5, episode 4, his birthday is given as September 15. Mr. Burns&#x27;s extreme old age is a frequent source of humor on the show. He is occasionally referred to as &quot;Springfield&#x27;s oldest resident&quot;; in Season 2&#x27;s &quot;Simpson and Delilah&quot;, he told Homer that he is 81, although, in several later episodes, he is shown to be 104. When Smithers informs him that Mr. Burns&#x27;s credit card PIN is his age, he types four digits in his answer. It is also mentioned that half of his age is 78, making him 156 years old. When Lisa Simpson is researching her ancestors from the American Civil War, she comes across a Colonel Burns in the journal, presumably one of Mr. Burns&#x27;s earlier ancestors. However, when Lisa mentions him, Mr. Burns replies by saying that he has not heard his father&#x27;s name in years. The episode reveals that Mr. Burns&#x27;s father was a slaveowning Southern plantation owner who inspired the character Simon Legree from Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and that Homer and Grampa are descended from Colonel Burns&#x27;s runaway slave Virgil who fled to British Canada with Mabel Simpson on the Underground Railroad. In other episodes, Mr. Burns&#x27;s birthplace is apparently Pangea, his national anthem implies he was both from Austria-Hungary and unaware of its collapse in World War I, and he mentions the possibility of an update on the Siege of Khartoum, implying that he was aware of current events as early as 1884. In other episodes, he has instructed a postal clerk to send a telegram to the Prussian consulate in Siam via autogyro, and believes a nickel will buy &quot;a steak and kidney pie, a cup of coffee, a slice of cheesecake and a newsreel, with enough change left over to ride the trolley from Battery Park to the Polo Grounds.” Mr. Burns frequently answers the telephone with the archaic salutation &quot;Ahoy-hoy&quot;, which was proposed by Alexander Graham Bell, but has long since been superseded by &quot;Hello&quot;. In &quot;The Old Man and the Lisa&quot;, Mr. Burns&#x27;s investment portfolio is revealed to consist of long-defunct and obsolete companies such as &quot;Confederated Slave Holdings&quot;, and he learns about the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression for the first time after checking a very old stock-ticker.

Mr. Burns&#x27;s state of mind is the subject of frequent jokes on the show. At times, he appears to be completely removed from reality and modern conventions. He continually fails to recognize Homer Simpson or remember his name, even though many of the recent major events in Mr. Burns&#x27;s life have involved Homer in some way. Mr. Burns is, for the most part, unaware of the townspeople&#x27;s general dislike of him. He also displays mannerisms that are considered outdated, such as practicing phrenology, writing with a quill pen, and using an antique view camera to take photographs. He is also angered when Springfield Elementary children mock his dated car, saying it was &quot;the first car to outrun a man!&quot; Mr. Burns refers to many celebrities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the present tense, assuming they are still alive. In &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, Mr. Burns instructs Smithers to recruit dead-ball-era players, such as Honus Wagner and Cap Anson for the plant&#x27;s softball team, and has to be told that all of them died long ago. He also once rewarded Homer for being the first to arrive at work with a ticket to the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. However, despite his obvious senility and social ineptitude, Mr. Burns is an extraordinarily clever businessman, as he has lost his fortune several times, only to regain it a very brief time later. In the episode &quot;The Old Man and the Lisa&quot;, Mr. Burns loses his fortune and regains it by opening a recycling plant, which allows him to regain his nuclear power plant. Additionally, in the episode &quot;The Seemingly Never-Ending Story&quot;, Mr. Burns loses both his fortune and nuclear power plant to the Rich Texan after losing a scavenger hunt, but eventually gains both backs after a series of events that includes him briefly working at Moe&#x27;s Tavern.

Mr. Burns is physically weak and emaciated and is often shown to have little more strength than an infant. In &quot;The Mansion Family&quot;, doctors at the Mayo Clinic discover that Mr. Burns has contracted every known human disease, as well as several that were discovered during his checkup, but that they have canceled each other out in a condition they call &quot;Three Stooges syndrome;&quot; although a doctor warns him that his physical health is extremely fragile and that &quot;even a slight breeze&quot; could upset the balance between his diseases, Mr. Burns misinterprets his condition to believe that he is invincible. In the intro of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Mr. Burns is seen in his bathroom trying to brush his teeth. After Smithers applies the toothpaste onto his brush, he falls over. In &quot;Rosebud&quot; and &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, he needed a great deal of effort to wrench items from Maggie. He has difficulty performing such simple actions as giving a thumbs-up, and crushing an insect by stepping on it, or using a door-knocker. In one instance, when he is told to jump out of his burning mansion onto a life net, he drops at the speed of a feather, floats onto some power lines, and is electrified. He pitched the opening baseball at a game in &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot;, but was only able to throw it a small distance, which drew mocking laughter from the crowd. When Mr. Burns joined Homer&#x27;s bowling team in &quot;Team Homer&quot;, he was barely able to roll the ball down the lane. In season five&#x27;s &quot;Burns&#x27; Heir&quot;, Smithers puts a sponge on Mr. Burns&#x27;s head before leaving the bathroom, causing him to nearly drown in the tub from its weight. In &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;, however, he shows himself as a lively, excellent dancer.

Mr. Burns also had a teddy bear named &quot;Bobo&quot; that he loved as a child, revealed in the episode &quot;Rosebud&quot;. The stuffed animal was lost and eventually, the stuffed bear became a toy for Maggie. In &quot;American History X-cellent&quot;, Mr. Burns gets sent to jail because he is in possession of stolen paintings. In the same episode, it is implied that he was once in the SS. Another episode has him exclaim that though he and Oskar Schindler had much in common: &quot;We both made shells for the Nazis, but mine worked, damn it!&quot;

==Character==

===Creation===

Mr. Burns&#x27;s character, appearance, and mannerisms are based on several different people. The show&#x27;s creator Matt Groening principally based Mr. Burns on his high school teacher Mr. Bailey. Drawing further inspiration from oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller and his grandson David Rockefeller, Groening made Mr. Burns the &quot;embodiment of corporate greed&quot;. Animator David Silverman modeled Mr. Burns&#x27;s appearance on Fox founder Barry Diller, and modeled his body on a praying mantis. The idea of Mr. Burns reading employee names off cards in &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; came from an article about Ronald Reagan that writer Al Jean had read. In some episodes, parallels have been drawn between Mr. Burns and moguls such as Howard Hughes and, more frequently, fictional character Charles Foster Kane from &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Writer George Meyer lifted Mr. Burns&#x27;s &quot;Excellent!&quot; hand gesture from his former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; colleague Jim Downey. While perhaps not intentional, Mr. Burns&#x27;s physical characteristics and mannerisms are cited as a modern example of the commedia dell&#x27;arte character Pantalone.

Al Jean relieved on DVD commentary track Sam Simon used his father&#x27;s nickname, Monty, when he named Mr. Burns. Matt Groening claimed Mr. Burns&#x27;s middle name from a Montgomery Ward department store in Portland, Oregon&#x27;s Northwest Industrial district and his surname from Burnside Street, a main thoroughfare in Portland. Mr. Burns&#x27;s first name being Charles is a reference to Charles Foster Kane. The names Plantagenet and Schickelgruber appear to refer to the House of Plantagenet and Alois Schickelgruber, the father of Adolf Hitler. In the script for &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;, Al Jean and Mike Reiss referred to him as &quot;Mr. Meanie&quot;. In the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Mr. Burns&#x27;s relationship, and they often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition.

===Voice===

Mr. Burns was originally voiced by Christopher Collins in the episodes &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot; and &quot;The Telltale Head&quot;. He was soon replaced by Harry Shearer because Sam Simon found Collins &quot;difficult to work with&quot;. Shearer re-recorded Mr. Burns for all the above episodes and has voiced the character since.

Shearer modeled the voice on Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Shearer is also the voice of Smithers and is able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Shearer said he found Mr. Burns the most difficult character to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice. He said Mr. Burns was his favorite character: &quot;I like Mr. Burns because he is pure evil. A lot of evil people make the mistake of diluting it. Never adulterate your evil.&quot; In 2014, Shearer won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his performance on &quot;Four Regrettings and a Funeral&quot; for voicing Mr. Burns.

==Reception==
In 2006, &quot;Wizard&quot; rated Mr. Burns the 45th-greatest villain of all time. They also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being &quot;TV&#x27;s most functional dysfunctional couple&quot;. In a 2003 article, &quot;EW&quot; also named &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot; the greatest episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Other episodes which feature Mr. Burns placed on the list, including &quot;Rosebud&quot;, at number two, and the two-part episode &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, at number 25. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; placed &quot;Rosebud&quot; first on their list of the top 25 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes.

&quot;Forbes&quot; estimates Mr. Burns&#x27;s net worth at $1.3 billion, placing 12th on the 2008 &quot;Forbes Fictional 15&quot; list. Mr. Burns has been on the list since 1989 and has previously placed fifth in 2005, second in 2006 and sixth in 2007 when he was estimated to be worth $16.8 billion. Mr. Burns&#x27;s evil has made him a popular example of terrible television bosses. In 2006, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas released a report saying that Mr. Burns was one of the eight worst bosses on television. &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; named Mr. Burns the third worst boss, calling him &quot;heartless, greedy and exceptionally ugly, Mr. Burns makes Ebenezer Scrooge seem downright lovely.&quot;

In the run-up to the New York City&#x27;s 2009 mayoral election, several posters appeared throughout the city, showing Mr. Burns and accompanied by the words &quot;No Third Terms, Vote for Burns&quot;—a reference to Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s run for a third term that year—in the style of Shepard Fairey&#x27;s Obama poster. The city&#x27;s Board of Elections announced that December that Mr. Burns had received 27 write-in votes out of 299 write-in votes cast. As the chief of &quot;Springfield Republican Party&quot; Mr. Burns endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 US presidential election. The IG Group, a financial corporation in the City of London, use a recording of Mr. Burns&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Excellent&quot; as an alert that an order has been completed.

<text>The Liberals (, L), previously known as the Liberal People&#x27;s Party () until 22 November 2015, is a conservative-liberal political party in Sweden. The Liberals ideologically have shown a broad variety of liberal tendencies. Currently they are seen as following classical liberalism and economic liberalism, and have been described as being centre-right. The party is a member of the Liberal International and Renew Europe.

Historically, the party was positioned in the centre of the Swedish political landscape, willing to cooperate with both the political left and the right. It has since the leadership of Lars Leijonborg and Jan Björklund in the 2000s positioned itself more towards the right. It was a part of the Alliance centre-right coalition government led by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt from 2006 to 2014. The party&#x27;s policies include action toward a free market economy and pushing for Sweden to join the Eurozone, as well as investing in nuclear power; it also focuses on gender equality, the school system and quality education.

In February 2019, following the conclusion of government negotiations, Jan Björklund announced his intention to step down from the leadership position after 11 years at the helm of the Liberals. He was succeeded by Nyamko Sabuni in June 2019. After the 2021 Swedish government crisis, the party withdrew its support for Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, and is now part of a right-wing government together with the Moderate Party and the Christian Democrats, with support from the Sweden Democrats, with Ulf Kristersson as their Prime Minister candidate. In an interview with in February 2022, Sabuni stated that the Sweden Democrats will &quot;play an important role in an eventual right-wing government&quot; and that she would not be hesitant to work and collaborate with them, stating that there was a possibility of Liberals supporting a Moderate-Christian Democrats-Sweden Democrats government, even if the Liberals were not included in the government. Since the decision to collaborate with the Sweden Democrats, the party has adopted more right-wing populist viewpoints, such as a more restrictive migration policy, easier withdrawal of citizenship for immigrants, and has strongly criticised Muslim schools. The party ultimately agreed to join the Tidö Agreement and form a coalition government with the Christian Democrats and the Moderate Party, which rely closely on support from the Sweden Democrats.

==History==

* 1809: The first liberal party is formed after a coup d&#x27;état ends 20 years of royal autocracy under the Union and Security Act; it may be the first party in the world to use the word &quot;liberal&quot; in its name (This information needs to be verified with a citation. According to Bäck, Henry, Gissur Ó. Erlingsson and Torbjörn Larsson (2013.). &quot;Den svenska politiken: struktur, processer och resultat&quot; Stockholm: Liber, p. 49 a Liberal party was formed in the Parliament in 1900).
* 1902: The Free-minded National Association () is formed as the first liberal party with a national grassroots organisation. It is heavily reliant on the free church movement (Protestants outside Church of Sweden).
* 1910: After women become eligible to be elected to municipal councils in Sweden, suffragette Valborg Olander is elected to the Falun city council for the Liberal Party.
* 1923: The Free-minded National Association splits over alcohol prohibition; the anti-ban minority forms the Liberal Party of Sweden. The Free-minded would come to lead several governments during the coming years.
* 1934: The parties reconcile and form the People&#x27;s Party (), i.e. the party in its present form.
* 1939–45: It takes part in a wartime coalition government comprising all parties except the communists. Sweden remains neutral during the Second World War.
* 1976: It enters a three-party government ending 44 years of Social Democratic Party rule (excepting the wartime emergency grand coalition).
* 1978: The People&#x27;s Party forms a short-lived minority government by itself, with chairperson Ola Ullsten as prime minister. Hans Blix served as a foreign minister.
* 1979: A new attempt at a three-party coalition is made.
* 1980–82: It forms a two-party coalition government with the Centre Party.
* 1990: It adds &quot;Liberal&quot; to its name to become the Liberal People&#x27;s Party ().
* 1991–94: It forms part of a four-party centre-right coalition government under Moderate Party leader Carl Bildt.
* 2002: It more than doubles its vote share and comes close to being the second-largest party in Riksdag elections; party leader Lars Leijonborg fails to unite a green-liberal four-party coalition government with passive Moderate support.
* 2006–14: It forms part of the Alliance four-party centre-right coalition government under Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt.
* 2015: It changes its name from the Liberal People&#x27;s Party to the Liberals ().
* 2018: It, together with the Centre Party, voted down a proposed Moderate-Christian Democrat government led by Ulf Kristersson after concerns that such a government would be dependent on the Sweden Democrats for support.
* 2019: It, together with the Centre Party, voted to tolerate a Social Democratic-Green government led by Stefan Löfven after coming up with a 73-point agreement. Jan Björklund also announced he will step down as party leader and will not stand in the party&#x27;s autumn leadership contest.
*2021: After the 2021 Swedish government crisis, the party withdraw their support for Löfven, and now supports a centre-right government with Ulf Kristersson as Prime Minister.
*2022: In the parliamentary elections in September the party won 4.61% of votes and 16 places in the Swedish Parliament.
*2022: The party agrees to form a coalition government with the Christian Democrats and the Moderate Party, with support from the Sweden Democrats as part of the Tidö Agreement.

===2006 computer hacking scandal===
On 4 September 2006, only weeks before the 2006 general election, the Social Democratic Party reported to the police that its internal network had been hacked into. It has been reported that members of the then-named Liberal People&#x27;s Party had, in order to counter Social Democrat political propositions, on at least two occasions copied secret information that had not yet been officially released. On 5 September, Party Secretary Johan Jakobsson voluntarily chose to resign. Leading members of the party and its youth organisation both were placed under a police investigation, suspected for criminal activity. All members of the party were acquitted by the court; however, an official of the party&#x27;s youth organisation, and one from the Social Democrats as well as a newspaper reporter, were found guilty.

==Ideology==
The official party ideology has historically been social liberalism, which translates as a strong ideological commitment to a mixed economy, with support for comprehensive but market-based welfare state programs.

While initially allied with the Swedish Social Democratic Party in the struggle for democracy (achieved in 1921) and social reform, the People&#x27;s Party came to be part of the opposition from the thirties and onwards, opposing Social Democrat demands for nationalization of private businesses. It has stayed opposed to the Social Democrats ever since, often as the largest or second-largest party of the opposition block (called &quot;the non-socialists&quot; or &quot;de borgerliga&quot;, approximately &quot;the bourgeois&quot;), but often equally critical towards parties on the right. Over time, this has shifted towards a more clear-cut rightwing role. In the mid-nineties the party seemed to have ruled out the alternative of co-operation with the Social Democrats, focusing instead on bringing them down by strengthening the opposition.

Foreign policy is another high-profile issue. Always oriented towards the United States and the United Kingdom, the party was a strong opponent of Communism and Nazism during the 20th century. While it was part of and supported the Swedish coalition government and its position of neutrality during World War II, the party advocated an active stance against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The party (alongside &quot;Moderaterna&quot;) actively supported the struggle of the Baltic peoples against the Soviet regime, whereas Social Democrats were wary of irritating the Soviets. As a consequence, it suffered several sharply worded rebukes from the often-ruling Social Democrats for endangering Swedish relations with the Soviet Union. It also criticised what it perceived as Social Democrat tolerance of left-wing dictatorships in the third world, and supported the United States in the Vietnam War. After the end of the Cold War, it became the first Swedish party to call for abandoning the country&#x27;s traditional neutrality in favor of joining NATO.

Among issues concerning the developing world, the party supported decolonization and advocated boycotting South Africa to help overthrow apartheid rule. It also opposed third world Communist dictatorships. Nowadays it is strongly supportive of Israel, and former Party leader Per Ahlmark has been especially vocal on the issue.

On the European level, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party was strongly supportive of the emergence of the European Union and campaigned for Swedish entry into it (which happened in 1995). It also campaigned for joining the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, but this was voted down by the Swedes in a referendum in 2003. The party has aimed to come across as the most &quot;pro-European&quot; party, trying to break what it refers to as the country&#x27;s &quot;isolationist&quot; mindset. It is supportive of EU enlargement, including letting Turkey join on condition of democratic reforms, and also advocates further integrative measures, with some members, including the youth organization, openly calling for a single federal European state.

In 2003, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party supported the invasion of Iraq, but stopped short of demanding Swedish participation in the US-led &quot;coalition of the willing&quot;. In recent years, and especially under the leadership of Jan Björklund, the party has moved markedly towards conservative liberalism in its social attitudes, taking tougher stands on areas such as crime and punishment, law and order, school and discipline as well as strengthening its abolitionist policies on drugs. In 2008, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s support for a controversial legislative change regulating the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) in particular upset its youth organisation.

==Voter base==
=== Statistical changes in voter base ===
Historically the party had a strong base in the &#x27;free churches&#x27; (Protestant congregations not part of the state church that turned into powerful grassroots movements in the late 19th century), but with the exception of certain regions, that is not a significant feature today. Tensions between factions sometimes described as &quot;the free religionists&quot; and &quot;the metropolitan liberals&quot; (occasionally in the form of an open left-right conflict, with the &quot;free religious&quot; members emphasizing the social aspect over liberal economics) was an important part of party life until the seventies. It provoked a party split in the twenties, centred on the question of an alcohol ban, but differences were eventually repaired. (The re-merging of the parties in 1934 is one of the party&#x27;s plethora of official creation dates, some others being 1895, 1900 and 1902, providing frequent cause for anniversary celebrations.)

The party enjoys higher support among people above the age of 65, tending to be higher among people who have completed higher education. Its support is lowest among people with a pre-gymnasial education. The party&#x27;s voters are predominantly urban with more than 30% of L-voters residing in Metropolitan Stockholm. The party&#x27;s support is especially strong in affluent municipalities such as Danderyd, Lidingö and Lomma. According to Sveriges Television&#x27;s exit poll for the 2019 European parliament election, voters of the Liberals were the most likely to approve of Sweden&#x27;s EU membership. In September 2022, 84% of L-voters supported Sweden&#x27;s bid to join NATO.

<doc id="217367" wikidata="Q648396" url="?curid=217367" title="Hortensio Félix Paravicino">
<text>Hortensio Félix Paravicino y Arteaga (12 October 1580 – 12 December 1633) was a Spanish preacher and &quot;Culteranismo&quot; Baroque poet from the noble house of Pallavicini.

==Life==
He was born in Madrid and was educated at the Jesuit college in Ocaña, and on April 18, 1600 joined the Trinitarian Order. A sermon pronounced before Philip III at Salamanca in 1605 brought Paravicino into notice; he rose to high posts in his order, was entrusted with important foreign missions, became royal preacher in 1616, and on the death of Philip III in 1621 delivered a famous funeral oration which was the subject of acute controversy.

His (1638-1641) makes use of extravagant tropes and metaphors. His (1641) include his devout and secular poems, as well as a play entitled ; his verse, like his prose, shows the influence of Gongora, and were highly regarded in his lifetime. He was a great connoisseur of painting, but argued for the destruction of all paintings of nudes: &quot;the finest paintings are the greatest threat: burn the best of them&quot;. However these views were too extreme for even 17th century Spain, where the King and leading courtiers kept galleries of such works in relatively private rooms, and his piece on the subject was not published in the pamphlet for which it was written.

==In film==
Fernando Fernández de Córdoba played Paravicino in the 1947 historic drama &quot;Lady in Ermine&quot;.

<text>The Christian Democrats ( , KD) is a Christian democratic political party in Sweden founded in March 1964. It first entered parliament in 1985, through electoral cooperation with the Centre Party; in 1991, the party won seats on its own. The party leader since 25 April 2015 has been Ebba Busch. 

The party name was initially abbreviated to KDS (standing for , Christian Democratic Unity), from its foundation in 1964 to 1996, when the party changed its name to the current &quot;Christian Democrats&quot; and its abbreviation to &quot;KD&quot;.

The party was a minor party in centre-right coalition governments led by Moderate Party Prime Ministers Carl Bildt from 1991 to 1994 and Fredrik Reinfeldt from 2006 to 2014, with the latter under a formalised cooperation within the Alliance for Sweden. The party has been a minor party in the coalition government led by Moderate Party Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson since 2022, this time with Moderate Party and the Liberals with support from the Sweden Democrats.

The KD sits with the European People&#x27;s Party in the European Parliament, and is a member of Centrist Democrat International and International Democracy Union in which both contain other Christian democratic parties.

== Ideology ==
Ideologically, the KD is a centre-right Christian democratic party that during the last few years has shifted to the right and adopted more conservative policies. 

According to the party, their five most important policy issues include:

* Healthcare: reform the healthcare system and nationalise Swedish healthcare. Improve care guarantee. Reform the queue billion. Save supported living.
* Elderly care: retirement home guarantee as well as an abolished pensions tax. The KD also supports housing supplements for the elderly. The Christian Democrats especially emphasize the elderly&#x27;s right to a dignified life and want to introduce a higher standard for nursing homes.
* Safety: more police officers and more resources to the police. The party also supports law and order policies, such as increasing resources for the police and stricter laws against sexual crimes and honor killings.
* Family: enable more time for the children, facilitate family formation, increase families&#x27; room for maneuver, upgrade parenthood, enable different forms of childcare and strengthen the finances of families with children. The party supports freedom of choice of parents for education and increased resources for schools in vulnerable areas.
* Integration: according to the party, jobs are one of the keys to good integration and that a society is built on a common set of values, where certain values are immutable.

KD&#x27;s platform and policies have been shaped by the tenets of Christian democracy, stewardship, and the shared responsibility between the church and political institutions, the responsibility of solidarity towards fellow human beings and the safeguarding of civil society, permeated with socially and culturally conservative values.

The KD supports reducing petrol prices and abolishing the property tax. The KD also supports the monarchy.

The Christian Democrats want a flexible immigration policy, but one that is regulated and controlled. The party names a Nordic level when it comes to immigration, meaning the amount of refugees that enter Sweden should be at the same level as in the other Nordic countries. The KD also calls for a socially just but efficient asylum policy in which resources can be allocated to those in need in tandem with faster screening and quicker deportation of those who fail or abuse the asylum claiming processes, as well as increased spending on border patrol police. It also wants to introduce a special integration committee in the Riksdag and compulsory measures for refugees to learn Swedish and adopt Swedish customs and social norms. Since 2018, the party has pledged a tougher line against immigration and multiculturalism, including opposing the Islamic call to prayer in public spaces.

On foreign policy, the KD is largely supportive of Sweden&#x27;s membership of the European Union. They were in favour of entering the eurozone during the 2003 Swedish euro referendum, but after the “No” side won the referendum in a landslide victory the party changed its stance and are now against joining the eurozone. They are calling for &quot;a narrower and sharper EU&quot; and that &quot;on a number of issues, the EU need to take a step back and give more power back to the nation states”. 

== History ==

=== Background ===
The party had its roots in a movement against the Swedish government&#x27;s decision in 1963 to remove religious education from the elementary school syllabus. An organisation called &quot;Christian Social Responsibility&quot;, which would later become the Christian Democratic Unity, organised several marches against the decision, one of which became one of the largest in Swedish modern history. Despite the public outcry and over 2.1 million protest signatures, the decision went through. The group that had worked in the campaign felt it was a sign that Swedish politics needed a Christian Democratic Party.

The political and social origins of the Swedish Christian Democrats clearly differ from those of the European continental Christian Democratic parties (as in Italy or Germany). In those countries, Christian Democracy represented the mainstream of the social-conservative political forces and was closely tied to majoritarian religious practice. In Sweden, however, Christian Democracy emerged as a minority grouping amongst the centre-right forces and was tied to minority-religious tendencies in society (particularly among voters associated with the free churches and likeminded Lutherans).

=== Founding ===
In the beginning of 1964, Lewi Pethrus, founder of the Swedish Pentecostal movement and chief editor of the Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagen&quot;, discussed the idea of a Swedish Christian democratic party on the editorial pages of &quot;Dagen&quot;. He stated that many people had contacted him about the idea and that the current Swedish political climate was dominated by atheist economic materialism.

Principal Algot Tergel hosted a conference on 7 February of the same year. The topic of the conference was &quot;Christianity and Politics&quot;, and during the conference the idea of starting a Christian Democratic Party was discussed. A committee consisting of Pethrus and eight other Free Church leaders was formed.

A large and widespread debate followed the decision to create the committee. &quot;Dagen&quot; published an interview with Kjell Bondevik, the leader of the Norwegian Christian Democratic Party, and there were talks about creating a Christian Democratic Party in Finland as well.

On 20 March 1964, the party was founded as Christian Democratic Unity (). At first, it was only an organisation, but at a board meeting later that year it was decided that the organisation would be revamped into a party and that it would compete in the national elections in Sweden. The first roughly 100 members elected Birger Ekstedt to the post of party chair and Lewi Pethrus to the post of vice chair.

The party grew rapidly; by the end of the year, it had 14,500 members.

=== Early years ===
During its early years, the KDS was sometimes called the &quot;Air and Water&quot; party because of its strong emphasis on environmental politics. At that time the Green Party of Sweden did not exist, and thus the Christian Democratic Unity had a unique appeal with its environmentally friendly policies. In the Swedish national elections of 1964 the party gained 1.8% of the vote, not enough to get any seats in the Riksdag, but the party already had influence at the municipal level. In the municipal elections of 1966 the party gained 354 seats.

At this time, the established major parties of Sweden began discussing new ways of making it more difficult for minor parties to enter the Riksdag. The Riksdag was reformed in 1971; with this came the D&#x27;Hondt method of allocating seats. The electoral threshold was set at 4%, which meant that the wanted political breakthrough was far away now.

Birger Ekstedt died in 1972, aged 51, only a few days after having been reelected as the party chair. An emergency congress was called; there Alf Svensson, the relatively unknown chair of the youth wing of the party, was elected chair. Svensson was to become one of the most important figures in modern Swedish politics. In the national elections of 1973 the party gained 1.8% of the vote, the same result as in the two preceding elections.

Before the national elections of 1976, there was a strong call for a change to a right-wing government in Sweden. The organisation &quot;Vote right-wing&quot; was formed to promote the change to a right-wing government. The KDS, however, announced a desire not to be placed on the traditional right-wing/left-wing scale, a measurement system it felt was outdated. Therefore, the &quot;Vote right-wing&quot; organisation started a campaign of negative campaigning against the KDS with the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t vote for KDS, don&#x27;t throw away your vote&quot; as the KDS had not reached the 4% threshold at the last elections. The effect of this large campaign on a small and relatively new party like the KDS was disastrous, and it gained only 1.4% of the vote in the 1976 election.

At the start of the 1980s, the party revamped its entire political manifesto. The party abandoned its conservative stance on abortion and instead assumed a moderate pro-choice stance and adopted a plank to work to lower the total number of abortions in Sweden through encouragement of individual voluntary measures instead. In the 1980 nuclear power referendums the party supported the &quot;no&quot; campaign, which meant opposing any further construction of new nuclear power-plants in Sweden and advocating the phasing-out of all nuclear power plants in Sweden within 10 years, together with increased investments in renewable energy.

In 1982, the Christian Democratic Women&#x27;s League was founded, and the party gained 1.9% of the votes, for the first time getting more than 100,000 votes.

=== Way into the Riksdag ===
As early as 1978, the KDS discussed the idea of electoral cooperation with the Centre Party. Similar ideas were discussed before the 1982 elections but were never put into action. One of the proponents of such a collaboration was the then secretary of information Mats Odell. The party officially took a stance against a socialist government, which effectively put them together with the right-wing block.

The negotiations were difficult, but in 1984 the Centre Party and KDS agreed to run under a joint banner in the next year&#x27;s elections under the name (&quot;The Centre&quot;).

The deal, which was heavily criticised by the Swedish Social Democratic Party, meant that each party had its own voting ticket but that the Centre Party should nominate a Christian Democratic candidate on at least five of the regional candidacy lists. The Centre Party ticket would win over the KDS ticket almost everywhere, but this way there would be at least five Christian Democrats in the Riksdag. The Centre Party did not fulfil its promise, however, and put a Christian Democrat on the list only in the municipality of Kalmar. This resulted in great tensions within the Christian Democrats; one of the party icons, the environmental activist Björn Gillberg, left the party. However, Alf Svensson managed to get into the Riksdag through the KDS party ticket in Jönköping.

=== Real breakthrough ===
In 1987, the party manifesto was revamped once again (although not so heavily as the last time), and the party changed its name to Christian Democratic Social Party ( ), while keeping the KDS abbreviation. In the 1988 national elections the party grew significantly and gained 2.8% of the votes. But the Centre Party did not wish any further electoral cooperation, and Alf Svensson had to leave the Riksdag. Something had happened, however. The party was now recognised as one of the major parties in Sweden, and Svensson had become famous. According to many opinion polls, he was the most popular politician in the entire nation.

Several famous people joined the party, and in the right-wing breakthrough national elections of 1991 the party grew explosively yet again and gained over 7% of the votes. The right-wing bloc gained a majority, and KDS formed a government with the right-wing bloc. Several Christian Democrats got positions within the new government: Alf Svensson as the minister of foreign aid (and vice foreign minister), Inger Davidson as minister of civilian infrastructure, and Mats Odell as minister of communications.

After the right-wing bloc lost the 1994 general election, the KDS managed to stay in the Riksdag and had assumed a steady position within Swedish national politics. In 1996, it changed its name to the current form, Christian Democrats (&quot;Kristdemokraterna&quot;), switching the abbreviation form to KD, in a gesture perceived by elements both inside and outside the party as helping deflect the belief that it was a strictly religious party. In 1998 the party had its best elections ever, gaining over 11% of the votes; it established itself as the fourth-largest party in the Riksdag, becoming larger than its former electoral partner the Centre Party. In the 2002 national elections, the party got fewer votes but still held on to its position as the fourth-largest party.

In 2004, Svensson stepped down in favor of his long-designated successor Göran Hägglund.

At the end of 2005, the party had 24,202 confirmed members, making it the fourth-largest party in size as well. Its membership is far more stable than most parties in Sweden. The Christian Democrats are represented in almost every municipality and region in Sweden.

=== Criticism ===
The KD has previously held socially conservative views surrounding same sex marriage and in the early 2000s the party was criticized for being opposed to increased rights for homosexuals. In 2007, the KD mostly voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage in parliament, with party leader Göran Hägglund stating &quot;my position is that I have been tasked by the party to argue that marriage is for men and women. When we discuss it between parties we are naturally open and sensitive to each other&#x27;s arguments and we&#x27;ll see if we can find a line that allows us to come together.&quot; However, the party has since moderated its stance and now supports keeping same-sex marriage legal, albeit saying that churches should make the final decision on whether to perform wedding ceremonies and not the state, and in 2015 voted to change its platform in order to support same-sex adoption.

=== Alliance cabinet ===
As a member of the Alliance for Sweden, the winning side in the 2006 general election, the Christian Democrats got three minister posts in the Reinfeldt cabinet. The minister posts were held by Göran Hägglund, Mats Odell and Maria Larsson. Unlike the Moderate Party and the Liberal People&#x27;s Party, the Christian Democrats and the Centre Party avoided scandals for personal conduct and accusations for espionage against the competing Social Democratic Party.

Hägglund, however, received criticism internally for defending the party&#x27;s pro-choice stance on abortion, which some older members believed had contributed to the decline of the party in recent years. The Alliance cabinet&#x27;s stance against unemployment and sick-listed benefits have been criticised by former party leader Alf Svensson, while the Sven Otto Littorin of the Moderate Party went into aggressive counterattack, but the Christian Democratic ministers were silent.

=== Decline and internal strife ===
Support of the Christian Democrats significantly declined in the European elections of 2009, where the former party leader Alf Svensson got the party&#x27;s sole seat in the European Parliament at the expense of the party&#x27;s top candidate Ella Bohlin. Though Bohlin had run her campaign with a focus on limiting alcohol and outlawing traditional Swedish snuff, Göran Hägglund stated in a speech two weeks after the elections that he wanted to &quot;prohibit the prohibitions&quot; and spoke about the difference between the values of the &quot;people of reality&quot; and the left-wing cultural elite. Some claim that this was not followed up by any political suggestions in the 2010 general election, where the party declined once again. Hägglund was criticized for not being controversial enough by MP Ebba Busch, and it was suggested that around a quarter of the party&#x27;s representatives would like him to resign. Other commentators have suggested that the party&#x27;s decrease in support has coincided with the rise of the Sweden Democrats, who gained the support of socially and culturally conservative Swedish voters.

The politics of the Young Christian Democrats have shifted to the right in the past few years, a change that has been attributed to many conservative ex-members of the Moderate Party joining the organization. Swedish political news magazine &quot;Fokus&quot; has stated that the conflict on traditional Christian moral questions (abortion, gay rights, stem cell research) is secondary to the conflict between those who want a Christian democratic and centrist party focused on social responsibility in addition to environmental questions, and those who want a traditional right-wing party focusing on populism and economic liberalism. The latter group has founded a network called FFFF (Freedom, family, diligence and enterprise), a group that has clear influences coming from Thatcherism. Christian Democratic youth leader Aron Modig has stated that he wants the Christian Democrats to become the &quot;Tea Party&quot; of Sweden, and push the government when it fails to present a likeminded vision of society.

=== Election of Ebba Busch ===
In 2015, the young deputy Mayor of Uppsala Ebba Busch was elected as new party leader. She moved the party towards a new more right-wing and secular position. In the 2018 election she showed herself to be a fierce debater lifting her party from what had been predicted as a sure defeat to the best election result in nearly 20 years.

In 2019, after the new government was announced the KD harshly criticized the incoming government and the liberal parties supporting it. To create an alternative to the center-left government the KD opened up to cooperation with the Sweden Democrats This move was popular with the voters and during this period the party saw continually increased support in the opinion polls.

Ahead of the European election the party had reached 13% in the opinion polls, which if it would have been the election result would be the best result for the Christian Democracts ever. This passed after the election when the Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; posted an article showing the KD’s MEP Lars Adaktusson voting no to the expansion of abortion rights 22 times while he sat in the European Parliament between 2014 and 2019. The situation for the party worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic where, as in most other countries, smaller opposition parties saw a decrease whilst the governments strengthened their support.

==== 2022 election ====

Ahead of the 2022 election, the Christian Democrats continued the party&#x27;s turn to the right in a number of issues. In migration the party advocates a reduction in the number of refugees let into Sweden by 70%. The party&#x27;s youth wing, KDU, went out and caused a stir after they proposed repatriation of migrants that have come, and that are coming, to Sweden. Ahead of the &quot;Folk och Försvar&quot; conference in 2020 the party proposed a doubling of the Swedish Defence budget so that it would meet the 2% of GDP spending each year.

During the 2022 election campaign, the party tried to grow by attracting Sweden&#x27;s rural voters introducing new policies within the area as well as criticizing both the historically agrarian Centre Party and the Social Democrats, accusing them of having abandoned rural Sweden. The party also recruited former parliamentarian for the Centre Party, Staffan Danielsson and made him head of a party-associated organisation for farmers. Their opponents answered these attacks by calling the KD populist - criticising the use of anti-elitist rhetoric and for unhistorical references to a &quot;made up&quot; Swedish heartland.

The election was not a success for the Christian Democrats losing three MP:s. But as a part of the overall center-right coalition that Ebba Busch had been instrumental in creating the party joined the new Kristersson cabinet. The party received six ministerial portfolios and Ebba Busch was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister.

== Voter base ==
Historically, a large part of its voter base lays among those who belong to evangelical fellowships known in Sweden as &quot;free churches&quot; (Pentecostals, Methodists, Baptists, etc.) together with likeminded Lutherans (such as Göran Hägglund and Mats Odell). These churches have many followers in Småland and along the Swedish west coast, the regions in which the party is politically strongest. Important voter groups are senior citizens, families, voters in rural areas, members of free churches and citizens that belong to the upper middle class.

<text>The Centre Party ( , C) is a liberal political party in Sweden, founded in 1913.

The party focuses on the national economy, the environment, political decentralisation and social integration. It is represented in all of the Riksdag&#x27;s parliamentary committees, currently holding 24 seats. From 2019 to 2021, it provided confidence and supply to the Löfven II cabinet.

Traditionally part of the Nordic agrarian family of political parties, the Centre Party has increasingly switched focus towards economic liberalism, environmental protection, equality of the sexes and decentralisation of governmental authority. The party describes itself as liberal feminist, campaigning for policies which enhance gender equality on an individualist basis. Its environmental policies stress the importance of consent and voluntary action, including working with foresters and private landowners to promote biodiversity within a mutually agreeable framework.

The Centre Party has produced two prime ministers of Sweden, who served a total of three terms; Thorbjörn Fälldin was the last Centre Party prime minister, and held the post for a total of five years, from 1976 to 1978 and then again from 1979 to 1982. It is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Liberal International and Renew Europe. It was originally named the Farmers&#x27; League ( ; B).

== History ==
The party was founded in 1913 as the Farmers&#x27; League (, B). In 1922, it merged with the ( , JR), and adopted its current name in 1957. At that time, it had been the closest ally of the centre-left Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) for twenty-five years, and one of the SAP&#x27;s coalition partners between 1936 and 1945 as well as between 1951 and 1957. However, it later revised this strategy in order to establish a closer long-term alliance between the centre-right &quot;borgerlig&quot; (&quot;bourgeois&quot; or &quot;nonsocialist&quot;) parties that achieved power between 1976 and 1982 and between 1991 and 1994.

Thorbjörn Fälldin served as Leader of the Centre Party and Prime Minister of Sweden from 1976 until 1982, except for a short interregnum between 1978 and 1979 led by Liberal People&#x27;s Party leader Ola Ullsten. The Centre Party joined another centre-right government following the 1991 general election, led by Moderate Party leader Carl Bildt. During the leaderships of Maud Olofsson and Annie Lööf in the 2000s, the party positioned itself clearly on the political right as a small-business-friendly party, advocating market liberal policies and viewing the Social Democrats as its main opponent.

In 2005, the Centre Party the newspaper group it owned, Centertidningar AB, for 1.8 billion SEK, which made it the richest political party in the world at the time. In 2022, Annie Lööf resigned her position as Leader of the Centre Party.

== Ideology and political position ==
The Centre Party sits on the centre-right of the political spectrum. The party has also described as economically liberal, and &quot;ecological-liberal&quot;. It describes itself as a green-liberal and libertarian party, while it has been traditionally associated with agrarianism and the Nordic agrarian party family.

=== National economy ===
The party has been described as one of Sweden&#x27;s most market liberal parties in liberal, socialist and conservative media. It describes itself as &quot;a party with a green, social and decentralised liberalism&quot;. The party advocates lower taxes, greatly reduced employer contributions, a freer market and an increased . The party is a major supporter of the interests of small businesses, farmers and entrepreneurs. It also favours investments in infrastructure and transportation, to allow employees to work in bigger cities but still live in the rural areas and vice versa. On economic policy, it views the Social Democrats and the Sweden Democrats as its opponents, though it supported a government led by the Social Democrats till 2022.

=== Immigration ===
The party is liberal on immigration, seeking to combine a generous immigration policy with an initially more restrictive contribution policy to the immigrants. After the European migrant crisis, the party proposed to replace the existing establishment grants with establishment loans, similar to the Swedish student loans.

The balance of the state responsibility of accepting refugees with their responsibility for integration into Swedish society is at the core of the party policy. In January 2016, the party for example proposed to give all immigrants compulsory civic education in both rights and expectations from the society.

=== European Union ===
The party is a decentralist pro-European party that considers the European Union important for the preservation of peace, freedom and trade in Europe. The party also advocates a smaller but sharper European Union focused on promoting democracy, peace, free movement, free trade, vigorous action against climate change and collaboration against organized crime, while also believing that Sweden should stay outside the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and keep the krona as its currency.

The party is a member of the ALDE Party and its affiliated European Parliament group Renew Europe. In the European Committee of the Regions, the Centre Party sits with the Renew Europe CoR group with one full and one alternate member for the 2020-2025 mandate.

== Publications ==
The Centre Party owned a media consortium called Centertidningar AB. It included newspapers that the party had either started on their own or brought from competitors. It included &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot;, &quot;Södermanlands Nyheter&quot;, &quot;Länstidningen i Södertälje&quot;, &quot;Nynäshamns Posten&quot;, &quot;Norrtelje Tidning&quot;, &quot;Lidingö Tidning&quot;, &quot;Ljusdalsposten&quot;, &quot;Östersunds-Posten&quot;, &quot;Hälsingekuriren&quot; and &quot;Hudiksvalls Tidning&quot;. The consortium was split in 2005 and sold to Mittmedia, Stampen Group and VLT for a total of 1.815 billion Swedish kronor.

== Election results ==

=== Riksdag ===
=== European Parliament ===
== Voter base ==

Traditionally, most of the party&#x27;s voters come from rural areas and include farmers and agricultural producers. Since the takeover of Maud Olofsson in recent years, the party has been attracting liberal voters from urban areas in central Sweden. It is believed that voters from the Liberals have been moving to the Centre Party due to changes in both parties.

== Leaders of the Centre Party ==
The Leader of the Centre Party is its highest political and organisational officer, its president in the National Executive Board and representative of the party in the media, in public and with other parties. The party leader has often held an important cabinet portfolio when the party has been part of a coalition.

<text>The Snowdon Mountain Railway (SMR; ) is a narrow gauge rack-and-pinion mountain railway in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. It is a tourist railway that travels for from Llanberis to the summit of Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales. A return journey, including the stop at the summit, takes 2½ hours. 

The SMR is the only public rack-and-pinion railway in the United Kingdom, and after more than 100 years of operation it remains a popular tourist attraction, carrying more than 140,000 passengers annually. The line is owned and operated by Heritage Great Britain, operators of several other tourist attractions in the United Kingdom.

The railway is operated in some of the harshest weather conditions in Britain, with services curtailed from reaching the summit in bad weather and remaining closed during the winter from November to mid-March. Single carriage trains are pushed up the mountain by either steam locomotives or diesel locomotives. It has also previously used diesel railcars as multiple units.

The traditional logo for the railway includes a pinion ring engaged on a rack bar, representing the rack railway technology used by the line.

==History==

===Construction===

The idea of a railway to the summit of Snowdon was first proposed in 1869, when Llanberis was linked to Caernarfon by the London &amp; North Western Railway. In 1871 a Bill was put before Parliament, applying for powers of compulsory purchase for a railway to the summit, but it was opposed by the local landowner, Assheton-Smith of the Vaynol Estate, who thought that a railway would spoil the scenery.

For two decades nothing happened, and Assheton-Smith remained opposed to any plans. However, in 1893 the Rhyd Ddu terminus of the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways was renamed Snowdon, attracting many of the tourists who previously visited Llanberis and affecting the livelihoods of the accommodation providers who were Assheton-Smith tenants.

After much persuasion, Assheton-Smith ultimately gave his assent to the construction of a railway to the summit, and though still the principal landowner in the area, he was not a major influence in the company. However, no Act of Parliament was now required, as the line was built entirely on private land obtained by the company, without any need for the power of compulsory purchase. This was unusual for a passenger-carrying railway, and also meant that the railway did not come under the jurisdiction of the Board of Trade.

The railway was constructed between December 1894, when the first sod was cut by Enid Assheton-Smith (after whom locomotive No. 2 was named), and February 1896, at a total cost of £63,800 (equivalent to £ in ). The engineers for the railway were Sir Douglas Fox and Andrew Fox of London, and the contractors were Messrs Holme and King of Liverpool.

By April 1895 the earthworks were 50% complete, a sign of the effort put into the construction work as much as of the lack of major earthworks along much of the route.
All tracklaying had to start from one end of the line, to ensure the rack was correctly aligned; so although the first locomotives were delivered in July 1895 very little track was laid until August, when the two large viaducts between Llanberis and Waterfall were completed. Progress up the mountain was then quite rapid, with the locomotives being used to move materials as required. Despite the harsh climate the first train reached the summit in January 1896. As the fencing and signals were not then ready, the opening was set for Easter.

The line was opened at Easter 1896. In anticipation of this, Colonel Sir Francis Marindin from the Board of Trade was asked by Fox to make an unofficial inspection of the line on Friday 27 March. This included a demonstration of the automatic brakes. He declared himself satisfied with the line, but recommended that the wind speed be monitored and recorded, and that trains stopped when the wind was too strong.

On Saturday 4 April, a train was run by the contractor consisting of a locomotive and two coaches. On the upper section, the descending train hit a boulder that had fallen from the side of a cutting and several wheels were derailed. The workmen on the train were able to rerail the carriage and the train continued.

===Opening day accident===
The railway was officially opened on Monday 6 April 1896, and two trains were dispatched to the summit. On the first return trip down the mountain, possibly due to the weight of the train, locomotive No. 1 &quot;L.A.D.A.S.&quot; with two carriages lost the rack and ran out of control. The locomotive derailed and fell down the mountain. A passenger died from loss of blood after jumping from the carriage. After a miscommunication the second downward train hit the carriages of the first, with no fatalities.

An inquiry concluded that the accident had been triggered by post-construction settlement, compounded by excess speed due to the weight of the train. As a result of the inquiry&#x27;s recommendations the maximum allowed train weight was reduced to the equivalent of 1½ carriages, leading to lighter carriages being bought and used on two-carriage trains. A gripper system was also installed on the rack railway.

===Pre-war===

The railway reopened to Hebron on Saturday 26 September 1896. On 9 April 1897 the line re-opened to Clogwyn. By June the trains were again reaching the summit. This time there were no incidents and the train service continued.

On 30 July 1906 a wagon broke loose and ran into a train, injuring one passenger, the driver and guard. Traffic was suspended for several hours.

In 1910 there were reports of vandalism on the line. A man named William Morris Griffiths who had climbed Snowdon to see the sunrise, placed a stone on the rail and sitting on it, slid down the track at speed. Someone put a boulder on the line behind him and pushed it down, and it struck Griffiths in the back, he somersaulted off the line and died a few hours later. The manager of the railway also reported that crowds of visitors were breaking down fences, pulling up gradient posts, throwing down wires and interfering with the railway bed.

In 1936 it was reported that the railway carried 30,000 people to the summit during the season.

Passengers were still carried during the Second World War. The &quot;Western Mail&quot; for 12 May 1943 reported that two trains per day would operate from Llanberis (at 1.15pm and 4.00pm) and people could still book to stay at the summit hotel. However, this appears to have been just propaganda, as the summit was closed for military purposes from 1942 until the end of the war.

===Post-war===
Normal service resumed in 1946. The shortage of coal led to the railway attempting to burn old army boots as fuel. The British Railways Llanberis–Caernarvon line closed to passengers in 1962. In 1983, the summit buildings were transferred to the ownership of Gwynedd County Council. A share issue was made in 1985, primarily to raise money to purchase the first two diesel locomotives. Between 1986 and 1992 the railway company was involved with the airfield and aviation museum in Caernarvon.

===Centenary===

As part of the centenary celebrations the railway held an enthusiasts&#x27; weekend in September 1996. This was one of the few occasions when the public were allowed to visit the railway&#x27;s workshops. Scrap pinion rings were also sold as (rather large) souvenirs. From this time the locomotives were painted in differing liveries, but by 2005 this practice had ended.

===Summit building project===
In 2006 the Snowdon summit café was demolished and construction of a new visitor centre was started. While this construction was taking place passenger trains terminated at Clogwyn, but the line and a works train was still used to transport workers and materials to the project. On some days, however, the train could not reach the summit and the workers had to walk down to Rocky Valley. The new building, &quot; (loosely translated from Welsh as &quot;), was officially opened by First Minister Rhodri Morgan on 12 June 2009.

===Rescue work===
In 2015, after the coastguard rescue helicopter was unable to reach the summit, the railway was used to carry mountain rescue teams to the summit of Snowdon to rescue a 17-year-old girl who had collapsed due to an asthma attack while sheltering from wind gusting up to . The railway was then used to carry the girl and rescuers to the foot of the mountain, where she was transferred to an ambulance.

==Route==
The lowland terminus is Llanberis station, at the side of the main road, a short walk from the site of the Llanberis terminus station of the railway from Caernarvon which closed in 1962. The railway is a single track line with passing loops. It is long, with an average gradient of 1 in 7.86 (12.7%). The steepest gradient is 1 in 5.5 (18.2%), and this occurs in a number of places. The railway rises a total of , from above sea level at Llanberis to at Summit station.
==Operation==
The Llanberis complex also houses the company offices, locomotive shed and workshop building. The forecourt has recently been changed from a visitor car park into a café and picnic area.

===Train control===

Traffic and train movements are controlled from Llanberis: communication between Llanberis, Clogwyn and the Summit, as well as to trains&#x27; guards, is by two-way radio.

The line has three passing loops, around 15 minutes travelling time apart. Going up the mountain, these are at Hebron, Halfway and Clogwyn stations. The operation of the Hebron and Halfway loops was converted to semi-automatic operation in the early 1990s. The Clogwyn loop is still staffed and retains the original mechanical point levers. Waterfall station had a siding but never a loop, and has been closed for many years.

All three passing loop tracks are on the southwest side of the main running line – this is in general the downhill side, where the mountain slopes away from the line. This means that, if required, the line could be easily be converted to double track without the need to cut into the rock face to widen the formation.

Including stops at the passing loops, the train takes an hour to climb to the summit and an hour to descend again, at an average speed of around .

Passenger trains normally run from Llanberis to the Summit. The wind speed is measured at Clogwyn Station and used to determine if trains can continue to the summit. Trains terminate at Rocky Valley Halt when the weather is too bad to allow them to proceed safely to the summit.

It is possible for two trains to run together on sight, which involves the second train following shortly (more than two minutes but less than five) after the first, and keeping a safe distance throughout the journey. This is known as a &quot;doubler&quot;. All platforms and passing loops are long enough to accommodate two trains.

The two Llanberis platforms are dedicated, one for arrivals and the other for departures. Arriving trains empty of passengers then shunt to the other platform. At the Summit station arriving trains generally alternate between the two platforms.

When steam and diesel trains run together, it is normal for the diesel to lead up the mountain. This allows the steam train to enter the departure platform and load at its leisure, while the diesel moves across from the arrival platform from a quick turn-around.

Locomotives spend the whole day with the same carriage. Any locomotive can work with any carriage, although carriage No. 10 (the most modern) until 2012 usually ran with a diesel locomotive.

In 2013 four new carriages, which seat 74 passengers instead of 56 (as in the old ones), entered service. They work together with the four diesel locomotives and thus form four identical trains.

=== Steam versus diesel ===
For steam-hauled trains, the Llanberis shunt movement includes a trip to the water crane and coaling stage outside the locomotive shed. At Halfway Station steam locomotives also take water from a water crane, fed from a large tank located just above the station. For emergency use another large water tank is situated near Clogwyn Station which can feed two water cranes.

The diesel locomotives are used on the normal trains, with the steam locomotives being used on higher-priced Heritage Steam trains. On arrival at Llanberis, diesel-hauled trains run directly from the arrival platform to the departure platform, load and depart at the scheduled time. Steam-hauled trains take at least half an hour to transfer from the arrival to the departure platform, thus making no more than one trip every three hours.

The use of diesel locomotives therefore allows more trains to be run with the same number of carriages. By using diesels, the reduction in costs for both operating trains over the line and having them standing between infrequent runs has allowed the operating season to be extended considerably.

It is stated by the management that the vast majority of passengers do not care whether the trains are powered by steam or diesel locomotives. In the late 1980s comparative figures for the diesels against steam locomotives made it clear that they made economic sense.

==Technology==
===Rack rail===

The line is built to 800 mm gauge ( gauge), a gauge it has in common with several rack railways in Switzerland. The rails are fastened to steel sleepers. The line uses the Abt rack system devised by Roman Abt, a Swiss locomotive engineer. The system comprises a length of toothed rail (the &quot;rack&quot;) between the running rails which meshes with a toothed wheel (the &quot;pinion&quot;) mounted on each rail vehicle&#x27;s driving axle. These pinions provide all the traction and braking effort, and the vehicle&#x27;s wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles and serve only for support and guidance.

===Train formation===
For safety, train formations consist of one locomotive pushing a single carriage up the mountain and leading it down again while the locomotive brakes allow a controlled descent. (On opening, the usual practice was to have a locomotive pushing two coaches; this was changed in 1923.) The carriage is not coupled to the locomotive, as gravity keeps the two in contact.

==Rolling stock==

The company has owned a total of eight steam locomotives, five diesel locomotives and three diesel railcars.

===History===

When the railway was being planned, only the Swiss had significant experience in building rack locomotives, so it was they who won the contract to build the engines for the line. In comparison with some Swiss railways the line is not very steep, and this is reflected in the design of the engines, which are all classified 0-4-2T. The boilers of the locomotives are set at an angle of 9°, to keep the water level over the tubes when the locomotive is ascending the mountain.

Built specially for the line in 1895 and 1896, Nos. 1 to 5 were manufactured by the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works of Winterthur. The first locomotives cost £1,525 (equivalent to £ in ). Nos. 1 to 3 were delivered before the line was open and used on construction work. On at least two occasions, trials have been made on oil burners on Nos. 2 to 5, the latest being on No. 2 in the late 1990s.

For most of the time, the railway&#x27;s steam locomotives have burnt coal. The requirement for the locomotives to have a hot fire burning efficiently for a solid hour has led to problems when best Welsh steam coal has not been readily available. During 1978 Nos. 2 and 8 ran with oil burners. To hold the fuel oil, a tank was fitted to the roof of each locomotive. The tanks were thin and followed the profile of the roof. In 2000, No. 2 was again fitted with an oil burner in an attempt avoid the increasing problems of obtaining suitable coal.

In 1922–23 a further three locomotives were delivered, becoming Nos. 6 to 8. Although similar to the first engines in terms of size and power, they have a different design. Again all were built by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works of Winterthur.

When the boilers of Nos. 7 and 8 needed replacing they were withdrawn from service in 1990 and 1992 respectively, but no new boilers were bought. This is probably due to the extra expense of superheaters, and to the reduced need for steam locomotives after the introduction of the diesels. Neither is likely to run in the foreseeable future.

The railway first thought of using a diesel locomotive in the early 1970s, when a small four-wheeled diesel-mechanical locomotive built by Ruston &amp; Hornsby (their class 48DL) was bought second-hand from a quarry. It was intended to regauge it and use it as a yard shunter at Llanberis. It was sold to the Llanberis Lake Railway in 1978 without being regauged or used on the SMR. It would have been the railway&#x27;s only locomotive without pinions, and as such would have been of limited use – it is doubtful if it would have had sufficient grip on the grease covered rails to shunt a dead steam locomotive. This locomotive has since been dismantled and scrapped.

It was the mid-1980s before any effort was made to obtain a diesel locomotive that could work trains up the line. Between 1986 and 1992, four diesel locomotives were bought from the Hunslet Engine Company of Leeds, to a design and specification jointly developed with the railway. These became Nos. 9 to 12. During the period between the building of No. 9 and No. 12, both the locomotive manufacturer and the diesel engine manufacturer changed their names – Hunslet becoming Hunslet-Barclay, and Rolls-Royce diesel engines being sold to Perkins.

In 1995 three identical railcars built by HPE Tredegar (successor to Hugh Phillips Engineering) were delivered. These were designed to run as either two- or three-car multiple unit trains. When all three were coupled together, they were the maximum length of a train that could fit into the platforms and passing loops.

===List of motive power===
====Steam locomotives No. 1 to No. 5====

The boilers are inclined on the locomotives, to ensure that the boiler tubes and the firebox remain submerged when on the gradient, a standard practice on mountain railways – the locomotive always runs chimney-first up the mountain. The water gauges (gauge glasses) are mounted half at the centre on the locomotive so that the water level does not change with the gradient. One result of the boiler&#x27;s angle is that the Firehole door is at waist height, requiring the fireman to lift the coal some distance. The boiler is not superheated. Water is carried in tanks that run the full length of the boiler, but not all this water is for use in the boiler. The tanks are in fact divided into two sections, the smaller front section holding water that is used for cooling when the engine is running downhill. The drive to the wheels is through a series of levers that allow the pistons to have a longer stroke than the cranks. This is another common feature in mountain railways.

====Steam locomotives No. 6 to No. 8====

The boilers of these engines are fitted with superheaters, making them more efficient, and in place of a lever-type regulator they have a wheel that must be turned times between closed and fully open. The drive from the cylinders and to the wheels again uses levers, but in a different pattern. The linkage is fitted within double frames at the front of the locomotive. This results in a locomotive that is far more rigid. The side tanks are arranged vertically just in front of the cab. No. 6 carries the same amount of water as the earlier engines, but Nos. 7 and 8 carry enough water to get to the top of the mountain without stopping, if required. There is no separate tank for cooling water as it is drawn from the boiler on these engines.

====Diesel locomotives No. 9 to No. 12====
The design specifically includes features for safety, reliability and appearance. In place of cardan shaft drives to the wheels, coupling rods were used to give people something to watch and engine covers were omitted to give a good view of the Rolls-Royce diesel engines. The full-length canopy above the engine covers not only adds to the distinctive outline but also supports the exhaust silencer. For added safety with only one man in the cab, a dead-man device is included, a pedal that when released triggers the braking system to bring the train safely to a halt. The turbocharged six-cylinder engine is rated at and drives through a hydraulic transmission that has only one drive ratio. The result is a locomotive that accelerates quickly up to speed. All four locomotives were rebuilt in 2012–13 in readiness for the launch of the new &quot;traditional diesel&quot; service.

====Railcars No. 21 to No. 23====

The railcars were diesel-electric, using a standard industrial generator set mounted at the downhill end of each vehicle. This powered an induction motor through electronic controllers. The generators had a Cummins engine rated at which was run at a constant 1800 rpm and produced 440 V AC at 60 Hz. Unlike any other train on the system, the driver sat at the front when climbing the mountain.

For safety reasons the railcars could not be run as single vehicles since they each had only one set of pinions. No. 21 had to be taken out of service by 2001 owing to problems with the speed control mechanism, and Nos. 22 and 23 were taken out of service in 2003 for the same reason. The railcars were finally taken away for scrap in July 2010.

====Hybrid locomotives====

On 13 August 2019, the railway announced that it had ordered two new battery-diesel hybrid locomotives from Clayton Equipment for introduction at the start of the railway&#x27;s 2020 season, at a cost of £1.1 million. The intention was that the diesel generator on the new locomotives would be switched off on the downhill runs, with regenerative service braking used to recharge the battery to provide power for the next ascent. This method of operation meant that the locomotives&#x27; engines, which comply with Euro V emission standards, could be less powerful than those on the existing locomotives, thus providing maintenance and fuel savings, quieter operation, and lower emissions.

It was announced in February 2020 that the new locomotives were due to enter passenger service in May 2020. However, the launch was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 both were returned to Clayton Equipment, having been deemed unsuitable for the SMR, by not generating sufficient energy when descending.

===Passenger coaches===

All passenger coaches were withdrawn from service at the end of the 2012 season. With the exception of Coach 10 (the latest built), their bodies were dismantled and the frames and bogies were stored off-site. The railway now operates two services, depending on the motive power:

====Traditional diesel service====
Garmendale Engineering Ltd was commissioned to build four brand new coaches for the 2013 season which are used exclusively with the diesel locomotives. These coaches can transport 74 passengers. The coaches have been named: &quot;Sir David Brailsford CBE&quot;, &quot;Bryn Terfel CBE&quot;, &quot;Katherine Jenkins OBE&quot; and &quot;Dame Shirley Bassey&quot;, the last of these being named on 17 May 2018 at a ceremony attended by the singer.

====Heritage steam experience====
A new body was built on the original frames and bogies of Coach 2 by Garmendale Engineering Ltd to resemble an original coach from 1895. Named the &quot;Snowdon Lily,&quot; the coach entered service in 2013. This coach only carries 34 passengers and has a central aisle. It is used exclusively with one of the operational steam locomotives and attracts a higher fare. The steam service proved successful and a second heritage coach was built, using the frames and bogies of Coach 5. The &quot;Snowdon Mountain Goat&quot; arrived at the railway on 15 April 2015 and entered service following running in trials.

== Liveries ==
None of the contemporary reports on the railway refer to liveries but in coloured picture postcards and lantern slides the locomotives appear to be black. Red lining was introduced in 1933. On the back of a photograph of No 2 taken in 1942, the photographer noted that it was painted green; and colour transparencies taken in the 1950s show them in dark green. A lighter pea green was introduced in 1960. From 1995 until 2000 they were painted in a variety of colours according to crew preference. From 2000 a standard green livery was adopted.

Originally, the carriages were open-bodied and were probably a dark brown in colour. They were painted red, grey, green and orange in the 1930s. After the 1939-45 war the carriage bodies were enclosed, one at a time, on a platform at Llanberis. Originally painted brown, a livery of crimson and cream was introduced in 1960.

Until 1998 the diesels were an overall mid-green colour. It was decided that the warning colour on the coupling section would be striped red and white, with the crank axles an overall red colour. The diesels&#x27; colouring was later changed: &quot;Yeti&quot;, for example, adopted a red livery, and &quot;George&quot; a purple one. The warning colours also changed several times until around 2004, when all the diesels again received a green livery, with yellow and black warning colours. Painted green from 2000, they were painted black from 2013.

==Opening day accident==
===First train===

The public opening was on Monday 6 April 1896. A train was run from Llanberis to the summit to check that no more boulders had come loose; it is thought the locomotive was No. 2 &quot;Enid&quot;. On its return to Llanberis, locomotive No. 1 &quot;Ladas&quot; departed with two carriages on the official first train. Shortly afterwards, No. 2 &quot;Enid&quot; departed with a second public train. All went well on the ascent, except that mist and cloud was covering the top of the mountain and extending down to about the level of Clogwyn Station.

At a little after noon, &quot;Ladas&quot; with the two carriages started back down the mountain. About above Clogwyn, where the line runs on a shelf formed across a steep drop, the locomotive jumped off the rack rail, losing all braking force and accelerating down the track. At first it remained on the running rail and the driver tried to apply the handbrake, but with no effect. Realising that the train was out of control, the driver and his fireman jumped from the footplate.

&quot;Ladas&quot; ran about after losing the rack rail before hitting a left-hand curve. Here it derailed and fell over the side of the mountain. The two carriages accelerated to a speed at which the automatic brakes were triggered (). These brakes brought both carriages to a stand safely. One of the passengers, Ellis Griffith Roberts of Llanberis, on seeing the driver and fireman jump from the locomotive, did likewise. Falling to the ground, he sustained a serious injury to his leg, which later had to be amputated, and he died.

===Second train===

In derailing, locomotive No. 1 had broken the telegraph lines used to signal between stations. Some versions say that the wires had touched as they were hit and made a signal that was mistaken for the &#x27;line clear&#x27; signal, while other versions say that so long a time had passed that the people at the summit assumed that the telegraph system had failed. Whichever is true, the other train left the summit on its descent.

In spite of the line speed and a man being sent back up the line to warn the second train, it did not stop before reaching the point where No.1 had lost the rack rail; exactly the same thing happened, with No. 2 losing the rack rail and accelerating out of control. This time, however, the line was blocked by the carriages of the first train; No. 2 hit these with some force, causing the carriages of the first train to drag their brakes and run away down the line, and causing the locomotive to drop back onto the rack rail and stop safely. The carriages from the first train rolled down the line to Clogwyn station, where they became derailed.

Locomotive No. 1 was recovered and taken back to Llanberis.

===Inquiry===
It was revealed during the inquiry that the locomotive on a ballast train had lost the rack in January 1895 a little lower down the line. Details are not recorded, but it is likely that the locomotive dropped back onto the rack and was not badly damaged.

After hearing all the evidence, it was decided that the weather had caused a freeze–thaw action which had led to settlement in the ground. Another contributory factor was the construction work being carried out during poor weather, and then not being checked for settlement when the weather had improved. The settlement was sufficient to twist the tracks and reduce the contact between the rack (on the track) and the pinion (on the locomotive). The weight and speed of the train did the rest. The damage caused by the first derailment made the second almost inevitable.

===Recommendations===
The first recommendation was that the maximum load for the locomotives be reduced to the equivalent of carriages. These led to a further carriage being bought that was smaller and lighter than the others. From then onward, only this carriage was used, with one of the originals, for two-carriage trains.

The second recommendation was that a gripper system be installed (see Gripper rail). This required extra rails to be added to the rack rail and a mechanism to be fitted to the locomotives and carriages.

<doc id="217373" wikidata="Q213451" url="?curid=217373" title="Green Party (Sweden)">
<text>The Green Party (, , MP), commonly referred to as in Swedish, is a political party in Sweden based on green politics.

Sparked by the anti-nuclear power movement following the 1980 nuclear power referendum, the party was founded in 1981 out of a discontent with the existing parties&#x27; environmental policies. In the 1988 general election they won seats in the Swedish Riksdag for the first time, capturing 5.5 percent of the vote, and becoming the first new party to enter parliament in seventy years. Three years later, they dropped back below the 4 percent threshold.

In 1994, they returned to parliament again and since have retained representation there. The party is represented nationally by two spokespeople, always one man and one woman. These roles are currently held by Amanda Lind and Daniel Helldén.

Between 3 October 2014 and 30 November 2021, the Green Party was a part of the Social Democratic-led government. This was the first time the Greens have entered government in their history. The Greens left the government after the right-wing opposition parties&#x27; budget for 2022 was passed in the Riksdag, and the government&#x27;s own budget failed to pass.

In the 2018 general election, the Greens received 4.4% of the vote and 16 seats, making the party the smallest in the Riksdag. Despite this, the party was still able to maintain its place in government.

==Ideology==

===Fundamental principles===
In their party platform, the Greens describe their ideology as being based on &quot;a solidarity that can be expressed in three ways: solidarity with animals, nature, and the ecological system&quot;, &quot;solidarity with coming generations&quot;, and &quot;solidarity with all of the world&#x27;s people&quot;. A Green analysis of society is based on a holistic vieweverything is connected and interdependent.

The platform then describes these solidarities being expressed in &quot;several fundamental ideas&quot;, these being participatory democracy, ecological wisdom, social justice, children&#x27;s rights, circular economy, global justice, nonviolence, equality and feminism, animal rights, self-reliance and self-administration, freedom, and long-sightedness. The Swedish Green Party has its roots in the environmental, solidarity, women&#x27;s rights and peace movements.

=== Climate change and the environment ===
The Green Party was the first political party in Sweden to raise the issue of climate change. Fighting climate change is a major policy issue for the party. For example, the party&#x27;s main criticism of The Alliance&#x27;s 2010 election manifesto was the &quot;entirely astonishing&quot; lack of effort in fighting climate change, and in 2013, the party announced a budget proposal that was dominated by a &quot;climate package&quot;. The party supports a general shift in taxation policy, towards high taxes on environmentally unfriendly or unsustainable products and activities, hoping to thus influence people&#x27;s behavior towards the more sustainable.

=== Nuclear power ===
The anti-nuclear movement was a major factor in the party&#x27;s creation. The party&#x27;s party platform reads that &quot;we oppose the construction of new reactors in Sweden, or an increase in the output of existing reactors, and instead want to begin immediately phasing out nuclear power.&quot; MP Per Bolund clarified in 2010 that the party &quot;does not propose shutting down nuclear power reactors today, but rather phasing them out as new and renewable electricity is phased in.&quot;

=== European integration ===
The party was initially opposed to membership in the European Union, and sought a new referendum on the issue. The party&#x27;s EU opposition captured them 17 percent of the votes in the 1995 European Parliament election, the first following Sweden’s EU accession. The Greens included withdrawal from the EU in their party platform as recently as 2006.

This policy was abolished in a September 2008 internal party referendum. However, the party remains somewhat Eurosceptic. The section of the party platform on the subject opens by citing how decentralization and making decisions as locally as reasonably possible is a central part of green politics. It continues to state that the Greens &quot;are warm adherents to international cooperation. We want to see Europe as a part of a world of democracies, where people move freely over borders, and where people and countries trade and cooperate with each other.&quot;

=== Symbol ===
The Green Party&#x27;s party symbol is the dandelion.

== Leadership and organisation ==
The Greens, like many other green parties around the world, do not have a party leader in the traditional sense. The party is represented by two spokespeople, always one male and one female. The current spokespersons are Amanda Lind and Daniel Helldén. The spokespeople are elected annually by the party congress, up to a maximum of nine consecutive one-year terms.

The party congress, consisting of elected representatives of all of the party&#x27;s local groups, is the highest decision-making organ in the Green Party. The congress, in addition to the two spokespeople, also fills many other important posts in the party, including a party board (), which is the party&#x27;s highest decision-making authority between party congresses, and the day-to-day operation of the party&#x27;s national organisation. The congress also elects a party secretary (), who is an internal, organisational leader for the party. The current party secretary, initially elected by the 2021 party congress, is .

== Criticism ==

=== Scandal involving Islamic extremism ===
The Green Party was hit by a political scandal in April 2016, as images emerged of Green Party housing minister Mehmet Kaplan attending a dinner party alongside leading members of the Turkish far-right extremist group Grey Wolves. Following attention to comments made by Kaplan in 2009 comparing Israel to Nazi Germany, Kaplan resigned as minister, while still defended by the party leadership. During a seminar in 2014, Kaplan equalized jihadists who travel to Syria with Swedish volunteers who fought on the Finnish side against the Soviet Union during the Winter War 1939-1940. Kaplan later defended himself as being misunderstood and said he is against &quot;young Swedes traveling to the war in Syria&quot;. After his resignation, images emerged of Kaplan and other members of the Green Party displaying hand gestures associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.

Another controversy ensued as a rising Green-Party star, Yasri Khan, refused to shake hands with a female TV reporter. Lars Nicander, director of the Centre for Asymmetric Threat Studies at the Swedish Defence University, compared the revelations with how the Soviet Union sought to infiltrate democratic Western parties during the Cold War, alleging that the Green Party similarly may have been &quot;infiltrated by Islamists&quot;. Yasri Khan was criticised by members within the party. He withdrew his candidacy for the Green Party executive board and also quit his seats on a regional board and city council. Spokesperson Fridolin said: men, especially those wanting to be in Swedish politics, should have no problems shaking a woman&#x27;s hand. The Green Party&#x27;s spokespersons also comment the debate saying there&#x27;s no evidence of Islamists influencing party policies, but underlined the party needs a &quot;reset&quot; with greater focus on environmental issues.

In April 2016, Kamal al Raffi, a Green Party politician from the council of Burlöv Municipality as well as the chairman of the local Syrian community group invited Osama bin Laden&#x27;s former advisor Salman al-Ouda to hold a lecture to be attended by his and two other community groups. This invitation was controversial in Sweden as Al-Ouda, a muslim salafist, is known for openly antisemitic views and denying the Holocaust. The Green Party politician was suspended for a time by the party leadership. During the scandal, the party secretary promised the party will better handle crises in the future.

In May 2016, Green Party co-spokesperson and Environmental Minister Åsa Romson confirmed she would resign from both positions as a result of her leadership during the party crisis, along with controversies of her own, such as referring to the September 11 attacks as the 11 September &quot;&quot; (&#x27;accident&#x27; or &#x27;misfortune&#x27;, Romson later claimed she had meant the latter) in a television interview.

Romson later explained her comment, and said: &quot;Of course, the attack on New York on 11 September 2001 is one of the biggest attacks, terror-actions and assaults on the peaceful and democratic world we have seen in modern times. I have no other opinion on this matter.&quot;

== Electoral politics ==

It is often believed that the party is situated on the left on a left-right scale due to its co-operation with the Social Democratic Party. The party participated in a political and electoral coalition called the Red-Greens with the Social Democrats and Left Party from October 2008 until the 2010 general election in September 2010, and has vowed to co-operate with the Social Democrats until 2020. In several municipalities, however, the Greens cooperate with liberal and conservative parties, and the party does not define itself as left, nor right. Rather, they place themselves on one end of a scale between sustainability and growth. In an article published in 2009, Maria Wetterstrand, then party co-spokesperson, defined the party as a natural home also for green-minded social liberals and libertarian socialists, by referring to its liberal policy regarding immigration and its support of personal integrity, participation and entrepreneurship, among other issues.

=== Church politics ===
The party does not directly participate in elections to the Church of Sweden. However, &quot;Greens in the Church of Sweden&quot;, an independent nominating group, participates in church elections at all levels.

=== Relationship with other parties ===
The Green Party has a good relationship with the Social Democrats, and to a lesser extent, with the Left Party. The party does not rule out participation in a government with the minor liberal and centre-right parties in Sweden. The Green Party on first entering the Riksdag, allied with the Conservative Bloc in opposition to the Social Democrats. The Green Party has made clear that its preference among cooperative arrangements with the Conservative Bloc does not include support of a government led by the liberal-conservative Moderate Party. However, historically there have been political deals concluded with the parties forming the centre-right Alliance as an example concerning education. Co-operation with the Moderate Party on the municipal level are relatively frequent.

<text>Gabriel Téllez, O. de M. (24 March 158320 February 1648), also known as Tirso de Molina, was a Spanish Baroque dramatist and poet, as well as a Mercedarian friar, and Catholic priest. He is primarily known for writing &quot;The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest&quot;, the play from which the character Don Juan originates. His work also includes female protagonists and the exploration of sexual issues.

==Life and career==
Gabriel Téllez was born in Madrid to Andrés López and Juana Téllez, servants of the Count of Molina. As a youth, he studied at the University of Alcalá]]. He joined the mendicant Order of Our Lady of Mercy on 4 November 1600, by whom he was sent to the Monastery of San Antolín at Guadalajara to begin his period of novitiate on 21 January 1601. He had been ordained as a priest by 1610.

Téllez had been writing plays for ten years when he was sent by his superiors on a mission to the West Indies in 1615; as a result, he resided in the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo from 1616 to 1618. After returning to Europe, he resided at the Mercedarian monastery in Madrid, where he took part in the proceedings of the Medrano Academy, competed in the literary tournaments, and wrote for the stage.

Tellez&#x27; first publication, the incomplete &quot;Cigarrales de Toledo&quot; (a work licensed in 1621, but not published until 1624), is a miscellany of short tales, novellas, verses, and three plays. One of the novellas, &quot;Los tres maridos burlados&quot;, which may have been derived from Francesco Cieco da Ferrara&#x27;s &quot;Mambriano&quot;, and the play entitled &quot;El vergonzoso en palacio&quot; are considered to demonstrate wit and ingenuity. The preface to &quot;Cigarrales de Toledo&quot; states that Tirso de Molina had already written three hundred plays.

Téllez opposed &quot;culteranismo&quot; in the &quot;Cigarrales de Toledo&quot;, and made enemies through his attacks on it in pieces such as &quot;Amar por arte mayor&quot; and &quot;La celosa de si misma&quot;. The tone of some of his productions caused his rivals to denounce him as a corrupter of public morals to the Council of Castile in 1625, and, though no legal action was taken against him, he may have been reprimanded privately. In 1626, it was thought to be advisable to transfer him to Salamanca, thus Téllez left Madrid, determined not to write anything more for the stage. Although one of his plays, &quot;La huerta de San Juan&quot;, is dated as being written in 1626, there is no proof that he started writing it after his departure from Madrid, and it is suspected that he did not write anything for eight years.

Téllez, however, had not lost his interest in theatre, having published twelve representative pieces as the first part of his dramatic works (1626). At the same time, he continued to serve his Order, being named the prior of the monastery at Trujillo in 1626; he was elected later to the posts of reader in theology and Definitor General, and, in May 1632, he was appointed the official archivist of the Order.

His &quot;Deleitar aprovechando&quot;, which was published in 1635, is a counterpart of the &quot;Cigarrales de Toledo&quot;. A sequel was promised to this collection of tales, lyrics, and autos, but, as in the case of the &quot;Cigarrales de Toledo&quot;, the continuation never appeared.

Twelve plays constitute the third part of his dramatic works published in 1634; the plays were supposedly edited by the writer&#x27;s nephew, Francisco Lucas de Ávila; however, Ávila may have been a cover identity for himself. The second section of the plays (1635), the printing of which was paid for by the Confraternity of St. Jerome, contains four plays by Téllez, and eight written by him in collaboration with other dramatists, including Juan Ruiz de Alarcón; however, Tirso de Molina still did the majority of the writing. The fourth and fifth compilations of his dramatic works (1635 and 1636) each contain twelve plays; the haste with which these five volumes were issued may indicate the author&#x27;s desire to save some part of his work from destruction, and the appearance of his nephew&#x27;s name on the titlepages of the last four volumes may indicate his desire to avoid conflict with the authorities. A sixth volume of dramatic pieces, consisting of comedies, was announced; however, the project was abandoned.

Dramatic composition may have still been a part of Tirso&#x27;s leisure as he grew older, as indicated by how the fragmentary autograph copy of &quot;Las quinas de Portugal&quot; is dated 8 March 1638, despite the fact that his active career as a dramatist ended two years earlier. He was absorbed by other duties. As official archivist of his order, he compiled the elaborate &quot;Historia de la Merced&quot; (his religious order), which occupied him until 24 December 1639, and which was not published until 1973. As a tribute to the Count de Sastago, who had accepted the dedication of the fourth part of the plays, and who may have helped to defray the publishing expenses, Tirso de Molina is said to have compiled the &quot;Genealogía de la casa de Sastago&quot; (1640), but the ascription of this genealogical work is disputed.

On 29 September 1645, Tirso de Molina was appointed as the prior of the monastery at Soria, where he died.

== Legacy ==
It is only within the last century that it has become possible to give an outline of his life and only a fraction of his plays have been preserved. The earliest of his extant pieces is dated 1605; in 1624, he had written three hundred plays, and in 1634, he stated that he had composed four hundred within the previous twenty years; however, not more than eighty of his plays are currently in existence. Tirso de Molina is known as the author of &quot;The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest&quot;, the piece in which &quot;Don Juan&quot; is first presented onstage. However, whether or not other works are correctly attributed to him is disputed; as thought by scholars such as Fernando Cantalapiedra and Alfredo Rodríguez, &quot;El Burlador de Sevilla&quot; and &quot;El Condenado por desconfiado&quot; may have been written by Andrés de Claramonte.

His works cover multiple genres and scenarios. &quot;El Condenado por desconfiado&quot; describes a philosophical enigma, while &quot;Prudence in Woman&quot; is a historical interpretation. &quot;Averígüelo Vargas&quot; and &quot;La villana de Vallecas&quot; (The Peasant Woman of Vallecas) write about female characters.

His reputation may have extended beyond the Pyrenees in his own lifetime, as indicated by how James Shirley&#x27;s &quot;Opportunity&quot; is derived from &quot;El Castigo del penséque&quot;; however, his name was almost forgotten until the end of the 18th century, when some of his pieces were recast by Dionisio Solís and later by Juan Carretero.

The height of his fame occurred between 1839 and 1842, when an incomplete edition of his plays was published by Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch. He is now accepted as one of the greatest dramatists of Spain.

In 2012, Tirso&#x27;s &quot;Condenado por Desconfiado&quot; was performed as &quot;Damned by Despair&quot; at the Olivier Theatre in London, in a new version by Frank McGuinness.

<text>Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch Martínez (6 September 1806 – 2 August 1880) was a Spanish dramatist. He was the Director of the National Library of Spain until he retired in 1875.

==Biography==
Hartzenbusch was born in Madrid, Spain. His father was a German furniture carpenter and his mother a Spanish woman with the name María Josefa Martínez Calleja. Hartzenbusch&#x27;s childhood was spent as an apprentice in his father&#x27;s shop in order to become a cabinet-maker. He studied French 1815-1818 and then took a four-year course in the Jesuit College of San Isidro el Real in Madrid where he studied principally rhetoric, Latin, and philosophy. He followed his father&#x27;s trade until 1830, when he learned shorthand and joined the staff of the &quot;Gaceta&quot;. He married Doña María Bernardina Morgue in 1830. She died in 1836. His earliest dramatic essays were translations from Molière, Voltaire and Alexandre Dumas, père; he then turned to adapting old Spanish plays, and in 1837 produced his first original play, &quot;Los amantes de Teruel&quot;, the subject of which had previously been used by Andrés Rey de Artieda, Tirso de Molina and Juan Pérez de Montalbán. &quot;Los amantes de Teruel&quot; at once made the author&#x27;s reputation, but &quot;Doña Mencía&quot; (1840) and &quot;Alfonso el Casto&quot; (1841) were disappointments; it was not until 1845 that he repeated his former success with &quot;La jura en Santa Gadea&quot;.

In 1900, Don Eugenio Hartzenbusch, Juan&#x27;s son, published &quot;Bibliografía&quot; in Madrid which presents in succinct form as complete a list of his father&#x27;s writings. It remains a testimonial to the lifelong indefatigable industry of this prolific writer. Summarized, the record there given comprises about 15 collections, including various editions of his works, 94 dramatic works, 236 poems 231 fables in verse, 19 addresses, 8 biographical articles, 15 stories, 14 articles depicting manners and customs, 9 literary criticism, 3 dramatic criticism, 33 prologues, 22 notes and articles referring to &quot;Don Quixote&quot; 22 miscellaneous articles, and 9 works of different authors collected and annotated. Such a record of literary activity tells its own story. It is the life of an author and a scholar, who through hard work and conscientious effort, secured for himself an honorable place among Spain&#x27;s men of letters.

Hartzenbusch was the chief librarian at the &quot;Biblioteca Nacional&quot;, National Library, from 1862 to 1875, and was an indefatigable editor of many national classics. Inferior in inspiration to other contemporary Spanish dramatists, Hartzenbusch excelled his rivals in versatility and in conscientious workmanship.

As a member of the Real Academia Española, he edited works from Tirso de Molina (12 vols., Madrid, 1839–42), Calderón de la Barca (4 vols., 1849–51), Juan Ruiz de Alarcón (1852), and Lope de Vega (4 vols., 1853), among others.

After retiring from the National Library in 1875, his strength of body and mind began to give way, and after losing his second wife, Salvadora Hiriart, he failed rapidly and died at his home in Madrid on 2 August 1880. The Real Academia Española, the Spanish Academy, did him the honor of accompanying his body to its last resting place, the &quot;Cementerio de la Sacramental de San Ginés y San Luis&quot;.

<doc id="217381" wikidata="Q1366337" url="?curid=217381" title="Chalcid wasp">
<text>Chalcid wasps (, , for their metallic colour) are insects within the superfamily Chalcidoidea, part of the order Hymenoptera. The superfamily contains some 22,500 known species, and an estimated total diversity of more than 500,000 species, meaning the vast majority have yet to be discovered and described. The name &quot;chalcid&quot; is often confused with the name &quot;chalcidid&quot;, though the latter refers strictly to one constituent family, the Chalcididae, rather than the superfamily as a whole; accordingly, most recent publications (e.g.,) use the name &quot;chalcidoid&quot; when referring to members of the superfamily.

Most chalcid wasps are parasitoids of other insects, though other life styles are known, with the herbivorous fig wasps acting as pollinators. Various species are used as biological pest control agents or in scientific research.

== Description ==
Chalcidoids are generally small wasps, averaging 1.5 mm in length and usually being less than 3 mm. The body is often metallic in colour. The wings may be developed, reduced or absent. When the wings are developed, they have reduced venation or sometimes none at all.

However, the group is morphologically very diverse. Chalcidoids range in size from up to 41.7 mm long (females of the pelecinellid &quot;Doddifoenus wallacei,&quot; this length includes the ovipositor) to merely 0.13 mm long (males of the mymarid &quot;Dicopomorpha echmepterygis&quot;). Various lineages have convergently evolved features such as enlarged femora, enlarged acropleura, reduced numbers of antennal and tarsal segments, reduced wings or reduced wing venation. Some have significant sexual dimorphism: male fig wasps are &quot;turtle-like fighting machines&quot; that are very different to the females, while males of the aforementioned &quot;D. echmepterygis&quot; lack eyes, ocelli, mouthparts, antennal flagella or wings.

== Ecology ==
Most chalcidoids are parasitoids, their hosts including insects, spiders, ticks and mites, pseudoscorpions and even gall-forming nematodes. Some species parasitise a wide range of hosts, while others have a narrow host range. They attack host life stages ranging from eggs to adults. The superfamily includes primary, secondary and tertiary parasitoids, both ecto- and endoparasitoids, and both solitary and gregarious parasitoids.

There are also herbivorous chalcidoids within the families of Agaonidae, Epichrysomallidae, Eurytomidae, Eulophidae, Melanosomellidae, Ormyridae, Pteromalidae, Tanaostigmatidae and Torymidae. Agaonidae only develop within figs.

Predation is exhibited by larvae of some Encyrtidae (prey on coccid eggs) and some Eurytomidae (prey on Cynipidae larvae).

== Importance ==
Chalcidoidea is one of the most important taxa of biological control agents. They are used to control pest insects in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Some herbivorous species are also used in biological control, such as the melanosomellid &quot;Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae&quot; for control of the weed &quot;Acacia longifolia&quot;.

There are also chalcidoids that are agricultural pests themselves, mainly attacking plant seeds. &quot;Bruchophagus&quot; attack seeds of legumes (e.g. alfalfa), &quot;Systole&quot; attack seeds of Apiaceae used as spices (e.g. coriander) and &quot;Megastigmus&quot; attack seeds of Pinaceae grown in plantations.

Females of family Agaonidae are important as pollinators of figs.

Some chalcidoids, especially those in genera &quot;Trichogramma&quot; (Trichogrammatidae) and &quot;Nasonia&quot; (Pteromalidae) are model organisms in scientific research. They have been used to study sex determination, the influence of bacterial endosymbionts and the genetics of speciation. The genome of moth parasitoid &quot;Copidosoma floridanum&quot; was sequenced as part of the i5K project.

== Taxonomy ==
Chalcidoidea is a superfamily of Hymenoptera, whose family constituency is in constant flux, as new hypotheses of relationships are constantly being proposed and rejected; with the advent of molecular systematics, it seems that the future will see further revisions of the classification in use today.

There are fifty families recognized at present:

*Agaonidae 
*Aphelinidae 
*Azotidae 
*Baeomorphidae (formerly Rotoitidae)
*Boucekiidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Calesidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)

*Cerocephalidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Chalcedectidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Chalcididae 
*Chrysolampidae (formerly part of Perilampidae)
*Cleonymidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Coelocybidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Cynipencyrtidae 
*Diparidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Encyrtidae 
*Epichrysomallidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Eucharitidae 
*Eulophidae 
*Eunotidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Eupelmidae 
*Eurytomidae 
*Eutrichosomatidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Herbertiidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Hetreulophidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Heydeniidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Idioporidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Leucospidae 
*Lyciscidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Macromesidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Megastigmidae 
*Melanosomellidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Metapelmatidae (formerly part of Eupelmidae)
*Moranilidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Mymaridae 
*Neanastatidae (formerly part of Eupelmidae)
*Neodiparidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Ooderidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Ormyridae 
*Pelecinellidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Perilampidae 
*Pirenidae (including Eriaporidae) (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Pteromalidae 
*Signiphoridae 
*Spalangiidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Systasidae (formerly part of Pteromalidae)
*Tanaostigmatidae 
*Tetracampidae 
*Torymidae 
*Trichogrammatidae 

There are also three extinct families:
*†Diversinitidae 
*†Khutelchalcididae 
*†Protoitidae Ulmer &amp; Krogmann, 2023 

Of these families, at least five are known to be artificial groups (paraphyletic), and have been divided into several families. The most problematic, the Pteromalidae, has recently been split into 24 families, and Eupelmidae into three families.
