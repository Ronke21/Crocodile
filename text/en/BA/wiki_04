<text>Earth-centered religion or nature worship is a system of religion based on the veneration of natural phenomena. It covers any religion that worships the earth, nature, or fertility deity, such as the various forms of goddess worship or matriarchal religion. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the Gaia hypothesis. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.

==Origins==
===Origin claims by earth religion sources===
According to Marija Gimbutas, pre-Indo-European societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced matrilineal succession and goddess-centered religion where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In Irish mythology she is Danu, in Slavic mythology she is Mat Zemlya, and in other cultures she is Pachamama, Ninsun, Terra Mater, Nüwa, Matres or Shakti.

In the late 1800s, James Weir wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early humans were forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by their instincts and senses. Because their existence depended on nature, humans began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that humanity&#x27;s first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because humans relied heavily on their senses. In this sense, the worship of nature formed, allowing humans to further depend on nature for survival.

Neopagans have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, &quot;The Urantia Book&quot;, another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man. His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Humans experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship.

The origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. Pascal Boyer suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a &quot;blank slate.&quot; Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that &quot;having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different.&quot; He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind. Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.

An additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man&#x27;s cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African chimpanzee. At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape&#x27;s life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of belongingness, which is derived from its dependence on the ape&#x27;s mother and family. Belongingness is defined as &quot;mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships.&quot; This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the hominid (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.

As severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that &quot;an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits.&quot;

==Encompassed religions==
The term &#x27;earth religion&#x27; encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature, or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as paganism, which is a polytheistic, nature-based religion; animism, which posits that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; Wicca, which holds the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practices ritual magic; and Druidism, which equates divinity with the natural world.

Another perspective of earth religion to consider is pantheism, which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth and to the relationship of humans with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that &quot;all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part&quot; and &quot;we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere, and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally&quot;.

The earth also plays a vital role for many Voltaic peoples, many of whom &quot;consider the Earth to be Heaven&#x27;s wife&quot;, such as the Konkomba of northern Ghana, whose economic, social, and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as the Peyote Religion, Longhouse Religion, and Earth Lodge Religion.

==Around the world==
April 22 was established as International Mother Earth Day by the United Nations in 2009, but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. Winter solstice and Summer solstice are celebrated with holidays like Yule and Dongzhi in the winter and Tiregān and Kupala in the summer.

===Africa===
Animism is practiced among some Bantu peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Dahomey mythology has deities like Nana Buluku, Gleti, Mawu, Asase Yaa, Naa Nyonmo and Xevioso.

===Europe===
In Baltic mythology, the sun is a female deity, Saulė, a mother or a bride, and Mēness is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In Slavic mythology Mokosh and Mat Zemlya together with Perun head up the pantheon. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. Dragobete is a traditional Romanian spring holiday that celebrates &quot;the day when the birds are betrothed.&quot;

===India===
In Hindu philosophy, the yoni is the creative power of nature and the origin of life. In Shaktism, the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the Ambubachi Mela, an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth&#x27;s menstruation.

==Popular culture==
Although the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, its presence in popular culture became more pronounced in the early 1990s. &quot;The X-Files&quot; was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air witchcraft and Wicca (types of earth religion) content, particularly in episodes like &quot;Die Hand Die Verletzt&quot; and &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot;. On average, Wiccans—those who practice Wicca—were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs, though they found it to be a little &quot;sensationalistic&quot;. That same year, the movie &quot;The Craft&quot; was released, also depicting the art of Wicca. Unlike &quot;The X-Files&quot;, this cinematic feature faced mixed reviews from the Earth Religion community due to its sensationalized portrayal of witchcraft.

A few years later, programs such as &quot;Charmed&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; became widely popular, further introducing audiences to Earth Religion themes. &quot;Charmed&quot;, although focused mostly on witchcraft, portrayed magic that closely resembled Wiccan practices. Meanwhile, &quot;Buffy&quot; was notable for casting a Wiccan character, Willow Rosenberg, albeit within a fantastical context given the show&#x27;s focus on vampires.

The genre of Earth Religion in popular culture expanded with films by director Hayao Miyazaki, like &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, which delve into human interaction with nature spirits. These films were lauded for their respectful and intricate depiction of Earth Religion themes, both in Japan and internationally.

Disney films such as &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Brother Bear&quot; have also been identified with Earth Religion themes due to their exploration of the &quot;interconnectedness&quot; and &quot;Circle of Life&quot; between animals, plants, and life in general. These films illustrate the consequences when the harmony between humans and nature is disrupted, resonating with Earth Religion principles.

Other films like &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;, &quot;The Deceivers&quot;, &quot;Sorceress&quot; (1982), &quot;Anchoress&quot;, &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;, &quot;Agora&quot;, and &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973) have also explored earth religion and nature worship. Each film, with its unique narrative and setting, contributes to the diverse portrayal of Earth Religion in popular culture. For instance, the religious aspect in &quot;The Deceivers&quot; is primarily embodied by the Thuggee cult&#x27;s worship of the goddess Kali, a deity in Hinduism. Although Kali worship is a part of Hindu tradition, the portrayal in the movie is associated with violence, robbery, and ritualistic murders carried out by the Thuggee cult, which is far from a representation of Earth religion or a reverence for nature. Moreover, the Thuggees&#x27; criminal activities and the religious fanaticism depicted in the movie serve as a plot device to drive the narrative forward, rather than an exploration or demonstration of Earth religion. The focus of &quot;The Deceivers&quot; lies more on the historical thriller aspect, religious fanaticism, and the moral dilemmas faced by the protagonist, rather than on exhibiting practices or ideologies typically associated with Earth religion.

Similarly, online communities and social media platforms are used to discuss and spread Earth Religion ideas. By doing so, people are able to foster a global dialogue, enhancing the representation of Earth Religion in digital popular culture.

Video Games: Video games such as &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; have woven Earth Religion themes into their narratives, offering players an interactive medium to explore these ideas.

Impact on Public Perception: The portrayal of Earth Religion in popular culture has played a significant role in shaping public perception. While some portrayals have been commended for their accuracy and depth, others have been criticized for perpetuating stereotypes and misconceptions.

== Core beliefs and practices ==

* Veneration of nature:
** Earth-centered religions or nature worship are systems of religion based on the veneration of natural phenomena, including the earth, nature, and fertility deities.
** The veneration of the planet and nature has been integral to various religions and spiritual practices throughout history. Adherents to earth religions subscribe to a belief system based on the preservation and reverence for natural phenomena.
* Diversity of beliefs and practices:
** Earth religion encompasses a range of groups and beliefs such as paganism (a polytheistic, nature-based religion), animism (the worldview that all living entities possess a spirit), Wicca (which holds the concept of an earth mother goddess and practices ritual magic), and druidism (which equates divinity with the natural world).
* Connection with Earth:
** Core statements of some earth religions emphasize the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that &quot;all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part&quot; and advocate for living in harmony with nature both locally and globally.
* Cultural variations:
** The earth plays a vital role in many cultures; for example, some Voltaic peoples consider the Earth to be Heaven&#x27;s wife, and their economic, social, and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. Native American religions, such as the Peyote Religion, Longhouse Religion, and Earth Lodge Religion, also have earth-centric beliefs and practices.
* Incorporation of fertility deities:
** Worship of fertility gods or goddesses is a common practice within many earth religions, which often have roots in ancient goddess worship or matriarchal religions.
* Environmental stewardship:
** Earth religions often promote practices that are aimed at preserving the earth and its ecosystems, aligning with conservationist and environmentalist principles.
* Integration of ancient and neo-pagan practices:
** Many earth religions draw from ancient pagan practices, integrating old and neo-pagan earth religions and often including a variety of life-affirming faiths dedicated to healing both individuals and the Earth.
* Gaia hypothesis connection:
** Some individuals find a connection between earth worship and the Gaia hypothesis, which proposes that the Earth is a self-regulating complex system.

==Controversy and criticism==
===Hindrance of progress===
Many religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of &quot;Mother Earth&quot; is that the rights of nature and anti-ecocide movements are inhibitors of human progress and development. This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into &#x27;western&#x27; world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith (of the conservative Discovery Institute which advocates for Intelligent Design ) believes this is &quot;anti-humanism with the potential to do real harm to the human family&quot;. According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.

===Negative representatives===
Much of the criticism directed towards earth religion stems from the adverse actions of a handful of individuals who have faced reproach for their deeds. A notable figure often cited as a negative representation of earth religion is Aleister Crowley. He is critiqued for being &quot;too preoccupied with awakening magical powers&quot; rather than prioritizing the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley is purported to have admired &quot;Old George&quot; Pickingill, another nature worshipper who garnered negative attention. Critics labeled Pickingill as a Satanist and &quot;England&#x27;s most notorious Witch.&quot;

Crowley was &quot;allegedly expelled from the Craft due to his perverse tendencies.&quot; He exhibited arousal towards torture and pain, and took pleasure in being &quot;punished&quot; by women. These behaviors severely tarnished Crowley&#x27;s public image and, by extension, cast a shadow over earth religion, leading to a misperception where many began to associate all followers of earth religion with perverse Satanism.&quot;

===Accused of Satanism===
Followers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being Satanists. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, Witchcraft, a common practice of Wiccans, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism. An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca &quot;have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc.&quot;

Neo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism. Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.

====Accusations of Satanism as religious harassment====

Some earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as &quot;other&quot; from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.

To illustrate, a problem could arise with the &quot;other&quot; than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as Samhain. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.

Organized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).

The issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or &quot;the adversary&quot;, would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the &quot;other&quot; as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.

==Ethics==
Because of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of &quot;earth religion&quot; there is no consensus of beliefs. However, the ethical beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the Wiccan Rede. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually. These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.
#There is no divine judgement
#It is up to each individual to decide what is ethical
#Each individual is responsible for his or her actions
#Nature and all life should be honored
#There is no one correct path or religion, only that which fits best for each individual
#Moral doings are done for their own sake and not for a reward

===The Wiccan Rede===

&quot;An [if] it harm none, do what ye will.&quot; Commonly worded in modern English as &quot;if it doesn&#x27;t harm anyone, do what you want.&quot; This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people&#x27;s interpretation of what is ethical. The rede clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable. Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into &quot;Do what ye will an it harm none,&quot; meaning &quot;Do what you want if it doesn&#x27;t harm anyone.&quot; The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the &quot;harmlessness&quot; of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a karma reaction from every action. Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.

===The Threefold Law===
The Threefold Law is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.

===Honor===
This term is what Emma Restall Orr calls reverence for the earth in her book &quot;Living with Honour: A Pagan Ethics&quot;. She separates the term into three sections: courage, generosity and loyalty, or honesty, respect and responsibility. There is no evil force in Nature. Nothing exists beyond the natural, therefore it is up to the individual to choose to be ethical not because of divine judgment. All beings are connected by the earth and so all should be treated fairly. There is a responsibility toward the environment and a harmony should be found with nature.

===The Earth Religion Anti-Abuse Resolution (1988)===
In 1988, a significant resolution titled the Earth Religion Anti-Abuse Resolution was drafted and approved by various Pagan communities to address concerns of abuse and misrepresentation. This resolution was initially penned by the Church of All Worlds and later garnered approval from the Pagan Ecumenical Conferences of Ancient Ways (held in California from May 27 to May 30) and the Pagan Spirit Gathering (held in Wisconsin on June 17). Following these affirmations, the Pagan Community Council of Ohio presented the resolution to the Northeast Council of W.I.C.C.A., further solidifying its acceptance within the broader Pagan community.

The text of the resolution reads as follows:

&quot;&quot;We, the undersigned, as adherents of Pagan and Old and Neo-Pagan Earth Religions, including Wicca or Witchcraft, practice a variety of positive, life-affirming faiths that are dedicated to healing, both of ourselves and of the Earth. As such, we do not advocate or condone any acts that victimize others, including those proscribed by law. One of our most widely accepted precepts is the Wiccan Rede&#x27;s injunction to &quot;harm none,&quot; and thus, we vehemently condemn practices of child abuse, sexual abuse, and any other form of abuse that inflicts harm on the bodies, minds, or spirits of the victims. We recognize and revere the divinity of Nature in our Mother the Earth, and we conduct our rites of worship in a manner that is ethical, compassionate, and constitutionally protected. Contrary to misconceptions, we neither acknowledge nor worship the Christian devil, &quot;Satan,&quot; as he is not a part of our Pagan pantheons. We strongly oppose slander or libel against our Temples, clergy, or Temple Assemblers and are prepared to defend our civil rights through legal action as deemed necessary and appropriate.&quot;&quot;

This resolution was a significant step towards addressing and condemning abusive practices while also aiming to dispel common misconceptions and stereotypes associated with Earth Religions, particularly Wicca and Witchcraft. It also highlighted the collective stance of the Pagan community against abuse and their commitment to ethical and compassionate practices.

<text>Birkenfeld () is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Its seat is the town of Birkenfeld. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Sankt Wendel (Saarland), Trier-Saarburg, Bernkastel-Wittlich, Rhein-Hunsrück, Bad Kreuznach and Kusel.

== History ==
In the early nineteenth century, the Nahe River was the boundary between two tiny principalities: Birkenfeld, west of the Nahe; and Lichtenberg, east of it. The principality of Birkenfeld was annexed by Oldenburg in 1817; Lichtenberg became an exclave of the Duchy Saxe-Coburg (Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until 1826, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha thereafter). Prussia bought Lichtenberg in 1834 and made it the District of Sankt Wendel.

After World War I, the southern half of Sankt Wendel had to be ceded to the newly created Saar Territory, and the small part remaining in Prussia was then officially called the &quot;Restkreis Sankt Wendel&quot; (&quot;remaining district of Sankt Wendel&quot;). In 1937 the Oldenburgian District of Birkenfeld was merged with the remaining Sankt Wendel District to form the new Prussian District of Birkenfeld.

Following World War II, on 18 July 1946 by the French Ordinance No. 8, twenty-four more villages were ceded to the new &quot;Délégation Supérieure de la Sarre&quot;, which became the new Saar Protectorate in 1947. Not until 1970 were the present borders of the district set.

== Geography ==
The Nahe River runs through the district from south to north. The portions west of the river are located on the eastern slopes of the Hunsrück.

== Coat of arms ==
The German blazon reads: &quot;Geschachtet von Rot und Silber; belegt mit einem rot gezungten, golden gekrönten und golden bewehrten blauen Löwen.&quot;

The arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Chequy of twenty gules and argent a lion rampant azure armed and crowned Or and langued of the first.

The chequered red and silver pattern was the arms of the Counts of Sponheim, a medieval county of the region. The lion is the symbol of the Counts of Veldenz.

<doc id="212490" wikidata="Q177013" url="?curid=212490" title="Subatomic particle">
<text>In physics, a subatomic particle is a particle smaller than an atom. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, a subatomic particle can be either a composite particle, which is composed of other particles (for example, a baryon, like a proton or a neutron, composed of three quarks; or a meson, composed of two quarks), or an elementary particle, which is not composed of other particles (for example, quarks; or electrons, muons, and tau particles, which are called leptons). Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact. Most force-carrying particles like photons or gluons are called bosons and, although they have quanta of energy, do not have rest mass or discrete diameters (other than pure energy wavelength) and are unlike the former particles that have rest mass and cannot overlap or combine which are called fermions. The W and Z bosons, however, are an exception to this rule and have relatively large rest masses at approximately 80 GeV and 90 GeV respectively.

Experiments show that light could behave like a stream of particles (called photons) as well as exhibiting wave-like properties. This led to the concept of wave–particle duality to reflect that quantum-scale behave both like particles and like waves; they are occasionally called wavicles to reflect this.

Another concept, the uncertainty principle, states that some of their properties taken together, such as their simultaneous position and momentum, cannot be measured exactly. 
Interactions of particles in the framework of quantum field theory are understood as creation and annihilation of &quot;quanta&quot; of corresponding fundamental interactions. This blends particle physics with field theory.

Even among particle physicists, the exact definition of a particle has diverse descriptions. These professional attempts at the definition of a particle include: 
* A particle is a collapsed wave function
* A particle is a quantum excitation of a field
* A particle is an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group
* A particle is an observed thing

== Classification ==

=== By composition ===
Subatomic particles are either &quot;elementary&quot;, i.e. not made of multiple other particles, or &quot;composite&quot; and made of more than one elementary particle bound together. 
The elementary particles of the Standard Model are:
* Six &quot;flavors&quot; of quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top;
* Six types of leptons: electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tau, tau neutrino;
* Twelve gauge bosons (force carriers): the photon of electromagnetism, the three W and Z bosons of the weak force, and the eight gluons of the strong force;
* The Higgs boson.
All of these have now been discovered through experiments, with the latest being the top quark (1995), tau neutrino (2000), and Higgs boson (2012).

Various extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of an elementary graviton particle and many other elementary particles, but none have been discovered as of 2021.

==== Hadrons ====
The word hadron comes from Greek and was introduced in 1962 by Lev Okun. Nearly all composite particles contain multiple quarks (and/or antiquarks) bound together by gluons (with a few exceptions with no quarks, such as positronium and muonium). Those containing few (≤ 5) quarks (including antiquarks) are called hadrons. Due to a property known as color confinement, quarks are never found singly but always occur in hadrons containing multiple quarks. The hadrons are divided by number of quarks (including antiquarks) into the baryons containing an odd number of quarks (almost always 3), of which the proton and neutron (the two nucleons) are by far the best known; and the mesons containing an even number of quarks (almost always 2, one quark and one antiquark), of which the pions and kaons are the best known.

Except for the proton and neutron, all other hadrons are unstable and decay into other particles in microseconds or less. A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while the neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark. These commonly bind together into an atomic nucleus, e.g. a helium-4 nucleus is composed of two protons and two neutrons. Most hadrons do not live long enough to bind into nucleus-like composites; those that do (other than the proton and neutron) form exotic nuclei.
=== By statistics ===

Any subatomic particle, like any particle in the three-dimensional space that obeys the laws of quantum mechanics, can be either a boson (with integer spin) or a fermion (with odd half-integer spin).

In the Standard Model, all the elementary fermions have spin 1/2, and are divided into the quarks which carry color charge and therefore feel the strong interaction, and the leptons which do not. The elementary bosons comprise the gauge bosons (photon, W and Z, gluons) with spin 1, while the Higgs boson is the only elementary particle with spin zero.

The hypothetical graviton is required theoretically to have spin 2, but is not part of the Standard Model. Some extensions such as supersymmetry predict additional elementary particles with spin 3/2, but none have been discovered as of 2023.

Due to the laws for spin of composite particles, the baryons (3 quarks) have spin either 1/2 or 3/2 and are therefore fermions; the mesons (2 quarks) have integer spin of either 0 or 1 and are therefore bosons.

=== By mass ===
In special relativity, the energy of a particle at rest equals its mass times the speed of light squared, &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2. That is, mass can be expressed in terms of energy and vice versa. If a particle has a frame of reference in which it lies at rest, then it has a positive rest mass and is referred to as &quot;massive&quot;.

All composite particles are massive. Baryons (meaning &quot;heavy&quot;) tend to have greater mass than mesons (meaning &quot;intermediate&quot;), which in turn tend to be heavier than leptons (meaning &quot;lightweight&quot;), but the heaviest lepton (the tau particle) is heavier than the two lightest flavours of baryons (nucleons). It is also certain that any particle with an electric charge is massive.

When originally defined in the 1950s, the terms baryons, mesons and leptons referred to masses; however, after the quark model became accepted in the 1970s, it was recognised that baryons are composites of three quarks, mesons are composites of one quark and one antiquark, while leptons are elementary and are defined as the elementary fermions with no color charge.

All massless particles (particles whose invariant mass is zero) are elementary. These include the photon and gluon, although the latter cannot be isolated.

=== By decay ===
Most subatomic particles are not stable. All leptons, as well as baryons decay by either the strong force or weak force (except for the proton). Protons are not known to decay, although whether they are &quot;truly&quot; stable is unknown, as some very important Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) actually require it. The μ and τ muons, as well as their antiparticles, decay by the weak force. Neutrinos (and antineutrinos) do not decay, but a related phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is thought to exist even in vacuums. The electron and its antiparticle, the positron, are theoretically stable due to charge conservation unless a lighter particle having magnitude of electric charge  &quot;e&quot; exists (which is unlikely). Its charge is not shown yet.

== Other properties ==
All observable subatomic particles have their electric charge an integer multiple of the elementary charge. The Standard Model&#x27;s quarks have &quot;non-integer&quot; electric charges, namely, multiple of  &quot;e&quot;, but quarks (and other combinations with non-integer electric charge) cannot be isolated due to color confinement. For baryons, mesons, and their antiparticles the constituent quarks&#x27; charges sum up to an integer multiple of &quot;e&quot;.

Through the work of Albert Einstein, Satyendra Nath Bose, Louis de Broglie, and many others, current scientific theory holds that &quot;all&quot; particles also have a wave nature. This has been verified not only for elementary particles but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules. In fact, according to traditional formulations of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, wave–particle duality applies to all objects, even macroscopic ones; although the wave properties of macroscopic objects cannot be detected due to their small wavelengths.

Interactions between particles have been scrutinized for many centuries, and a few simple laws underpin how particles behave in collisions and interactions. The most fundamental of these are the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, which let us make calculations of particle interactions on scales of magnitude that range from stars to quarks. These are the prerequisite basics of Newtonian mechanics, a series of statements and equations in &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, originally published in 1687.

== Dividing an atom ==
The negatively charged electron has a mass of about of that of a hydrogen atom. The remainder of the hydrogen atom&#x27;s mass comes from the positively charged proton. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. Neutrons are neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of the proton. Different isotopes of the same element contain the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. The mass number of an isotope is the total number of nucleons (neutrons and protons collectively).

Chemistry concerns itself with how electron sharing binds atoms into structures such as crystals and molecules. The subatomic particles considered important in the understanding of chemistry are the electron, the proton, and the neutron. Nuclear physics deals with how protons and neutrons arrange themselves in nuclei. The study of subatomic particles, atoms and molecules, and their structure and interactions, requires quantum mechanics. Analyzing processes that change the numbers and types of particles requires quantum field theory. The study of subatomic particles &quot;per se&quot; is called particle physics. The term &quot;high-energy physics&quot; is nearly synonymous to &quot;particle physics&quot; since creation of particles requires high energies: it occurs only as a result of cosmic rays, or in particle accelerators. Particle phenomenology systematizes the knowledge about subatomic particles obtained from these experiments.

== History ==

The term &quot;&quot;subatomic&quot; particle&quot; is largely a retronym of the 1960s, used to distinguish a large number of baryons and mesons (which comprise hadrons) from particles that are now thought to be truly elementary. Before that hadrons were usually classified as &quot;elementary&quot; because their composition was unknown.

<text>A manicure is a mostly cosmetic beauty treatment for the fingernails and hands performed at home or in a nail salon. A manicure usually consists of filing and shaping the free edge of nails, pushing and clipping (with a cuticle pusher and cuticle nippers) any nonliving tissue at the cuticle and removing hangnails, treatments with various liquids, massage of the hand, and the application of fingernail polish. When the same is applied to the toenails and feet, the treatment is referred to as a pedicure. Together, the treatments may be known as a mani-pedi. 
Some manicures include painting pictures or designs on the nails, applying small decals, or imitation jewels (from 2 dimension to 3 dimension). Other nail treatments may include the application of artificial gel nails, tips, or acrylics, which may be referred to as &quot;French manicures&quot;.

Nail technicians, such as manicurists and pedicurists, must be licensed in certain states and countries, and must follow government regulations. Since skin is manipulated and often times trimmed, there is a risk of spreading infection when tools are used across many people. Therefore, having improper sanitation can pose serious issues.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;manicure&quot; comes from the French word , meaning care of the hands, which in turn originates from the Latin words &#x27;, for hand, and &#x27;, for care. Similarly, the English word &quot;pedicure&quot; comes from the Latin words &#x27; (genitive case: &#x27;), for foot, and &#x27;, for care. Colloquially, the word for manicure is sometimes shortened to mani.

==Types==

===Dip powder manicures===
Dip powder manicures are an alternative to traditional acrylic nails and gel polish. Dip powders have become popular due to ease of application. They are similar to traditional silk or fiberglass enhancements, with the fiber being replaced by acrylic powder. Both methods rely on layering cyanoacrylate over the natural nail and encasing either the fiber or acrylic powder. While a single layer of fiber is typical, multiple alternating layers of powder and cyanoacrylate may be used in dip nails.

===French manicures===

Jeff Pink, founder of the professional nail brand ORLY, is credited with creating the natural nail look later called the French manicure in 1976.

In the mid-1970s, Pink was tasked by a film director to come up with a universal nail look that would save screen actresses from having to spend time getting their nails redone to go along with their costume changes. Inspired by the instant brightening effect of a white pencil applied to the underside, Pink suspected that the solution was to apply that same neutralizing principle to the top of the nail. &quot;I got one gallon of white polish for the tips, and pink, beige, or rose for the nail,&quot; he recalled in a 2014 interview with &quot;The National&quot;. The Natural Nail Kit, as Pink called it then, was a hit among movie stars and studios who found the time-saving strategy indispensable. &quot;The director commented that I should get an Oscar for saving the industry so much money,&quot; he said. Eventually Pink took the trend to the catwalk crowd in Paris, and they liked it, too. But, it still needed, as he thought, a more pleasing name. He gave it the French rebranding on the flight back home to Los Angeles.

Nails that have undergone a French manicure are characterized by a lack of artificial base color and white tips at the free edge of the nail. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as French tips. The nail tips are painted white, while the rest of the nails are polished in a pink or a suitable nude shade. French manicures can be achieved with artificial nails. However, it is also as common to perform a French manicure on natural nails. Another technique is to whiten the underside of the nail with white pencil and paint a sheer color over the entire nail.
===Hot oil manicures===
A hot oil manicure is a specific type of manicure that cleans the cuticles and softens them with oil. Types of oils that can be used are mineral oil, olive oil, some lotions or commercial preparations in an electric heater.

===Lesbian manicures===

A lesbian manicure (also known as a queer manicure, lez nails, or femmicure, from the LGBTQ slang terms &quot;queer&quot;, &quot;lez&quot;, and &quot;femme&quot; respectively) is a style or trend of manicure intended to allow lesbians and other queer people in the LGBTQ community to safely and easily perform digital penetration during sex. The most distinct and modern form of the manicure entails long nail extensions on every finger apart from the index finger, middle finger, and sometimes thumb of the dominant hand, thus preventing injury or discomfort to the vulva or vagina during intercourse while otherwise maintaining the fashion of long acrylic nails in one&#x27;s daily life. The style is often seen as a public expression or symbol of lesbian identity, particularly on the &quot;femme&quot; side of the femme-butch spectrum.

== Paraffin wax treatments ==

Hands or feet can be covered in melted paraffin wax for softening and moisturizing. Paraffin wax is used because it can be heated to temperatures of over 95 °F (35 °C) without burning or injuring the body. The intense heat allows for deeper absorption of emollients and essential oils. The wax is usually infused with various botanical ingredients such as aloe vera, azulene, chamomile, or tea tree oil, and fruit waxes such as apple, peach, and strawberry, are often used in salons. Paraffin wax treatments are often charged as an addition to the standard manicure or pedicure. They are often not covered in general training and are a rare treatment in most nail salons.

Professional services should not include dipping clients&#x27; hands or feet into a communal paraffin bath, as the wax can be a vector for disease. Paraffin should be applied in a way that avoids contamination, often by placing a portion of the wax into a bag or mitt, which is placed on the client&#x27;s hand or foot and covered with a warm towel, cotton mitt, or booty to retain warmth. The paraffin is left for a few minutes until it has cooled.

==Common manicure tools and supplies==
Common manicure/pedicure tools include:
*Bowl of warm water or fingerbath
* Cuticle nipper (cuticle knife, cuticle clipper)
* Cuticle pusher
*Foot bath (pedicures)
*Manicure table
*Nail art brushes/tools
* Nail brush
* Nail buffer
* Nail clippers
* Nail file (usually an emery board)
*Nail scissors
* Orangewood stick
* Pumice stone / foot file (pedicures)
*Rubber thimble (used to help open polish)
* Toe separator (pedicures)

Common manicure/pedicure supplies include: 
*Cotton balls/pads
*Cuticle remover
*Hand cream
*Hand towels
*Massage lotion
* Mild scrub
*Nail jewels (often self-adhesive)
*Nail polish
*Nail polish remover or nail polish remover wipes
**Base coat polish and ridge filler polish
**Color varnish
**Top coat or sealant

For decoration:
*Fimo/Nail art cane slices
*Flocking Powder
*Glitter
*Sanitizing spray/towels
*Small dried flowers

== Sanitation options ==
In Australia, the United States, and other countries, many nail salons offer personal nail tool kits for purchase to avoid some of the sanitation issues in the salon. The kits are often kept in the salon and given to the client to take home, or are thrown away after use. They are only used when that client comes in for a treatment.

Another option is to give the client the files and wooden cuticle sticks after the manicure. Since the 1970s, the overwhelming majority of professional salons use electric nail files that are faster and yield higher quality results, particularly with acrylic nail enhancements.

==Shape==
There are several common nail shapes: almond, oval, pointed, round, square, square oval, square with rounded corners, and straight with a rounded tip. 

The square oval shape is sometimes known as squoval, a term coined in 1984. The squoval is considered a sturdy shape.

<text>The Tacoma Rainiers are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners. They are located in Tacoma, Washington, and play their home games at Cheney Stadium, which opened in 1960. Tacoma has competed in the PCL since 1960, including the 2021 season when it was known as the Triple-A West. The team operated under several monikers before becoming the Rainiers in 1995.

Tacoma has won the PCL championship six times (1961, 1969, 1978, 2001, 2010, and 2021).

==History==

=== 1904–1905: Tacoma Tigers ===
Tacoma&#x27;s first team in the PCL was the Tacoma Tigers, who joined the league in 1904, having moved from Sacramento after the 1903 season. The 1904 Tigers won Tacoma&#x27;s first PCL pennant, finishing first in both halves of the split season schedule, seven games (annualized) over the runner-up Los Angeles Angels. The 1905 Tigers won the first-half championship, then moved back to Sacramento, finishing out the season as the Sacramento Solons and losing the postseason series to the Angels.

The PCL did not return to Tacoma for 55 years; however, another Tacoma Tigers franchise operated in the Western International League from the 1930s through 1951. Owned by William Starr of San Diego, they were affiliated with the San Diego Padres of the PCL. The team was sold, relocated to north central Idaho, and became the Lewiston Broncs in 1952.

=== 1960–1965: Tacoma Giants ===
The current PCL franchise was founded in 1960 when the Phoenix Giants, a San Francisco Giants affiliate, moved to Tacoma and became the Tacoma Giants, the first team to play at brand-new Cheney Stadium.

The Giants&#x27; first win at Cheney Stadium came on April 16, 1960—an 11-0 victory over Portland in game two of a doubleheader. Future Hall Of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal worked the victory, giving Tacoma their first franchise shutout performance.

The 1961 iteration of the club posted a 97–57 record under manager Red Davis, who steered a team led by Gaylord Perry, Ron Herbel, Eddie Fisher, and Dick Phillips. Following a season in which he hit .264 with 16 home runs and 98 RBI, Phillips was named the 1961 PCL Most Valuable Player (MVP). The franchise did not have another MVP winner until José Marmolejos in 2021.

=== 1966–1971: Tacoma Cubs ===
In 1965, the Giants moved its PCL team back to Phoenix. However, the Chicago Cubs chose to move their affiliate, the Salt Lake City Bees, to Tacoma the same year and renamed the team the Tacoma Cubs.

Tacoma played as a Cubs affiliate for six seasons, compiling a record. The Tacoma Cubs were managed by Whitey Lockman for their first four seasons, including a 1969 PCL Championship after finishing the year 86–60. The 1969 Cubs pitching staff compiled a 3.01 team ERA, and bested Eugene for the league championship 3–2 in a best-of-five series.

=== 1972–1977: Tacoma Twins ===
Following the 1971 season, the Cubs left town. Local businessmen Stan Naccarato and Clay Huntington spearheaded a group of local investors who purchased the franchise and secured an affiliation with the Minnesota Twins, who renamed the team the Tacoma Twins. The new local ownership team, known as the Tacoma Twins Baseball Club Directors, comprised the following: E.J. Zarelli (President); Stan Naccarato (General Manager-Vice President); Frank Manley (Treasurer); Tom Baker (Secretary); and Clay Huntington, Alden Woodworth, Francis Browne, Robert Alessandro, Mike Tucci Jr., Walt Wiklund, Dr. Robert Johnson, Lawrence Ghilarducci Sr., James Topping, Marley Brotman, Carl Miraldi, Frank Ruffo, Douglas Goneya, Ray Carlson, Frank Pupo, Bill Cammarano Sr., and Mike Block (Vice Presidents). 

Through six seasons as a Twins affiliate, Tacoma compiled a record with no league championships.

During the Twins era, infielder Rick Renick (1973–76) slugged his way to 72 home runs, giving him the most career home runs in franchise history. In the midst of a 1977 season in which he hit .321 with 25 home runs and 117 RBI, first baseman Randy Bass notched four home runs on June 9, 1977 at Phoenix. Bass is one of only six players in PCL history to hit four or more home runs in one game.

Future Toronto Blue Jays broadcaster Jerry Howarth broadcast games for Tacoma during this period.

=== 1978: Tacoma Yankees ===
For one season, the Tacoma franchise was affiliated with the New York Yankees. As the Yankees compiled a 100-win 1978 season that culminated in an American League East title over the Boston Red Sox, the Tacoma Yankees compiled an 80–57 record and advanced to the league championship. The 1978 PCL championship series with Albuquerque was cancelled due to rain, so Tacoma and Albuquerque were named PCL co-champions.

=== 1979 Tacoma Tugs and 1980 Tacoma Tigers ===
Following an affiliation change to the Cleveland Indians, a local contest was held and long-time Tacoma resident, Gary Grip won with his entry, the Tacoma Tugs. Grip drew his inspiration for the name from the many tugboats in the Tacoma waters. The franchise was renamed the Tacoma Tugs, marking the first time the team&#x27;s nickname did not align with its major league club. After one season as the Tugs, the team returned to the Tigers nickname in 1980.

The team finished with nearly identical records in both years as a Cleveland affiliate, going 74–73 in 1979, and 74–74 in 1980.

=== 1981–1994: Tacoma Tigers ===
Following their brief stints with the Yankees and Indians, the team changed their affiliation to the Oakland A&#x27;s, a partnership that lasted fourteen seasons.

While the affiliation with Oakland provided five playoffs appearances for Tacoma fans, it produced no league champions. Future American League Rookies of the Year Walt Weiss, Jose Canseco, and Mark McGwire all played in Tacoma during this period. Scott Brosius, Tacoma&#x27;s future hitting coach, also played for Tacoma during the Oakland era.

=== 1995–present: Tacoma Rainiers ===
The team affiliated with the nearby Seattle Mariners in 1995, whose Triple-A team for the previous ten seasons had been the Calgary Cannons. On November 3, 1994, Tacoma adopted the Rainiers name in part as a tribute to the Seattle Rainiers minor league teams that played from 1938 to 1964 in the PCL and again from 1972 to 1976 in the Northwest League (NWL).

Since their affiliation began with the Mariners in 1995, nearly all of the organization&#x27;s homegrown prospects have passed through Tacoma, including Alex Rodriguez, Raúl Ibañez, Félix Hernández, J. J. Putz, Kyle Seager, Ken Griffey Jr. (on rehab assignments), and more.

Tacoma was managed by Dan Rohn from 2001 to 2005, a three-time PCL Manager of the Year Award recipient. Under Rohn&#x27;s direction, the Rainiers compiled a record.

The Tacoma Rainiers shared the 2001 PCL championship with New Orleans after the September 11 attacks forced the cancellation of the championship series. The Rainiers advanced to the championship series in 2005 but were swept by the Nashville Sounds. The Tacoma Rainiers won its second PCL championship in 2010.

The Rainiers are broadcast on KHHO 850 AM by play-by-play announcer Mike Curto, who has been with the club since 1999.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Rainiers were organized into the Triple-A West. Tacoma ended the season as champions of the Western Division by finishing in first place with a 73–47 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead the Rainiers also won the Triple-A West championship by having the best regular-season record among all 10 teams. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch, in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Tacoma finished the tournament tied for 13th place with a 5–5 record. José Marmolejos won the Triple-A West MVP award that season.

In 2022, Triple-A West was renamed as the Pacific Coast League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to 2021.

The Rainiers set a new PCL record in 2024 with 286 stolen bases, surpassing the 1981 Albuquerque Dukes&#x27; 281 steals.

==Season-by-season records==


=== Postseason history ===

==== 1961 Tacoma Giants ====
The 1961 Tacoma Giants finished the season with a record of 97–57 (.630), which still stands as the best season in the club&#x27;s PCL history. No playoffs were held in 1961; instead, the Giants clinched the league championship by earning the top spot in the league&#x27;s sole, eight-team division. The club finished the season going 57–10 over their final 67 games, including a 16-game winning streak.

==== 1969 Tacoma Cubs ====
The 1969 Tacoma Cubs finished the season with an 86–60 (.589) record, and earned the franchise&#x27;s second league championship. The Cubs won the four-team Northern Division by 14 games to advance to the league championship. After going down 0–2 in the championship series to Eugene, then a Philadelphia Phillies affiliate, the Cubs rallied to win three straight games, clinching the five-game series. Cubs pitcher Archie Reynolds fired a complete game, two-hit shutout in game four to force a deciding fifth game. The 1969 Cubs were the first Tacoma team to win a championship playoff series.

==== 1971 Tacoma Cubs ====
The Tacoma Cubs compiled a record of 78–65 (.545) and returned to the PCL championship series just two short years after winning the league title. This time, the Cubs would fall to the Salt Lake Angels, three games to one. After falling behind 0–1 in the series, Cubs starting pitcher Jim Colborn fired a 10-inning, complete-game winning effort in game two, surrendering only one run and evening the series. Tacoma played the series without Adrian Garrett, who had hit a franchise record 43 home runs during the regular season before being sold to Oakland on August 31.

==== 1978 Tacoma Yankees ====
Tacoma finished with a record of 80–57 (.584) during their only season as a Yankees affiliate and was declared PCL co-champions, along with Albuquerque, after inclement weather in the Pacific Northwest forced the league office to cancel the playoffs.

==== 1981 Tacoma Tigers ====
For the first time since the PCL switched to a split-season format, Tacoma made the playoffs after finishing 43–27 in the second half to win the Northern Division. The Tigers defeated Hawaii, winners of the first half, two games to one to advance to the PCL championship series against Albuquerque. The Dukes would go on to sweep the Tigers 3–0 by a combined score of 22–7 to win the PCL championship.

==== 2001 Tacoma Rainiers ====
While the Seattle Mariners compiled a major league record 116 wins, the Rainiers put together an 85–59 (.590) record to win the Northern Division by games. The 2001 Rainiers led the Pacific Coast League with a 3.74 team ERA, while the offense finished fifth in the league in runs scored. Tacoma defeated Sacramento 3–2, after falling behind in the Pacific Conference series 2–1, to move on to the championship series. Tacoma and New Orleans were scheduled to begin the series on September 11, before it was cancelled in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The league office announced that Tacoma and New Orleans would be declared co-champions of the 2001 season.

==== 2005 Tacoma Rainiers ====
The 2005 Rainiers finished 80–64 (.556) under the guidance of manager Dan Rohn. The Rainiers clinched the Pacific Conference Northern Division crown on the second-to-last day of the season, eliminating a Salt Lake team that had won their final nine games of the season. Tacoma dropped the first two games of the five-game Pacific Conference series at home against Sacramento, before taking the final three games at Raley Field to advance to the championship. After falling behind 0–1 in the series to Nashville, a season-high five errors in game two sunk the Rainiers and gave the Sounds a 2–0 series advantage. In the 13th inning of game three, eventual series MVP Nelson Cruz launched a three-run home run to give Nashville a 5–2 victory and the PCL championship.

==== 2009 Tacoma Rainiers ====
The 2009 Rainiers, guided by manager Daren Brown, worked a record of 74–70 to sneak into the postseason. Tacoma was quickly eliminated from championship contention after dropping the conference series to Sacramento, 3–1.

==== 2010 Tacoma Rainiers ====
The Rainiers went into playoffs with its home ballpark, Cheney Stadium, under construction. Displaced from its home field, the Rainiers had to play its playoff home games at other venues. The first round of playoff games against the Sacramento Rivercats saw the Rainiers winning two straight on the road, then coming &quot;home&quot; to Safeco Field, the Mariners&#x27; home ballpark. The Rainiers then dropped two straight games at Safeco, before winning Game 5 to advance to the PCL championship series against the Memphis Redbirds.

Due to Safeco Field not being available for the championship series and no other ballpark in the Pacific Northwest meeting PCL requirements, the Rainiers were forced to play all games in the PCL finals on the road. For Games 1 and 2, the Rainiers played as the home team, batting second against the Memphis Redbirds, with AutoZone Park in Memphis, Tennessee, (the Redbirds&#x27; home park) hosting all the games. Despite playing all its games in its opponents home park, the Rainiers swept the Redbirds in three games to win the 2010 PCL championship.

The Columbus Clippers defeated the Rainiers, 12–6, on September 21, 2010, to win the Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game in Oklahoma City.

== Uniforms ==
In March 2015, the Tacoma Rainiers announced a set of new logo marks and additions to the club&#x27;s uniform set. An updated version of the team&#x27;s script logo, introduced in 1995, became the club&#x27;s primary logo mark. A long-standing fan-favorite, the standalone &quot;R&quot; logo, became the team&#x27;s secondary mark.

In addition to the logo marks, a new look was given to the club&#x27;s home alternate, away, and batting practice uniforms. A red alternate jersey, worn with a new red hat, was added to the rotation of uniform sets. The club&#x27;s new road uniform was modeled after the Tacoma Giants uniforms of the 1960s with a gray color scheme and block letters on the front. The final addition to the uniform set was a new batting practice cap, adorned with a mountain outline and a climbing axe with a baseball bat handle.

<text>Kerry Ray King (born June 3, 1964) is an American musician, best known for being the co-lead guitarist and songwriter of thrash metal band Slayer. He co-founded the band with Jeff Hanneman in 1981 and is one of two members to stay with the band for its -year existence, along with Tom Araya. During Slayer&#x27;s hiatus from 2019 to 2024, King went on to pursue a solo career, with his debut album &quot;From Hell I Rise&quot; released in May 2024.

==Biography==
===Early life===
The youngest of three children, King was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. His father was an aircraft parts inspector, and his mother worked for a telephone company. He started learning guitar at the age of thirteen at his father&#x27;s urging, saying &quot;...my dad was trying to get me out of the wrong circles and give me a hobby.&quot; King attended three different high schools and had very good grades, even winning an award as his school&#x27;s top math student in junior high. As the youngest child in the family, King says he was &quot;spoilt&quot; growing up. He learned guitar on his father&#x27;s Gibson ES-175 and later had a Fender Stratocaster which he traded for a BC Rich Mockingbird, beginning a long relationship with BC Rich guitars. The first song he ever learned was Ted Nugent&#x27;s &quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot; and he soon became a major fan of Van Halen and Judas Priest, which had a major impact on his guitar playing.

===Slayer===
King formed his first band with another guitarist who had been teaching him lessons, and this guitarist introduced him to Tom Araya. He discovered that he and Araya lived only a block away from each other, and they agreed to start jamming together. &quot;Everything began from that point&quot;, King has said of Slayer&#x27;s origins. In 1981, King was at an audition for a southern rock band which Jeff Hanneman was also auditioning for. King heard Hanneman playing guitar near the reception desk and approached him, soon learning that they liked a lot of the same music, and they decided to jam together. The pair enjoyed playing together and decided to start their own band with Araya and a neighborhood drummer named Dave Lombardo, which would soon evolve into Slayer. King, along with Araya, remained in Slayer for the entire length of the band&#x27;s career, from 1981 to 2019 and since 2024.

In 1984, King was invited by former Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine to join his new band Megadeth. Slayer&#x27;s future was briefly in doubt as King played several shows with Megadeth, though he ultimately did not join full-time due to his commitment to Slayer. He still lived with his parents and has said that the desire to not spend time at home with his family caused him to spend more time rehearsing with the band, which helped his musicianship improve tremendously.

King says at that time their music was viewed simply as heavy metal and the term &quot;thrash&quot; emerged later. He was becoming heavily influenced by the band Venom, which helped shape Slayer&#x27;s dark image. King says that after releasing &quot;Haunting The Chapel&quot; and &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; and seeing the band&#x27;s audience grow steadily, he knew Slayer would be his career. The controversy surrounding Slayer&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Angel Of Death&quot; fueled King to dedicate himself to songwriting. &quot;I think, on the whole, that mankind is full of fucking idiots. In a nutshell, our lyrics just say &#x27;think&#x27;. That&#x27;s it&quot;, he said of the unwanted &quot;Angel of Death&quot; attention.

Slayer fared better than most bands after heavy metal&#x27;s decline in the 1990s, which King describes as &quot;the fuckin&#x27; Limp Bizkit era&quot;. King almost stopped writing music entirely due to how offensive he believed the music scene had become at that time. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t understand why anybody would make music like that, let alone like it. That was definitely my darkest time as a musician, and that definitely showed up on &quot;Diabolus in Musica&quot;... through my lack of involvement&quot;, he has said.

===Solo career===
In March 2020, when interviewed by &quot;Guitar World&quot; about his endorsement with Dean Guitars, King hinted that he would be working on new material for his first project since Slayer&#x27;s disbandment, simply saying, &quot;Dean didn&#x27;t sign me for nothing!&quot; King stated in an August 2020 interview on the Dean Guitars YouTube channel that he had &quot;more than two records&#x27; worth of music&quot;. It was later confirmed that he and former Slayer bandmate Paul Bostaph were working on a new project that would &quot;sound like Slayer without it being Slayer — but not intentionally so.&quot; In November 2023, King hinted that he was going to release the debut album by his new project in 2024; this project was later revealed to be his solo debut album, &quot;From Hell I Rise&quot;, released on May 17, 2024. The lineup on the album includes King, Bostaph, Death Angel vocalist Mark Osegueda, Hellyeah bassist Kyle Sanders, and Vio-lence and former Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel. 

==Guest appearances==
In addition to appearing on Slayer&#x27;s albums, he has also made several guest appearances for other artists. While lending production to 1986&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, Rick Rubin was also helping with the production of the Beastie Boys&#x27; debut album &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;. Rubin felt the track &quot;No Sleep till Brooklyn&quot; needed a guitar solo, so he called in King to lay down the part. King has since commented that his playing ability &quot;certainly wasn&#x27;t that of a virtuoso&quot;. The video for &quot;No Sleep till Brooklyn&quot;, whose title was a spoof on Motörhead&#x27;s 1981 live album &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot;, was originally intended to feature King being knocked offstage by a gorilla, but King refused. King replied, &quot;If there&#x27;s gonna be anyone knocking anyone offstage, it&#x27;ll be me knocking the gorilla&quot;, which was what subsequently happened.

On &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, King also played the guitar solo on the song &quot;Fight For Your Right (To Party)&quot;.

King contributed the main lead guitar solo and outro part to Pantera&#x27;s song &quot;Goddamn Electric&quot;, which appeared on the 2000 album, &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot;. King&#x27;s rig was set up in Pantera&#x27;s bathroom backstage just after Ozzfest 1999 in Dallas, as the group still did not have their own dressing room, on top of not appearing on the festival bill. 

King has also made several guest appearances on Marilyn Manson&#x27;s Rape of the World Tour, joining the band to play tracks such as &quot;Little Horn&quot;, &quot;1996&quot; and &quot;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&quot;. Many fans noticed elements of King&#x27;s own style used on these occasions. 

On October 21, 2010, the final date of the Jägermeister Music Tour, King joined Megadeth on stage at the Gibson Amphitheater in Hollywood to perform &quot;Rattlehead&quot; which was the first time in 26 years that King had shared the stage with Megadeth (King had been a touring substitute for a few months in 1984).

King contributed a guitar solo on the title track for the 2010 album Witchkrieg by the Swedish blackened thrash band Witchery. He also appears in the music video playing his solo.

He made an appearance in the 2009 movie &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot; as a member of SWAT team led by Ethan Hawke&#x27;s character. In 2022, he appeared in the comedy horror film &quot;Studio 666&quot; as Krug.

==Style and influences==

King&#x27;s first experience with a guitar was when he was a child. Steve Huey of AllMusic has commented in his review for &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; that Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman&#x27;s demented soloing often mimics the screams of the songs&#x27; victims. He also described his and Jeff Hanneman&#x27;s guitar solos as &quot;wildly chaotic&quot;. Thom Jurek, also of AllMusic, described his work on 2006&#x27;s &quot;Christ Illusion&quot; as creating &quot;an intensely harrowing and angular riff that changes from verse to verse, through the refrain and bridge, and comes back again.&quot;

King listed Venom, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath as his favorite bands during his teen years. He said once &quot;Anybody who plays heavy music and doesn&#x27;t cite Sabbath as an influence is lying, because that&#x27;s where it all started.&quot; He cited Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing of Judas Priest as his biggest influences as a guitarist that inspire his style, tone, and gear. He mentioned Eddie Van Halen, Ted Nugent, Ronnie Montrose, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Randy Rhoads as other influences. King also quoted Elton John, Eagles, Boston, Foreigner, J. Geils among his favorite non-metal artists.

==Personal life==
King has been twice divorced and has a daughter named Shyanne Kymberlee King with his first wife; his current wife is Ayesha King. He claims he has never done drugs, though he has said &quot;I&#x27;m quite an experienced drinker&quot;.

Prior to 2020, King had lived in California for almost all of his life. He relocated to Phoenix, Arizona around 1987, and while living there, he was a neighbor of Judas Priest singer Rob Halford. By the early 2000s, King had moved back to Los Angeles, and he would later relocate to Riverside County, California. In April 2020, King and Ayesha bought one home in Las Vegas, Nevada; as of November 2021, however, the couple resides in New York City.

King is an antitheist. He is known to oppose and strongly criticize organized religion by expressing his views in his songwriting. In a 2006 interview with Blabbermouth.net, King expressed his anti-religious views: &quot;I don&#x27;t really have a life philosophy; my thing is just rebelling against pretty much organized religion. That is my main thing, because personally I think it&#x27;s a crutch for people that are too weak to get through life on their own. I&#x27;m the kind of guy that says if I don&#x27;t see it, then it doesn&#x27;t work. And nobody can show me God.&quot; When asked by &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot; what superpower would he want if he was a supervillain, King replied &quot;the ability to burst a church into flames by simply walking by it.&quot;

King is an avid snake collector who owns a reptile house and herpetology nursery called Psychotic Exotics.

King has largely avoided politics, although he displayed sympathy for conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in the past. In 2017, King said that he was &quot;embarrassed about Trump&#x27;s presidency,&quot; which he described as &quot;divisive and polarizing.&quot; In 2024, while promoting his solo album, he stated that he was &quot;pissed off&quot; about the overturning of Roe V. Wade. 

King&#x27;s body has grown increasingly tattooed over his career, with &quot;Blender Magazine&quot; once producing a tour of his body ink. King&#x27;s abbreviation, KFK, was revealed to mean &quot;Kerry Fuckin&#x27; King&quot; in the January 2007 Issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot;.

<text>Sir Peter Thomas Blake (born 25 June 1932) is an English pop artist. He co-created the sleeve design for the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. His other works include the covers for two of The Who&#x27;s albums, the cover of the Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, and the Live Aid concert poster. Blake also designed the 2012 Brit Award statuette.

Blake is a prominent figure in the pop art movement. Central to his paintings are his interest in images from popular culture which have infused his collages. In 2002 he was knighted at Buckingham Palace for his services to art.

== Early life ==
Peter Blake was born in Dartford, Kent, on 25 June 1932. He was educated at the Gravesend Technical College school of art, and the Royal College of Art.

== Career ==

From the late 1950s, Blake&#x27;s paintings included imagery from advertisements, music hall entertainment, and wrestlers, often including collaged elements. Blake was included in group exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. In the &quot;Young Contemporaries&quot; exhibition of 1961 in which he exhibited alongside David Hockney and R. B. Kitaj, he was first identified with the emerging British Pop Art movement. Blake won the (1961) John Moores junior award for &quot;Self Portrait with Badges&quot;. He came to wider public attention when, along with Pauline Boty, Derek Boshier and Peter Phillips, he featured in Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; film on pop art, &quot;Pop Goes the Easel&quot;, broadcast on BBC television in 1962. From 1963, Blake was represented by Robert Fraser placing him at the centre of Swinging London and bringing him into contact with leading figures of popular culture. Blake had his first solo exhibition with Robert Fraser Gallery in 1965 and appeared on the front cover of &quot;LIFE International&quot; in a photograph by Lord Snowdon. Blake was given the final exhibition held at Robert Fraser Gallery which closed in 1969. The same year, Blake had his first exhibition with Waddington Galleries, owned by Leslie Waddington who became his lifelong supporter and representative. In 1999, Blake painted &quot;Leslie Waddington with Portrait of a Young Man by Hans Memling&quot;.

Blake participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; in 1987.

== Work ==
&quot;On the Balcony&quot; (1955–1957) is a significant early work which remains an iconic piece of British Pop Art, showing Blake&#x27;s interest in combining images from pop culture with fine art. The work, which appears to be a collage but is wholly painted, shows, among other things, a boy on the left of the composition holding Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;The Balcony&quot;, badges and magazines. It was inspired by a painting by Honoré Sharrer depicting workers holding famous paintings, &quot;Workers and Paintings&quot;. At the &quot;Pop Art in Changing Britain&quot; exhibit and as reported by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; on 21 February 2018, his &quot;Girls with Their Hero&quot;, a 1959 painting of facets of Elvis Presley was said to have &quot;fashioned a highly personal form of Pop Art, infused by nostalgia for Victoriana and a long-lost world of native pastimes&quot;. Blake has referred to the work of other artists many times. His &quot;Captain Webb Matchbox&quot;, based on a Bryant &amp; May matchbox design featuring the first man to swim the Channel unaided, is another of his early works in the pop art movement. Another example, &quot;The First Real Target&quot; (1961) a standard archery target with the title written across the top is a play on paintings of targets by Kenneth Noland and Jasper Johns.

Blake has been commissioned to create many album sleeves. He designed the sleeve for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; with his wife Jann Haworth, the American-born artist whom he married in 1963 and divorced in 1979. The Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s sleeve has become an iconic work of pop art, much imitated and Blake&#x27;s best-known work. Producing the collage necessitated the construction of a set with cut-out photographs and objects, such as flowers, centred on a drum (sold in auction in 2008) with the title of the album. Blake has subsequently complained about the one-off fee he received for the design (£200), with no subsequent royalties. Blake made sleeves for the Band Aid single, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; (1984), Paul Weller&#x27;s &quot;Stanley Road&quot; (1995) and the Ian Dury tribute album &quot;Brand New Boots and Panties&quot; (2001; Blake was Dury&#x27;s tutor at Walthamstow School of Art in the early 60s). He designed the sleeves for Pentangle&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Child&quot;, The Who&#x27;s &quot;Face Dances&quot; (1981), which features portraits of the band by a number of artists, and 38 years later, The Who&#x27;s &quot;WHO&quot; (2019).

In 1968, commissioned by Dodo Editions, Blake made &quot;Babe Rainbow&quot;, a screen-print on tinplate, in an edition of 10,000, which sold for £1 each.

In 1969, Blake left London to live near Bath. His work changed direction to feature scenes based on English Folklore and characters from Shakespeare. In the early 1970s, he made a set of watercolour paintings to illustrate Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; using a young artist, Celia Wanless, as the model for Alice and in 1975 he was a founder of the Brotherhood of Ruralists. Blake moved back to London in 1979 and his work returned to earlier popular culture references.

In 1990 and 1991, Blake painted the artwork to Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1991 million-selling live album &quot;24 Nights&quot;. A scrapbook featuring all of Blake&#x27;s drawing was later released. In January 1992, Blake appeared on BBC2&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Arena&quot; &quot;Masters of the Canvas&quot; documentary and painted the portrait of the wrestler Kendo Nagasaki.

In June 2006, as The Who returned to play Leeds University 36 years after recording their seminal &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; album in 1970, Blake unveiled a &quot;Live at Leeds 2&quot; artwork to commemorate the event. The artist and The Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend signed an edition which will join the gallery&#x27;s collection. More recently, Blake has created artist&#x27;s editions for the opening of the Pallant House Gallery which houses collections of his most famous paintings. The works are homages to his earlier work on the &quot;Stanley Road&quot; album cover and Babe Rainbow prints. He designed a series of deck chairs.

In 2006, Blake designed the cover for Oasis greatest hits album &quot;Stop the Clocks&quot;. According to Blake, he chose all of the objects in the picture at random, but the sleeves of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; were in the back of his mind. He claims, &quot;It&#x27;s using the mystery of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; and running away with it.&quot; Familiar cultural icons which can be seen on the cover include Dorothy from &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;, Michael Caine (replacing the original image of Marilyn Monroe, which could not be used for legal reasons) and the seven dwarfs from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Blake revealed that the final cover wasn&#x27;t the original which featured an image of the shop &#x27;Granny Takes a Trip&#x27; on the Kings Road in Chelsea, London.

Blake created an updated version of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;—with famous figures from Liverpool history—for the campaign for Liverpool to become European Capital of Culture in 2008, and created a series of prints to celebrate Liverpool&#x27;s status. In 2008, Blake painted a pig for the public art event &quot;King Bladud&#x27;s Pigs in Bath&quot; in the city of Bath.

A fan of Chelsea Football Club, Blake designed a collage to promote the team&#x27;s home kit in 2010. He also designed a shopping bag for the Lucky Brand Jeans company for the holiday season.

As part of &#x27;The Big Egg Hunt&#x27; February 2012 Sir Peter Blake designed an egg on behalf of Dorchester Collection. Blake created the carpet which runs through the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Middlesex Guildhall building.

As he approached his 80th birthday, Blake undertook a project to recreate the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album cover with images of British cultural icons of his life that he most admires. He stated: &quot;I had a very long list of people who I wanted to go in but couldn&#x27;t fit everyone in – I think that shows how strong British culture and its legacy of the last six decades is.&quot; The new version was created for a special birthday celebration of Blake&#x27;s life at fashion designer Wayne Hemingway&#x27;s Vintage festival at Boughton House, Northamptonshire in July 2012.

An exhibition was held at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester to celebrate the artist&#x27;s long associations with music called &quot;Peter Blake and Pop Music&quot; (23 June to 7 October 2012). In 2014, he exhibited his illustrations inspired by &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; at National Museum Cardiff. In 2016, Blake designed the artwork for Eric Clapton&#x27;s studio album &quot;I Still Do&quot;.

In March 2020, Blake&#x27;s poster &quot;London Stands Together&quot; was distributed in every copy of London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper.

== Honours ==
Blake became a Royal Academician in 1981. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1983 Birthday Honours and Knight Bachelor in the 2002 Birthday Honours for his services to art. Blake was knighted by Prince Charles in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Retrospectives of Blake&#x27;s work were held at the Tate in 1983 and Tate Liverpool in 2008. In February 2005, the Sir Peter Blake Music Art Gallery, located in the School of Music, University of Leeds, was opened by the artist. The permanent exhibition features 20 examples of Blake&#x27;s album sleeve art, including the only public showing of a signed print of his &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; artwork.

In March 2011, Blake was awarded an honorary DMus from the University of Leeds, and marked by the public unveiling of his artwork for the Boogie For Stu album. On 18 July 2011, Blake was awarded an honorary degree for Doctor of Art from Nottingham Trent University. In 2014 he was made an honorary academician at the Royal West of England Academy, Bristol.

<doc id="212504" wikidata="Q432771" url="?curid=212504" title="Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester">
<text>Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester (7 January 13558 or 9 September 1397) was the fifth surviving son and youngest child of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault.

==Early life==
Thomas was born on 7 January 1355 at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire after two short-lived brothers, one of whom had also been baptised Thomas. He married Eleanor de Bohun in 1374, was given Pleshey Castle in Essex, and was appointed Constable of the Realm, a position previously held by the Bohuns. The younger sister of Woodstock&#x27;s wife, Mary de Bohun, was subsequently married to Henry of Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby, who later became King Henry IV of England.

In 1377, at the age of 22, Woodstock was knighted and created Earl of Buckingham. On 22 June 1380 he became Earl of Essex in right of his wife. In 1385, he received the title Duke of Aumale, and at about the same time was created Duke of Gloucester.

==Campaign in Brittany==

Thomas of Woodstock was in command of a large campaign in northern France that followed the War of the Breton Succession of 1343–1364. The earlier conflict was marked by the efforts of John IV, Duke of Brittany to secure control of the Duchy of Brittany against his rival Charles of Blois. John was supported in this struggle by the armies of the Kingdom of England, whereas Charles was supported by the Kingdom of France. At the head of an English army, John prevailed after Charles was killed in battle in 1364, but the French continued to undermine his position, and he was later forced into exile in England.

John returned to Brittany in 1379, supported by Breton barons who feared the annexation of Brittany by France. An English army was sent under Woodstock to support his position. Due to concerns about the safety of a longer shipping route to Brittany itself, the army was ferried instead to the English continental stronghold of Calais in July 1380.

As Woodstock marched his 5,200 men east of Paris, they were confronted by the army of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, at Troyes, but the French had learned from the Battle of Crécy in 1346 and the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 not to offer a pitched battle to the English. Eventually, the two armies simply marched away. French defensive operations were then thrown into disarray by the death of King Charles V of France on 16 September 1380. Woodstock&#x27;s chevauchée continued westwards largely unopposed, and in November 1380 he laid siege to Nantes and its vital bridge over the Loire towards Aquitaine. However, he found himself unable to form an effective stranglehold, and urgent plans were put in place for Sir Thomas Felton to bring 2,000 reinforcements from England. By January, though, it had become apparent that the Duke of Brittany was reconciled to the new French king Charles VI, and with the alliance collapsing and dysentery ravaging his men, Woodstock abandoned the siege.

==Dispute with King Richard II==
Returning to England early in 1381, Thomas of Woodstock found that his brother, John of Gaunt, had married his wife&#x27;s sister, Mary de Bohun, to John&#x27;s own son Henry. The relations between the brothers, hitherto somewhat strained, were not improved by this event; presumably, Thomas was hoping to retain possession of Mary&#x27;s estates. Still, having taken part in crushing the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381, Thomas became more friendly with John, and in 1385 was created duke of Gloucester. However, this mark of favour did not prevent him from taking up an attitude of hostility to his nephew, Richard II.

Thomas placed himself at the head of the party that was opposed to the royal advisers, Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, whose recent elevation to Duke of Ireland had aroused discontent. Supported by those who were indignant at the extravagance and incompetence, real or alleged, of the king, Thomas was soon in a position of authority. He forced the dismissal and impeachment of Suffolk; was a member of the commission appointed in 1386 to reform the kingdom and the royal household; and took up arms when Richard began proceedings against the commissioners. Having defeated de Vere at the Battle of Radcot Bridge in December 1387 the duke and his associates entered London to find the king powerless in their hands. Thomas, who had previously threatened his nephew with deposition, was only restrained from taking this extreme step by the influence of his colleagues; but, as the leader of the &quot;Lords Appellant&quot; in the &quot;Merciless Parliament,&quot; which met in February 1388 and was packed with his supporters, he took revenge upon his enemies, which culminated in a successful rebellion in 1388 that significantly weakened the king&#x27;s power.

Richard II quickly regained control and eventually, in 1397, managed to dispose of the Lords Appellant. By 1396, Thomas and Richard were again at odds over policy. In 1397, Thomas was arrested at his home by the king himself and was imprisoned in Calais to await trial for treason. During that time he was murdered by being smothered between two feather beds, probably by a group of men led by Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, and the knight Sir Nicholas Colfox, presumably on behalf of Richard II; parliament declared him guilty of treason and his estates forfeited. These events caused an outcry among the nobility of England that is considered by many to have added to Richard&#x27;s unpopularity.

Thomas was buried in Westminster Abbey, first in the Chapel of Saint Edmund and Saint Thomas in October 1397, and two years later reburied in the Chapel of Saint Edward the Confessor. His wife was buried next to him.

==Marriage and progeny==
Thomas married Eleanor de Bohun (c. 1366–1399), the elder daughter and co-heiress (with her sister Mary de Bohun) of Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341–1373). Thomas of Woodstock and his wife Eleanor had issue as follows:
*Humphrey, 2nd Earl of Buckingham (c. 13811399), died aged 18, unmarried and without issue;
*Anne of Gloucester (c. 13831438) who married three times:
**Firstly to Thomas Stafford, 3rd Earl of Stafford, without issue;
**Secondly to Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford, the youngest brother of her first husband, by whom she had issue one son and two daughters; 
**Thirdly to William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu (1374–1420), by whom she had issue, represented today by the Wrey baronets (heirs of the Bourchier Earls of Bath), who quarter the arms of Bohun, Bourchier and Thomas of Woodstock.
*Joan (1384–1400), who married Gilbert Talbot, 5th Baron Talbot (1383–1419) and died in childbirth
*Isabel (12 March 1385/1386c.1421), a nun of the Order of Minoresses 
*Philippa ( - ). Died young. 

As he was attainted as a traitor, his dukedom of Gloucester was forfeit. The title Earl of Buckingham was inherited by his son, who died in 1399 only two years after Thomas&#x27; own death. Thomas of Woodstock&#x27;s eldest daughter, Anne, married into the powerful Stafford family, who were Earls of Stafford. Her son, Humphrey Stafford was created Duke of Buckingham in 1444 and also inherited part of the de Bohun estates.

The other part of these estatesincluding the Earldom of Hereford, which had belonged to Mary de Bohun and had then become incorporated into the holdings of the House of Lancasterbecame a matter of contention in the latter 15th century.

==In literature==

*Thomas of Woodstock&#x27;s murder plays a prominent part in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard II&quot;, though he is dead at the time of the play&#x27;s beginning.
*He also is the subject of &quot;Thomas of Woodstock&quot;, another Elizabethan drama by an anonymous playwright. Because of its stylistic affinities to Shakespeare&#x27;s play, it is also called &quot;Richard the Second Part One&quot;.

<doc id="212505" wikidata="Q1277289" url="?curid=212505" title="Earl of Essex">
<text>Earl of Essex is a title in the Peerage of England which was first created in the 12th century by King Stephen of England. The title has been recreated eight times from its original inception, beginning with a new first Earl upon each new creation. The most well-known Earls of Essex were Thomas Cromwell (c. 14851540) (sixth creation), chief minister to King Henry VIII, Sir William Parr (1513-1571) who was brother to Queen Catherine Parr who was the sixth wife of King Henry VIII, and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (1565–1601) (eighth creation), a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I who led Essex&#x27;s Rebellion in 1601.

The current holder of the earldom is Paul Capell, 11th Earl of Essex (born 1944), a retired school teacher from Caton, Lancashire.

The family seat was Cassiobury House, near Watford, Hertfordshire.

==Early creations==
The title was first created in the 12th century for Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex (died 1144). Upon the death of the third earl in 1189, the title became dormant or extinct. Geoffrey Fitz Peter, who had married Beatrice de Say, granddaughter of the first earl&#x27;s sister and eventual heir to the Mandeville honour, gained the earldom in 1199 at its second creation by King John. The Essex title passed to two of Fitz Peter&#x27;s sons before again becoming extinct upon the death of the second son, William, the 3rd Earl of Essex, who had taken the surname de Mandeville.

The third creation was for Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford in 1239, whose father Henry had married Maud, sister of the sixth earl. All three of the Earldoms of Hereford, Northampton and of Essex became extinct in 1373. There were several more creations, including one briefly for Thomas Cromwell, before the Devereux creation in 1572. Walter Devereux was the first earl of this creation; he was related to the Bourchier family who had held the honour earlier. This line continued to his son Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (1566–1601) a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I and his son Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, the general who commanded the Parliamentary army at the Battle of Edge Hill, the first major battle of the English Civil War (for further history of the Devereux family, see the Viscount Hereford). Following its extinction in September 1646, the present creation was made in 1661.

==Capell creation==
The Capell (or Capel) family descends from Sir Arthur Capell of Raines Hall in Essex and of Hadham in Hertfordshire. His grandson Arthur Capell represented Hertfordshire in both the Short and Long Parliaments. In 1641 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Capell of Hadham, in the County of Hertford. Capell later fought as a Royalist in the Civil War. He was tried and condemned to death by the Parliamentarians and beheaded in May 1649. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. In 1661 he was created Viscount Malden, in the County of Essex, and Earl of Essex, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to, firstly, his brother Henry Capell (later Baron Capell of Tewkesbury; see below), failing which to, secondly, his brother Edward Capell. These titles are also in the Peerage of England. Lord Essex later served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and as First Lord of the Treasury. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the second Earl. He was a lieutenant-general in the army and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Hertfordshire. He was succeeded by his son, the third Earl. He served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1739 to 1743 and was also Lord-Lieutenant of Hertfordshire. When he died the titles passed to his son, the fourth Earl. He also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Hertfordshire.

He was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, the fifth Earl. He sat in the House of Commons for many years and was Lord-Lieutenant of Hertfordshire from 1801 to 1817. Lord Essex assumed the surname of Coningsby. In 1839, at the age of seventy-six, he married the vocalist and actress Catherine Stephens. He was succeeded by his nephew, the sixth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. John Thomas Capell, second son of the fourth Earl from his second marriage to Harriet Bladen. On his death, the titles passed to his grandson, the seventh Earl. He was the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur de Vere Capell, Viscount Malden, eldest son of the sixth Earl. The line of the sixth Earl failed on the death of the seventh Earl&#x27;s grandson, the ninth Earl, in 1981. The succession was unclear and it was not until 1989 that the late Earl&#x27;s third cousin once removed, Robert Edward de Vere Capell, managed to prove his claim, and became the tenth Earl. He was the great-grandson of the Hon. Algernon Henry Champagné Capell (younger brother of the sixth Earl), son of the aforementioned the Hon. John Thomas Capell (half-brother of the fifth Earl), son of the second marriage of the fourth Earl. the titles are held by his only son, the eleventh Earl, who succeeded in 2005.

Two other members of the Capell family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Henry Capell, second son of the first Baron, was a politician and was created Baron Capell of Tewkesbury in 1692. The Hon. Sir Thomas Bladen Capell (1776–1853), youngest son of the second marriage of the fourth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy.

==Family tree==
==Ancestral seat==

At the time of the Capell creation, the Barons Hadham were based at the family seat at Hadham Hall in Little Hadham, Hertfordshire, which was originally purchased in the early 16th century by Sir William Capel, a wealthy draper and Lord Mayor of London. In 1627 his descendant Arthur Capell married Elizabeth Morrison, daughter and heir of Sir Charles Morrison of Cassiobury in Watford. The turmoil of the Civil War took its toll on the Capell family, and Arthur, a Royalist, was executed in 1649. Arthur Capell&#x27;s eldest son, also called Arthur Capell, inherited both the Hadham and Cassiobury estates. After the Restoration, having been created Viscount Malden and 1st Earl of Essex, the younger Capell became an ambitious courtier of Charles II. Now one of the wealthiest men in England, he embarked on an ambitious project to redecorate Cassiobury House in the style of the sumptuous state rooms of Windsor Castle, hoping to attract a visit from the King to Cassiobury. Although a royal visit was not forthcoming, the 1st Earl&#x27;s favour for Cassiobury completed the family&#x27;s move to Watford, and Hadham Hall fell into disuse. The Capell family finally sold Hadham in 1900 and it is now a private residence; Cassiobury remained in the family until 1927 when, like many other British country houses in the period between the world wars, it was demolished.

<doc id="212513" wikidata="Q1318169" url="?curid=212513" title="Good agricultural practice">
<text>Good agricultural practice (GAP) is a certification system for agriculture, specifying procedures (and attendant documentation) that must be implemented to create food for consumers or further processing that is safe and wholesome, using sustainable methods. While there are numerous competing definitions of what methods constitute good agricultural practice, there are several broadly accepted schemes that producers can adhere too.

==Motivation==

Introduction of GAP is particularly desirable when there is chronic overuse and misuse of agricultural pesticides. Governments seek to reduce the use of pesticides by promoting alternative methods of pest management, while at the same time ensuring a steady production of safe and wholesome food.

== Organizations ==

===Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations GAP===
The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) uses good agricultural practice as a collection of principles applying to on-farm production and post-production processes, resulting in safe and healthy food and non-food agricultural products, while taking into account economical, social and environmental sustainability.

GAPs require maintaining a common database on integrated production techniques for each of the major agro-ecological area (see ecoregion). They collect, analyze and disseminate information of good practices in relevant geographical contexts.

===United States Department of Agriculture GAP/GHP Program===
The United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Marketing Service operates an audit/certification program to verify that farms use good agricultural practice or good handling practice. It is a voluntary program typically used by growers and packers to satisfy contractual requirements with retail and food service buyers. The program was implemented in 2002 after the New Jersey Department of Agriculture petitioned USDA-AMS to implement an audit-based program to verify conformance to the 1998 Food &amp; Drug Administration publication entitled, &quot;Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.&quot;

The program has been updated several times since 2002, and includes additional certification programs such as commodity specific audit programs for mushrooms, tomatoes, leafy greens, and cantaloupes. In 2009, USDA-AMS participated in the GAPs Harmonization Initiative which &quot;harmonized&quot; 14 of the major North American GAP audit standards, which in 2011 resulted in the release and implementation of the Produce GAPs Harmonized Food Safety Standard.

=== Korean National Agricultural Products Quality Management Institute GAP Program ===
Following the principles established by the United Nations and several of its members, Korea has established a GAP program that has been in effect since 2006.

== Recommendations ==

===Soil===

* Reducing erosion by wind and water through hedging and ditching.
* Application of fertilizers at appropriate moments and in adequate doses (i.e., when the plant needs the fertilizer), to avoid run-off
**The use of sewage sludge is currently not allowed on GAP-certified farms of horticultural crops (though it is unclear whether this includes compost derived from sewage sludge and other human excreta derived fertilizers).
* Maintaining or restoring soil organic content, by manure application, use of grazing, crop rotation
* Reduce soil compaction issues (by avoiding using heavy mechanical devices)
* Maintain soil structure, by limiting heavy tillage practices
* &quot;In situ&quot; green manuring by growing pulse crops like cowpea, horse gram, sunn hemp etc.

===Water===

* Practice scheduled irrigation, with monitoring of plant needs, and soil water reserve status to avoid water loss by drainage
* Prevent soil salinization by limiting water input to needs, and recycling water whenever possible
* Avoid crops with high water requirements in a low availability region
* Avoid drainage and fertilizer run-off
* Maintain permanent soil covering, in particular in winter to avoid nitrogen run-off
* Manage carefully water table, by limiting heavy output of water
* Restore or maintain wetlands (see marshlands)
* Provide good water points for livestock
* Harvest water &quot;in situ&quot; by digging catch pits, crescent bunds across slope

===Animal production, health and welfare===

* Respect of animal well-being (freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury or disease; freedom to express normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress)
* Avoid nontherapeutic mutilations, surgical or invasive procedures, such as tail docking and debeaking;
* Avoid negative impacts on landscape, environment and life: contamination of land for grazing, food, water and air
* Check stocks and flows, maintain structure of systems
* Prevent chemical and medical residues from entering the food chain
* Minimize non-therapeutic use of antibiotics or hormones
* Avoid feeding animals with animal wastes or animal matter (reducing the risk of alien viral or transgenic genes, or prions such as mad cow disease),
* Minimize transport of live animals (by foot, rail or road) (reducing the risk of epidemics, e.g., foot and mouth disease)
* Prevent waste run-off (e.g. nitrate contamination of water tables from pigs), nutrient loss and greenhouse gas emissions (methane from cows)
* Prefer safety measures standards in manipulation of equipment
* Apply traceability processes on the whole production chain (breeding, feed, medical treatment...) for consumer security and feedback possibility in case of a food crisis (e.g., dioxin).

===Healthcare and public health===

* Quality assurance of the horticultural or agricultural production of medicinal plant

===Smallholder productivity===
Crop demand is expected to double as the world&#x27;s population reaches 9.1 billion by 2050. Increasing the quantity and quality of food in response to growing demand will require increased agricultural production. Good agricultural practices, often combined with effective input use, are among the best ways to increase smallholder productivity. Many agribusinesses are building sustainable supply chains to increase production and improve quality.

<doc id="212514" wikidata="Q748786" url="?curid=212514" title="Cod liver oil">
<text>Cod liver oil is a dietary supplement derived from liver of cod fish (Gadidae). As with most fish oils, it contains the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and also vitamin A and vitamin D. 

Historically, it was given to children in the United States in the 19th Century&#x27;s as a patent medicine and by the end of the century was being praised by doctors in medical journals. After it was shown, in 1920 that vitamin D deficiency was the cause of rickets, cod liver oil was given as a rich source of vitamin D.

==Manufacture==
Cod liver oil has traditionally come in many grades. Cod liver oil for human consumption is pale and straw-colored, with a mild flavor. Scandinavian Vikings produced cod liver oil by laying birch tree branches over a kettle of water, and fresh livers were laid over the branches. The water was brought to a boil and as the steam rose, the oil from the liver dripped into the water and was skimmed off. There was also a method for producing fresh raw cod liver oil.
In the Industrial Revolution, cod liver oil became popular for industrial purposes. Livers placed in barrels to rot, with the oil skimmed off over the season, was the main method for producing this oil. The resulting oil was brown and foul-tasting. In the 1800s cod liver oil became popular as a medicine and both pale and brown oils were used. Brown oils were common because they were cheaper to produce. Some doctors believed in only using the fresh pale oil, while others believed the brown oil was better. The rancid brown oils tended to cause intestinal upset.

The Möller Process was invented by Peter Möller in 1850. The livers are ground with water into a slurry, then this is gently simmered until the oil rises to the top. The oil is skimmed off and purified. Other methods used in modern times include the Cold Flotation Process, pressure extraction, and pressure cooking. These all require further purification steps to get a pure oil.

==Therapeutic uses==
Though similar in fatty acid composition to other fish oils, cod liver oil has higher concentrations of vitamins A and D. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a tablespoon (13.6 grams or 14.8 mL) of cod liver oil contains 4,080 μg of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 μg (1360 IU) of vitamin D. The Dietary Reference Intake of vitamin A is 900 μg per day for adult men and 700 μg per day for women, while that for vitamin D is 15 μg per day. The Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) are 3000 μg/day and 100 μg/day, respectively. People consuming cod liver oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids should pay attention to how much vitamin A and vitamin D this adds to their diet.

Cod liver oil is approximately 20% omega-3 fatty acids. For this reason, cod liver oil may be beneficial in secondary prophylaxis after a heart attack. Diets supplemented with cod liver oil have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on psoriasis, and daily supplementation has been shown to be correlated with lower rates of high-severity depression.

==Potential adverse effects==

A tablespoon (13.6 g) of cod liver oil contains 136% of the UL for preformed vitamin A (retinol). Vitamin A accumulates in the liver, and can reach harmful levels sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A. Pregnant women may want to consider consulting a doctor when taking cod liver oil because of the high amount of retinol.

Fatty acid oxidation and environmental toxins content are reduced when purification processes are applied to produce refined fish oil products.

==Other uses==
In Newfoundland, cod liver oil was sometimes used as the liquid base for traditional red ochre paint, the coating of choice for use on outbuildings and work buildings associated with the cod fishery.

In Tübingen, Germany, drinking a glass of cod liver oil is the punishment for the loser at the traditional Stocherkahnrennen, a punting boat race by University of Tübingen groups.

<text>The 7.5 cm Infanteriegeschütz 37 (7.5 cm IG 37) was an infantry support gun, used by Germany during World War II. The guns were originally designated 7.5 cm PaK 37. The IG 37s were manufactured from carriages of 3.7 cm Pak 36s (and the nearly identical Soviet 3.7 cm PaK 158(r)) and a barrel designed originally for the IG 42 infantry support gun. As an anti-tank weapon it used a hollow charge shell with of explosives to penetrate up to with a velocity of . The first 84 guns were delivered in June 1944. By the end of the war 1,304 guns were operational.

While the gun carriage was an old design, the gun itself was a new design created by Krupp, though the design had been shelved at the time of its conception. The gun has two distinctive features: the first is the large four-baffle muzzle brake and the second is the vertical sliding-block breech that was considered unusual for a Krupp designed gun. The breech operates in a semi-automatic fashion, in that once the gun was fired the breech block would open and eject the spent casing and remained open to allow for rapid reloading. The breech would then be closed once the next round was loaded and the gun was then ready to fire.

<text>Pegasus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the winged horse Pegasus in Greek mythology. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and is one of the 88 constellations recognised today.

With an apparent magnitude varying between 2.37 and 2.45, the brightest star in Pegasus is the orange supergiant Epsilon Pegasi, also known as Enif, which marks the horse&#x27;s muzzle. Alpha (Markab), Beta (Scheat), and Gamma (Algenib), together with Alpha Andromedae (Alpheratz) form the large asterism known as the &quot;Square of Pegasus&quot;. Twelve star systems have been found to have exoplanets. 51 Pegasi was the first Sun-like star discovered to have an exoplanet companion.

==Mythology==
The Babylonian constellation IKU (field) had four stars of which three were later part of the Greek constellation &quot;Hippos&quot; (Pegasus). Pegasus, in Greek mythology, was a winged horse with magical powers. One myth regarding his powers says that his hooves dug out a spring, Hippocrene, which blessed those who drank its water with the ability to write poetry. Pegasus was born when Perseus cut off the head of Medusa, who was impregnated by the god Poseidon. He was born with Chrysaor from Medusa&#x27;s blood. Eventually, it became the horse for Bellerophon, who was asked to kill the Chimera and succeeded with the help of Athena and Pegasus. Despite this success, after the death of his children, Bellerophon asked Pegasus to take him to Mount Olympus. Though Pegasus agreed, he plummeted back to Earth after Zeus either threw a thunderbolt at him or sent a gadfly to make Pegasus buck him off.
In ancient Persia, Pegasus was depicted by al-Sufi as a complete horse facing east, unlike most other uranographers, who had depicted Pegasus as half of a horse, rising out of the ocean. In al-Sufi&#x27;s depiction, Pegasus&#x27;s head is made up of the stars of Lacerta the lizard. Its right foreleg is represented by β Peg and its left foreleg is represented by η Peg, μ Peg, and λ Peg; its hind legs are marked by 9 Peg. The back is represented by π Peg and μ Cyg, and the belly is represented by ι Peg and κ Peg.

In Chinese astronomy, the modern constellation of Pegasus lies in The Black Tortoise of the north (北方玄武), where the stars were classified in several separate asterisms of stars. Epsilon and Theta Pegasi are joined with Alpha Aquarii to form &quot;Wei&quot; 危 &quot;rooftop&quot;, with Theta forming the roof apex.

In Hindu astronomy, Pegasus is contained within the 25th nakshatra lunar mansion Purva Bhadrapada. More specifically, it represented a bedstead that was a resting place for the Moon.

For the Warrau and Arawak peoples in Guyana the stars in the Great Square, corresponding to parts of Pegasus and of Andromeda, represented a barbecue, taken up to the sky by the seven hunters of the myth of Siritjo.

==Characteristics==
Covering 1121 square degrees, Pegasus is the seventh-largest of the 88 constellations. Pegasus is bordered by Andromeda to the north and east, Lacerta to the north, Cygnus to the northwest, Vulpecula, Delphinus and Equuleus to the west, Aquarius to the south and Pisces to the south and east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is &quot;Peg&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 35 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between 2.33° and 36.61°. Its position in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers north of 53°S.

Pegasus is dominated by a roughly square asterism (the Square of Pegasus) although one of the stars, formerly known as Delta Pegasi or Sirrah, is now officially assigned to Andromeda and is known as Alpha Andromedae, or Alpheratz. Traditionally, the body of the horse consists of a quadrilateral formed by the stars α Peg, β Peg, γ Peg, and α And. The front legs of the winged horse are formed by two crooked lines of stars, one leading from η Peg to κ Peg and the other from μ Peg to 1 Pegasi. Another crooked line of stars from α Peg via θ Peg to ε Peg forms the neck and head; ε is the snout.

===Stars===

Bayer catalogued what he counted as 23 stars in the constellation, giving them the Bayer designations Alpha to Psi. He saw Pi Pegasi as one star, and was uncertain of its brightness, wavering between magnitude 4 and 5. Flamsteed labelled this star 29 Pegasi, but Bode concluded that the stars 27 and 29 Pegasi should be Pi1 and Pi2 Pegasi and that Bayer had seen them as a single star. Flamsteed added lower case letters e through to y, omitting A to D as they had been used on Bayer&#x27;s chart to designate neighbouring constellations and the equator. He numbered 89 stars (now with Flamsteed designations), though 6 and 11 turned out to be stars in Aquarius. Within the constellation&#x27;s borders there are 177 stars of apparent magnitude 6.5 or greater.

Epsilon Pegasi, also known as Enif, marks the horse&#x27;s muzzle. The brightest star in Pegasus, is an orange supergiant of spectral type K21b that is around 12 times as massive as the Sun and is around 690 light-years distant from Earth. It is an irregular variable, its apparent magnitude varying between 2.37 and 2.45. Lying near Enif is AG Pegasi, an unusual star that brightened to magnitude 6.0 around 1885 before dimming to magnitude 9. It is composed of a red giant and white dwarf, estimated to be around 2.5 and 0.6 times the mass of the Sun respectively. With its outburst taking over 150 years, it has been described as the slowest nova ever recorded.

Three stars with Bayer designations that lie within the Great Square are variable stars. Phi and Psi Pegasi are pulsating red giants, while Tau Pegasi (the proper name is Salm), is a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. Rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 150 km s−1, Kerb is almost 30 times as luminous as the Sun and has a pulsation period of 56.5 minutes. With an outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 7,762 K, it is a white star with a spectral type of A5IV.

Zeta, Xi, Rho and Sigma Pegasi mark the horse&#x27;s neck. The brightest of these with a magnitude of 3.4 is Zeta, also traditionally known as Homam. Lying seven degrees southwest of Markab, it is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8V located around 209 light-years distant. It is a slowly pulsating B star that varies slightly in luminosity with a period of 22.952 ± 0.804 hours, completing 1.04566 cycles per day. Xi lies 2 degrees northeast, and is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F6V that is 86% larger and 17% more massive that the Sun, and radiate 4.5 times the solar luminosity. It has a red dwarf companion that is 192.3 au distant. If (as is likely) the smaller star is in orbit around the larger star, then it would take around 2000 years to complete a revolution. Theta Pegasi marks the horse&#x27;s eye. Also known as Biham, it is a 3.43-magnitude white main sequence star of spectral type A2V, around 1.8 times as massive, 24 times as luminous, and 2.3 times as wide as the Sun.

Alpha (Markab), Beta (Scheat), and Gamma (Algenib), together with Alpha Andromedae (Alpheratz or Sirrah) form the large asterism known as the &quot;Square of Pegasus&quot;. The brightest of these, Alpheratz was also known as both Delta Pegasi and Alpha Andromedae before being placed in Andromeda in 1922 with the setting of constellation boundaries. The second brightest star is Scheat, a red giant of spectral type M2.5II-IIIe located around 196 light-years away from Earth. It has expanded until it is some 95 times as large, and has a total luminosity 1,500 times that of the Sun. Beta Pegasi is a semi-regular variable that varies from magnitude 2.31 to 2.74 over a period of 43.3 days. Markab and Algenib are blue-white stars of spectral types B9III and B2IV located 133 and 391 light-years distant respectively. Appearing to have moved off the main sequence as their core hydrogen supply is being or has been exhausted, they are enlarging and cooling to eventually become red giant stars. Markab has an apparent magnitude of 2.48, while Algenib is a Beta Cephei variable that varies between magnitudes 2.82 and 2.86 every 3 hours 38 minutes, and also exhibits some slow pulsations every 1.47 days.

Eta and Omicron Pegasi mark the left knee and Pi Pegasi the left hoof, while Iota and Kappa Pegasi mark the right knee and hoof. Also known as Matar, Eta Pegasi is the fifth-brightest star in the constellation. Shining with an apparent magnitude of 2.94, it is a multiple star system composed of a yellow giant of spectral type G2 and a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type A5V that are 3.2 and 2.0 times as massive as the Sun. The two revolve around each other every 2.24 years. Farther afield is a binary system of two G-type main sequence stars, that would take 170,000 years to orbit the main pair if they are in fact related. Omicron Pegasi has a magnitude of 4.79. Located 300 ± 20 light-years distant from Earth, it is a white subgiant that has begun to cool, expand and brighten as it exhausts its core hydrogen fuel and moves off the main sequence. Pi1 and Pi2 Pegasi appear as an optical double to the unaided eye as they are separated by 10 arcminutes, and are not a true binary system. Located 289 ± 8 light-years distant, Pi1 is an ageing yellow giant of spectral type G6III, 1.92 times as massive and around 200 times as luminous as the Sun. Pi2 is a yellow-white subgiant that is 2.5 times as massive as the Sun and has expanded to 8 times the Sun&#x27;s radius and brightened to 92 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. It is surrounded by a circumstellar disk spinning at 145 km a second, and is 263 ± 4 light-years distant from Earth.

IK Pegasi is a close binary comprising an A-type main-sequence star and white dwarf in very close orbit; the latter a candidate for a future type Ia supernova as its main star runs out of core hydrogen fuel and expands into a giant and transfers material to the smaller star.

Twelve star systems have been found to have exoplanets. 51 Pegasi was the first Sun-like star discovered to have an exoplanet companion; 51 Pegasi b (unofficially named Bellerophon, officially named Dimidium) is a hot Jupiter close to its star, completing an orbit every four days. Spectroscopic analysis of HD 209458 b, an extrasolar planet in this constellation, has provided the first evidence of atmospheric water vapor beyond the Solar System, while extrasolar planets orbiting the star HR 8799 also in Pegasus are the first to be directly imaged. V391 Pegasi is a hot subdwarf star that has been found to have a planetary companion.

===Deep-sky objects===

M15 (NGC 7078) is a globular cluster of magnitude 6.4, 34,000 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class IV cluster, which means that it is fairly rich and concentrated towards its center. M15 was discovered in 1746 by Jean-Dominique Maraldi. Pease 1 is a planetary nebula located within the globular cluster and was the first planetary nebula known to exist within a globular cluster. It has an apparent magnitude of 15.5.

NGC 7331 is a spiral galaxy located in Pegasus, 38 million light-years distant with a redshift of 0.0027. It was discovered by musician-astronomer William Herschel in 1784 and was later one of the first nebulous objects to be described as &quot;spiral&quot; by William Parsons. Another of Pegasus&#x27;s galaxies is NGC 7742, a Type 2 Seyfert galaxy. Located at a distance of 77 million light-years with a redshift of 0.00555, it is an active galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its core. Its characteristic emission lines are produced by gas moving at high speeds around the central black hole.

Pegasus is also noted for its more unusual galaxies and exotic objects. Einstein&#x27;s Cross is a quasar that has been lensed by a foreground galaxy. The elliptical galaxy is 400 million light-years away with a redshift of 0.0394, but the quasar is 8 billion light-years away. The lensed quasar resembles a cross because the gravitational force of the foreground galaxy on its light creates four images of the quasar. Stephan&#x27;s Quintet is another unique object located in Pegasus. It is a cluster of five galaxies at a distance of 300 million light-years and a redshift of 0.0215. First discovered by Édouard Stephan, a Frenchman, in 1877, the Quintet is unique for its interacting galaxies. Two of the galaxies in the middle of the group have clearly moms to collide, sparking massive bursts of star formation and drawing off long &quot;tails&quot; of stars. Astronomers have predicted that all five galaxies may eventually merge into one large elliptical galaxy.

<doc id="212532" wikidata="Q449048" url="?curid=212532" title="Derren Brown">
<text>Derren Brown (born 27 February 1971) is an English mentalist, illusionist, and writer. He is a self-described &quot;psychological illusionist&quot; whose acts are often designed to expose the methods of those who claim to possess supernatural powers, such as faith healers and mediums. His live performances, which incorporate audience participation and comedy, often include statements describing how his results are achieved through a combination of psychology, showmanship, magic, misdirection, and suggestion.

Brown began performing in 1992, making his television debut with &quot;Mind Control&quot; (2000). He has since starred in several more shows for stage and television, including &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (2006) and &quot;Svengali&quot; (2012) which won him two Laurence Olivier Awards for Best Entertainment, as well as &quot;The Experiments&quot; (2011) which won him a BAFTA for Best Entertainment Programme at the 2012 awards. Brown made his Broadway debut with his 2019 stage show &quot;Secret&quot;. He has also written books for both magicians and the general public.

== Early life ==
Derren Brown was born in the London Borough of Croydon on 27 February 1971, the son of Chris and Bob Brown. He was raised in Croydon&#x27;s Purley area, which he described as &quot;the epitome of middle-class suburbia&quot;, and he has a brother who is nine years younger than him. He was privately educated at Whitgift School in South Croydon, where his father was a swimming coach, before going on to study law and German at the University of Bristol. While there, he attended a hypnotist show by Martin S. Taylor, which inspired him to turn to illusion and hypnosis as a career. As an undergraduate, he started working as a conjuror, performing the traditional skills of close-up magic in bars and restaurants. In 1992, he started performing stage shows at the University of Bristol under the stage name Darren V. Brown; the &quot;V&quot; stood for &quot;Victor&quot;.

== Career ==
At the International Magic shop in Clerkenwell, Brown met Scottish-American magician and comedian Jerry Sadowitz, who put him in touch with H&amp;R publishers and magician Andrew O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s production company Objective Productions. This led to his television debut with the show Mind Control (2000), which became one of the company&#x27;s award-winning productions. After several shows with Objective, Brown set up his own company Vaudeville Productions with former Objective executives Michael Vine, Andrew O’Connor, and Paul Sandler, in order to produce his own shows as well as other projects with other performers. Its first show was Brown&#x27;s TV special, &quot;Pushed to the Edge&quot;.

In 2008, Brown made a brief cameo in the supernatural drama series &quot;Crooked House&quot;. An interview with Brown was featured in Richard Dawkins&#x27; 2009 two-part documentary series &quot;The Enemies of Reason&quot;. Brown explained various psychological techniques used by purported psychics and spiritual mediums to manipulate their audiences. The most notable was cold reading, a technique which he discusses extensively in his book &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot;. Some video footage was also used from his TV special &quot;Messiah&quot;. As part of Channel 4&#x27;s 3D season in 2009, Brown presented &quot;Derren Brown&#x27;s 3D Magic Spectacular&quot;. The show was not a new special from Brown, who instead presented a number of other magicians and clips. However, he did include one extract taken from a 2006 episode of &quot;Trick of the Mind&quot; in which he found an object that had been hidden in the streets of Venice by a volunteer.

In January 2011, to celebrate 10 years since his first television appearance, Channel 4 held a special &quot;Derren Brown Night&quot;. As well as re-showing &quot;The Heist&quot; (which had won a recent poll of favourite Brown specials) and one of his &quot;Enigma&quot; live shows, the channel screened a special documentary called &quot;Derren Brown: Behind the Mischief&quot;. It was a personal and candid film about Brown which included the story of how he met his co-writer (who was featured in &quot;Seance&quot;), his mother&#x27;s feelings about his involvement in the &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; special, and an emotional visit back to his old school, university, and bars/pubs where he first began his career. Celebrity contributors included Matt Lucas, Jo Whiley, Stephen Merchant, and Simon Pegg. In January 2013, he was featured in a Channel 4 &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; special, where he appeared to have predicted all the correct boxes to win the big jackpot of £250,000. That same year, he appeared in a comedy sketch at the beginning of an &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Deal or No Deal&quot; special.

In January 2014, Brown appeared as himself in the &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot;, as part of a theory regarding how the title character faked his own death. On 9 November 2018, he appeared as a guest on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; to promote his Netflix special &quot;Sacrifice&quot;.

In February 2021, Brown appeared in a trailer for the horror video game &quot;Little Nightmares II&quot;, in which he discussed the nature of nightmares while some of the monsters featured in the game appeared around him.

== Methods ==
=== Suggested methods ===
Brown states that he uses a variety of methods to achieve his illusions including traditional magic/conjuring techniques, memory techniques, hypnosis, body language reading, cognitive psychology, cold reading, and psychological, subliminal (specifically the use of PWA; &quot;perception without awareness&quot;), and ideomotor suggestion. Others additionally ascribe methods to him that he denies, ranging from the pseudoscience neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) to paid actors.

In an interview in &quot;New Scientist&quot; in 2005, when asked how he &quot;acquired his psychological skills&quot;, Brown says that he learnt skills as a hypnotist, which he was not sure how to apply until he started performing close-up magic. When asked whether he is able to detect lies, Brown claimed to be able to read subtle cues such as micro-muscle movements that indicate to him if someone is lying. Concerning his apparent success at hypnotising people, he stated that he can normally spot a suggestible type of person and chooses that person to be his participant. He believes that the presence of a television camera also increases suggestibility.

Several authors have claimed that Brown uses neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) in his act which &quot;consists of a range of magical &#x27;tricks&#x27;, misdirection and, most intriguing, setting up audiences to provide the response that he wishes them to provide by using subtle subliminal cues in his conversation with them&quot;. In response to the accusation that he unfairly claims to be using NLP whenever he performs, he wrote, &quot;The truth is I have never mentioned it outside of my book.&quot; He does have an off-stage curiosity about the system, and discusses it in the larger context of hypnotism and suggestion. In his book &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot;, he mentions that he attended an NLP course with Richard Bandler, co-creator of NLP and mentor of Paul McKenna. He also describes the NLP concept of eye-accessing cues as a technique of &quot;limited use&quot; in his book &quot;Pure Effect&quot;. Brown also mentions in &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot; that NLP students were given a certificate after a four-day course, certifying them to practise NLP as a therapist. A year after Brown attended the class, he received a number of letters saying that he would receive another certificate, not for passing a test (as he discontinued practising NLP following the course), but for keeping in touch. After ignoring their request, he later received the new certificate for NLP in the post, unsolicited.

=== Actual versus suggested methods ===
Brown often claims to reveal the methods by which he achieves his tricks, but this is typically an additional layer of misdirection, as the stated methods are not the methods that he uses. The perception by his audience that he uses deep psychological insights typically aids the misdirection required for his tricks. He employs a variety of techniques to ensure his audience cannot deduce the methods behind his illusions. Some critics have argued that his presentation as a sceptic might be misleading, as certain elements of his performances could be interpreted as promoting pseudoscience. For example, after performing a trick in which he appeared to predict lottery numbers, his demonstrated explanation included using the Wisdom of Crowds, but it has been theorised that the actual method relied on split-screen video. Some commentators have suggested that such performances might inadvertently conflict with efforts to reduce magical thinking.

In a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article published in 2003, Simon Singh criticised Brown&#x27;s early TV appearances, arguing that he presented standard magic and mentalism effects—such as the classic ten-card poker deal trick—as genuine psychological manipulation. On Brown&#x27;s television and live shows, he often appears to show the audience how a particular effect was created—claiming to use techniques such as subliminal suggestion, hypnosis, and body language reading. Singh&#x27;s suggestion is that these explanations are dishonest. Furthermore, Singh took exception to the programme&#x27;s website being categorised under Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Science&quot; section. The mini-site was later reclassified under &#x27;Entertainment&#x27; instead of &#x27;Science&#x27;.

In his 2006 book &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot;, Brown wrote, &quot;I am often dishonest in my techniques, but always honest about my dishonesty... I happily admit cheating, as it&#x27;s all part of the game&quot; and claimed to never use actors or &quot;stooges&quot; in his work without informing the viewers, calling it &quot;artistically repugnant and simply unnecessary&quot;. However, in an October 2010 interview, Brown conceded that Singh may have had a point, explaining that at the start of his television career &quot;I was overstating the case, overstating my skills. I thought there&#x27;ll only be one show, there&#x27;ll never be a repeat, so I might as well go for it.&quot;

==Controversies==
In 2007, BBC News listed Brown&#x27;s shows &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; and &quot;Seance&quot; in a list of examples of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;legacy of controversy&quot;. Public complaints that &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; was distasteful, made light of suicide, and promoted gun culture were ultimately rejected by Ofcom on the basis that the context (a post-watershed magic show) was enough and that the warnings given were sufficient. Additionally, the use of a 15-minute time delay ensured no viewer would have seen the result of any mistake. The police had also warned that the show might inspire copycat acts. In 2013, Brown said, &quot;Controversy has never interested me for its own sake. It&#x27;s always been about doing stuff that feels dramatic.&quot;

Seance received a significant number of complaints, including 487 to Channel 4 and 208 to Ofcom. Most were from church groups and came before transmission, i.e. before Brown revealed during the broadcast that his attempt to contact the dead was a hoax. The show was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing. The GMB union criticised &quot;Heist&quot; on behalf of security workers, arguing it was &quot;irresponsible and insensitive&quot; in light of increased attacks on staff. Channel 4 responded by arguing that it was made &quot;very clear that attempting any form of robbery was criminal behaviour&quot;. An episode of &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;, which appeared to show Brown convincing someone to press a button even though they thought it would electrocute a kitten inside a metal box, caused charity Cats Protection to complain and news outlets to label Brown a &quot;cat killer&quot;. He responded by arguing they had misunderstood the trick as the box was not wired up and that he &quot;wasn’t glorifying cruelty to cats [...] people would have been hard-pressed to recreate the electrocution device at home even if they wanted to&quot;. Another episode, which saw someone hypnotised into thinking they had been killed in a car crash after not wearing a seatbelt, was criticised by a road safety charity which alleged it trivialised the issue.

Ofcom received 11 complaints and began an investigation relating to the safety of a scene in &quot;Hero at 30,000 Feet&quot;, in which the subject was shown chained to a railway line in order to escape from an oncoming train. The show is listed in the &quot;Other Programmes Not in Breach&quot; (p. 38) category of their Ofcom&#x27;s Broadcast Bulletin, Issue Number 168, without any explanation as to why it was decided that it is not in breach.

Self-proclaimed psychic Joe Power, the subject of the &quot;Derren Brown Investigates&quot; episode &quot;The Man Who Contacts the Dead&quot;, complained to Ofcom about being misled and treated unfairly and said the programme &quot;presented, disregarded or omitted material facts&quot;. He also alleged he had received threats from sceptics and had to move home because of it. Ofcom rejected his complaint on the basis that Power had been fully apprised of the sceptical nature of the programme, and his actions had been presented fairly.

Brown has faced allegations of using stooges in his work. Viewers complained that the subject of &quot;Apocalypse&quot; was an actor, pointing to his CastingCallPro account as evidence; Brown dismissed these allegations as conspiracy theories and called them untrue and hurtful, while the head of CastingCallPro pointed out that the subject had created an account on the website a long time ago but never completed his profile or looked for work on the website.

==Personal life==
Although Brown&#x27;s parents were not practising Christians, they sent him to Bible classes from the age of five because they believed it was the &quot;right thing to do&quot;. In an effort to deal with self-esteem and sexuality issues, he became an evangelical Christian as a teenager in order to present himself as confident and asexual; however, by the end of his teenage years, he decided that his beliefs had no basis and became an atheist.

In 2007, at the age of 36, Brown came out as gay via an article in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;. He was dating a designer named Marc at the time, though they later separated after eight years together.

Brown has been the patron of the Parrot Zoo Trust in Friskney since 2004. He told &quot;LeftLion&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of parrots. I think they&#x27;re fascinating creatures. Many of them live for longer than us humans and it&#x27;s interesting to me the way they learn to mimic human voices even though they don&#x27;t really comprehend what they&#x27;re saying.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s signature look consisted of short brown hair with sideburns and a goatee until he shaved both his head and face in 2013, though he now occasionally sports stubble. He told &quot;The Times&quot; later that year, &quot;I&#x27;m really not fussed about losing my hair. I started going bald when I was doing TV, and the make-up artist started putting all this powdery stuff on to thicken it. I got balder and balder and they put more and more of the stuff on, until it got to this weird point where on TV I had a full head of hair, but in real life I very obviously didn&#x27;t.&quot;

=== Books ===
Brown has written seven books: &quot;Absolute Magic&quot;, &quot;Pure Effect&quot;, &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot;, &quot;Confessions of a Conjuror&quot;, &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;A Book of Secrets&quot;, and &quot;Notes From a Fellow Traveller&quot;, and released books of his street photography and painted portraiture. The first two books are intended solely for practitioners of magic and mentalism, whilst his books &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot;, and &quot;Confessions of a Conjuror&quot; are aimed at the general public. He has also written a book exploring the history and philosophy of happiness; &quot;Happy: Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine&quot;.

&quot;Absolute Magic&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Model for Powerful Close-Up Performance&quot;, is not so much about magical methodology as about how magicians can make their performances magical; it is written in a variety of styles: sometimes humorous, sometimes serious. Brown critiques performances that he feels lack originality and encourages magicians to create more engaging and audience-focused experiences.Some reviewers have noted similarities between Brown&#x27;s discussions and Darwin Ortiz&#x27;s Strong Magic, though Brown frames these ideas within his personal experiences and performance philosophy.

&quot;Pure Effect&quot; is a more traditional book of trickery and technique and offers an insight into some of the methods that Brown employs, and offers a starting point for development for the reader&#x27;s own use.

Brown&#x27;s first two books were intended for magicians; they were written before his fame. He has said that he pulled them from the market when he found that non-magicians would bring them to his shows for autographs. He says he felt bad because, &quot;...they&#x27;re spending a lot of money on those things and...if they wanted to find out how I was doing the TV shows it wasn&#x27;t really answering that question.&quot;

&quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot; is Brown&#x27;s first book intended for the general public. It is a wide-ranging book in which Brown reveals some of the techniques he uses in his performances, delves into the structure and psychology of magic and discusses hypnosis. He also applies his insight to the paranormal industry, looking at the structure of beliefs and how psychology can explain why people become &#x27;true believers&#x27;. He also offers autobiographical stories about his own experiences as a former Christian, and discusses his scepticism about religion, allegedly &#x27;psychic&#x27; phenomena and other supernatural belief systems.

&quot;Confessions of a Conjuror&quot; was published by Channel 4 Books in October 2010. It is a mix of autobiography and humorous observation told mostly through footnotes and diversions while Brown describes performing a single card routine for a group of people at his old restaurant gig. ()

&quot;Happy: Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine&quot; was published on 22 September 2016 by Bantam Press. (). A condensed version of the book, entitled &quot;A Little Happier: Notes for reassurance&quot;, was published on 15 October 2020. ()

On 2 September 2021, &quot;A Book of Secrets: Finding Comfort in a Complex World&quot; was published by Bantam Press.

In 2023 &quot;Notes from a Fellow Traveller&quot; was published by The Neat Review. It was launched on 4 July at The Magic Circle and is aimed at magicians and mentalists rather than lay people. It is based on a journal written during Brown&#x27;s sell-out UK &quot;Showman&quot; tour in 2022/23 and was produced in paperback, hardback and a Deluxe Limited Edition of 300 copies.

=== Other productions and publications ===
Brown co-presented two web-based series for Channel 4; &quot;The Science of Scams&quot; and &quot;The Science of Attraction&quot;. In The Science of Scams, a number of videos were placed on YouTube purporting to show various kinds of paranormal phenomena such as ghosts, telekinesis and a tarot card reading. In a second series of videos, Brown and his co-presenter Kat Akingbade explained what was actually happening, exposing each as a specially created scam. The Science of Attraction was co-presented by Brown, Akingbade and Charlotte McDonnell (formerly Charlie McDonnell). The shows examined the physical and psychological factors that can influence our feelings of attraction to other people, especially those of the opposite sex. The series featured a number of experiments designed to show how these factors can be influenced.

Brown has recorded some audio extracts from &quot;Tricks of the Mind&quot;. In them he expounds on the three subjects essential to his performance—Magic, Memory, and Hypnosis. The extracts last around 40 minutes each, disclosing tips and techniques Brown uses in his acts (as well as day-to-day) and narrating the highlights of his book.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Picturebook&quot; is a near 3-hour home-made video. The first half explains in detail some classic card routines from his earlier career as a conjurer, all of which rely on sleight of hand, misdirection and audience management. The second looks at psychological card routines and shows a distinct move towards mentalism, for which he is now known. It is an instructional video for aspiring magicians and not an entertainment piece. For this reason, it was available only to practitioners through a password-protected &quot;magicians only&quot; area of his website. The clue to the password tells you that the word itself begins with T and is a type of palming trick.

&quot;International Magic Presents: The Derren Brown Lecture&quot; is an 80-minute lecture DVD of close-up mentalism and subsequent discussion of various aspects of Brown&#x27;s performance. Again, this product is not intended for general consumption but is directed at magicians and mentalists only.

In 2007, Brown performed in the short film &quot;Medium Rare&quot;.

In 2008, Brown made a guest acting appearance in BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Crooked House&quot; as Sir Roger Widdowson.

In 2008, Brown provided caricatures for &quot;The QI &#x27;F&#x27; annual&quot;.

In 2009, a book, &quot;Portraits&quot;, was released containing a selection of Brown&#x27;s paintings and bizarre caricatures of celebrities.

In 2010, Brown appeared in a special Comedy Gala for Channel 4 and Great Ormond Street Hospital. He appeared with Kevin Bishop, who played his jealous annoying twin &#x27;Darren&#x27;.

=== Thorpe Park ride ===
Brown created a new virtual reality dark ride at the Thorpe Park amusement park, which opened on 8 July 2016. &quot;Derren Brown&#x27;s Ghost Train&quot; was set aboard an old train carriage in an abandoned warehouse. The experience lasted around 13-15 minutes and was Thorpe Park&#x27;s most expensive ride experience. The ride had live-action actors and holograms while passengers were strapped in wearing VR headsets. In 2017, the attraction added new experiences to the train and &#x27;Rise of the Demon&#x27; to the name. The ride closed in 2022; it was rebranded and rethemed as Ghost Train, a project without Brown&#x27;s involvement.

=== Playing cards ===
In 2019, Brown collaborated with playing card company Theory11 on a deck of cards that are sold on the company&#x27;s website.

<doc id="212533" wikidata="Q627470" url="?curid=212533" title="The Turtles">
<text>The Turtles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The band achieved several Top 40 hits throughout the latter half of the 1960s, including &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; (1965), &quot;You Baby&quot; (1966), &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1967), &quot;She&#x27;d Rather Be with Me&quot; (1967), &quot;Elenore&quot; (1968), and &quot;You Showed Me&quot; (1969).

The original six members were Howard Kaylan, Mark Volman, Al Nichol, Jim Tucker, Chuck Portz, and Don Murray, with subsequent members being Chip Douglas, Joel Larson, Johnny Barbata, Jim Pons, and John Seiter. As the Turtles&#x27; commercial success waned by the end of the 1960s, they became plagued with management problems, lawsuits and conflicts with their label, White Whale Records, leading the group to break up in 1970. Kaylan and Volman then joined Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, where, for contractual reasons, they performed under the name Flo &amp; Eddie (Volman as Flo, Kaylan as Eddie). After leaving Zappa at the end of 1971, Kaylan and Volman continued to perform under the Flo &amp; Eddie name, becoming popular as a comedy rock act, and also went onto long-lasting success as session musicians. In 1983, Kaylan and Volman began touring as The Turtles featuring Flo &amp; Eddie. Kaylan ceased touring in 2018, while Volman continues to tour with the Turtles.

== History ==
=== 1963–1966: Formation, initial success and first personnel changes ===
==== The Nightriders, the Crossfires and the Tyrtles ====
In early 1963, New Yorker Howard Kaylan and Californian Mark Volman attended the same school, Westchester High in Los Angeles (Kaylan had moved from New York City as a child). The two sang in the school&#x27;s a cappella choir, where Volman soon heard about Kaylan&#x27;s instrumental surf music band, the Nightriders, which included Kaylan on saxophone and choir members Al Nichol on lead guitar, Don Murray on drums and Chuck Portz on bass. Volman joined the group as a saxophonist, just before the group changed its name to the Crossfires in the same year. After high school graduation, the band continued on while its members attended area colleges, picking up rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker as a sixth member along the way. 

They released a single, &quot;Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot; b/w &quot;Fiberglass Jungle&quot;, on the local &quot;Capco Records&quot; label, always in 1963. With the help of KRLA and KFWB DJ and club owner Reb Foster, the Crossfires signed to the newly formed White Whale Records. Adhering to the prevailing musical trend, the group rebranded itself as a folk rock band under the name the Tyrtles, an intentionally stylized misspelling inspired by the Byrds and the Beatles. However, the trendy spelling did not survive long, and they had to name themselves the Turtles.

Because of the stylistic change from &quot;Surf music&quot; to &quot;Folk rock&quot;, Kaylan and Volman dropped the saxophones to become the band&#x27;s vocalists. Kaylan became the group&#x27;s lead singer, and keyboardist (although he would give up most of the keyboard parts to Nichol in their hits). Volman began to harmonize with Kaylan&#x27;s lead singing becoming a third guitarist, as well as a percussionist, for the band.

==== &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; and &quot;You Baby&quot; ====
As with the Byrds, the Turtles achieved breakthrough success with a cover of a Bob Dylan song. &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 in the late summer of 1965, and was the title track of the band&#x27;s first album. &quot;Let Me Be&quot;, their second single, reached the Top 30, and &quot;You Baby&quot; charted in the Top 20 in early 1966. &quot;You Baby&quot;, with its intricate vocal harmonies and upbeat tempo, was influential in the band&#x27;s sound as it departed from the political, Byrds-type folk rock; the band&#x27;s new sound ranged from chamber pop to straightforward pop music.

&quot;You Baby&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album, failed to reach &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs chart, and of several singles released in 1966, &quot;Grim Reaper of Love&quot; and &quot;Can I Get to Know You Better&quot; barely entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. One single, the tough &quot;Outside Chance&quot;, written by Warren Zevon, did not chart. In 1966, the Turtles made an appearance in Universal&#x27;s film &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, singing &quot;She&#x27;ll Come Back&quot; on screen.

In early 1966, drummer Don Murray and bassist Chuck Portz quit the group. Murray was replaced by Joel Larson for a few months, before John Barbata became the band&#x27;s new drummer in late 1966. Portz was replaced by Chip Douglas on bass.

=== 1966–1968: Peak years ===

==== &quot;Happy Together&quot; ====
&quot;Happy Together&quot;, the first of several key Turtles singles co-written by Garry Bonner and Alan Gordon, had been rejected by countless performers. &quot;Happy Together&quot;, both their biggest hit and their signature song, signaled a turning point for both the Turtles and for Chip Douglas, who provided the arrangement. The single replaced the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Penny Lane&quot; at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the spring of 1967. The Turtles&#x27; only No. 1 remained there for three weeks. An album of the same name followed and peaked at No. 25. &quot;Happy Together&quot; reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. This same year saw the Turtles performing the title song (composed by John Williams with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse) for the Twentieth Century-Fox bedroom farce &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot;.

Impressed by Chip Douglas&#x27;s studio arrangements, Michael Nesmith approached him after a Turtles show at the Whisky a Go Go and invited him to become the Monkees&#x27; producer as that band wanted to break out of their &quot;manufactured&quot; studio mold. Douglas accepted and left the Turtles, producing the Monkees&#x27; next three albums: &quot;Headquarters&quot;; &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot; (both 1967); and &quot;The Birds, the Bees &amp; the Monkees&quot; (1968), the last of which he co-produced with the band. Meanwhile, the Turtles continued with new bassist Jim Pons replacing Douglas.

==== &quot;She&#x27;d Rather Be with Me&quot;, &quot;You Know What I Mean&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s My Girl&quot; ====
Other hits, all written by Gordon/Bonner, followed &quot;Happy Together&quot;, making 1967 a lucrative year for the Turtles. A follow-up, the brassy &quot;She&#x27;d Rather Be with Me&quot;, reached No. 3 on the US charts in late spring and actually out-charted &quot;Happy Together&quot; overseas, reaching No. 4 in the UK. Two successive Top 15 songs followed: &quot;You Know What I Mean&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s My Girl&quot;. Both 45s showed a psychedelic side in the band&#x27;s style. During that year, the band released two albums, &quot;Happy Together&quot; and &quot;Golden Hits&quot;, the former reaching the Top 30 and the latter reaching the Top 10. The similar album covers for &quot;Golden Hits&quot; and its 1970 companion &quot;More Golden Hits&quot; were designed by Dean Torrence of Jan &amp; Dean.

By the end of 1967 the band were reduced to a five-piece, when rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker departed, citing the pressure of touring and recording new material. He moved to Grass Valley, California where he became an electrical contractor. He has denied that he left the band because John Lennon was rude to him, as Kaylan later suggested.

==== &quot;The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands&quot; ====

&quot;Sound Asleep&quot; and &quot;The Story of Rock and Roll&quot;, the first two singles in 1968, stalled somewhere in the middle of the Top 100. The band&#x27;s fortunes changed when former member Chip Douglas returned to work with them as a producer. Late in 1968 the band released a concept album called &quot;The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands&quot;, in which the group pretended to be 11 different bands (with fanciful names including the Bigg Brothers, Nature&#x27;s Children, the US Teens featuring Raoul, and the Fabulous Dawgs), each with a song in a different genre. The album yielded two singles: &quot;Elenore&quot; and &quot;You Showed Me&quot;, both peaking at No. 6. &quot;Elenore&quot; also reached No. 7 in the UK chart. Although both singles were successful, they did not help to boost the album&#x27;s sales, which peaked at No. 128 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums. The 1969 hit &quot;You Showed Me&quot; had been written by the Byrds&#x27; Gene Clark and Roger (then Jim) McGuinn in 1964. It was their last Top 10 single. Television appearances included a February 1968 spot on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, to which they returned in April 1969. 1969 saw the band undergo another personnel change, with drummer John Barbata being replaced by John Seiter.

=== 1969–1970: Commercial waning and break-up ===

==== &quot;Turtle Soup&quot; ====
Towards the end of 1969, the group released its next album, &quot;Turtle Soup&quot;, a critically well-received LP produced by Ray Davies of the Kinks. Inspired by the revered 1968 concept album &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot;, this was Davies&#x27;s only released production work for another band (but Davies had previously produced demo recordings for the Iveys). Notable tracks include &quot;Somewhere Friday Nite&quot; and &quot;Love in the City&quot;. In spite of &quot;Turtle Soup&quot;″s positive reception from the music press, its commercial success was marginal, and the band began to disintegrate.

==== Conflicts with White Whale and disintegration ====
Long disillusioned with their record label and its growing financial problems by this time, Kaylan and Volman resisted White Whale&#x27;s efforts to turn the Turtles into something approaching an assembly-line pop act, like the early Monkees. The label apparently encouraged Kaylan and Volman to fire the rest of the band, tour with hired musicians and make records by adding their vocals to backing tracks recorded by Memphis session players. Such pressure convinced the band to record a single called &quot;Who Would Ever Think That I Would Marry Margaret?&quot;, which they disowned after its release.

The Turtles wound down their career in 1970 with &quot;More Golden Hits&quot;, a second compilation album, and &quot;Wooden Head&quot;, a B-sides and rarities album. With the demise of the Turtles, White Whale Records lost its biggest moneymaker, had few commercially viable bands, and soon ceased operations.

===Post-Turtles===
====1970s====
In mid-1970, Kaylan and Volman joined Frank Zappa&#x27;s band the Mothers of Invention, with Pons also joining in early 1971. As well as the Turtles&#x27; name, Kaylan and Volman were unable to use their real names in billings due to them being prohibited by their contract with their label White Whale Records. Because of this, Volman and Kaylan began performing under the nicknames the Phlorescent Leech &amp; Eddie or Flo &amp; Eddie for short. Kaylan, Volman, and Pons worked with Zappa until December 1971, when the infamous attack on Zappa at the Rainbow Theatre in London left him no choice but to cease touring for a while. During their time together the former Turtles appeared on several Zappa albums, as well as starring in his 1971 film &quot;200 Motels&quot;. Volman and Kaylan then went on to make several duo albums, still using the Flo &amp; Eddie name.

Volman and Kaylan sang backing vocals on several recordings by the band T. Rex, including their worldwide 1971 hit &quot;Get It On (Bang a Gong)&quot; and the albums &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; and &quot;The Slider&quot;. When White Whale&#x27;s master recordings were sold at auction in 1974, the duo won the Turtles&#x27; masters, making them the owners of their own recorded work. They promptly licensed the tracks to Sire Records, which issued them as a compilation album titled &quot;Happy Together Again&quot;. In the mid-1970s, Volman and Kaylan started their syndicated radio show titled &quot;Flo &amp; Eddie by the Fireside&quot;, which originated from KMET in Los Angeles.

====1980s====
In the 1980s, the duo began hosting their radio show on KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WXRK in New York City and recorded soundtrack music for children&#x27;s shows like the &quot;Care Bears&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot;. In 1980, Flo and Eddie performed backing vocals on Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Flush the Fashion&quot; and sang backup on Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; from his album &quot;The River&quot;. 1982 saw the re-release of the Turtles&#x27; original albums through Rhino Records. 

In 1983, they also contributed backing vocals to the self-titled debut album of British New wave band Espionage, produced by Roy Thomas Baker and released by A&amp;M Records. Also in 1983, Howard Kaylan appeared in the comedy film &quot;Get Crazy&quot;, starring Malcolm McDowell and Daniel Stern: Kaylan played the part of Captain Cloud, a spiritual guru, leader of a caravan of time-lost hippies. In the same year, Kaylan and Volman legally regained the use of &quot;the Turtles&quot; name and began touring as the Turtles Featuring Flo and Eddie; instead of trying to reunite with their earlier bandmates, they began featuring sidemen who had played with different groups. In 1984, the Turtles embarked on a U.S. Happy Together tour with Gary Puckett &amp; the Union Gap, Spanky &amp; Our Gang and the Association. 

In 1987, Kaylan and Volman appeared in a music video of their 1967 song &quot;Happy Together&quot; to promote the romantic comedy &quot;Making Mr. Right&quot;. That year also saw the debut of the previously unreleased &quot;Shell Shock&quot; album, as well as a new retrospective CD &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;, both released by Rhino. The latter compilation was followed in 1988 with &quot;Turtle Wax: The Best of the Turtles, Vol. 2&quot;, which featured the best of their &quot;album tracks&quot; and previously neglected single B-sides. 

The 1989 debut album by hip hop combo De La Soul, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, featured an uncredited sample from the Turtles (specifically, the introduction to &quot;You Showed Me&quot;), in the song &quot;Transmitting Live from Mars.&quot; Kaylan and Volman sued, winning a large settlement, setting a legal precedent, and causing the music industry to begin carefully crediting (and paying royalties for) sampled works on future rap music and other recordings in general. As they explained: &quot;We don&#x27;t hate sampling; we like sampling. If we don&#x27;t get credit, we sue, and all that stuff (a share of the royalties plus punitive damages) comes back to us!&quot; It was incorrectly reported in 2009 that Volman was involved in another lawsuit against rapper Gucci Mane for an unauthorized sample; the sample of &quot;Keep It Warm&quot; used in Mane&#x27;s &quot;Lemonade&quot; was cleared legitimately before the release of the song. Also in 1989, the Turtles&#x27; recording of &quot;Happy Together&quot; was featured in the eponymous romantic comedy film &quot;Happy Together&quot; as well as in the film soundtrack album.

====1990s====
In 1991 Music Club Records released a Turtles&#x27; anthology in the United Kingdom: &quot;Happy Together: The Best of the Turtles&quot;. In 1993, Rhino Records presented &quot;Captured Live&quot;, a live album of their 1992 tour. In 1994 Sundazed Music re-released all of the Turtles&#x27; original albums, and in 1999 Varèse Sarabande released &quot;Happy Together: The Best of White Whale Records&quot;, which included many of the Turtles&#x27; singles.

Original drummer Don Murray died on March 22, 1996, at age 50.

====2000s====
In 2002, the film &quot;Adaptation&quot; used their song &quot;Happy Together&quot; extensively as a device to portray the closeness of the two brothers Kaufman, both played by Nicolas Cage; this film closes with the Turtles&#x27; version over the final credit scroll and time lapse photography. 

Also the 2005 film &quot;Imagine Me &amp; You&quot;, the title of which was taken from the first line of the song &quot;Happy Together&quot;, used this song in its end credits. In 2009, a Turtles compilation CD titled &quot;Save the Turtles: The Turtles Greatest Hits&quot; was issued on their FloEdCo Record label and distributed by Manifesto Records.

====2010s====
Starting in the summer of 2010, the Turtles Featuring Flo &amp; Eddie toured throughout the United States as part of the Happy Together: 25th Anniversary Tour, an oldies concert series that retained the &quot;Happy Together&quot; moniker in subsequent years. They performed alongside other 1960s and 1970s pop stars, including Gary Puckett, Mitch Ryder, Mark Lindsay, Mark Farner, Gary Lewis, and Micky Dolenz. The 2015 tour featured the Buckinghams, the Cowsills, the Grass Roots, and the Association. In 2016, the complete output of the Turtles was reissued as two box sets, titled &quot;The Complete Original Album Collection&quot; and &quot;All the Singles&quot;. The expanded editions of the six albums contained in the former were issued separately in 2017.

In 2018, since Kaylan required heart and back surgery, he was told by his doctors to cease touring, so Ron Dante (a prolific session musician of the Archies, the Cuff Links and the Detergents fame) replaced him.

====2020s====

Original rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker died on November 12, 2020, at age 74.

Drummer John Barbata died on May 8, 2024, at age 79.

<text>George Granville Bradley (11 December 1821 – 13 March 1903) was an English divine, scholar, and schoolteacher, who was Dean of Westminster (1881–1902).

==Life==
Bradley was a son of the preacher Charles Bradley (1789–1871), vicar of Glasbury, a noted evangelical Anglican preacher and leader of the so-called Clapham Sect.Charles had thirteen children (twelve surviving) by his first wife, who died in 1831, and nine by his second wife Emma Linton. George Bradley was among the elder sons; his younger half-brothers included philosopher Francis Herbert Bradley (1846–1924), and literary scholar Andrew Cecil Bradley (1851–1935).

Bradley was educated at Rugby under Thomas Arnold. He won an open scholarship at University College, Oxford, where in 1844 Bradley gained a first-class degree in &quot;literae humaniores&quot;. He was immediately elected to a Fellowship at University and, in the following year, won the Chancellor&#x27;s prize for the Latin essay. He was an assistant master at Rugby from 1846 to 1858, when he succeeded G.E.L. Cotton as Headmaster of Marlborough College in Wiltshire. In the same year he look Holy Orders.

In 1870, Bradley was elected Master of his old college at Oxford. Under his mastership, he and the fellows of the college celebrated its apocryphal thousandth anniversary since its supposed founding by Alfred the Great. In 1874 he was appointed examining chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Archibald Campbell Tait, under whom he had served at Rugby. In 1874 and 1875 he was Select Preacher at Oxford; he was also Honorary Chaplain to the Queen, becoming Chaplain in Ordinary in 1876. In 1878 he was chosen as the first chairman of the Association for the Education of Women, which aimed to promote the education of women at the university.

In 1881 Bradley was given a canonry in Worcester Cathedral; in August that year he was appointed Dean of Westminster in succession to Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, whose pupil and intimate friend he had been, and whose biographer he became. Shortly afterwards he was conferred the degree of DD by University College, Oxford. By the turn of the 20th century, he was in declining health, and had to be absent from his duties for considerable periods. He took part in the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 9 August 1902, and asked the King to be allowed to resign from his duties later the same month. For his service, he was invested as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) two days after the ceremony, on 11 August 1902.

Bradley was an Acting Chaplain of the 13th Middlesex (Queen&#x27;s Westminsters) Volunteer Rifle Corps for 20 years, and received the Volunteer Officers&#x27; Decoration (VD) on 21 February 1902, before he resigned this appointment in November 1902.

The very reverend George Granville Bradley, of 42 Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate, Westminster died on 13 March 1903. He was buried at Westminster Abbey on 17 March. The pall-bearers included the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, Henry Montagu Butler; the Master of University College, Oxford, James Franck Bright; and the Headmasters of Marlborough and Rugby.

F. D. How included Bradley in the 1904 book &quot;Six Great Schoolmasters&quot;.

==Works==
Besides his &quot;Recollections of A. P. Stanley&quot; (1883) and &quot;Life of Dean Stanley&quot; (1892), Bradley published a revised version of Thomas Kerchever Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Latin Prose Composition&quot; (commonly referred to by generations of Latin students as &quot;Bradley&#x27;s Arnold&quot;); his more advanced intended work on &quot;Aids to Writing Latin Prose: with Exercises&quot; was edited and completed by T. L. Papillon. Further works were &quot;Lectures on Job&quot; (1884) and &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot; (1885).

==Family==
Bradley married Marian Jane Philpot at Great Cressingham on 18 December 1849. They had two sons and five daughters; of these children one son, Arthur Granville Bradley (1850–1943), and four daughters were writers, including Margaret Louisa Woods, Emily Tennyson Bradley (married Alexander Murray Smith), Mabel Charlotte, the Lady Birchenough (the wife of Sir Henry Birchenough, public servant and business man) and Rose Marian Bradley.

<doc id="212552" wikidata="Q5538141" url="?curid=212552" title="George Cotton">
<text>George Edward Lynch Cotton (29 October 1813 – 6 October 1866) was the Bishop of Calcutta. He was also an English educator and clergyman, known for his connections with British India and the public school system.

==Life in England==

He was born at Chester, a grandson of the late George Cotton, Dean of Chester.

His father, Thomas George D&#x27;Avenant Cotton—born in Acton, Cheshire, England on 28 June 1783 to George and Catherine Maria ( Tomkinson) Cotton—was a captain in the Royal Fusiliers and died in the Peninsular War in 1813 at the Battle of Nivelle, two weeks after George&#x27;s birth.
He received his education at The King&#x27;s School, Chester, Westminster School, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Here he joined the Low Church party, and was a close friend of several disciples of Thomas Arnold, including CJ Vaughan and WJ Conybeare. Arnold&#x27;s influence determined the character and course of Cotton&#x27;s life.

He graduated BA in 1836, and became an assistant master at Rugby School. He became master of the fifth form in about 1840. In 1852 he accepted the appointment of headmaster at Marlborough College, reviving its financial, educational and reputational status. Both Rugby School and Marlborough College boarding houses were subsequently named after him.

Cotton married his cousin, Sophia Ann Tomkinson, daughter of Rev. Henry Tomkinson and niece of T. J. Phillips Jodrell, on 26 June 1845. They had two children; a son, Edward Cotton-Jodrell (later MP for Wirral) and a daughter, Ursula Mary, who also married within the clergy.

==India==
In 1858 Cotton was offered the office of the Bishop of Calcutta, which, after much hesitation, he accepted. The government of India had just been transferred from the British East India Company to the crown, and questions of education were eagerly discussed, following Macaulay&#x27;s famous &quot;Minute on Indian Education&quot;.

Cotton established schools for British and Eurasian (and Indian) children including the Bishop Cotton School Shimla. The Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School and Bishop Cotton Girls&#x27; School in Bangalore were established in his memory. The Bishop Cotton School in Nagpur also bears his name. He founded many other schools in India, including St. James&#x27; School in Calcutta, and Cathedral and John Connon in Bombay.

As the senior Anglican prelate in India, he also consecrated a number of new churches throughout the subcontinent, including St. Luke&#x27;s Church, Abbottabad, and others on what then used to be the Punjab Province and later became the North West Frontier Province.

A memoir of his life with selections from his journals and correspondence, edited by his widow, was published in 1871.

==Death==
On 6 October 1866, he had consecrated a cemetery at Kushtia on the Ganges in the then Bengal Presidency, and was crossing a plank leading from the bank to the steamer when he slipped and fell into the river Gorai. He was carried away by the current and never seen again.

It has been suggested that the phrase &quot;to bless one&#x27;s cotton socks&quot; is traceable to Cotton&#x27;s death. It is said that while Bishop of Calcutta, Cotton ensured that children in his schools had socks to wear, and he blessed the socks upon their arrival, as he did other goods. Over time, &quot;Cotton&#x27;s socks&quot; became &quot;Cotton socks&quot;. Upon his sudden death, the Archbishop was asked, &quot;Who will bless his cotton socks&quot;.

<text>Charles John Vaughan (16 August 1816 – 15 October 1897) was an English scholar and Anglican churchman.

== Life ==
He was born in Leicester, the second son of the Revd Edward Thomas Vaughan, vicar of St Martin&#x27;s, Leicester. He was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was bracketed senior classic with Lord Lyttelton in 1838. In 1839 he was elected a fellow of Trinity, and for a short time studied law. He took orders in 1841, and became vicar of St Martin&#x27;s, Leicester. Three years later he was elected headmaster of Harrow School. He resigned the headship in 1859 because of his homosexuality and accepted the bishopric of Rochester, but afterwards withdrew his acceptance. In 1860 he was appointed vicar of Doncaster. It was in this capacity that he was celebrant for the marriage of the new Headmaster of Harrow School, the Revd Henry Montagu Butler, in December 1861. In 1869 he was appointed Master of the Temple in 1869, and Dean of Llandaff in 1879, a post he held until his death. In 1894 he was elected president of University College, Cardiff, in recognition of the prominent part he took in its foundation.

Vaughan was a well-known Broad Churchman, an eloquent preacher and an able writer on theological subjects, his numerous works including lectures, commentaries and sermons. His greatest contribution to the Church of England was the help he gave to over 400 graduates preparing themselves for Ordination. These men became known as &#x27;Vaughan&#x27;s doves&#x27;. Eighteen of them became Bishops, and two of them Archbishops.

Vaughan wrote the first published New Testament commentary that utilized the scholarship of Brooke Foss Westcott and Fenton Hort. In his 1859 book &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans: with notes&quot; Vaughan thanked Westcott for allowing him to use the text being prepared for the new recension.
: &quot;Mr Westcott has thus allowed me to anticipate (with regard to this Epistle) the publication of that complete recension of the text of the New Testament, on which he has been for some time engaged.&quot;

In 1871, Vaughan joined the English Revision Committee, New Testament company, where the text of Westcott and Hort became the working papers source for the Revision Committee. Westcott had been an assistant master under Vaughan at Harrow from 1852 to 1859.

He died in 1897 in the Llandaff deanery and was buried within the cathedral grounds. He had married in 1850 Catherine Maria Stanley, youngest daughter of Edward Stanley, Bishop of Norwich.
F. D. How included Vaughan in the 1904 book &quot;Six Great Schoolmasters&quot;.

== Alleged paedophilia at Harrow ==

Until the 1970s no convincing reason for Vaughan&#x27;s resignation from Harrow School was known. Speculation ended when Phyllis Grosskurth discovered the diaries of John Addington Symonds, who attended Harrow School while Vaughan was headmaster. The following account based on what Symonds wrote is accepted in some quarters, though uncorroborated; but John Roach writing in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; points to discrepancies in the dates, and Symonds&#x27;s own sexual orientation, as reasons to suspend judgement.

Harrow in the 1840s and 1850s had a schoolboy homosexual culture. Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy calls it &quot;an adolescent boy&#x27;s jungle; a jungle where lust and brute strength raged completely unrestrained&quot;. Symonds was propositioned numerous times. A master at Harrow intercepted a note between two of the boys, and passed it to Vaughan. He summoned the whole school immediately, and read the whole letter aloud. He then banned the sending of such letters, and the use of female nicknames, and flogged both culprits.

Through this incident Vaughan was, in the words of Gathorne-Hardy, &quot;... not for the first time... in the grip of a devastating physical passion which he was completely unable to control.&quot; In early 1858, Alfred Pretor (1840–1908), a spirited, good-looking friend of Symonds, sent Symonds a letter, telling him that he was having an affair with Vaughan, and showed him several love letters. Symonds did not mention the incident for over a year, and then in 1859, gave the whole story to John Conington. Conington told Symonds to tell his father John Addington Symonds, a doctor.

Symonds senior wrote to Vaughan to inform him that he knew of his behaviour with Pretor. He would not expose him publicly, as long as Vaughan agreed to resign at once. After a long confrontation, about which nothing is known, Vaughan agreed. On 16 September Vaughan sent a circular to the parents. It read: &quot;I have resolved after much deliberation, to take that opportunity of relieving myself from the long pressure of these heavy duties and anxious responsibilities which are inseparable from such an office, even under the most favourable circumstances.&quot; Four years later, in 1863, Vaughan accepted the position of Bishop of Rochester, ignoring Symonds&#x27;s demand that Vaughan also never hold any high position in the church. Symonds telegraphed Vaughan, ordering him to resign or risk public exposure. So he resigned again. According to Noel Annan, &quot;only after the elder Symonds&#x27; death did Vaughan dare to accept the deanery of Llandaff, where his ordinands were known as &#x27;Vaughan&#x27;s doves.&#x27;&quot;

Pretor was furious about the younger Symonds&#x27;s part in the scandal and refused to speak to him; but the secret was kept. Horatio Brown, Symonds&#x27;s biographer and literary executor, skipped the Harrow years, saying merely &quot;The autobiography of the Harrow period is not copious&quot;. On his death Vaughan had all his papers destroyed and forbade any biography of him to be written. Vaughan had maintained his friendship with Pretor until his death and at his request Pretor undertook the duties of his literary executor.

<text>William John Conybeare (1 August 1815 – 23 July 1857) was an English vicar, essayist and novelist who was the first Principal of Liverpool College.

==Biography==
William John Conybeare was the son of Dean William Daniel Conybeare. He attended Westminster School, where he formed a life-long friendship with George Cotton, later Bishop of Calcutta. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1833, where he was elected fellow in 1837.

From 1842 to 1848 Conybeare was principal of the Liverpool Collegiate Institution (later Liverpool College). There, he worked with John Saul Howson, with whom he would later publish &quot;Perversion: or, the Causes and Consequences of Infidelity&quot;. Whilst in Liverpool, he campaigned for the improvement of middle-class education in the city.

With his health deteriorating, Conybeare resigned his position at Liverpool in 1848 and moved to Axminster, Devon, to become vicar. He served there until 1854, when he moved to Weybridge, Surrey, where his brother-in-law, Edward Rose, was the parish priest. He died of tuberculosis in Weybridge in 1857, and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. He was survived by his wife, Eliza Rose (1820-1903), and his son, John William Edward Conybeare.

==Publications==
Conybeare published &quot;Essays, Ecclesiastical and Social&quot; (1855), and a novel, &quot;Perversion: or, the Causes and Consequences of Infidelity&quot; (1856), but is best known as the joint author (along with John Saul Howson) of &quot;The Life and Epistles of St Paul&quot;  (1852, 2nd ed. 1856).

He published &quot;Church Parties&quot;, a 30,000 word essay on the different styles of churchmanship found within the Anglican Church, in 1855.

<text>John Saul Howson (5 May 1816 – 1885), British divine and school master, who served as Dean of Chester Cathedral and Principal of Liverpool College

==Early and private life==
Howson was born at Giggleswick-on-Craven, Yorkshire.His father was head-master of Giggleswick School. His nephew George William Saul Howson (1860–1919) was a reforming headmaster of Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt, Norfolk, between 1900 and his death.

After attending the school, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge. Graduating BA in 1837 and MA in 1840, he became private tutor at Cambridge to the Marquess of Sligo and the Marquess of Lorne.

==Career==

In 1845 Howson, having taken orders, accepted the post of senior classical master at the Liverpool College under his friend W. J. Conybeare, whom he succeeded as principal in 1849. This post he held until 1865, and it was largely due to his influence that a similar college for girls was established at Liverpool.

On 2 June 1865, Howson was appointed as Honorary Chaplain of the 1st Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps.

In 1866 he left Liverpool to become vicar of the Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wisbech, and in 1867 he was appointed dean of Chester Cathedral, where he gave himself vigorously to the work of restoring the crumbling fabric, collecting nearly £100,000 in five years for this purpose His restoration created a great debate and led in part to formation of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.

His sympathies were with the evangelical party, and he stoutly opposed the &quot;Eastward position,&quot; but he was by no means narrow. He did much to reintroduce the ministry of women as deaconesses. The building of the King&#x27;s School for boys, and the Queen&#x27;s School for girls (both in Chester), was due in a great measure to the active interest which he took in educational matters.

Howson&#x27;s chief literary production was &quot;The Life and Epistles of St Paul&quot; (1852) in which he collaborated with Conybeare.

==Family==
He married the daughter of John Cropper, who survived him by only a few days. He died at Bournemouth on 15 December 1885 and was buried in the cloister garth of Chester.

Howson was the father of George Howson (1854–1943) who was Archdeacon of Warrington from 1916 to 1933, and then Archdeacon of Liverpool from 1933 to 1934; another son James Howson (1856–1934) was Archdeacon of Craven from 1928 to 1934. His grandson George Howson was the founder and chairman of the Royal British Legion Poppy Factory.

<text>Lunaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to North America and elsewhere. Species include:
*&quot;L. annua&quot; (syn. &quot;L. biennis&quot;), annual or biennial 
*&quot;L. rediviva&quot;, perennial
*&quot;L. telekiana&quot;. rare Balkan species

The Latin name &quot;Lunaria&quot; means &quot;moon-like&quot; and refers to the plants&#x27; decorative seedpods.

They have hairy toothed leaves and terminal racemes of white or violet flowers in Spring and Summer, followed by prominent, translucent, disc-shaped seedpods, which are frequently seen in flower arrangements.

They are widely grown as ornamental plants in gardens, and have become naturalised in many temperate areas away from their native habitat.

<text>Lunaria rediviva, known as perennial honesty, is a species of plant in the cabbage family Brassicaceae. This hairy-stemmed herbaceous perennial is found throughout Europe. It often grows in damp woods on lime substrates. Growing up to tall, it has large, pointed oval leaves with marked serrations. Clusters of fragrant, pale pink flowers are borne in spring, followed by translucent oval seedheads, often used in flower arranging. It is cultivated as a garden plant, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The Latin specific epithet &quot;rediviva&quot; means &quot;growing again&quot;, &quot;reviving&quot;, in reference to its perennial habit, which distinguishes it from its biennial or annual cousin, &quot;Lunaria annua&quot;.

<text>Sir William Mitchell Ramsay (15 March 185120 April 1939) was a British archaeologist and New Testament scholar. He was the foremost authority of his day on the history of Asia Minor, and a leading scholar in the study of the New Testament.

Ramsay was educated in the Tübingen school of thought (founded by F. C. Baur) which doubted the reliability of the New Testament, but his extensive archaeological and historical studies convinced him of its historical accuracy. From the post of Professor of Classical Art and Architecture at Oxford, he was appointed Regius Professor of Humanity at Aberdeen.

Knighted in 1906 to mark his distinguished service to the world of scholarship, Ramsay also gained three honorary fellowships from Oxford colleges, nine honorary doctorates from British, Continental and North American universities, and became an honorary member of almost every association devoted to archaeology and historical research. 

At the end of his career he became involved in Christian apologetics, which combined with his argumentative and caustic tendencies ultimately harmed his reputation among scholars. He died at his home in Bournemouth on the 20th of April, 1939.

==Early life and education==
Ramsay was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the youngest son of a third-generation lawyer, Thomas Ramsay and his wife Jane Mitchell, daughter of William Mitchell. His father died when he was six years old, and the family moved from the city to the family home in the country district near Alloa. The help of his older brother and his maternal uncle, Andrew Mitchell of Alloa, made it possible for him to receive an education at the Gymnasium in Old Aberdeen. (Other relatives include Mary Ramsay and Agnes Margaret Ramsay, who contributed photographs and illustrations in Ramsay&#x27;s later work, &quot;The Letters to the Seven Churches&quot;.)

Ramsay studied at the University of Aberdeen, where he achieved high distinction. He then won a scholarship to St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in classical moderations (1874) and in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; (1876), He also studied Sanskrit under scholar Theodor Benfey at Göttingen. In 1880 Ramsay received an Oxford studentship for travel and research in Greece. At Smyrna, he met Sir C. W. Wilson, then British consul-general in Anatolia, who advised him on inland areas suitable for exploration, and made two long journeys with him in 1881 and 1882.

==Career==
Ramsay travelled widely in Asia Minor and rapidly became the recognised authority on all matters relating to the districts associated with St Paul&#x27;s missionary journeys and on Christianity in the early Roman Empire. Greece and Turkey remained the focus of Ramsay&#x27;s research for the remainder of his academic career. In November 1881, he discovered two of the most important Phrygian monuments – the rock tombs &quot;Aslantaş&quot; (Lion Stone) and &quot;Yılantaş&quot; (Snake Stone), located close to the city centre of Afyon. In 1883, he discovered the world&#x27;s oldest complete piece of music, the Seikilos epitaph. In 1890 he discovered inscriptions in an unknown Anatolian language, Pisidian, a description of which he published in 1895. He was known for his expertise in the historic geography and topography of Asia Minor and of its political, social, cultural, and religious history.

After becoming a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford in 1882, from 1885 to 1886 Ramsay held the newly created Lincoln Professor of Classical Archaeology and Art at Oxford and became a fellow of Lincoln College (honorary fellow 1898). In 1886 Ramsay was appointed Regius Professor of Humanity at the University of Aberdeen. He remained affiliated with Aberdeen until his retirement in 1911.

===Perspective on biblical historicity===
When Ramsay first travelled to Asia Minor, the locations of many of the cities mentioned in the Book of Acts were not known. Later in life Ramsay stated, &quot;Further study ... showed that the book could bear the most minute scrutiny as an authority for the facts of the Aegean world, and that it was written with such judgment, skill, art and perception of truth as to be a model of historical statement&quot;, also stating that one &quot;may press the words of Luke in a degree beyond any other historian&#x27;s&quot;. 

Specifically, Ramsay&#x27;s studies in Asia Minor led him to accept the trustworthiness of Luke&#x27;s account in the Book of Acts. He wrote:

Regarding the authorship of the Pauline epistles Ramsay also concluded that all thirteen New Testament letters ostensibly written by Paul were in fact authentic.

===Awards, recognition, leadership positions===
Beginning in 1880, Ramsay began receiving honorary degrees, which eventually included a D.C.L. from Oxford, LL.D. recognition from St Andrews and Glasgow, and a D.D. from Edinburgh. In 1906, Ramsay was knighted for his scholarly achievements on the 400th anniversary of the founding of the University of Aberdeen. He was elected a member of learned societies in Europe and America and was awarded a medal by the University of Pennsylvania.

Ramsay was awarded the Gold Medal of Pope Leo XIII in 1893, and the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1906. In 1919, Ramsay was named president of the Royal Geographical Society.

===Legacy of scholarship===
Ramsay is recognised as an important scholar in the archaeology of Asia Minor as well as the study of the New Testament, mainly from his 19th century work. In the 1960s, W. Ward Gasque listed three significant contributions of his to biblical studies: his conclusion of the reliability and accuracy of Luke-Acts; his identification of the Galatians with the Christians of Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, and Pisidian Antioch; and his emphasis on the historical context of the New Testament. 

However, his later work suffered in scholarly reputation. Persuaded by William Robertson Nicoll, he worked as a popular apologist and his writings from that period have been dismissed by scholars for their speculative content. He also had a reputation as a controversialist, remaining argumentative even into old age.

==Personal life==
Ramsay&#x27;s wife, Agnes, accompanied him in many of his journeys; Lady Ramsay, granddaughter of Andrew Marshall of Kirkintilloch, was an author in her own right (&quot;Everyday Life in Turkey&quot; in 1897, and &quot;The Romance of Elisavet&quot; in 1899).

<text>Renn Dickson Hampden (29 March 1793 – 23 April 1868) was an English Anglican clergyman. His liberal tendencies led to conflict with traditionalist clergy in general and the supporters of Tractarianism during the years he taught at the University of Oxford (1829–1846) which coincided with a period of rapid social change and heightened political tensions. 

His support for the campaign for the admission of non-Anglicans to the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford was unpopular at the time (1834) and led to serious protests when he was nominated to the Regius Professorship of Divinity two years later. His election as Bishop of Hereford became a &quot;cause celebre&quot; in Victorian religious controversies because it raised questions about the royal prerogative in the appointment of bishops and the role of the prime minister. He administered the diocese with tolerance and charity without being involved in any further controversy for nearly twenty years.

==Early life, education and parish ministries==
He was born in Barbados, where his father was colonel of militia, on Good Friday in 1793, and was educated at Oriel College, Oxford.

He took his B.A. degree in 1813 with first-class honours in both classics and mathematics and in the following year, he obtained the chancellor&#x27;s prize for a Latin essay. Shortly afterwards, he was elected a fellow of Oriel College. Election to these fellowships was by special examination intended to select the best possible minds and Hampden became a member of the group known as the &quot;Noetics&quot; who were Whigs in politics and freely critical of traditional religious orthodoxy. He was reputedly one of the milder but most learned of them. John Keble and Thomas Arnold were also fellows during this period. He left the university in 1816 and held successively a number of curacies. 

In 1827, he published &quot;Essays on the Philosophical Evidence of Christianity&quot;, followed by a volume of &quot;Parochial Sermons illustrative of the Importance of the Revelation of God in Jesus Christ&quot; (1828).

==Teaching and conflict in Oxford (1829–1846)==
In 1829, Hampden returned to Oxford and in May 1830 became one of the tutors at Oriel where a disagreement about the tutors&#x27; duties led to John Henry Newman, Hurrell Froude, and Robert Wilberforce being relieved of their duties. Hampden was chosen to deliver the prestigious Bampton Lectures for 1832, in which he attempted to disentangle the original truth of Christianity from later accretions and superstitions, particularly scholastic philosophy. 

At the time, some thought he had committed himself to a heretical view of the Trinity akin to Socinianism and Sabellianism, but serious questioning only started after the publication of his &quot;Observations on Religious Dissent&quot; in 1834, and wide-ranging outrage was sparked in 1836 after his nomination to the Regius Professorship of Divinity.

In 1833, he moved from a tutorship at Oriel to become Principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford. In 1834, he was appointed White&#x27;s Professor of Moral Philosophy without any adverse comment in preference to Newman. 

===Wider background of the conflicts===
The years 1815–1914 were a time of radical social and political change in which religion played a significant role. Politically the Church of England was overwhelmingly Tory and opposed to political reform. At the start of this period, many Anglicans equated the religious well–being of the country to that of their own church while Protestant and Catholic dissidents suffered under discriminatory religious legislation. The Whig party and its reforming programme relied heavily on the support of Protestant dissidents who saw the parish priest as &quot;the black recruiting–sergeant against us&quot;. Feelings ran very high, particularly between 1825 and 1850. 

Despite the recent, partial relief afforded by the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, non-Anglicans still suffered from serious discrimination. The tensions had been worsened by the actions of 21 bishops in voting against the reform of Parliament in 1831 while only 3 voted in favour. Had all voted in favour the Bill would have passed.

Oxford and Cambridge Universities played a central role in the Church of England. They were wholly Anglican institutions. At Oxford, students had to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England as part of the admission process; while at Cambridge no one could graduate without doing so. They were the principal nurseries of Anglican clergy and extremely influential in the country in general.

The passing of the Reform Bill in 1832 did little to ease the tensions since the widened franchise produced a reforming parliament in which the more radical members obviously had ecclesiastical abuses in their sights as part of a very wide-ranging programme. Many dissenters campaigned for the disestablishment of the Church of England and the Government&#x27;s decision to merge ten dioceses of the Church of Ireland with their neighbours was seen as a serious threat to the Church of England when carried into effect by the Church Temporalities (Ireland) Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 37). It was the direct cause of John Keble&#x27;s famous assize sermon on &quot;National Apostasy&quot; at Oxford the following year and this in its turn led to the Tractarian Movement. By 1834, the tensions between dissenters and churchmen had reached unprecedented levels, probably because the dissenters sensed the Church of England would cling to its remaining privileges.

=== &quot;Observations on Religious Dissent&quot; ===
In the summer of 1834, a bill to abolish subscription on admission to a university or on taking any degree rather than requiring a subscription to the 39 Articles of the Church of England was rejected by the House of Lords. Hampden entered the public arena in August by publishing &quot;Observations on Religious Dissent&quot; in support of the admission of non-Anglicans to Oxford University on the strength of a simple declaration of faith. 

Even so, urged by the Duke of Wellington (recently elected Chancellor), on 10 November the heads of the Oxford Colleges recognised that public feeling was opposed to making schoolboys subscribe to the Articles on matriculation and by a single vote agreed to abolish the practice. Hampden then produced a second edition of the pamphlet and sent a copy to John Henry Newman who, while recognising its &quot;tone of piety&quot; regretted that the arguments of the work tended &quot;altogether to make shipwreck of the Christian faith&quot;. Debate via published works and personal acrimony between the two scholars continued for two years.

The decision of the heads of Colleges was rescinded but revived in March of the following year when a motion to that effect was roundly defeated in Convocation by 459 votes to 57 where all Masters of Arts whether resident or not had the right to vote and all types of traditionalist MAs combined to defeat it.

A few months later, Lord Radnor introduced a parliamentary bill with the same object and Hampden was the only resident to speak out openly in favour. He became the chief target of a book on the subscription issue edited by Newman who accused Hampden of being a Socinian in it.

===Regius Professor===
In 1836 the Regius Professor of Divinity died suddenly and the Whig Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, offered the post to Hampden. (The only other clergyman from Oxford who in Whig eyes deserved preferment was Thomas Arnold of Rugby School but he was already regarded as a heretic in conservative church circles). The news leaked out before the appointment was confirmed and opposition was quickly organised in the hope of preventing it. It came from three different groups. 

A few high churchmen and evangelicals genuinely believed him to hold heretical views and therefore to be unfit to train future clergymen; a large number of Oxford graduates resented the favour shown to the author of &quot;Observations on Religious Dissent&quot;; and a large number of Tory supporters throughout the country seized the chance of harrying a Whig government. Despite all the objections, Melbourne pushed the nomination through and Hampden became the Regius Professor of Divinity. Melbourne told the House of Lords when the appointment was debated, with brutal frankness that few if any of them had the expert knowledge to have an informed opinion on the matter.

==Bishop of Hereford==
Hampden&#x27;s nomination by Lord John Russell to the vacant see of Hereford in December 1847 was again the signal for organised opposition; and his consecration in March 1848 took place in spite of a remonstrance by many of the bishops, and the resistance of John Merewether, the Dean of Hereford, who voted against the election.

As bishop of Hereford Dr Hampden made no change in his long-formed habits of studious seclusion, and though he showed no special ecclesiastical activity or zeal, the diocese certainly prospered in his charge. Among the more important of his later writings were the articles on Aristotle, Plato and Socrates, which contributed to the eighth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, and afterwards reprinted with additions under the title of &quot;The Fathers of Greek Philosophy&quot; (Edinburgh, 1862). In 1866 he had a paralytic seizure, and died in London on 23 April 1868. His daughter, Henrietta Hampden, published &quot;Some Memorials of R. D. Hampden&quot; in 1871.

<doc id="212573" wikidata="Q4935164" url="?curid=212573" title="Bobby Hutton">
<text>Robert James Hutton (April 21, 1950–April 6, 1968), also known as &quot;Lil&#x27; Bobby,&quot; was the treasurer and first recruit to join the Black Panther Party. Alongside Eldridge Cleaver and other Panthers, he was involved in a confrontation with Oakland police that wounded two officers. Hutton was killed by the police in disputed circumstances. Cleaver stated Hutton was shot while surrendering with his hands up, while police stated he ignored commands and tried to flee.

==Early life==
Bobby Hutton was one of three children, born in Jefferson County, Arkansas, to John D. Hutton and Dolly Mae Mitchner-Hutton. When he was three years old, his family moved to Oakland, California during the second wave of the Great Migration, after they were visited by nightriders intimidating and threatening Black residents in the area.

==Black Panther Party==
Hutton met Black Panther Party founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale at the North Oakland Neighborhood Anti-Poverty Center, a &quot;government-funded agency that employed local youth to work on community service projects.&quot; In October 1966, 16-year-old Hutton became the first member and the first treasurer of the Black Panther Party. In May 1967, he was one of thirty Panthers who traveled to the California state capitol in Sacramento to demonstrate against the Mulford Act, a bill that would prohibit carrying loaded firearms in public. The group walked into the state assembly armed; Hutton and four other Panthers were arrested.

==Death==
On the night of April 6, 1968, Hutton was killed by Oakland Police officers after Eldridge Cleaver led him and twelve other Panthers in a confrontation with the Oakland Police, during which two officers were seriously wounded by gunfire. The confrontation, which lasted roughly an hour and a half and which took place at a house in West Oakland, drew to a close when the police tear-gassed the house and Hutton and Cleaver surrendered. One impetus for the confrontation was the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

Despite the fact that he had instructed Hutton to strip down to his underwear to demonstrate that he was unarmed, Eldridge Cleaver stated that police shot Hutton more than twelve times as he was surrendering. Another account from Kathleen Cleaver states that Hutton was embarrassed to remove his clothing and so he only took off his shirt and kept on his pants. While the police maintained that he attempted to run away and ignored orders to stop, Eldridge Cleaver stated that Hutton was shot by the police with his hands up. Cleaver also claimed that an Oakland police officer who witnessed the shoot-out later told him: &quot;What they did was first-degree murder.&quot; Cleaver and two police officers were also wounded. Bobby Seale, a fellow Black Panther, has since speculated that the police shot Bobby Hutton thinking they were shooting him.

Hutton&#x27;s funeral was held on April 12 at the Ephesians Church of God in Berkeley, California. About 1,500 people attended the funeral. A rally held afterwards at the Alameda County Courthouse near Lake Merritt in Oakland which was attended by over 2,000 people, and included a eulogy by actor Marlon Brando. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. 

Bobby Hutton&#x27;s death at the hands of the Oakland police was seen by those sympathetic to the Black Panther Party as an example of police brutality against blacks. Hutton was the first Panther to die and &quot;immediately became a martyr for the cause of black power.&quot;

==Legacy==
DeFremery Park in West Oakland, California, was unofficially named after Bobby Hutton not long after his death and is now known locally as &quot;Lil&#x27; Bobby Hutton Park&quot;. &quot;Lil&#x27; Bobby Hutton Day&quot; has been held annually at the park since April 1998. Organized by family members and former Black Panther Party members, the memorial event features speakers, performers, and art works commemorating Hutton&#x27;s black consciousness and dedication to the party.

==In popular culture==
Hutton has been referenced frequently in popular culture. He was portrayed by Wesley Jonathan in the 1995 movie &quot;Panther&quot;. He is mentioned in Tupac Shakur&#x27;s &quot;Ghetto Gospel,&quot; Paris&#x27; &quot;Panther Power&quot; (1990), The Coup&#x27;s &quot;Get Up&quot; (2001), Smif-N-Wessun’s &quot;Still Fighting&quot; (2007), Sa-Roc&#x27;s &quot;Lost Sunz&quot; (2014), Bhi Bhiman&#x27;s &quot;Up in Arms&quot; (2015), Bambu&#x27;s verse from Rocky Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Headhunter,&quot; and Clipping&#x27;s &quot;Blood of the Fang&quot; (2019). A photo of Hutton in front of the Oakland City Jail appeared on the cover of Primal Scream&#x27;s 1997 single &quot;Star.&quot; Country Joe And The Fish dedicated their 1968 LP &quot;Together&quot; to Hutton. Hutton&#x27;s story is featured in the young adult novel One Crazy Summer by Rita Williams-Garcia.

<doc id="212576" wikidata="Q12061163" url="?curid=212576" title="Henry Liddon">
<text>Henry Parry Liddon (1829–1890), usually cited as H. P. Liddon, was an English Anglican theologian. From 1870 to 1882, he was Dean Ireland&#x27;s Professor of the Exegesis of Holy Scripture at the University of Oxford.

== Biography ==

The son of a naval captain, Liddon was born on 20 August 1829 at North Stoneham, near Eastleigh, Hampshire. He was educated at King&#x27;s College School, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated, taking a second class, in 1850. As vice principal of the theological college at Cuddesdon (1854–1859) he wielded considerable influence, and, on returning to Oxford as vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, became a force among the undergraduates, exercising his influence in opposition to the liberal reaction against Tractarianism, which had set in after John Henry Newman&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism in 1845.
In 1864 Walter Kerr Hamilton, the Bishop of Salisbury, whose examining chaplain Liddon had been, appointed him prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral. In 1866 he delivered his Bampton Lectures on the doctrine of the divinity of Christ, published as &quot;The Divinity of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&quot; (1867). From that time his fame as a preacher was established. In 1870 he was made canon of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. He had before this published &quot;Some Words for God&quot; against the scepticism of the day. His preaching at St Paul&#x27;s soon attracted vast crowds. The afternoon sermon, which fell to the canon in residence, had usually been delivered in the choir, but soon after Liddon&#x27;s appointment it became necessary to preach the sermon under the dome, where from 3000 to 4000 persons used to gather to hear him.

Liddon was praised for grasp of his subject, clarity and lucidity, use of illustration, vividness of imagination, elegance of diction, and sympathy with the intellectual position of those whom he addressed. In the arrangement of his material, he is thought to have imitated the French preachers of the age of Louis XIV.

In 1870 Liddon had also been made Dean Ireland&#x27;s Professor of the Exegesis of Holy Scripture at Oxford. The combination of the two appointments gave him extensive influence over the Church of England. With Dean Church he restored the influence of the Tractarian school, and he succeeded in popularising the opinions which, in the hands of Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble, had appealed to thinkers and scholars. He opposed the Church Discipline Act of 1874, and denounced the Bulgarian atrocities of 1876.

In 1882 he resigned his professorship and travelled in Palestine and Egypt; and showed his interest in the Old Catholic movement by visiting Döllinger at Munich. In 1886, he became chancellor of St Paul&#x27;s, and declined more than one offer of a bishopric. Liddon was a friend of Lewis Carroll, who accompanied him on a trip to Moscow where Liddon made approaches to leading Russian Orthodox clergy, seeking closer links between them and the Church of England.

He died on 9 September 1890 at the height of his reputation, having nearly completed a biography of Pusey, whom he admired; this work was completed after his death by John Octavius Johnston and Robert Wilson. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Liddon&#x27;s influence during his life was due to his personal fascination and his pulpit oratory rather than to his intellect. As a theologian his outlook was old-fashioned; to the last he maintained the narrowly orthodox standpoint of Pusey and Keble, in opposition to modernist thought and scholarship. The publication in 1889 of &quot;Lux Mundi&quot; edited by Charles Gore, a series of essays attempting to harmonise Anglican Catholic doctrine with modern thought, showed that even at Pusey House, established as the citadel of Puseyism at Oxford, the principles of Pusey were being departed from. He was the last of the classical pulpit orators of the English Church, the last great popular exponent of the traditional Anglican orthodoxy, with the exception of John Charles Ryle (1816-1900), the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool (1880-1900).
Liddon is buried in the Chapel of the Order of the British Empire in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, close to the grave of Henry Hart Milman.

==Works==

Besides the works mentioned, Liddon published several volumes of sermons, including a book on sermons on the Magnificat, a volume of Lent lectures entitled &quot;Some Elements of Religion&quot; (1870), and a collection of &quot;Essays and Addresses&quot; on such themes as Buddhism, Dante, etc.

Liddon wrote &quot;Explanatory Analysis of Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans&quot; published in 1899 and &quot;Explanatory Analysis of Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to Timothy&quot; published in 1897. Both were published posthumously.

Liddon was chosen to preach to the International Medical Congress at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London in 1881. During the sermon, he addressed the subject of Darwinian evolution, which was a point of great debate among leading scientists and physicians of the day:

He is also noted for his translation and abridgement of Rosmini&#x27;s &quot;Of the Five Wounds of the Holy Church&quot;.

<doc id="212587" wikidata="Q1063490" url="?curid=212587" title="Dicastery for the Causes of Saints">
<text>In the Catholic Church, the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, previously named the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (), is the dicastery of the Roman Curia that oversees the complex process that leads to the canonization of saints, passing through the steps of a declaration of &quot;heroic virtues&quot; and beatification. After preparing a case, including the approval of miracles, the case is presented to the pope, who decides whether or not to proceed with beatification or canonization.

==History==

===Early history===

Saints were recognised by popular acclamation until the 12th century. After controversial cases, Pope Alexander III in 1170 required all candidates for sainthood to be approved by the Vatican. The papacy took total authority over the process in the 17th century.

===Sacred Congregation of Rites===
The Sacred Congregation for Rites was created by Pope Sixtus V on 22 January 1588 in the bull &quot;Immensa aeterni Dei&quot;. The congregation dealt both with regulating divine worship and the causes of saints.

===Congregation for the Causes of Saints===
On 8 May 1969, Pope Paul VI issued the apostolic constitution , separating the Congregation into two parts: The Congregation for the Divine Worship and the renamed &quot;Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints&quot;, which was given three offices, those of the judiciary, the Promoter General of the Faith, and the historical-juridical.

With the changes in the canonization process introduced by Pope John Paul II in 1983, a &quot;College of Relators&quot;, with five relators (priests appointed to oversee the canonisation process), was added to prepare the cases of those declared as Servants of God. In January 2014, the Prefect of the Congregation announced that at the direction of Pope Francis those working on canonizations must adhere to financial guidelines to eliminate unfairness in the treatment of cases based on the financial resources provided. According to &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, Pope Francis hoped to promote the causes of those less well-known, those from poorer regions, and those who were victims of 20th-century totalitarian persecutions.

===Dicastery for the Causes of Saints===
As part of his 2022 reorganization of the Curia in Praedicate evangelium, Pope Francis renamed the congregation to the &quot;Dicastery for the Causes of Saints&quot;. It is working on about 1,600 causes, some dating from the 15th century.

==Canonization process since 1983==

The current steps for the recognition of a miracle follow rules laid down in 1983 by the apostolic constitution &quot;Divinus perfectionis Magister&quot;. Changes to the previous system included reduction of the waiting period for opening a Cause to five years after the candidate&#x27;s death, previously 50; halving the number of miracles required; and abolishing the office of &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot;, whose task was always to argue against canonisation.

The legislation establishes two procedural stages: the diocesan one and that of what is known as the Roman Congregation. The first takes place within the diocese where the allegedly miraculous event happened. The bishop opens the enquiry on the presumed miracle in which depositions of the eyewitnesses questioned by a duly constituted court are gathered, as well as the complete clinical and instrumental documentation inherent to the case. In the second, the Congregation examines the documents sent and eventual supplementary documentation, pronouncing its judgment on the matter.
===Assessing miracles===
The miracle may go beyond the possibilities of nature either in the substance of the fact or in the subject, or only in the way it occurs. The Dicastery distingueshes three degrees of miracles. The first degree is represented by resurrection from the dead (&quot;quoad substantiam&quot;). The second concerns the subject (&quot;quoad subiectum&quot;): the sickness of a person is judged incurable, in its course it can even have destroyed bones or vital organs; in this case not only is complete recovery noticed, but even wholesale reconstitution of the organs (&quot;restitutio in integrum&quot;). The third degree (&quot;quoad modum&quot;) involves instantaneous recovery from an illness that treatment could only have achieved after a long period.

In 2016 Cardinal Parolin, under the mandate of Pope Francis, approved new Regulations for the Medical Board of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The Regulations were published and signed by Cardinal Amato and Archbishop Marcello Bartolucci. The current text, explains Archbishop Bartolucci, &quot;is inspired by the previous Regulation approved by Paul VI on 23 April 1976 and, aside from the linguistic and procedural updating, introduces some new elements, such as: the qualified majority, to proceed ad ulteriora to the examination of a presumed miracle, is at least 5/7 or 4/6; the case cannot be re-examined more than three times; for the re-examination of the presumed miracle a Board of nine members is required; the term of office of the president of the Board can be renewed only once (five years, plus another five year term); all those who are occupied with a presumed miracle (promoters of the cause, tribunal, postulators, experts, officials of the Dicastery) are held to secrecy[.]&quot; These &quot;new rules approved by Pope Francis and released by the Vatican on Friday are designed to make the process for approving a miracle in a sainthood cause more stringent, and also to ensure there&#x27;s a clear paper trail behind who&#x27;s picking up the tab and how much is being spent.&quot;

==Canonization process until 1983==

===Martyrs===
The decision as to whether martyrs had died for their faith in Christ and the consequent permission of veneration lay originally with the bishop of the place in which they had borne their testimony. The bishop inquired into the motive of the person&#x27;s death and, on finding they had died a martyr, sent their name with an account of their martyrdom to other churches, especially neighboring ones, so that, in the event of approval by their respective bishops, the cultus of the martyr might extend to their churches also and that the faithful, as is said of Ignatius of Antioch in the &quot;Acts&quot; of his martyrdom &quot;might hold communion with the generous martyr of Christ&quot; (&quot;generoso Christi martyri communicarent&quot;). Martyrs whose cause, so to speak, had been discussed, and the fame of whose martyrdom had been confirmed, were known as proved (&quot;vindicati&quot;) martyrs. That word probably did not antedate the fourth century, when it was introduced into the Church at Carthage; but the fact is certainly older. In the earlier ages, therefore, this veneration was entirely local and passed from one church to another with the permission of their bishops. This is clear from the fact that in ancient Christian cemeteries there are found paintings of only those martyrs who had suffered in that neighborhood. It explains, also, the almost universal veneration very quickly paid to, e.g., Lawrence, Cyprian, and Sixtus II, who were killed by the Roman Emperor Valerian.

===Confessors===
The veneration of confessors, who died peacefully after a life of heroic virtue, is not as ancient as that of martyrs. It was in the fourth century, as is commonly held, that confessors were first given public ecclesiastical honour, though occasionally praised in ardent terms by earlier Fathers.

Individual confessors themselves were sometimes called martyrs. Gregory Nazianzen calls Basil of Caesarea a martyr; John Chrysostom applies the same title to Eustachius of Antioch; Paulinus of Nola writes of Felix of Nola that he won heavenly honours &quot;sine sanguine martyr&quot; (&quot;A bloodless martyr&quot;); Gregory the Great styles Zeno of Verona as a martyr and Metronius gives to Roterius the same title. Later on, the names of confessors were inserted in the diptychs, and reverence was paid them. Their tombs were honoured with the same title (&quot;martyria&quot;) as those of the martyrs. It remained true, however, at all times that it was unlawful to venerate confessors without permission of the ecclesiastical authority as it had been so to venerate martyrs.

===Authority to canonize===
For several centuries, the bishops, or in some places only the primates and patriarchs, could grant martyrs and confessors public ecclesiastical honour; such honour, however, was always decreed only for the local territory of which the grantors had jurisdiction. Universal acceptance of the &quot;cultus&quot; was said to be made possible by the pope because he claimed to be the sole ruler the universal Catholic Church.

Toward the end of the eleventh century the popes judged it necessary to restrict episcopal authority in this regard, and therefore decreed that the virtues and miracles of persons proposed for public veneration should be examined in councils, more specifically in general councils. Popes Urban II, Calixtus II, and Eugene III conformed to this discipline. It happened, even after these decrees, that &quot;some, following the ways of the pagans and deceived by the fraud of the evil one, venerated as a saint a man who had been killed while intoxicated.&quot; Pope Alexander III (1159–81) prohibited his veneration in these words: &quot;For the future you will not presume to pay him reverence, as, even though miracles were worked through him, it would not allow you to revere him as a saint unless with the authority of the Roman Church.&quot; Theologians disagree as to the full import of this decretal: either a new law was instituted, in which case the Pope then for the first time reserved the right of beatification to himself, or an existing law was confirmed. Because the decretal did not end all controversy and some bishops did not obey it in so far as it regarded beatification, the right of which they had certainly possessed hitherto, Urban VIII published a papal bull in 1634 which ended all discussion by exclusively reserving to the Apostolic See both the right of canonization and that of beatification.

<text>Ficaria verna (formerly Ranunculus ficaria ), commonly known as lesser celandine or pilewort, is a low-growing, hairless perennial flowering plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. It has fleshy dark green, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive flowers with bright yellow, glossy petals. Native to Europe and Western Asia, it is now introduced in North America, where it is known by the common name fig buttercup and considered an invasive species. The plant is poisonous if ingested raw and potentially fatal to grazing animals and livestock such as horses, cattle, and sheep. For these reasons, several US states have banned the plant or listed it as a noxious weed. It prefers bare, damp ground and is considered by horticulturalists in the United Kingdom as a persistent garden weed; nevertheless, many specialist plantsmen, nursery owners and discerning gardeners in the UK and Europe collect selected cultivars of the plant, including bronze-leaved and double-flowered ones. Emerging in late winter with flowers appearing late February through May in the UK, its appearance across the landscape is regarded by many as a harbinger of spring.

==Description==

Lesser celandine is a hairless perennial plant to about high, growing in clumps of 4-10 short stems, on which the leaves are spirally-arranged or all basal. The leaf stalks have sheathing bases, no stipules, a groove along their upper surface, and two hollows within. The leaves are cordate, across, dark-green above with a distinctive variegated or mottled pattern, and pale green below. Purple-leaved varieties are common. The margins of the leaves are sometimes entire (rounded) but more often angled or weakly lobed, with hydathodes at the tips. There are two types of roots: dense clusters of thick, pale-coloured elongated tubers surrounded by patches of short, fibrous roots. Some clumps give rise to long stolons to or more, allowing vegetative spread to produce extensive carpets of plants.
It produces large actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) flowers with a diameter of up to , on long stalks arising individually from the leaf axils or in loose cymes at the top of the stem. There are no bracts. The flowers have a whorl of 3 sepaloid tepals and 7 to 12 glossy yellow petaloid tepals, which are sometimes tinged purple or grey on the back. Double flowered varieties also occur. The stamens and carpels are numerous, and the fruit is a single-seeded, shortly hairy achene with a very short style. In several subspecies, tubers are formed in the leaf axils after flowering. It blooms between March and May in the UK.

==Distribution==
&quot;Ficaria verna&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot; is native to central Europe, north Africa and the Caucasus. It has been introduced into Iceland and North America.

==Life cycle==

Lesser celandine grows on land that is seasonally wet or flooded, especially in sandy soils, but is not found in permanently waterlogged sites. In both shaded woodlands and open areas, &quot;Ficaria verna&quot; begins growth in the winter when temperatures are low and days are short. The plants mostly propagate and spread vegetatively, although some subspecies are capable of producing up to 73 seeds per flower. Germination of seeds begins in the spring, and continues into summer. Seedlings remain small for their first year, producing only one or two leaves until the second year.

Growth and reproduction is poor in dry or acidic conditions, though the plants can handle drought well once dormant. By emerging before the forest canopy leafs out, &quot;Ficaria verna&quot; is able to take advantage of the higher levels of sunlight reaching the forest floor during late winter and early spring. By late spring, second year plants quickly age as daylight hours lengthen and temperatures rise. By the end of May, foliage has died back and plants enter a six month dormancy phase.

If disturbed, separation of the plant&#x27;s numerous basal tubers is an efficient means of vegetative propagation. The plants are easily spread if the prolific tubers are unearthed and scattered by digging activities of some animals and humans. Erosion and flood events are particularly effective means of spread, as the plants are very successful at colonizing low-lying floodplains once deposited.
&quot;Ficaria verna&quot; exists in both diploid (2n=16) and tetraploid (2n=32) forms which are very similar in appearance. However, the tetraploid types prefer more shady locations and can develop up to 24 bulbils at the base of the stalk. Subspecies &quot;F. verna &quot;ssp&quot;. verna,&quot; and &quot;F. verna &quot;ssp&quot;. ficariiformis&quot; are tetraploid and capable of colonizing new areas much faster because they produce bulbils in their leaf axils in addition to root tubers. Subspecies &quot;F. verna calthifolia&quot; and &quot;F. verna verna&quot; are diploid and hybrids between subspecies often create sterile triploid forms.

==Ecology==
Lesser celandine is pollinated by bees, small beetles, and flies, including &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, &quot;Bibio johannis&quot;, &quot;Phora&quot;, and &quot;Meligethes&quot;. The larvae of &quot;Olindia schumacherana&quot; feed on the leaves.

It associates with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

===Fungal and oomycetous pathogens===

The leaves are parasitised by the chytrid fungus &quot;Synchytrium anomalum&quot;; the rust fungi &quot;Schroeteriaster alpinus&quot;, &quot;Uromyces ficariae&quot;, &quot;U. poae&quot;, and &quot;U. rumicis&quot;; the smut fungi &quot;Entyloma ficariae&quot; and &quot;Urocystis ficariae&quot;; the leaf spot fungi &quot;Septoria ficariae&quot; and &quot;Colletotrichum dematium&quot;; the grey mould &quot;Botrytis ficariarum&quot;; and the downy mildew &quot;Peronospora ficariae&quot;.

The roots are parasitised by the fungi &quot;Botryotinia ficariarum&quot; (the anamorph of which is &quot;Botrytis ficariarum&quot;) and &quot;Dumontinia tuberosa&quot;.

===As an invasive species===

In many parts of the Eastern and Northwestern United States and Canada, lesser celandine is cited as an invasive species. It poses a threat to native wildflowers, especially those ephemeral flowers with a spring-flowering lifecycle. Since &quot;Ficaria verna&quot; emerges well before most native species, it has a developmental advantage which allows it to establish and dominate natural areas rapidly. It is mainly a problem in forested floodplains, where it forms extensive mats, but can occur on upland sites as well. Once established, native plants are displaced and ground is left barren and susceptible to erosion, from June to February, during the plant&#x27;s six-month dormancy phase.

In the United States, where lesser celandine is considered a plant pest to gardens, lawns, and natural areas, many governmental agencies have attempted to slow the spread of this species with limited success. As of 2014, the species was reported to be invasive and established in 25 states. USDA APHIS considers &quot;Ficaria verna&quot; to be a high-risk weed that could spread across 79% of the United States, anticipating possible impacts to threatened and endangered riparian species. The U.S. National Park Service&#x27;s Plant Conservation Alliance recommends avoiding planting lesser celandine, and instead planting native ephemeral wildflowers such as &quot;Asarum canadense&quot;, bloodroot, the native twinleaf (&quot;Jeffersonia diphylla&quot;), and various species of &quot;Trillium&quot; as alternatives.

==As a garden plant==
Christopher Lloyd is one of several horticulturists who have recommended one of the double-flowered Flore Pleno Group for planting at the base of a hedge next to a lawn. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has even given advice on how to plant them, provided by the Royal Horticultural Society. Double-flowered plants were noted as long ago as 1625 when one was found by John Ray. The RHS specialist quarterly publication &quot;The Plantsman&quot; published a lengthy, well-illustrated article on double-flowered lesser celandine cultivars by Belgian gardener and alpine plant specialist Wim Boens in December 2017. &quot;RHS Plant Finder&quot; online lists around 220 named cultivars (many of these may well be very similar; nevertheless, this indicates the interest in the species among gardeners).

===Recommended cultivars===

Sources:

(Double-flowered and semi-double cultivars are unlikely to be invasive as they either cannot set seed or do not often do so. Semi-doubles may occasionally cross with single cultivars, which is probably how some of the most desirable cultivars originally arose.)

* Alba Group (cream to white flowers; foliage green or variously mottled with silver and occasional splashes of purple)
* Brambling (unremarkable yellow flowers; grown for its small triangular or horseshoe-shaped leaves beautifully mottled with silver-grey and purple-brown)
* Brazen Hussy (bright yellow flowers; glossy dark bronze foliage)
* Collarette (golden yellow double flowers with neat, button-like centres, green in the middle, and a gappy ring of outer petals; silvery-green leaves often with a central streak or splash of purple-black)
* Coppernob (bright orange, single flowers; glossy dark bronze foliage) 
* Double Bronze (syns. Bowles&#x27;s Double, Wisley Double) (semi-double rich yellow flowers with reddish-bronze reverse; green foliage streaked with silver)
* Double Mud (semi-double flowers, cream petals, muddy purple-brown on the reverse; green foliage mottled with silver)
* Flore Pleno Group (fully double yellow flowers, green or greenish purple on the reverse making a neat rounded centre; foliage pale green or dappled with silver)
* Green Petal (a curiosity with small double flowers resembling greenish-yellow roses; distinctive green foliage splashed silver, purple and bronze)
* Ken Aslet Double (syn. Ken Aslet) (sterile, fully double white, cream at centre, dark purplish reverse to the petals; plain green or slightly mottled foliage)
* Salmon&#x27;s White (single flowers open cream, fading almost to white, purplish-blue on reverse; dark green foliage splashed silver and black)
==Toxicity==
All plants of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) contain a compound known as protoanemonin. When the plant is wounded, the unstable glucoside ranunculin turns into the toxin protoanemonin. Contact with damaged or crushed &quot;Ficaria&quot; leaves can cause itching, rashes or blistering on the skin or mucosa. Ingesting the toxin can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, spasms, or paralysis. In one case, a patient experienced acute hepatitis and jaundice when taking untreated lesser celandine extracts internally as an herbal remedy for hemorrhoids.

===Treatment===
On drying of these plants, the protoanemonin toxin dimerizes to non-toxic anemonin, which is further hydrolyzed to non-toxic dicarboxylic acids. Cooking of the plants also eliminates the toxicity of the plants and the plant has been incorporated in diets or herbal medicine after being dried, and ground for flour, or boiled and consumed as a vegetable.

==Historical herbal use==
The plant is known as pilewort by some herbalists because it has historically been used to treat piles (hemorrhoids). Lesser celandine is still recommended in several &quot;current&quot; herbal guides for treatment of hemorrhoids by applying an ointment of raw leaves as a cream or lanolin to the affected area. Supposedly, the knobby tubers of the plant resemble piles, and according to the doctrine of signatures this resemblance suggests that pilewort could be used to cure piles.

Nicholas Culpepper (1616 – 1654), is claimed to have treated his daughter for &#x27;scrofula&#x27; (or Kings evil) with the plant.

The German vernacular &quot;skorbutkraut&quot; (&quot;scurvy herb&quot;) derives from the use of young leaves, which are high in vitamin C, to prevent scurvy. However, use of lesser celandine to prevent scurvy could be considered a misnomer, tied to its similar appearance to common scurvygrass (&quot;Cochlearia officinalis&quot;), which shares similarly shaped leaves as well as sharing the german name &quot;skorbutkraut&quot;. The German &quot;Hager&#x27;s Manual of pharmacy practice&quot; of 1900 states &quot;Ranunculus ficaria&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] and &quot;C. officinalis&quot; both share this name and use, though there was little documentation of the toxicity of untreated &quot;Ficaria&quot; species at the time.

Most guides today point out that medicines should be made from the dried herb or by heat extraction as the untreated plants and extracts will contain protoanemonin, a mild toxin. The plant has been widely used in Russia and is sold in most pharmacies as a dried herb. The protoanemonin found in fresh leaves is an irritant and mildly toxic but is suggested to have antibacterial properties if used externally. The process of heating or drying turns the Ranunculaceae toxin to anemonin which is non-toxic and may have antispasmodic and analgesic properties.
Mesolithic Hunter gatherers in Europe consumed the roots of the plant as a source of carbohydrates boiled, fried or roasted.

==References in literature==
The poet William Wordsworth was very fond of the flower, which inspired him to write three poems: &quot;To the Small Celandine,&quot; &quot;To the Same Flower,&quot; and &quot;The Small Celandine.&quot; The third poem begins thus:

&lt;poem&gt;
There is a Flower, the lesser Celandine,
That shrinks, like many more, from cold and rain;
And, the first moment that the sun may shine,
Bright as the sun himself, &#x27;tis out again!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Upon Wordsworth&#x27;s death it was proposed that a celandine be carved on his memorial plaque inside St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Grasmere, but unfortunately the greater celandine &quot;Chelidonium majus&quot; was mistakenly used.

Edward Thomas wrote a poem entitled &quot;Celandine&quot;. Encountering the flowers in a field, the narrator is reminded of a past love, now dead. He also remarked on banks of celandines in his early prose work &quot;In Pursuit of Spring&quot; (1913).

C. S. Lewis mentions celandines in a key passage of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, when Aslan comes to Narnia and the whole wood passes &quot;in a few hours or so from January to May&quot;. The children notice &quot;wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow flowers - celandines&quot;.

D. H. Lawrence mentions celandines frequently in &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;. They appear to be a favorite of the protagonist, Paul Morel:

...going down the hedgeside with the girl, he noticed the celandines, scalloped splashes of gold, on the side of the ditch.

&#x27;I like them,&#x27; he said, &#x27;when their petals go flat back with the sunshine. They seem to be pressing themselves at the sun.&#x27;

And then the celandines ever after drew her with a little spell.

<text>A minor-planet moon is an astronomical object that orbits a minor planet as its natural satellite. , there are 457 minor planets known or suspected to have moons. Discoveries of minor-planet moons (and binary objects, in general) are important because the determination of their orbits provides estimates on the mass and density of the primary, allowing insights into their physical properties that are generally not otherwise accessible.

Several of the moons are quite large compared to their primaries: 90 Antiope, Mors–Somnus and Sila–Nunam (95%), Patroclus–Menoetius, Altjira and Lempo–Hiisi (90%, with Lempo–Paha at 50%). The largest known minor-planet moon in &quot;absolute&quot; size is Pluto&#x27;s largest moon Charon, which itself has about half the diameter of Pluto.

There are also several known ring systems around distant objects (see: &quot;Rings of Chariklo&quot; and &quot;Chiron&quot;).

== Terminology ==
In addition to the terms &quot;satellite&quot; and &quot;moon&quot;, the term &quot;binary&quot; (binary minor planet) is sometimes used for minor planets with one moon, and &quot;triple&quot; for minor planets with two moons. If one object is much bigger it is referred to as the &quot;primary&quot; and its companion as the &quot;secondary&quot;. The term &quot;double asteroid&quot; is sometimes used for systems in which the asteroid and its moon are roughly the same size, while &quot;binary&quot; tends to be used independently from the relative sizes of the components. When binary minor planets are similar in size, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) refers to them as &quot;binary companions&quot; instead of referring to the smaller body as a satellite. A good example of a true binary is the 90 Antiope system, identified in August 2000. Very small satellites are often referred to as moonlets.

== Discovery milestones ==

Prior to the era of the Hubble Space Telescope and space probes reaching the outer Solar System, attempts to detect satellites around asteroids were limited to optical observations from Earth. For example, in 1978, stellar occultation observations were claimed as evidence of a satellite for the asteroid to 532 Herculina. However, later more-detailed imaging by the Hubble Telescope did not reveal a satellite, and the current consensus is that Herculina does not have a significant satellite. There were other similar reports of asteroids having companions (usually referred to as satellites) in the following years. A letter by astronomer Thomas Hamilton in the &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; magazine at this time pointed to apparently simultaneous impact craters on Earth (for example, the Clearwater Lakes in Quebec), suggesting that these craters were caused by pairs of gravitationally bound objects.

In 2014, 130 Elektra was discovered to have three moons, making it the only discovered quadruple asteroid.

Also in 1978, Pluto&#x27;s largest moon Charon was discovered; however, at the time Pluto was still considered to be one of the major planets.

In 1993, the first asteroid moon was confirmed when the &quot;Galileo&quot; probe discovered the small Dactyl orbiting 243 Ida in the asteroid belt. The second was discovered around 45 Eugenia in 1998. In 2001, 617 Patroclus and its same-sized companion Menoetius became the first known binary asteroids in the Jupiter trojans. The first trans-Neptunian binary after Pluto–Charon, , was optically resolved in 2002.

=== Multiple systems ===

In 2005, the asteroid 87 Sylvia was discovered to have two satellites, making it the first known triple system (also called a triple minor planet or triple asteroid). This was followed by the discovery of a second moon orbiting 45 Eugenia. Also in 2005, the dwarf planet was discovered to have two moons, making it the second trans-Neptunian object after Pluto known to have more than one moon. Additionally, 216 Kleopatra and 93 Minerva were discovered to be triple asteroids in 2008 and 2009 respectively. There has been one discovered quadruple minor planet, that being 130 Elektra. Since the first few triple minor planets were discovered, more continue to be discovered. , the total number of known multiple systems among minor planets is 18 (including the Pluto and Haumea systems).

The following table lists all satellites of multiple systems, starting with Pluto, which was unnumbered when its first moon was discovered in 1978. The highest known multiplicities are for Pluto (a sextuple system) and 130 Elektra (a quadruple system).

== Commonality ==
The data about the populations of binary objects are still patchy. In addition to the inevitable observational bias (dependence on the distance from Earth, size, albedo and separation of the components) the frequency appears to be different among different categories of objects. Among asteroids, an estimated 2% would have satellites. Among trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), an estimated 11% are thought to be binary or multiple objects, and the majority of the large TNOs have at least one satellite, including all four IAU-listed dwarf planets.

More than 50 binaries are known in each of the main groupings: near-Earth asteroids, belt asteroids, and trans-Neptunian objects, not including numerous claims based solely on light-curve variation.

Two binaries have been found so far among centaurs with semi-major axes smaller than Neptune. Both are double ring systems around 2060 Chiron and 10199 Chariklo, discovered in 1993–2011 and 2013 respectively.

== Origin ==
The origin of minor-planet moons is not currently known with certainty, and a variety of hypotheses exist. One such model is that minor-planet moons are formed from debris knocked off the primary by an impact. Other pairings may be formed when a small object is captured by the gravity of a larger one.

Formation by collision is constrained by the angular momentum of the components, i.e. by the masses and their separation. Close binaries fit this model (e.g. Pluto–Charon). Distant binaries however, with components of comparable size, are unlikely to have followed this scenario, unless considerable mass has been lost in the event.

The distances of the components for the known binaries vary from a few hundreds of kilometres (243 Ida, 3749 Balam) to more than 3000 km (379 Huenna) for the asteroids. Among TNOs, the known separations vary from 3,000 to 50,000 km.

== Populations and classes ==
What is &quot;typical&quot; for a binary system tends to depend on its location in the Solar System (presumably because of different modes of origin and lifetimes of such systems in different populations of minor planets).
* Among &quot;near-Earth asteroids&quot;, satellites tend to orbit at distances of the order of 3–7 primary radii, and have diameters two to several times smaller than the primary. Since these binaries are all inner-planet crossers, it is thought that tidal stresses that occurred when the parent object passed close to a planet may be responsible for the formation of many of them, although collisions are thought to also be a factor in the creation of these satellites.
* Among &quot;main-belt asteroids&quot;, the satellites are usually much smaller than the primary (a notable exception being 90 Antiope), and orbit around 10 primary radii away. Many of the binary systems here are members of asteroid families, and a good proportion of satellites are expected to be fragments of a parent body whose disruption after an asteroid collision produced both the primary and satellite.

* Among &quot;trans-Neptunian objects&quot;, it is common for the two orbiting components to be of comparable size, and for the semi-major axis of their orbits to be much larger − about 100 to 1000 primary radii. A significant proportion of these binaries are expected to be primordial.
** Pluto has five known moons. Its largest moon Charon has a radius of more than half that of Pluto, and is large enough to orbit a point outside Pluto&#x27;s surface. In fact, each orbits the common barycenter between them, with Pluto&#x27;s orbit entirely enclosed by Charon&#x27;s; thus they form a binary system informally referred to as a double dwarf planet. Pluto&#x27;s four other moons, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx, are far smaller and orbit the Pluto–Charon system.
** Haumea has two moons with radii estimated around 155 km (Hiʻiaka) and 85 km (Namaka).
** has one known moon, S/2015 (136472) 1, estimated to be some in diameter.
** 47171 Lempo is a unique trans-Neptunian triple system: Lempo and its moon of roughly equal mass, Hiisi, form a close-proximity binary, separated by roughly 867 km. A second moon, Paha, orbits the Lempo–Hiisi binary at about 7411 km.
** has one known moon, Dysnomia. Its radius, based on its brightness, is estimated to be roughly between 150 and 350 km.

<text>The Family Values Tour was an annual rock and hip hop tour held by the American nu metal band Korn since 1998. The first tour took place in 1998 and the second tour in 1999, but the tour took a hiatus in 2000 due to heavy competition from the Anger Management Tour, the Summer Sanitarium Tour, and others. The Family Values Tour happened again in 2001 before taking another hiatus, this time for four years. The Family Values Tour returned in 2006 with Korn and Deftones as the headliners. Another tour occurred in 2007, before taking another hiatus until 2013. In 2013 the event took place for the final time as a one-day music festival instead of the traditional tour under the name &quot;Family Values Festival&quot;.

==History==

===Family Values Tour 1998===

Korn, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Incubus (who replaced Ice Cube on October 25, 1998 for the four remaining dates), Orgy, and Rammstein.

In one of the more infamous moments, Rammstein&#x27;s band members were all dragged off stage by police and subsequently arrested during their Halloween performance. Each band decided to dress up while Rammstein were barely dressed at all, with most members performing in their underwear. Their lead guitarist Richard Kruspe was the only one decently dressed-he wore a wedding dress. The band had to spend the night in jail on charges of indecent exposure.

====Ice Cube replacement====
On October 25, 1998 due to the beginning of shooting the movie &quot;Next Friday&quot;, Ice Cube was replaced by alternative band Incubus for the remaining four dates. The band is featured on the Family Values Tour &#x27;98 CD release with the song &quot;New Skin&quot; and can be also seen during performance of &quot;All in the Family&quot; on the DVD release.

====Feud with Rob Zombie====
Initially Rob Zombie was to be one of the tour&#x27;s participating artists, but he was dropped from the tour due to high production costs (each Rob Zombie concert would cost $125,000 in band fees and show production alone). Therefore, Rob Zombie was replaced by German industrial metal act Rammstein.

However, the official explanation was somewhat confusing. The Firm, Korn&#x27;s management, said Zombie continually expressed dissatisfaction over not wanting to work with a hip hop act on the bill and was supposedly lectured by Rob Zombie&#x27;s management that &quot;rock kids don&#x27;t like hip-hop.&quot; Rob Zombie&#x27;s manager Andy Gould said those comments were false. He explained that Zombie had never even spoken to Korn, so he could not have made those comments.

Although the statement released by Korn&#x27;s management resulted in anger, Rob Zombie shared no bad blood with the bands participating in the Family Values Tour. In 1999, both Rob Zombie and Korn got on good terms again and launched the highly successful &quot;Rock is Dead&quot; tour together. Korn also toured with Rob Zombie in the summer of 2016.

===Family Values Tour 1999===

Headliners: 
* Limp Bizkit
* Filter
* Staind

On select dates:
* Korn 
* The Crystal Method 
* Mobb Deep 
* Run-DMC 
* Primus 
* Method Man and Redman 
* Sevendust 

Korn did not take a full part in the tour, instead making surprise appearances at a handful of dates.

Insane Clown Posse and System of a Down were originally scheduled for the tour but did not make the final roster. Controversy arose over System of a Down&#x27;s cancelled appearance, with speculation arising to believe Fred Durst had removed the band due to a falling out with the band Taproot after failing to negotiate them a record contract. After things had soured with Durst, System of a Down aided the band in securing a more satisfactory contract. Methods of Mayhem was also offered to take part of the tour.

DMX and Ja Rule were also on the bill for the first half of the tour, but cancelled all the shows prior to the beginning of the tour. Mobb Deep and Run-DMC became their replacements on the tour.

Sevendust filled in for Filter on the Denver date while Filter took time off to film the video for &quot;Take a Picture&quot;.

It was during this tour that Staind&#x27;s frontman Aaron Lewis, alongside Limp Bizkit&#x27;s Fred Durst, performed the emotional hit single &quot;Outside&quot; for the first time in Biloxi, Mississippi. This live version quickly found widespread radio play before being recorded in the studio for Staind&#x27;s next album &quot;Break the Cycle&quot;. Footage of this on-stage performance also was used for the song&#x27;s music video.

==== Dates ====

Cancellations and rescheduled dates
===Family Values Tour 2001===
Bands taking part in the 2001 tour were Stone Temple Pilots, Linkin Park, Staind, Static-X, Deadsy, and Spike 1000 (replacing Deadsy on only first five dates).

====Dates====
=== Family Values Tour 2006 ===

Korn, Deftones, Stone Sour, Flyleaf, Dir En Grey, 10 Years, Deadsy, Bury Your Dead, Bullets and Octane, and Walls of Jericho

====Controversies====
In 2006, a violent fight allegedly broke out in the mosh pit at the Family Values Tour in Atlanta, Georgia during the Deftones performance, resulting in the death of 30-year-old Andy Richardson on August 1, 2006. Lawyers representing Mr. Richardson&#x27;s family said they may pursue civil actions against Korn and the show&#x27;s promoters.

Andy&#x27;s mother, Gloria Richardson, said in a statement to Fox News Service on August 1, 2006 that &quot;It&#x27;s not right that someone could go to a concert for a good time and wind up dead. There needs to be more security or they need to not have these concerts at all&quot;. One week later, 24-year-old Michael Scott Axley was arrested and charged with Richardson&#x27;s murder. Witnesses claim Axley punched Richardson, causing his head to hit the concrete floor and suffer an injury that ultimately proved fatal.

===Family Values Tour 2007===
Main Stage: Korn, Evanescence, Atreyu, Flyleaf, Hellyeah, Trivium, Neurosonic

Side Stage: Droid, Five Finger Death Punch, Through You, Invitro, Twin Method, and Bloodsimple

===Family Values Festival 2013===
On August 30, 2013 Korn revealed to &quot;Billboard&quot; that they were bringing the tour back as a one-day event festival. On September 3, 2013, it was revealed that the Family Values Festival would take place in Broomfield, CO at the 1stBank Center.

Korn, Hollywood Undead, Asking Alexandria, Machine Gun Kelly, Beware of Darkness, and Love and Death

==CD and DVD releases==
* &quot;The Family Values Tour 1999&quot;
* &quot;The Family Values Tour 2001&quot;
* &quot;Family Values Tour 2006&quot;

The initial edition of Family Values Tour was highly successful and it was documented on separate DVD and CD releases, both put on sale on March 30, 1999 via Immortal/Epic Records. The CD release achieved gold record status in the United States while the DVD release went platinum.

<text>Earl Alexander of Tunis is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 14 March 1952 for the prominent military commander Field Marshal Harold Alexander, 1st Viscount Alexander of Tunis. He had already been created Viscount Alexander of Tunis, of Errigal in the County of Donegal, on 1 March 1946, and was made Baron Rideau, of Ottawa and of Castle Derg in the County of Tyrone, at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Alexander was the third son of James Alexander, 4th Earl of Caledon.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second and present holder of the titles. He briefly served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) under Edward Heath from January to March 1974. However, he lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. As a male line descendant of the fourth Earl of Caledon, he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.

==Coat of arms==
The arms of the Earls Alexander are the same as those of the Earls of Caledon because the Earls Alexander descend from the Earls of Caledon.

The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the Earldom is: &quot;Per pale argent and sable a chevron and in base a crescent all counterchanged, on a canton azure a harp or stringed argent&quot;. This can be translated as: a shield divided vertically, the left half white and the right half black. In the centre a chevron and below this a crescent, both counterchanged with the colours of the background. In the top left corner a blue rectangle containing a gold harp with white strings.

==Earls Alexander of Tunis (1952)==
*Harold Rupert Leofric George Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis (1891–1969)
*Shane William Desmond Alexander, 2nd Earl Alexander of Tunis (b. 1935)

The sole person in line to succeed is the present holder&#x27;s brother, the Hon. Brian James Alexander (b. 1939).

<text>Catherine Louise Sagal (; born January 19, 1954) is an American actress and singer. She is known for playing Peggy Bundy on &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (1987–1997), Leela on &quot;Futurama&quot; (1999–2003, 2008–2013, 2023–present), Cate Hennessy on &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; (2002–2005), Gemma Teller Morrow on the FX series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; (2008–2014), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 2011, and Louise Goldufski-Conner on &quot;The Conners&quot; (2018–present).

==Early life==
Sagal was born on January 19, 1954, in Los Angeles to a show business family with five children. Her mother, Sara Zwilling, was a singer (stage name Sara Macon), producer, and television writer who died of heart disease in 1975, and Sagal&#x27;s father, Boris Sagal, worked as a television director. Her father was a Russian-Jewish immigrant. Her mother had Amish ancestors. In 1977, Sagal&#x27;s father married dancer/actress Marge Champion, a few years before his accidental death on the set of the miniseries &quot;World War III&quot; in 1981. Three of Sagal&#x27;s four siblings are actors: her younger twin sisters, Jean and Liz Sagal and brother Joey Sagal; her other brother David Sagal is an attorney married to actress McNally Sagal. Sagal and her siblings grew up in Brentwood.

Her godfather was sitcom producer and writer Norman Lear. In 2016, both Sagal and Lear acknowledged that she was not only his goddaughter, but that he also introduced her parents to each other. Sagal has described herself as &quot;culturally Jewish&quot; but with no &quot;formal religious experience.&quot;

Sagal graduated from Palisades High School. After graduation, she attended the California Institute of the Arts until 1972.

==Musical career==
Sagal began her career in show business as a singer and songwriter. In 1973, she worked as a backing vocalist for various singers, including Bob Dylan, Etta James, and Tanya Tucker. In 1976, while a member of The Group with No Name, she contributed to the album &quot;Moon over Brooklyn&quot; (on which she was credited as &quot;Katie Sagal&quot;). She performed backing vocals on the self-titled Gene Simmons solo album (1978), the Molly Hatchet album &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; (1981), and on Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Soul Kiss.&quot;

She was a member of the music group the Harlettes, Bette Midler&#x27;s backup singers, in 1978, and again from 1982 to 1983.

She performed the song &quot;It&#x27;s the Time for Love&quot; that appears in the film &quot;Silent Rage&quot; (1982) featuring Chuck Norris. During the filming of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, Sagal was scheduled to sing at The Central. Her name can be seen in the schedule of upcoming acts, posted inside the door. Sagal also provided the vocals for &quot;Loose Cannons,&quot; the theme song for the 1990 film of the same name featuring Gene Hackman and Dan Aykroyd.

On April 19, 1994, Sagal released her first solo album, &quot;Well...&quot;. On June 1, 2004, she released her second album, &quot;Room&quot;.

She has also contributed to the &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; soundtrack in the early 2010s, working with its house band The Forest Rangers (Davey Faragher/bass, John Philipe Shenale (Phil Shenale)/keyboards, Billy Harvey/guitar-vocals, Michael Urbano/drums, Bob Thiele Jr./vocals-guitar) with songs that became part of its soundtrack albums (&quot;Songs of Anarchy: Music from Sons of Anarchy Seasons 1–4&quot;, &quot;Sons of Anarchy: Songs of Anarchy Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;Sons of Anarchy: Songs of Anarchy Vol. 3&quot;, and &quot;Sons of Anarchy: Songs of Anarchy Vol. 4&quot;) and singles.

She worked with the band for her album &quot;Covered&quot; (2013). For their live performances The Forest Rangers have occasionally used the name The Reluctant Apostles.

The 2019 single &quot;Mayans MC: Black is Black&quot; from &quot;Mayans M.C.&quot; was performed by Sagal and The Forest Rangers.

==Acting career==

=== Early roles and success with &quot;Married... with Children&quot; ===

One of Sagal&#x27;s early roles was as a receptionist in the &quot;Columbo&quot; installment &quot;Candidate for Crime&quot; (1973), which was directed by her father Boris. She also briefly appeared in the 1986 music video for Debbie Harry&#x27;s song &quot;French Kissin (in the USA)&quot;.

Sagal&#x27;s first major role was as a newspaper columnist in the series &quot;Mary&quot; (1985–86) starring Mary Tyler Moore. This led to her being cast as Peggy Bundy on the sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (1987–1997); she portrayed the lower-class, sex-starved, lazy and free-spending wife of shoe salesman Al Bundy. The series ran for 11 years. Reportedly Sagal brought her own red bouffant wig to audition for the role, and with the producers&#x27; approval the look transitioned into the show. However, Sagal later explained that she had initially styled her own hair, then once the show took off, the producers began to invest in a wig.

=== Continued career ===
After the end of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, several more television films followed; Sagal also guest starred on the children&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Recess&quot; as the voice of Spinelli&#x27;s mother. In 1998, Matt Groening chose her to provide the character voice of the purple-haired mutant spaceship captain, Leela, in his science-fiction animated comedy &quot;Futurama&quot;. The show developed a cult following, but was canceled after four seasons. However, syndication on Adult Swim and Comedy Central increased the show&#x27;s popularity and led Comedy Central to commission a season of &quot;Futurama&quot; direct-to-DVD films, which the network later retransmitted as a 16-episode fifth season. She reprised her role as Leela in the films, and in the sixth season that began airing June 24, 2010. The series ended its run on Comedy Central in 2013. Taking a break from animation, she went on to star in the critically acclaimed movie &quot;Smart House.&quot;

Sagal guest-starred as Edna Hyde, Steven Hyde&#x27;s mother, in three episodes of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. She starred in the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Tucker&quot; in 2000.

Sagal was cast as the wife of John Ritter in the sitcom &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot; in 2002. Ritter had completed only three episodes of the second season before his death, and the show was canceled in 2005 after its third season.

In 2005 and 2006, Sagal made four appearances on &quot;Lost&quot; as Helen Norwood. In 2007, she had a role in the season finale of &quot;The Winner&quot; as Glen Abbot&#x27;s former teacher, with whom Glen has his first sexual experience.

=== &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; and Hollywood Walk of Fame star ===
From 2008 to 2014, Sagal starred as Gemma Teller Morrow on the TV show &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, whose creator, Kurt Sutter, she had married in 2004, four years before the series premiered. In January 2009, Sagal reunited with David Faustino (who had played her son Bud Bundy in &quot;Married... with Children&quot;) for an episode of Faustino&#x27;s show &quot;Star-ving&quot;. In 2010, she appeared twice more on &quot;Lost&quot;. In 2009, she starred in the film &quot;House Broken&quot; with Danny DeVito. In 2010, she returned to the stage in Randy Newman&#x27;s musical &quot;Harps &amp; Angels&quot;.

In 2013, Sagal had a cameo on &quot;Glee&quot; as Nancy Abrams, Artie Abrams&#x27; mother. She co-starred in &quot;Pitch Perfect 2&quot;, released in 2015, as the mother of Hailee Steinfeld&#x27;s character. Next she appeared in the biography drama film &quot;Bleed for This&quot;, as the mother of Vinny Pazienza.

On September 9, 2014, Sagal received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; the &quot;Married... with Children&quot; cast – Ed O&#x27;Neill, Christina Applegate, and David Faustino – were present to celebrate the actor&#x27;s recognition.

=== Recent roles ===
On September 20, 2016, Sagal appeared on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; as Susan, the mother of Penny (Kaley Cuoco). Sagal and Cuoco had played mother and daughter before, on &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;. Sagal was also a series regular on the CBS sitcom &quot;Superior Donuts&quot; from 2017 to 2018. She also appeared on &quot;Shameless&quot; as Frank&#x27;s latest, crazy lover. She appeared in a recurring role as Dan Conner&#x27;s love interest, Louise Goldufski, in &quot;The Conners&quot; after Roseanne Barr was fired by ABC over controversial tweets on Twitter about Valerie Jarrett. She had a cameo appearance in the Netflix series &quot;Dead to Me&quot; in season 2, episodes 9 and 10 as Judy Hale&#x27;s (Linda Cardellini) estranged, emotionally abusive mother Eleanor Hale who was incarcerated. Sagal&#x27;s co-star on &quot;Married...with Children&quot;, Christina Applegate, also stars in &quot;Dead to Me&quot;. In 2018 she had a cameo appearance in the crime drama series &quot;Mayans M.C.&quot; as Gemma Tellor Morrow reprising her role from the &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; series.

In 2021, Sagal played the lead role of Annie &quot;Rebel&quot; Bello in the ABC drama series &quot;Rebel&quot;, which was written by Krista Vernoff. Due to low ratings, ABC cancelled &quot;Rebel&quot; after airing five episodes.

On February 9, 2022, Hulu announced that they would be reviving &quot;Futurama&quot; for a 20-episode 11th season run set to premiere in 2023 with Sagal returning as the voice of Leela.

In 2023, Sagal appeared live off-broadway in &quot;The Gospel According to Heather&quot;, which was written by Paul Gordon, directed by Rachel Klein and produced by Amas Musical Theatre and Jim Kierstead. 

==Personal life==
Sagal was married to musician Freddie Beckmeier from 1978 to 1981, and to drummer and actor Jack White from 1993 to 2000. She married writer-producer Kurt Sutter in a private ceremony on October 2, 2004, at their home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Los Feliz. They have a daughter, Esmé Louise, born in 2007 through a surrogate.

In 1991, while working on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, Sagal discovered that she was pregnant. This was unexpected and the pregnancy was written into the storyline of the show. In October 1991, however, she had to have an emergency caesarean section in her seventh month of pregnancy, ending in the stillbirth of a daughter. The showrunners did not want to subject a grieving Sagal to further stress by interacting with an infant during filming, so the pregnancy on the show (as well as the pregnancy of co-star Amanda Bearse&#x27;s character) was then treated as a &quot;dream sequence,&quot; which was mentioned only briefly at the end of the episode &quot;Al Bundy, Shoe Dick.&quot; Sagal and White eventually had two children—a daughter, Sarah Grace, in 1994, and a son, Jackson James White, in 1996. The writers of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; purposely did not write Sagal&#x27;s two later pregnancies into the show due to the stillbirth, opting instead to write off her absences in a subplot in which Peg is traveling the world to reunite her parents. In scenes where Peg was shown, Sagal had her midsection obscured, such as when she was sitting in a taxi or at a craps table in Las Vegas and was often seen or heard talking to family members over the phone.

The loss of her stillborn daughter Rudy was the inspiration to write the lyrics for &quot;(You) Can&#x27;t Hurry the Harvest&quot;. Sagal recorded this song on her debut album, &quot;Well...&quot;, which was released in April 1994.

In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting; in the video, Sagal and others told the stories of the people killed there.

She was the subject of an episode of the television genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2016.

<text>Urbanized is a documentary film directed by Gary Hustwit and released on 26 October 2011. It is considered the third of a three-part series on design known as the Design Trilogy; the first being &quot;Helvetica&quot;, about the typeface, and the second being &quot;Objectified&quot;, about industrial design. The documentary discusses how cities are designed, and it features interviews with urban planners and architects, such as Oscar Niemeyer and Jan Gehl.

==Marketing==
To promote the documentary, Hustwit commissioned a set of four limited edition posters based on four themes related to urban design.

==Reception==
The film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;an undertaking on an impressive scale&quot; while suggesting that the documentary could have used more interviews of ordinary people. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A.O. Scott compared the film to &quot;a really good class taught by a team of enthusiastic professors,&quot; although he noted &quot;a distinct bias in favor of [Jane Jacobs]-influenced new urbanism and against other approaches to city planning.&quot; &quot;TimeOut&quot;, meanwhile, called &quot;Urbanized&quot; &quot;gorgeously photographed&quot; while praising the film&#x27;s interviews and Hustwit&#x27;s ability &quot;to make even the most banal of cityscapes appear appealingly utopian.&quot;

<text>In general, a rural area or a countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements. Agricultural areas and areas with forestry are typically described as rural, as well as other areas lacking substantial development. Different countries have varying definitions of &quot;rural&quot; for statistical and administrative purposes.

Rural areas have unique economic and social dynamics due to their relationship with land-based industry such as agriculture, forestry, and resource extraction. Rural economics can be subject to boom and bust cycles and vulnerable to extreme weather or natural disasters, such as droughts. These dynamics alongside larger economic forces encouraging urbanization have led to significant demographic declines, called rural flight, where economic incentives encourage younger populations to go to cities for education and access to jobs, leaving older, less educated and less wealthy populations in the rural areas. Slower economic development results in poorer services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. This cycle of poverty contributes to why three quarters of the global impoverished live in rural areas according to the Food and Agricultural Organization.

Some communities have successfully encouraged economic development in rural areas, with policies such as increased access to electricity or internet. Historically, development policies have focused on larger extractive industries, such as mining and forestry. However, recent approaches more focused on sustainable development take into account economic diversification in these communities.

== Regional definitions ==
===North America===
====Canada====
In Canada, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development defines a &quot;predominantly rural region&quot; as having more than 50% of the population living in rural communities where a &quot;rural community&quot; has a population density less than 150 people per square kilometre. In Canada, the census division has been used to represent &quot;regions&quot; and census consolidated sub-divisions have been used to represent &quot;communities&quot;. Intermediate regions have 15 to 49 percent of their population living in a rural community. Predominantly urban regions have less than 15 percent of their population living in a rural community. Predominantly rural regions are classified as rural metro-adjacent, rural non-metro-adjacent and rural northern, following Philip Ehrensaft and Jennifer Beeman (1992). Rural metro-adjacent regions are predominantly rural census divisions which are adjacent to metropolitan centres while rural non-metro-adjacent regions are those predominantly rural census divisions which are not adjacent to metropolitan centres. Rural northern regions are predominantly rural census divisions that are found either entirely or mostly above the following lines of latitude in each province: Newfoundland and Labrador, 50th; Manitoba, 53rd; Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan, 54th. As well, rural northern regions encompass all of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.

Statistics Canada defines rural areas by their population counts. This has referred to the population living outside settlements of 1,000 or fewer inhabitants. The current definition states that census rural is the population outside settlements with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants and a population density below 400 people per square kilometre.

====United States====


===South America===
====Brazil====
In Brazil, there are different notions of &quot;rural area&quot; and &quot;countryside&quot;. Rural areas are any place outside a municipality&#x27;s urban development (buildings, streets) and it is carried by informal usage. Otherwise, countryside (&quot;interior&quot; in Portuguese) are officially defined as all municipalities outside the state/territory capital&#x27;s metropolitan region. Some states as Mato Grosso do Sul do not have any metropolitan regions, thus all of the state, except its capital is officially countryside. Rio de Janeiro is singular in Brazil and it is de facto a metropolitan state, as circa 70% of its population are located in Greater Rio. In the Federal District it is not applicable and there is no countryside as all of it is treated as the federal capital. Brasília is nominally the capital, but the capitality is shared through all Federal District, because Brazil de facto defines its capital as a municipality, and in municipal matters, the Federal District is treated and governs as a single municipality, city-state-like (Brasília, DF).

===Europe===
====France====

15% of the French population lives in rural areas, spread over 90% of the country. The government under President Emmanuel Macron launched an action plan in 2019 amid the yellow vests movement in favor of rural areas named the &quot;Agenda Rural&quot;. Among many initiatives recommended to redynamize rural areas, energy transition is one of them. Research is being carried out to assess the impact of new projects in rural areas.

In 2018, the government had launched the &quot;Action Cœur de Ville&quot; program to revitalize town centers across the country. 222 towns were selected as part of the five-year program. One of the program&#x27;s aims is to make the towns attractive so the areas nearby can also benefit from investments.

====Germany====
Germany is divided into 402 administrative districts, 295 rural districts and 107 urban districts. As one of the largest agricultural producers in the European Union, more than half of Germany&#x27;s territory which is almost 19 million hectares, is used for farming, and located in the rural areas. Almost 10% of people in Germany have jobs related to the agricultural, forest and fisheries sectors; approximately a fifth of them are employed in the primary production. Since there is a policy of equal living conditions, people see rural areas as equivalent as urban areas. Village renewal is an approach to develop countryside and supports the challenges faced in the process of it.

====United Kingdom====

In Britain, there are various definitions of a rural area. &quot;Rural&quot; is defined by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), using population data from the latest census, such as the United Kingdom Census 2001. These definitions have various grades, but the upper point is any local government area with more than 26% of its population living in a rural settlement or market town (&quot;market town&quot; being defined as any settlement which has permission to hold a street market). A number of measures are in place to protect the British countryside, including green belts.

===Asia===
====China====
====India====

In India a village tends to mean a small rural area, including both a settlement and its surrounding agricultural land, rather than just the settlement itself, the typical meaning elsewhere. There are said to be up to 500,000 villages in India. In rural areas, agriculture is the chief source of livelihood along with fishing, cottage industries, pottery etc.

Almost every Indian economic agency today has its own definition of rural India, some of which follow:
According to the Planning Commission, a town with a maximum population of 15,000 is considered rural in nature. In these areas the panchayat makes all the decisions. There are five people in the panchayat.
The National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) defines &#x27;rural&#x27; as follows:
* An area with a population density of up to 400 per square kilometer,
* Villages with clear surveyed boundaries but no municipal board,
* A minimum of 75% of male working population involved in agriculture and allied activities.
RBI defines rural areas as those areas with a population of less than 49,000 (tier -3 to tier-6 cities).

It is generally said that the rural areas house up to 70% of India&#x27;s population. Rural India contributes a large chunk to India&#x27;s GDP by way of agriculture, self-employment, services, construction etc. As per a strict measure used by the National Sample Survey in its 63rd round, called monthly per capita expenditure, rural expenditure accounts for 55% of total national monthly expenditure. The rural population currently accounts for one-third of the total Indian FMCG sales.

====Japan====
In Japan, rural areas are referred to as &quot;Inaka&quot; which translates literally to &quot;the countryside&quot; or &quot;one&#x27;s native village&quot;.

====Pakistan====
According to the 2017 census about 64% of Pakistanis live in rural areas. Most rural areas in Pakistan tend to be near cities and are peri-urban areas. This is due to the definition of a rural area in Pakistan being an area that does not come within an urban boundary. Rural areas in Pakistan that are near cities are considered as suburban areas or suburbs. 

The remote rural villagers of Pakistan commonly live in houses made of bricks, clay or mud. Socioeconomic status among rural Pakistani villagers is often based upon the ownership of agricultural land, which also may provide social prestige in village cultures. The majority of rural Pakistani inhabitants livelihoods is based upon the rearing of livestock, which also comprises a significant part of Pakistan&#x27;s gross domestic product. Some livestock raised by rural Pakistanis include cattle and goats.

===Oceania===
====New Zealand====
In New Zealand census areas are classified based on their degree of rurality. However, traffic law has a different interpretation and defines a Rural area as &quot;... a road or a geographical area that is not an urban traffic area, to which the rural speed limit generally applies.&quot;

== Academic study ==
Because of their unique dynamics, different academic fields have developed to study rural communities.

=== Economics ===
=== Rural planning ===
Rural planning is an academic discipline that exists &quot;within&quot; or &quot;alongside&quot; the field of urban planning, regional planning or urbanism. The definition of these fields differs between languages and contexts. Sometimes the terms are used interchangeably.

<doc id="212619" wikidata="Q2905020" url="?curid=212619" title="Whitehead problem">
<text>In group theory, a branch of abstract algebra, the Whitehead problem is the following question:

Saharon Shelah proved that Whitehead&#x27;s problem is independent of ZFC, the standard axioms of set theory.

==Refinement==
Assume that &quot;A&quot; is an abelian group such that every short exact sequence
:formula_1
must split if &quot;B&quot; is also abelian. The Whitehead problem then asks: must &quot;A&quot; be free? This splitting requirement is equivalent to the condition Ext1(&quot;A&quot;, Z) = 0. Abelian groups &quot;A&quot; satisfying this condition are sometimes called Whitehead groups, so Whitehead&#x27;s problem asks: is every Whitehead group free? It should be mentioned that if this condition is strengthened by requiring that the exact sequence 
:formula_2
must split for any abelian group &quot;C&quot;, then it is well known that this is equivalent to &quot;A&quot; being free.

&quot;Caution&quot;: The converse of Whitehead&#x27;s problem, namely that every free abelian group is Whitehead, is a well known group-theoretical fact. Some authors call &quot;Whitehead group&quot; only a &quot;non-free&quot; group &quot;A&quot; satisfying Ext1(&quot;A&quot;, Z) = 0. Whitehead&#x27;s problem then asks: do Whitehead groups exist?

==Shelah&#x27;s proof==
Saharon Shelah showed that, given the canonical ZFC axiom system, the problem is independent of the usual axioms of set theory. More precisely, he showed that:
* If every set is constructible, then every Whitehead group is free;
* If Martin&#x27;s axiom and the negation of the continuum hypothesis both hold, then there is a non-free Whitehead group.
Since the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of both of the following:
*The axiom of constructibility (which asserts that all sets are constructible);
*Martin&#x27;s axiom plus the negation of the continuum hypothesis,
Whitehead&#x27;s problem cannot be resolved in ZFC.

==Discussion==
J. H. C. Whitehead, motivated by the second Cousin problem, first posed the problem in the 1950s. Stein answered the question in the affirmative for countable groups. Progress for larger groups was slow, and the problem was considered an important one in algebra for some years.

Shelah&#x27;s result was completely unexpected. While the existence of undecidable statements had been known since Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem of 1931, previous examples of undecidable statements (such as the continuum hypothesis) had all been in pure set theory. The Whitehead problem was the first purely algebraic problem to be proved undecidable.

Shelah later showed that the Whitehead problem remains undecidable even if one assumes the continuum hypothesis. In fact, it remains undecidable even under the generalised continuum hypothesis. The Whitehead conjecture is true if all sets are constructible. That this and other statements about uncountable abelian groups are provably independent of ZFC shows that the theory of such groups is very sensitive to the assumed underlying set theory.

<text>Charleston is an unincorporated community in southwestern Hopkins County, Kentucky, United States.

According to legend, it was named for &quot;Free Charles&quot;, a former slave, who kept a tavern there. A Charleston post office was in operation from 1855 to 1909.

On May 26, 2024, an EF3 tornado struck the community.

<doc id="212621" wikidata="Q181561" url="?curid=212621" title="Thick-billed raven">
<text>The thick-billed raven (Corvus crassirostris), a corvid from the Horn of Africa, shares with the common raven the distinction of being the largest bird in the corvid family. The thick-billed raven averages in length, with a range of and weighs approximately in females and in males on average. Its size is about the same as the largest subspecies of common raven (i.e. those from the Himalayas and Greenland/Canadian Northwest Atlantic) but some common raven subspecies are rather smaller and, going on average weights, the thick-billed raven is likely the heaviest extant passerine. The thick-billed raven is about 25% heavier on average than the Australasian superb lyrebird, which is sometimes erroneously titled the largest passerine.

It has a very large bill that is laterally compressed and is deeply curved in profile giving the bird a very distinctive appearance. This bill, the largest of any passerine at in length, is black with a white tip and has deep nasal grooves with only light nasal bristle covers. This raven has very short feathers on the head, throat and neck. The throat and upper breast have an oily brown gloss, while the rest of the bird is glossy black except for a distinctive white patch of feathers on the nape and onto the neck.

==Distribution and habitat==
Its range covers Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia; its habitat includes mountains and high plateaux between elevations of 1,500 to 3,400 metres. It is one of several avian species endemic to northeastern tropical Africa.

==Behaviour==
===Diet===
The thick-billed raven is omnivorous, feeding on grubs, beetle larvae from animal dung, carrion, scraps of meat and human food. It has been seen taking standing wheat. When seeking food from dung, it has been seen using a distinct scything movement to scatter the dung and extract the grubs.

===Nesting===
It nests in trees and on cliffs, apparently building a stick nest like the similar and much more widely distributed and studied white-necked raven. It lays three to five eggs. In one case, thick-billed ravens were observed to vigorously displace predatory Verreaux&#x27;s eagle owls from their nest area.

===Voice===
Its calls include a harsh nasal croak, a low wheezy croak, a &quot;raven-raven&quot;, and sometimes a &quot;dink, dink, dink&quot; sound. Like many corvids, the thick-billed raven is capable of vocal mimicry; however, this behaviour is rare in the wild, and is normally recorded only in captivity.

<doc id="212629" wikidata="Q7014761" url="?curid=212629" title="New York Times Co. v. United States">
<text>New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the First Amendment right to freedom of the press. The ruling made it possible for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspapers to publish the then-classified &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; without risk of government censorship or punishment.

President Richard Nixon had claimed executive authority to force the &quot;Times&quot; to suspend publication of classified information in its possession. The question before the court was whether the constitutional freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of government to maintain the secrecy of information. The Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did protect the right of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to print the materials.

==Background==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; Washington Bureau Chief Max Frankel stated in 1971, during the organization&#x27;s ongoing fight to publish the Pentagon Papers, that secrets are often leaked to the press as a means of &quot;testing policy ideas and government initiatives.&quot; Frankel recounted, for example, that presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson revealed Cold War secrets for political and communication purposes. In contrast, the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; were released outside the unspoken rules of this framework by originating from a source at the lower levels of government. By 1971, the United States had been engaged in an undeclared war with North Vietnam for six years. At this point, about 58,000 American soldiers had died and the government was facing widespread dissent from large portions of the American public. In 1967, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara commissioned a &quot;massive top-secret history of the United States role in Indochina&quot;. Daniel Ellsberg, who had helped to produce the report, allowed 43 volumes of the 47-volume, 7,000-page report to be viewed by reporter Neil Sheehan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in Boston on March 2, 1971, then Sheehan surreptitiously copied them against Ellsberg&#x27;s wishes and took them by plane to The Jefferson hotel in Washington for initial reading, then mailed them to New York for final organization, and the paper began publishing articles outlining the findings.

===Restraining order sought===
The black article appeared in the &quot;Times&quot;″ Sunday edition, on June 13, 1971. By the following Tuesday, the &quot;Times&quot; received an order to cease further publication from a District Court judge, at the request of the administration. The government claimed it would cause &quot;irreparable injury to the defense interests of the United States&quot; and wanted to &quot;enjoin &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from publishing the contents of a classified study entitled &quot;History of U.S. Decision-Making Process on the Vietnam Policy.&quot;&quot;

The government sought a restraining order that prevented the &quot;Times&quot; from posting any further articles based upon the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. In addition to The New York Times Company, the Justice Department named the following defendants: Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, president and publisher; Harding Bancroft and Ivan Veit, executive vice presidents; Francis Cox, James Goodale, Sydney Gruson, Walter Mattson, John McCabe, John Mortimer and James Reston, vice presidents; John B. Oakes, editorial page editor; A. M. Rosenthal, managing editor; Daniel Schwarz, Sunday editor; Clifton Daniel and Tom Wicker, associate editors; Gerald Gold and Allan M. Siegal, assistant foreign editors; Neil Sheehan, Hedrick Smith, E. W. Kenworthy and Fox Butterfield, reporters; and Samuel Abt, a foreign desk copy editor.

===Section 793 of the Espionage Act===

Section 793 of the Espionage Act was cited by Attorney General John N. Mitchell as cause for the United States to bar further publication of stories based upon the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. The statute was spread over three pages of the &quot;United States Code Annotated&quot; and the only part that appeared to apply to the &quot;Times&quot; was 793(e), which made it criminal for:
Whoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it [shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both].
Based on this language, Alexander Bickel and Floyd Abrams felt there were three preliminary arguments to raise. First, the wording of the statute was very broad. Was each article about foreign policy one &quot;relating to the national defense&quot;? What was the significance of &quot;reason to believe&quot; that the Pentagon Papers &quot;could be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of any foreign nation&quot;? If the motivation was to educate the public, was that a defense that served to help, not hinder, the country? Would the public be &quot;a person not entitled to receive&quot; the information? Of equal importance was what the statute did not say: No references to &quot;publication&quot; (as Attorney General Mitchell&#x27;s cease-and-desist order referenced), no reference to classified information, and no support for Mitchell&#x27;s reliance on the top secret classification to justify restraint on publication. Additionally, there was no statutory language providing authority for prior restraint on publication at all.

Second, was the relevance of Mitchell&#x27;s reliance on a criminal statute in a civil proceeding seeking prior restraint. There was a Supreme Court precedent that lent support to the idea that bans on the publication of information by the press were unconstitutional. In 1907 Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the &quot;main purpose&quot; of the First Amendment was &quot;to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments.&quot; In 1931 the Court wrote that only the narrowest circumstances—such as publication of the dates of departure of ships during wartime—were permissibly restrained. In 1969 John Marshall Harlan II wrote that the Supreme Court &quot;rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication.&quot; This second line of reasoning made it seem the statute should only be dealt with in passing, making the case a First Amendment one and the relief the government wanted—a bar on publication—unavailable. 

The third possible approach was a very broad view of the First Amendment, one not focused on the impact of a government victory on the life of a democratic society if prior restraint were granted; but that the publication of just these sorts of materials—governmental misjudgments and misconducts of high import—is exactly why the First Amendment exists.

Federal judge Murray Gurfein heard arguments in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Michael Hess, chief of the Civil Division of the United States Attorneys Office, argued &quot;serious injuries are being inflicted on our foreign relations, to the benefit of other nations opposed to our foreign relations, to the benefit of other nations opposed to our form of government.&quot; Hess relied on Secretary of State William P. Rogers&#x27;s statement reported earlier that day that a number of nations were concerned about the Papers publication and an affidavit from the general counsel of the Navy that alleged irreparable injury if publication did not cease. Hess asked for a temporary restraining order.

Bickel argued that the separation of powers barred the court from issuing the restraining order since there was no statute authorizing such relief. He further argued that there was no exception to the general unavailability of prior restraint that applied in this case. Gurfein called all counsel to his chambers and asked Bickel and Abrams to have the &quot;Times&quot; cease publication of the Papers until he could review them. Bickel responded that Gurfein would be the first judge in American history to enter a prior restraint enjoining the publication of news if he granted the government&#x27;s request. The &quot;Times&quot; refused to cease publication. Gurfein granted the request and set a hearing for June 17th.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; agreed to abide by the restraining order and on June 19, Judge Gurfein rejected the administration&#x27;s request for an injunction, writing that &quot;[t]he security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone. Security also lies in the value of our free institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know.&quot; However, the Court of Appeals, after an &quot;en banc&quot; hearing, granted an injunction until June 25.

===&quot; United States v. Washington Post Co.&quot;===
On June 18, 1971, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; began publishing its own series of articles based upon the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. That same day, Assistant U.S. Attorney General William Rehnquist asked the &quot;Post&quot; to cease publication. After the paper refused, Rehnquist sought an injunction in the District Court for the District of Columbia, but Judge Gerhard Gesell rejected the government&#x27;s request, as did the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. This led to an inconsistency between the D.C. Circuit and Second Circuit Courts of Appeals. 

==Opinion==
The Supreme Court heard arguments from the Executive Branch, the &quot;Times&quot;, the &quot;Post&quot;, and the Justice Department on June 25 and 26, 1971. Along with the issue of how the &quot;Times&quot; obtained the documents (which was being investigated by a federal grand jury elsewhere) the real issue for the Court was whether there was a sufficient justification for prior restraint, which would be a suspension of the newspaper&#x27;s First Amendment rights to freedom of the press. The First Amendment states that no federal law can be made abridging the freedom of the press, but a few landmark cases in the 20th century had established precedents creating exceptions to that rule, among them the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test first articulated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;.

The most recent incarnation of the exception was the grave and probable danger rule, established in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, . During this case, the wording was changed to the grave and irreparable danger standard. The idea behind the numerous versions of the rule is that if a certain message will likely cause a &quot;grave and irreparable&quot; danger to the American public when expressed, then the message&#x27;s prior restraint could be considered an acceptable infringement of civil liberties. The Supreme Court was therefore charged with determining if the Government had sufficiently met the &quot;burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint&quot;.

On June 30, with six Justices concurring and three dissenting, the Supreme Court upheld the right of the newspapers to publish the material. The Court issued a terse &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion, stating only that the Court concurred with the decisions of the two lower courts to reject the Government&#x27;s request for an injunction. In its decision, the court first established the legal question with the use of precedents. It first stated that &quot;Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity&quot;. The purpose of this statement was to make clear the presence of the inherent conflict between the Government&#x27;s efforts and the First Amendment. The decision then stated that the government &quot;thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint&quot;. This reinforced the idea that it was the Nixon Administration&#x27;s responsibility to show sufficient evidence that the newspapers&#x27; actions would cause a &quot;grave and irreparable&quot; danger.

&quot;New York Times v. United States&quot; is generally considered a victory for an expansive reading of the First Amendment, but as the Supreme Court ruled on whether the government had made a successful case for prior restraint, its decision did not void the Espionage Act or give the press unlimited freedom to publish classified documents.

===Concurring opinions===

Justice Hugo Black wrote an opinion that elaborated on his view of the absolute superiority of the First Amendment:

Justice William O. Douglas concurred with Black, arguing that the need for a free press as a check on government prevents any governmental restraint on the press.

Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., wrote separately to explain that the publication of the documents did not qualify as one of the three exceptions to the freedom of expression established in &quot;Near v. Minnesota&quot; (1931).

Justices Potter Stewart and Byron R. White agreed that it is the responsibility of the Executive to ensure national security through the protection of its information. However, in areas of national defense and international affairs, the President possesses great constitutional independence that is virtually unchecked by the Legislative and Judicial branches. &quot;In absence of governmental checks and balances&quot;, wrote Justice Stewart, &quot;the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power in [these two areas] may lie in an enlightened citizenry – in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of democratic government&quot;.

Justice Thurgood Marshall argued that the term &quot;national security&quot; was too broad to legitimize prior restraint, and also argued that it is not the Court&#x27;s job to create laws where the Congress had not spoken.

===Dissenting opinions===

Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, dissenting, argued that when &quot;the imperative of a free and unfettered press comes into collision with another imperative, the effective functioning of a complex modern government, there should be a detailed study on the effects of these actions.&quot; He argued that in the haste of the proceedings, and given the size of the documents, the Court was unable to gather enough information to make a decision. He also argued that the &quot;Times&quot; should have discussed the possible societal repercussions with the Government prior to publication of the material. The Chief Justice did not argue that the Government had met the aforementioned standard, but rather that the decision should not have been made so hastily.

Justice John M. Harlan and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined Burger in arguing the faults in the proceedings, and the lack of attention towards national security and the rights of the Executive.

<doc id="212630" wikidata="Q6827322" url="?curid=212630" title="Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo">
<text>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), was a seminal First Amendment ruling by the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overturned a Florida state law that required newspapers to offer equal space to political candidates who wished to respond to election-related editorials or endorsements. The Supreme Court ruled that law was an unconstitutional restriction of freedom of the press under the First Amendment.

== Background ==
In 1972 Pat Tornillo, a candidate for an upcoming election to the Florida House of Representatives, found that the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; had criticized his candidacy and endorsed his opponent. Tornillo wrote some replies in which he accused the newspaper of defaming his character, and demanded that the newspaper offer him free space in which to print them. Such a request was permissible under a Florida right of reply statute for newspapers (Florida Statute § 104.38).

The newspaper refused Tornillo&#x27;s demands, so he sued in Florida court for violation of the state&#x27;s right of reply statute. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; responded that the statute was a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, because it compelled newspapers to print content against their will. After several local hearings, the case was sent to the Supreme Court of Florida, which ruled that the Florida statute was not a constitutional violation because, by offering media space to anyone regardless of their financial power or publishing abilities, it enhanced rather than restricted free speech.

The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; requested a special appeal to the United States Supreme Court, because of questions related to the federal constitution, and the Supreme Court accepted the case per a federal law stating that a state supreme court&#x27;s ruling on a federal question may not be the final word.

== Opinion of the court ==
The Supreme Court struck down the Florida right of reply statute for reasons of compelled speech, chilled speech, and the financial nature of the newspaper industry. The court held that the Florida statute violated the First Amendment by requiring newspapers to publish text against their will, while the statute may chill the press because &quot;editors may conclude that the safe course is to avoid controversy.&quot;

Furthermore, the Court held that unlike mass media broadcasting, in which a right of reply may be merited due to scarce frequencies, the newspaper industry suffered no such restrictions and a criticized person would have a relatively easier time finding a competing publication, or even starting a new publication of their own.

Thus, the Supreme Court overturned the Florida right of reply statute as a violation of freedom of the press, &quot;because of its intrusion into the function of editors&quot; and its restrictions on &quot;the exercise of editorial control and judgment.&quot;

== Impact ==
&quot;Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo&quot; has been widely cited as one of the most important Supreme Court rulings on freedom of the press, serving as a crucial precedent in later disputes over government attempts to control the activities of newspapers. However, this ruling is part of an inconsistent duo of cases, with the other being &quot;Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC&quot; (1969), in which the Supreme Court upheld different levels of government regulation for print media vs. broadcast media. This has resulted in frequent criticism of the differing free speech protections for different types of mass media simply because of their delivery methods.

<doc id="212631" wikidata="Q1704342" url="?curid=212631" title="Hustler Magazine v. Falwell">
<text>Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that parodies of public figures, even those intending to cause emotional distress, are protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

In the case, &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine ran a full-page parody ad against televangelist and political commentator Jerry Falwell Sr., depicting him as an incestuous drunk who had sex with his mother in an outhouse. The ad was marked as a parody that was &quot;not to be taken seriously&quot;. In response, Falwell sued &quot;Hustler&quot; and the magazine&#x27;s publisher Larry Flynt for intentional infliction of emotional distress, libel, and invasion of privacy, but Flynt defended the ad&#x27;s publication as protected by the First Amendment.

In an 8–0 decision, the Court held that the emotional distress inflicted on Falwell by the ad was not a sufficient reason to deny the First Amendment protection to speech that is critical of public officials and public figures.

Constitutional limits to defamation liability cannot be circumvented for claims arising from speech by asserting an alternative theory of tort liability such as intentional infliction of emotional distress.

==Background==

Known for its explicit pictures of nude women, crude humor, and political satire, &quot;Hustler&quot;, a monthly magazine published by Larry Flynt, printed a parody ad in its November 1983 issue that targeted Jerry Falwell, a prominent Christian fundamentalist televangelist and conservative political commentator.

The parody was mimicking the popular advertising campaigns that Campari, an Italian liqueur, was running at the time that featured brief contrived interviews with various celebrities that always started with a question about their &quot;first time&quot;, a double-entendre intended to give the impression that the celebrities were talking about their first sexual encounters before the reveal at the end that the discussion had actually concerned the celebrities&#x27; first time tasting Campari.

The &quot;Hustler&quot; parody, created by writer Terry Abrahamson and art director Mike Salisbury, included a headshot photo of Falwell and the transcript of a spoof interview, where, misunderstanding the interviewer&#x27;s question about his &quot;first time&quot;, &quot;Falwell&quot; casually shares details about his first sexual encounter, an incestuous rendezvous with his mother in the family outhouse while they were both &quot;drunk off our God-fearing asses on Campari.&quot; In the spoof interview, &quot;Falwell&quot; goes on to say that he was so intoxicated that &quot;Mom looked better than a Baptist whore with a $100 donation,&quot; and that he decided to have sex with her because she had &quot;showed all the other guys in town such a good time.&quot; When the interviewer asked if Falwell ever tried &quot;it&quot; again, once again mistaking the interviewer&#x27;s intention, &quot;Falwell&quot; responded, &quot;Sure ... lots of times. But not in the outhouse. Between mom and the shit, the flies were too much to bear.&quot; Finally, the interviewer clarifies that he&#x27;s asking if Falwell had tried Campari again, &quot;Falwell&quot; answered, &quot;I always get sloshed before I go out to the pulpit. You don&#x27;t think I could lay down all that bullshit &quot;sober&quot;, do you?&quot;

The ad carried a disclaimer in small print at the bottom of the page that said, &quot;ad parody – not to be taken seriously&quot;, and the magazine&#x27;s table of contents also listed the ad as: &quot;Fiction; Ad and Personality Parody&quot;.

Falwell sued Flynt, &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine, and Flynt&#x27;s distribution company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia for libel, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Before trial, the court granted Flynt&#x27;s motion for summary judgment on the claim of invasion of privacy, and the remaining two charges proceeded to trial. A jury ruled against Falwell on the libel claim, stating that the parody could not &quot;reasonably be understood as describing actual facts about [Falwell] or actual events in which [he] participated.&quot; On the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the jury ruled in favor of Falwell and awarded him $150,000 in damages.

Flynt appealed to the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Flynt&#x27;s argument that the actual-malice standard of &quot;New York Times Company v. Sullivan,&quot; applied in cases of intentional infliction of emotional distress where the plaintiff was a public figure, as Falwell concededly was. The &quot;New York Times&quot; standard focused too heavily on the truth of the statement at issue; for the Fourth Circuit, it was enough that Virginia law required the defendant to act intentionally. After the Fourth Circuit declined to rehear the case en banc, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Flynt&#x27;s request to hear the case.

==Opinion of the court==
&quot;At the heart of the First Amendment is the recognition of the fundamental importance of the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern. The freedom to speak one&#x27;s mind is not only an aspect of individual liberty – and thus a good unto itself – but also is essential to the common quest for truth and the vitality of society as a whole. We have therefore been particularly vigilant to ensure that individual expressions of ideas remain free from governmentally imposed sanctions.&quot; The First Amendment envisions that the sort of robust political debate that takes place in a democracy will occasionally yield speech critical of public figures who are &quot;intimately involved in the resolution of important public questions or, by reason of their fame, shape events in areas of concern to society at large&quot;. In &quot;New York Times&quot;, the court held that the First Amendment gives speakers immunity from sanction with respect to their speech concerning public figures unless their speech is both false and made with &quot;actual malice&quot;, i.e., with knowledge of its falsehood or with reckless disregard for the truth of the statement. Although false statements lack inherent value, the &quot;breathing space&quot; that freedom of expression requires in order to flourish must tolerate occasional false statements, lest there be an intolerable chilling effect on speech that does have constitutional value.

To be sure, in other areas of the law, the specific intent to inflict emotional harm enjoys no protection. But with respect to speech concerning public figures, penalizing the intent to inflict emotional harm, without also requiring that the speech that inflicts that harm to be false, would subject political cartoonists and other satirists to large damage awards. &quot;The appeal of the political cartoon or caricature is often based on exploitation of unfortunate physical traits or politically embarrassing events – an exploitation often calculated to injure the feelings of the subject of the portrayal&quot;. This was certainly true of the cartoons of Thomas Nast, who skewered Boss Tweed in the pages of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. From a historical perspective, political discourse would have been considerably poorer without such cartoons.

Even if Nast&#x27;s cartoons were not particularly offensive, Falwell argued that the &quot;Hustler&quot; parody advertisement in this case was so &quot;outrageous&quot; as to take it outside the scope of First Amendment protection. But &quot;outrageous&quot; is an inherently subjective term, susceptible to the personal taste of the jury empaneled to decide a case. Such a standard &quot;runs afoul of our longstanding refusal to allow damages to be awarded because the speech in question may have an adverse emotional impact on the audience&quot;. So long as the speech at issue is not &quot;obscene&quot; and thus not subject to First Amendment protection, it should be subject to the actual-malice standard when it concerns public figures.

Clearly, Falwell was a public figure for purposes of First Amendment law. Because the district court found in favor of Flynt on the libel charge, there was no dispute as to whether the parody could be understood as describing facts about Falwell or events in which he participated. Accordingly, because the parody did not make false statements that were implied to be true, it could not be the subject of damages under the &quot;New York Times&quot; actual-malice standard. The court thus reversed the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.

==Aftermath==

=== Dramatization ===

&quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, a 1996 film directed by Miloš Forman starring Woody Harrelson as Flynt and Edward Norton as Flynt&#x27;s lawyer Alan Isaacman features the case prominently. Burt Neuborne, a civil rights attorney, First Amendment advocate and law professor who contributed to Flynt&#x27;s defense, reversed roles and played Jerry Falwell&#x27;s lawyer in the film.

=== Flynt–Falwell relationship ===
After &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; appeared, Falwell and Flynt began meeting in person to discuss philosophy. They visited colleges to publicly debate morality and the First Amendment, and exchanged Christmas cards and family photos. After Falwell&#x27;s death in 2007, Flynt wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;the ultimate result was one I never expected ... We became friends&quot;.

<doc id="212632" wikidata="Q129499" url="?curid=212632" title="Gunma Prefecture">
<text>is a landlocked prefecture of Japan located in the Kantō region of Honshu. Gunma Prefecture has a population of 1,937,626 (1 October 2019) and has a geographic area of 6,362 km2 (2,456 sq mi). Gunma Prefecture borders Niigata Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture to the north, Nagano Prefecture to the southwest, Saitama Prefecture to the south, and Tochigi Prefecture to the east.

Maebashi is the capital and Takasaki is the largest city of Gunma Prefecture, with other major cities including Ōta, Isesaki, and Kiryū. Gunma Prefecture is one of only eight landlocked prefectures, located on the northwestern corner of the Kantō Plain with 14% of its total land being designated as natural parks.

== History ==
The ancient province of Gunma was a center of horse breeding and trading activities for the newly immigrated continental peoples (or Toraijin). The arrival of horses and the remains of horse tackle coincides with the arrival of a large migration from the mainland. From this point forward, the horse became a vital part of Japanese military maneuvers, quickly displacing the older Yayoi tradition of fighting on foot.

When Mount Haruna erupted in the late 6th century, Japan was still in the pre-historical phase (prior to the importation of the Chinese writing system during the Nara period). The Gunma Prefectural archaeology unit in 1994 was able to date the eruption through zoological anthropology at the corral sites that were buried in ash.

In the past, Gunma was joined with Tochigi Prefecture and called &quot;Kenu Province&quot;. This was later divided into &quot;Kami-tsu-ke&quot; (Upper Kenu, Gunma) and &quot;Shimo-tsu-ke&quot; (Lower Kenu, Tochigi). The area is sometimes referred to as Jomo (上毛, &quot;Jōmō&quot;). For most of Japanese history, Gunma was known as the province of Kozuke.

In the early period of contact between western nations and Japan, particularly the late Tokugawa, it was referred to by foreigners as the &quot;Joushu States&quot;, inside (fudai, or loyalist) Tokugawa retainers and the Tokugawa family symbol is widely seen on public buildings, temples, and shrines.

The Tenmei eruption of Mount Asama occurred in 1783, causing enormous damage.

The first modern silk factories were built with Italian and French assistance at Annaka in the 1870s.

In the early Meiji period, in what was locally called the Gunma Incident of 1884, a bloody struggle between the idealistic democratic Westernisers and the conservative Prussian-model nationalists took place in Gunma and neighboring Nagano. The modern Japanese army gunned down farmers with new repeating rifles built in Japan. The farmers in Gunma were said to be the first victims of the Murata rifle.

In the twentieth century, the Japanese aviation pioneer Nakajima Chikushi of Oizumi, Gunma Prefecture, founded the Nakajima Aircraft Company. At first, he produced mostly licensed models of foreign designs, but beginning with the all-Japanese Nakajima 91 fighter plane in 1931, his company became a world leader in aeronautical design and manufacture, with its headquarters at Ota, Gunma Ken. The factory now produces Subaru motorcars and other products under the name of Subaru née Fuji Heavy Industries.

In the 1930s, German architect Bruno Julius Florian Taut lived and conducted research for a while in Takasaki.

The Girard incident, which disturbed US-Japanese relations in the 1950s, occurred in Gunma in 1957, at near Shibukawa.

Four modern prime ministers are from Gunma, namely, Takeo Fukuda, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Keizo Obuchi, and Yasuo Fukuda, the son of Takeo.

== Geography ==
One of only eight landlocked prefectures in Japan, Gunma is the northwesternmost prefecture of the Kantō plain. Except for the central and southeast areas, where most of the population is concentrated, it is mostly mountainous. To the north are Niigata and Fukushima prefectures, while to the east lies Tochigi Prefecture. To the west lies the Nagano Prefecture, and the Saitama Prefecture is to the south.

Some of the major mountains in Gunma are Mount Akagi, Mount Haruna, Mount Myōgi, Mount Nikkō-Shirane and Mount Asama, which is located on the Nagano border. Major rivers include the Tone River, the Agatsuma River, and the Karasu River.

As of 1 April 2012, 14% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Jōshin&#x27;etsu-kōgen, Nikkō, and Oze National Parks and Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen Quasi-National Park.

=== Mergers ===
== Climate ==

Because Gunma is situated in inland Japan, the difference in temperature in the summer compared to the winter is large, and there is less precipitation. This is because of the karakkaze (&quot;empty wind&quot;), a strong, dry wind that occurs in the winter when the snow falls on the coasts of Niigata. The wind carrying clouds with snow are obstructed by the Echigo Mountains, and it also snows there, although the high peaks do not let the wind go past them. For this reason, the wind changes into the &quot;kara-kaze&quot;.

*Climate in Maebashi
**Average yearly precipitation: 1,163 mm (approx. 45.8in)
**Average yearly temperature: 14.2 degrees Celsius (approx. 57.6 degrees Fahrenheit)

== Economy ==

Gunma&#x27;s modern industries include transport equipment and electrical equipment, concentrated around Maebashi and the eastern region nearest Tokyo. More traditional industries include sericulture and agriculture. Gunma&#x27;s major agricultural products include cabbages and konnyaku. Gunma produces over 90% of Japan&#x27;s konnyaku, and two-thirds of the farms in the village of Tsumagoi are cabbage farms. Also, the city of Ōta is famous for the car industry, notably the Subaru factory.

== Culture ==

=== Melody Roads ===
As of 2018, Gunma is home to eleven of Japan&#x27;s over thirty Melody Roads. 2,559 grooves cut into a 175-meter stretch of the road surface in transmit a tactile vibration through the wheels into the car body. The roads can be found in Katashina, Minakami, Takayama, Kanna, Ueno, Kusatsu, Tsumagoi, Nakanojo, Takasaki, Midori, and Maebashi. Each is of a differing length and plays a different song. Naganohara also used to be home to a Melody Road playing &quot;Aj lučka, lučka široká&quot;, though the road in question was paved over in 2013 due to noise complaints.

== Prefectural symbols ==
The prefectural symbol consists of the first kanji of the word &#x27;Gunma&#x27; surrounded by three stylized mountains symbolizing the three important mountains of Gunma Prefecture: Mount Haruna, Mount Akagi, and Mount Myōgi.

For marketing, the Prefectural Government also uses Gunma-chan, a small super deformed drawing of a horse character wearing a green cap. It is used on promotional posters, banners, and other notable printed materials from the Prefectural Government. Other agencies and companies formally or informally use variations of its likeness and other horse-shaped characters when making signs or notices for work on buildings, roads, and other public notices.

== In popular culture ==
There are various manga and anime that have based their settings in Gunma, such as:

*&quot;A Place Further than the Universe&quot;
*&quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot;
*&quot;Initial D&quot;
*&quot;Nichijou&quot;
*&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Gunma Yet&quot;

In &quot;Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead&quot;, the main character Akira Tendo is from Gunma Prefecture.

<text>Surabaya is the capital city of East Java province and the second-largest city in Indonesia, after Jakarta. Located on the northeastern corner of Java island, on the Madura Strait, it is one of the earliest port cities in Southeast Asia. According to the National Development Planning Agency, Surabaya is one of the four main central cities of Indonesia, alongside Jakarta, Medan, and Makassar. The city had a population of 2,874,314 within its city limits at the 2020 census. With 3,009,286 people living in the city as of mid 2023 (comprising 1,490,358 males and 1,518,928 females) 
and over 10 million in the extended Surabaya metropolitan area, according to the latest official estimate, Surabaya is the second-largest metropolitan area in Indonesia. Surabaya metropolitan is also ASEAN&#x27;s 6th largest economy ahead of Hanoi. In 2023, the city&#x27;s GRP PPP was estimated at US$150.294 billion.

The city was settled in the 10th century by the Kingdom of Janggala, one of the two Javanese kingdoms that was formed in 1045 when Airlangga abdicated his throne in favor of his two sons. In the late 15th and 16th centuries, Surabaya grew to be a duchy, a major political and military power as well as a port in eastern Java, probably under the Majapahit empire. At that time, Surabaya was already a major trading port, owing to its location on the River Brantas delta and the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands via the Java Sea. During the decline of Majapahit, the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the Demak Sultanate and only submitted to its rule in 1530. Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan Trenggana of Demak in 1546.

From the 18th century until the mid-20th century, Surabaya was the largest city in the Dutch East Indies and the main trading hub for the Indonesian archipelago, competing with Shanghai and Hong Kong.

Surabaya has been one of the busiest trading city ports in Asia. Principal exports from the port include sugar, tobacco, and coffee. Its rich history as a trading port has led to a strong financial infrastructure with financial institutions such as banks, insurance, and export-import companies. The economy is influenced by the recent growth in international industries and the completion of the Suramadu Bridge. The city is home to a large shipyard and numerous specialized naval schools. The Bank of Indonesia has also made plans for Surabaya to be the Islamic financial center of Indonesia.

== Name ==
The name Surabaya, derived from the Javanese phrase &quot;&quot;&quot;,&quot; translates to &quot;bravely facing danger.&quot; Its origins trace back to the Pali words &quot;&quot;sura&quot;,&quot; referring to the figure &quot;Asura&quot; from Buddhist beliefs, and &quot;bhaya&quot;, meaning &quot;fear,&quot; &quot;perils,&quot; or &quot;danger.&quot; This name is connected to a prophecy by Jayabaya, a 12th-century psychic king of the Kediri Kingdom, whose name itself means &quot;conquering fear or perils, drawn from the Pali words &quot;&quot;jaya&quot; or &quot;vijaya&quot;&quot; (victory or conqueror) and &quot;bhaya&quot; (fear or peril). Jayabaya predicted a battle between a giant white shark and a giant white crocodile in the region.

The event is sometimes interpreted as foretelling the Mongol invasion of Java, a major conflict between the forces of Kublai Khan, Mongol ruler of China, and those of Raden Wijaya&#x27;s Majapahit on 31 May 1293, which is now considered the date of the city&#x27;s founding.

The two animals are now used as the city&#x27;s symbol, with the two facing and circling each other, as depicted in a statue appropriately located near the entrance to the city zoo.

Some people consider Jayabaya&#x27;s prophecy as being about the great war between native Surabayan people and foreign invaders at the start of the war of independence in 1945. Another story tells of two heroes who fought each other to be the king of the city. The two heroes were named Sura and Baya. These folk etymologies, though embraced enthusiastically by its people and city leaders, are unverifiable.

Surabaya was previously known as &quot;Soerajabaya&quot;, a name written using the van Ophuijsen spelling system, an older form of Indonesian orthography.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The Kingdom of Janggala was one of the two Javanese kingdoms that were formed in 1045 when Airlangga abdicated the throne of the Kingdom of Kahuripan in favor of his two sons. The earliest historical record of Surabaya was in the 1225 book &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot; written by Zhao Rugua, in which it was called Zhòng Jiā Lú (重迦庐). The name Janggala is derived from the Old Javanese name Hujung Galuh (). Hujung Galuh was located on the estuary of Brantas River and today is part of modern Surabaya city and Sidoarjo Regency.

By the 14th and 15th centuries, Surabaya was one of the Majapahit ports or coastal settlements, together with Tuban, Gresik, and Hujung Galuh (modern Sidoarjo). Ma Huan documented the early 15th-century visit of Zheng He&#x27;s treasure ships in his 1433 book &quot;Yingya Shenglan.&quot;

Ma Huan visited Java during Zheng He&#x27;s fourth expedition in 1413, during the reign of Majapahit king Wikramawardhana. He describes his travel to the Majapahit capital. He first arrived at the port of &quot;Tupan&quot; (Tuban) where he saw large numbers of Chinese settlers migrated from Guangdong and Zhangzhou. Then, he sailed east to the thriving new trading town of &quot;Koerhhsi&quot; (Gresik), &quot;Supaerhya&quot; (Surabaya), and then sailing inland into the river by smaller boat to the southwest until he reached the Brantas river port of &quot;Changku&quot; (Canggu). Continuing to travel by land to the southwest, he arrived in &quot;ManchepoI&quot; (Majapahit), where the Javanese king stayed.

=== Pre-colonial era ===

The Surabaya area was once the main gateway to the capital of the Majapahit Kingdom from the sea, at the mouth of &quot;Kali Mas&quot; river. The anniversary of the city of Surabaya was set on May 31, 1293, commemorating the victory of the Majapahit led by Raden Wijaya against the Mongol invasion. Mongol troops who came from the sea were described as &quot;Sura&quot; (sharks/brave) and Raden Wijaya&#x27;s troops who came from the land were described as &quot;Baya&quot; (crocodiles/danger), literally translating to brave to face the dangers that come threatening. So the day of victory is commemorated as the anniversary of Surabaya.

By the late 15th century, Islam began to take its root in Surabaya. The settlement of Ampel, located around Ampel Mosque in today&#x27;s Ampel subdistrict, Semampir district, north Surabaya, was established by Islamic proselytiser Sunan Ampel.

In the late 15th and 16th centuries, Surabaya grew to a duchy, a major political and military power in eastern Java. The Portuguese writer Tomé Pires mentioned that a Muslim lord was in power in Surabaya in 1513, though likely still a vassal of the Hindu–Buddhist Majapahit. By that time, Surabaya was already a major trading port, owing to its location on the Brantas River delta and the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands via the Java Sea. During the decline of Majapahit, the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the Demak Sultanate and only submitted to its rule in 1530. Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan Trenggana of Demak in 1546.

Following the collapse of Demak, Surabaya was conquered by the Mataram Sultanate, under the leadership of &quot;Panembahan Senopati&quot; in 1598, and invaded by &quot;Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak&quot; in 1610, An article by the VOC in 1620 described Surabaya as a rich and powerful region.&quot;&quot;

The Duchy of Surabaya entered conflict with and was later captured by the more powerful Sultanate of Mataram in 1625 under Sultan Agung. It was one of Mataram&#x27;s fiercest campaigns, in which they had to conquer Surabaya&#x27;s allies, Sukadana and Madura, and to lay siege to the city, blocking the flow of the Brantas River, Sultan Agung forced Surabaya to surrender. With this conquest, Mataram then controlled most of Java, except the Banten Sultanate and the Dutch settlement of Batavia.

=== Colonial era ===
The expanding Dutch East India Company took over the city from a weakened Mataram in November 1743. In consolidating its rule over Surabaya and, in time, the rest of East Java, the Dutch collaborated with leading regional magnates, including Ngabehi Soero Pernollo (1720–1776), his brother Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen (1727–1778), and his nephew, Han Chan Piet, Majoor der Chinezen (1759–1827), all from the powerful Han family of Lasem.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Surabaya was largest city in the Dutch East Indies, becoming a major trading center and hosting the most extensive naval base in the colony. Surabaya also served as the center of Java&#x27;s plantation economy, industry, supported by its natural harbor.

During the Dutch East Indies era, Surabaya was the capital of the Surabaya Residency, whose territory encompasses what is now the Gresik Regency, Sidoarjo, Mojokerto, and Jombang. In 1905, Surabaya received the status of municipality (gemeente). In 1926, Surabaya was designated the capital of the province of East Java. Since then Surabaya developed into the second largest city in the Dutch East Indies after Batavia.
Before 1900, the city center of Surabaya revolved around the &quot;Jembatan Merah&quot; (). In 1910, a modern port facility was built in Surabaya, now known as Tanjung Perak Harbor. Until the 1920s, new settlements such as Darmo, Gubeng, Fields, and Ketabang grew.

In 1920, a census recorded that Batavia had become the largest city. In 1917, a revolt occurred among the soldiers and sailors of Surabaya, led by the Indies Social Democratic Association. The revolt was firmly crushed, and the insurgents were given harsh sentences.

=== Independence era ===
Japan occupied the city in 1942, as part of the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, and it was bombed by the Allies in 1944. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Surabaya was seized by Indonesian nationalists. The young nation soon came into conflict with the British, who had become caretakers of the Dutch colony after the Japanese surrender.
The Battle of Surabaya, started after the &quot;Arek-Arek Suroboyo&quot; () killed British Brigadier Aubertin Mallaby on 30 October 1945, near &quot;Jembatan Merah&quot;, allegedly with a stray bullet. The Allies gave an ultimatum to the Republicans inside the city to surrender, but they refused. The ensuing battle, which cost thousands of lives, took place on 10 November, which Indonesians subsequently celebrate as &quot;Hari Pahlawan&quot; (Heroes&#x27; Day). The incident of the red-white flag (the Dutch flag at the top of Yamato Hotel&#x27;s tower that was torn into the Indonesian red-white flag) by Bung Tomo is also recorded as a heroic feat during the struggle over the city.

The city is known as &quot;Kota Pahlawan&quot; () due to the importance of the Battle of Surabaya in galvanising Indonesian and international support for Indonesian independence during the Indonesian National Revolution.

=== Modern history ===
After the independence era, population growth and rapid urbanization forced Surabaya to develop towards the east and west as it is today. The increase in vehicles, the growth of new industries and the proliferation of housing carried out by real estate companies occupying the outskirts of the city have resulted in traffic jams not only in the downtown area but also frequently in the suburbs. Surabaya grew from a relative poor city in the late 19th century into a metropolis in the late 20th century, and became one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Southeast Asia. Surabaya also managed to become one of the most organized metropolitan cities in Indonesia with the cleanest air.

On 13 May 2018, three churches in Surabaya and one apartment complex in the neighboring regency of Sidoarjo were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks initiated by Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, the Southeast Asian branch of ISIS, followed by a bombing on Surabaya Police Department HQ the next day. 28 people were killed, including the assailants. 57 people were injured; several of whom where in a critical condition.

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in East Java was in Surabaya, on 17 March 2020. In May 2020, Surabaya became the epicenter of the pandemic in Indonesia.

== Geography ==
Surabaya the capital of East Java province, extends over , its metropolitan area covers , which includes the satellite cities of Mojokerto, Gresik, Sidoarjo, Bangkalan, and Lamongan, and has an estimated population of 9.96 million , making it the Second largest urban area in Indonesia and the Top 50 largest in the world. Surabaya ranks 11th among the Indonesian city in the human development index. Surabaya&#x27;s offer business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.

The city is referred to as &quot;Kota Pahlawan&quot; (the city of heroes) due to the significance of the Battle of Surabaya during the Indonesian National Revolution. The city is one of the important financial, commercial, industrial, transportation, and entertainment hubs of the archipelago. Arguably the second most significant city after Jakarta, the city is also home to Indonesia&#x27;s second-busiest seaport, the Port of Tanjung Perak, which is located in northern Surabaya. The city is also known for being one of the cleanest and greenest in Indonesia.

=== Architecture ===
Architecture in Surabaya is a mixture of colonial, Asian, Javanese, modern, and post-modern influences. There are many colonial-era relics still standing today, such as Hotel Majapahit and Surabaya Post Office. As a relatively old city in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, most colonial buildings were built around the 17th century to the early 20th century. These buildings show the influence of Dutch or European style in the Middle Ages.

Before the Second World War, there were many shophouses in the old part of the city, mostly two-storey. They display the influence of European and Chinese traditions. Although some have been dismantled for new construction, there are still many old buildings that are preserved as cultural heritage and city icons, which are around the area of Kembang Jepun Street, Karet Street, Gula Street, Slompretan Street, and Rajawali Street.

After the independence of Indonesia, the center of Surabaya&#x27;s architectural development was concentrated only in the area of Jembatan Merah and its surroundings. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, modern and post-modern style buildings were increasingly emerging in Surabaya. Along with economic development, such buildings have continued to grow. In the 2010s, Surabaya has become a center of skyscrapers and high-rises in East Java and central regions of Indonesia, such as The Peak Residence – Tunjungan Plaza 6 (215 meters) and One Icon Residence–Tunjungan Plaza 5 (200 meters).

=== Parks and Gardens ===

Surabaya is among the cleanest and greenest cities in Indonesia. This can be seen by the urban parks which are equipped with fountains in almost every neighborhood area. These parks include Bungkul Park, Harmoni Park, Pelangi Park, Surya Park, Mundu Park, Undaan Fruit Park, Jayengrono Park, and others. Bungkul Park was awarded the Asian Townscape Award 2013 from the United Nations as the best park in Asia because of its very complete and integrated facilities, starting from the economic area (street food centers), green open area, parks, disability-friendly area, free internet (Wi-Fi), and routine garden maintenance management.

The city of Surabaya is very outstanding in the field of environment. The city has won many awards in the field of environment and city planning both nationally and internationally. These awards have included Adipura, Adipura kencana, Adiwiyata, Wahyu Tata Nugraha, and other green awards, the Adipura Cup, which Surabaya won several times in the 1980s and 1990s, the Adipura Kencana trophy, the cleanest metropolitan city category in the 1990s and in the period of 2010 to 2017, seven consecutive times, as well as the Adipura trophy, plenary in 2016. The city also received several awards from the central government as one of the major cities with the best air quality in Indonesia. Surabaya in 2012 has won the award &quot;City of the Best Participation in the Asia Pacific&quot; by Citynet for the success of the city government and people&#x27;s participation in managing the environment. Surabaya has also been awarded the ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable City Award or &quot;the city with the best sustainable environmental management in ASEAN&quot; in 2011 and 2014. In 2018, Surabaya won the Lee Kuan Yew City Prize along with Hamburg, Kazan, and Tokyo, on the basis of the ability to maintain and manage villages in the middle of the city with excellent government management and community participation amid the rapidly developing city. Surabaya became the first city in Indonesia to receive this award. On the other hand, however, there are not a few areas in Surabaya that appear less organised, especially in the neighborhoods of Southern and Northern Surabaya. This is the concern of the city government to reorganise the environment of the region.

=== Climate ===
Surabaya features a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;), with distinct wet and dry seasons. The city&#x27;s wet season runs from October through May, while the dry season covers the remaining four months. Unlike many cities and regions with a tropical wet and dry climate, average high and low temperatures are very consistent throughout the year, with an average high temperature of around 31 °C and average low temperatures around 23 °C. Summer months (December to February) are the wettest months, while spring months (September to November) are the hottest months.

== Government and politics ==

In 2012, Surabaya was awarded the &quot;ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable City Award&quot;.

Besides representatives to the city council, Surabaya also sends 8 delegates to the East Java provincial parliament.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Surabaya is divided into thirty-one &quot;kecamatan&quot; (districts), and subdivided into 154 &quot;kelurahan&quot; (urban villages). The districts are grouped into five areas: Central, North, South, East, and West. The districts are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with their official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, and the number of administrative villages (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district.

With the extended metropolitan development area called &quot;Gerbangkertosusila&quot; (derived from Gresik-Bangkalan-Mojokerto-Surabaya-Sidoarjo-Lamongan) adding more than 12 million inhabitants in several cities and around 50 districts spread over noncontiguous urban areas including Gresik, Sidoarjo, Mojokerto, and Pasuruan regencies. The central government of Indonesia recognises only the metropolitan area (Surabaya, Gresik, and Sidoarjo) as Greater Surabaya (&quot;Zona Surabaya Raya&quot;) with a population of 8,319,229 (2015), making Surabaya now the second-largest metropolitan area in Indonesia. The city is highly urbanised, with industries centralised in the city, and contains slums. As a leading education center, the city is also home for students from around Indonesia.

Surabaya is an old city that has expanded over time, and its population continues to grow at roughly 2.2% per year. In recent years, more people have moved to Surabaya from nearby suburbs and villages in East Java.

=== Ethnicity ===
Javanese people form the majority in Surabaya, with about 83 percent of the population, while the Madurese and Chinese are significant minorities, each making up about 7 percent of the population. Smaller groups include Arabs, especially the Hadhrami people who originate from the Hadhramaut region in Yemen, Armenians, and Jewish people. Surabaya also has ethnic populations from other parts of Indonesia: Sundanese, Minang, Batak, Banjar, and Balinese.

As one of Indonesia&#x27;s educational destinations, Surabaya is also the residence of students from various regions of the country, who may form communities based on the region they come from. Most come from the Eastern part of Indonesia, including those who are Papuan, Minahasan or Bugis, as well as people from Timor and others. 

Because it is a regional trade hub, many foreigners (expatriates) live in Surabaya, especially in the western part of the city. There are communities of Koreans and westerners in the city.

=== Language ===
Most citizens speak a dialect of East Javanese called &quot;Suroboyoan&quot;, a subdialect of the &quot;Arekan&quot; dialect. A stereotype of this dialect concerns equality and directness in speech. The use of register is less strict than the standardized Central Java dialect. The Suroboyoan dialect is a mixture of both Indonesian and Javanese, also with some significant influence from foreign languages such as Madurese, which has formed a distinctive dialect known as Suroboyoan. The Suroboyoan dialect is actively promoted in local media, such as in local TV shows, radio, newspapers, and traditional dramas called &quot;Ludruk&quot;. The speakers of Suroboyoan dialect are well known for being proud of their distinctive dialect and consistently maintain it wherever they go.

=== Religion ===
Although around 85% of citizens in Surabaya adhere to Sunni Islam, other major religions include Christianity (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Orthodox), of whom the majority are Roman Catholics. The influence of Hinduism is strong in basic Surabayan culture, but only a minority of the population adheres to Hinduism, mostly among the ethnic Indian and Balinese minorities. Also, a significant population of Chinese Indonesians adhere to Buddhism and Confucianism, and a small community of Dutch Jews follow Judaism.

The city had an influential role as a major Islamic center in Java during the Wali Sanga era. The prominent and honored Islamic figure in Surabaya was Sunan Ampel (Raden Rahmat). His tomb is a sacred religious site in the city and is visited by Surabayans and pilgrims from different parts of Indonesia. The largest Muslim organisation in Indonesia, Nahdlatul Ulama, was established in Surabaya on 26 January 1926. Al-Akbar Mosque is the largest mosque in the city and one of the largest mosque in the world.

Christianity as a whole is mainly practised by Chinese Indonesians, as well as native Javanese, Bataks, and Ambonese who attend either a Roman Catholic or Protestant church. A minority of Javanese worship at the Gereja Kejawen, a syncretic religious movement that combines Christianity with the traditional religion of Java. Around 15 churches are in Surabaya; they vary in size. The Church of the Birth of Our Lady, also known as Gereja Kepanjen, was built in 1815 as the first church in Surabaya and is one of the oldest churches in Indonesia. Graha Bethany Nginden, is a megachurch which is one of the largest churches in Surabaya, Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The main Orthodox Church in Indonesia, St Nikolas Church, is also based in Surabaya. The Orthodox Christian Center Surabaya was opened on 15 October 2008.

Once the major religion in Surabaya and across the archipelago during the Janggala and Majapahit era, Hinduism played a major role in traditional Surabayan culture. Small Hindu communities still exist, most commonly in the eastern sections of the city. Surabaya was the location of the only synagogue in Java, but it rarely obtained a &quot;minyan&quot; (quorum). The synagogue was demolished in 2013 by unidentified people while the city council was in the process of registering it as a heritage site. In the years before its demolition, it had been the site of many anti-Israel protests. A Jewish cemetery exists in the city.

== Economy ==
Since the early 1900s, Surabaya has been one of the most important and busiest trading city ports in Asia. Principal exports from the port include sugar, tobacco, and coffee. Its rich history as a trading port has led to a strong financial infrastructure with modern economic institutions such as banks, insurance, and sound export-import companies. The economy is influenced by the recent growth in international industries and the completion of the Suramadu Bridge. The high potential and economic activities make the city an attractive destination to foreign investors.
The city is home to a large shipyard and numerous specialized naval schools. The Bank of Indonesia has also made plans for Surabaya to be the Islamic financial center of Indonesia.
As the provincial capital, Surabaya has numerous offices and business centers; as a metropolitan city, it became the center of economic, financial, and business activities in East Java and beyond. Also, Surabaya is the second-largest port city in Indonesia after Jakarta. As a trading center, Surabaya is not only a trade center for East Java, but also facilitates areas in Central Java, Kalimantan, and Eastern Indonesia. Surabaya&#x27;s strategic location in almost in the center of Indonesia and just south of Asia makes it one of the critical hubs for trading activities in Southeast Asia. It is currently in the process of building high-rise skyscrapers, including apartments, condominiums, and hotels to attract foreign capital. Surabaya and the surrounding area are undergoing the most rapidly growing and the most advanced economic development in Indonesia. The city is also one of the most essential cities in supporting Indonesia&#x27;s economy.

Most of the population is engaged in services, industry, and trade. Surabaya is a fast-growing trading center.

== Infrastructure ==

Until 2009, the growth of road length in Surabaya was only about 0.01% per year. This is not comparable to the growth of motorized vehicles which reaches around 7–8% annually. Congestion that occurred in Surabaya was triggered by the growth of vehicles that were not proportional to the capacity of the road. To reduce congestion, the city government has built many new roads, including the construction of a frontage road on Ahmad Yani road which is divided into east and west sides of 4 km each. This slow lane is planned to penetrate to the Buduran area, Sidoarjo Regency. In addition, the municipal government has completed the construction of the Middle East Ring Road (MERR) or Dr. Ir. H. Soekarno Boulevard, which is a 10.98 km ring road between the Kenjeran area to Tambak Sumur that connects the Suramadu Bridge and Juanda International Airport; and the 780-meter Suroboyo Bridge that crosses the sea which is now a tourist icon in the Kenjeran Beach area. The city government has also intensified the construction of massive box culverts in Surabaya to reduce congestion while anticipating flooding.
The municipal government is also working on the construction of two new ring roads, namely the 17 km Outer East Ring Road (OERR) between the Kenjeran area to Gunung Anyar which also connects the Suramadu Bridge and Juanda International Airport and the West Outer Ring Road ( West Outer Ring Road (WORR) along 26.1 km between the Romokalisari area to Lakarsantri which connects the southern area of Surabaya with Teluk Lamong Harbor Terminal. In addition to building the ring road, the city government has completed the construction of an underpass on Jalan Mayjen Sungkono, and plans to build an underpass and flyover on Jalan Ahmad Yani. The problem of flooding is also a serious threat to city residents. To anticipate the occurrence of flooding, the city government has built many pump houses spread across several points in Surabaya, including Mulyorejo and Jemursari. In addition to pump houses, the city government has also built many parks that are used as sources of water absorption as well as areas for residents to interact, as well as carry out intensive cleaning and maintenance of major rivers in Surabaya. To accommodate the needs of pedestrians and tourists, the Surabaya city government has built bicycle lanes on many protocol roads in Surabaya, as well as pedestrian paths that are almost evenly distributed throughout the Surabaya area.

The Suramadu Bridge (abbreviated of Surabaya-Madura) connects Surabaya and Madura Island over the Madura Strait. A highway has been proposed to be built from the Suramadu Bridge to Madura International Seaport-City in Pernajuh village, Kocah district, Bangkalan, Madura at the cost of approximately Rp. 60 billion (US$7 billion). This container port was built to ease the burden on Surabaya&#x27;s overloaded Tanjung Perak Port.

=== Sports ===

Surabaya is a barometer and center of association football development in Indonesia. The city has many association football clubs founded in Surabaya, but Gelora Bung Tomo Stadium is the home of Persebaya Surabaya. The first club was founded by the youth of &quot;Hoogere Burger School&quot; (HBS) John Edgar with the Victoria club in 1895. Others included Scoren Is Ons Doel (SIOD), Sparta, Rapiditas and Thot Heil Onzer Ribben (THOR). These are the pioneers of association football in Surabaya. The clubs then took management under Oost Java Voetbalbond (OJVB) in 1907. Two years later, the OJVB changed to &quot;Soerabajasche Voetbalbond&quot; (SVB). Starting in 1914, SVB was based on the Nederlandsch Indische Voetbalbond (NIVB), created by Dutch football federation (KNVB). The Surabaya Chinese and native people also founded their association football clubs by ethnicity. Oei Kwie Liem founded Hoa Soerabaja in 1914, while the Bumiputera through R Pamoedji and Paidjo founded the &quot;Soerabajasche Indonesische Voetbalbond&quot; (SIVB) on 18 June 1927 (now Persebaya), which three years later co-founded the PSSI.

In 1950, the working-class people and office men founded &quot;Soerabajasche Kantoor Voetbalbond&quot; (SKVB). The association football sector in Indonesia and specifically Surabaya became more developed, and the football association of Indonesia founded a semi-professional competition in 1979, which was named the Main Football League (Galatama). A new team emerged from Surabaya, NIAC Partners and the Salim Group Association. Besides Galatama, PSSI also formed a women&#x27;s soccer competition called the Women&#x27;s Football League (Galanita). Surabaya also has a women&#x27;s soccer team, which was founded in 1977 and named Puteri Puspita. Clubs from Surabaya have also gained attention from the rest of the world. Persebaya has competed against European teams including Lokomotiv Moscow, Sturm Graz, Grasshoppers, Salzburg, Stade de Reims, Ajax Amsterdam, PSV Eindhoven, AC Milan, and lastly, Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Aside from European teams, there are several national teams outside the country competing against Persebaya, including Yugoslavia Olympics, Malaysia, Mozambique, Uruguay, Thailand, South Korea, and the Japanese national team.

NIAC Mitra also competed against Arsenal and won the Aga Khan Gold Cup competition in 1979 in Bangladesh. The achievements of NIAC Mitra in the Galatama competition included three championships in 1980–1982, 1982–1983, and 1987–1988, and finishing as runners-up in 1988–89. However, NIAC Partners officially dissolved and withdrew from the Galatama competition held by PSSI in 1990 because they considered the policies issued by PSSI irrelevant. After being disbanded, the demands of the Surabaya community to revive the NIAC Partners were channelled when the Jawa Pos party weighed in and changed the name of the NIAC Partner to the Surabaya Partner. When the Union competition was merged with Galatama in 1994, the new Persebaya was able to win in 1997 and 2004. Persebaya was listed as the first team capable of winning the Indonesian League twice. Mitra Surabaya was only able to exist until the 1998–1999 season and it was re-established again in another city, Tenggarong and has not used the name of Surabaya again.
Recently, only Persebaya has stable fans and achievements. Persebaya has won the Indonesian Premier Division three times–twice when the division was the first tier and once as the second tier. Fans refer to themselves as Bonek, an abbreviation for &quot;Bondo Nekat&quot; (which translates as &quot;equipped by bravery&quot;). The city is the home of CLS Knights Indonesia, a basketball club which participated in IBL (Indonesia basketball league) &amp; Asean Basketball League.

<text>James Price Johnson (February 1, 1894 – November 17, 1955) was an American pianist and composer. A pioneer of stride piano, he was one of the most important pianists in the early era of recording, and like Jelly Roll Morton, one of the key figures in the evolution of ragtime into what was eventually called jazz. Johnson was a major influence on Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, Thelonious Monk, and Fats Waller, who was his student.

Johnson composed many hit songs, including the unofficial anthem of the Roaring Twenties, &quot;The Charleston&quot;, and he remained the acknowledged king of New York jazz pianists through most of the 1930s. Johnson&#x27;s artistry, influence on early popular music, and contributions to musical theatre are often overlooked, and as such, he has been referred to by musicologist David Schiff as &quot;The Invisible Pianist.&quot;

==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey on February 1, 1894. The proximity to New York City meant that the full cosmopolitan spectrum of the city&#x27;s musical experience, from bars, to cabarets, to the symphony, were at the young Johnson&#x27;s disposal. Johnson&#x27;s father, William H. Johnson, was a store helper and mechanic while his mother, Josephine Harrison, was a maid. Harrison was a part of the choir at the Methodist Church and was also a self-taught pianist. Johnson later cited the popular African American songs and dances he heard at home and around the city as early influences on his musical taste. In 1908, Johnson&#x27;s family moved to the San Juan Hill (near where Lincoln Center stands today) section of New York City and subsequently moved again to uptown in 1911. With perfect pitch and excellent recall he was soon able to pick out the piano tunes that he had heard.

Johnson grew up listening to the ragtime of Scott Joplin and always retained links to the ragtime era, playing and recording Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, as well as the more modern (according to Johnson) and demanding &quot;Euphonic Sounds&quot;, both several times in the 1940s. Johnson, who gained his first job as a pianist in 1912, decided to pursue his musical career rather than return to school. From 1913 to 1916, Johnson spent time studying the European piano tradition with Bruto Giannini. Over the next four to five years, Johnson continued to develop his ragtime piano skills by studying other pianists and composing his own rags.

=== Early career: 1914—1929 ===
In 1914, while performing in Newark, New Jersey with singer Lillie Mae Wright, who became his wife three years later, Johnson met Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith. Smith and Johnson shared many of the same ideas regarding entertainers and their stage appearance. These beliefs and their complementary personalities led the two to become best friends. Starting in 1918, Johnson and Wright began touring together in the Smart Set Revue before settling back in New York in 1919.

Before 1920, Johnson had gained a reputation as a pianist on the East coast on a par with Eubie Blake and Luckey Roberts and made dozens of player piano roll recordings initially documenting his own ragtime compositions before recording for Aeolian, Perfection (the label of the Standard Music Roll Co., Orange, New Jersey), Artempo (label of Bennett &amp; White, Inc., Newark, New Jersey), Rythmodik, and QRS during the period from 1917 to 1927. During this period he met George Gershwin, who was also a young piano-roll artist at Aeolian.

As his piano style continued to evolve, his 1921 phonograph recordings of his own compositions, &quot;Harlem Strut&quot;, &quot;Keep Off the Grass&quot;, &quot;Carolina Shout&quot;, and &quot; Worried and Lonesome Blues&quot; were, along with Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s Gennett recordings of 1923, among the first jazz piano solos to be put on record. These technically challenging compositions would be learned by his contemporaries, and would serve as test pieces in solo competitions, in which the New York pianists would demonstrate their mastery of the keyboard, as well as the swing, harmonies, and improvisational skills which would further distinguish the great masters of the era.

The majority of his phonograph recordings of the 1920s and early 1930s were done for Black Swan (founded by Johnson&#x27;s friend W.C. Handy, where William Grant Still served in an A&amp;R capacity) and Columbia. In 1922, Johnson branched out and became the musical director for the revue &quot;Plantation Days&quot;. This revue took him to England for four months in 1923. During the summer of 1923, Johnson, along with the help of lyricist Cecil Mack, wrote the revue &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot;. This revue stayed on tour for more than five years as well as showing on Broadway.
=== Swing era: 1930—1939 ===
In the Depression era, Johnson&#x27;s career slowed down somewhat. As the swing era began to gain popularity within the African American communities, Johnson had a hard time adapting, and his music would ultimately become unpopular. The cushion of a modest but steady income from his royalties as a composer allowed him to devote significant time to the furtherance of his education, as well as the realization of his desire to compose &quot;serious&quot; orchestral music. Johnson began to write for musical revues, and composed many now-forgotten orchestral music pieces. Although by this time, he was an established composer, with a significant body of work, as well as a member of ASCAP, he was nonetheless unable to secure the financial support that he sought from either the Rosenwald Foundation or a Guggenheim Fellowship; he had received endorsement for each from Columbia Records executive and long-time admirer John Hammond. The Johnson archives include the letterhead of an organization called Friends of James P. Johnson, ostensibly founded at the time (presumably in the late 1930s) in order to promote his then-idling career. Names on the letter-head included Paul Robeson, Fats Waller, Walter White (President of the NAACP), the actress Mercedes Gilbert and Bessye Bearden, the mother of artist Romare Bearden. In the late 1930s, Johnson slowly started to re-emerge with the revival of interest in traditional jazz and began to record, with his own and other groups, at first for the H.R.S. label. Johnson&#x27;s appearances at the &quot;Spirituals to Swing&quot; concerts at Carnegie Hall in 1938 and 1939 were organized by John Hammond, for whom he recorded a substantial series of solo and band sides in 1939.

=== Later career: 1940—1951 ===
Johnson suffered a stroke (likely a transient ischemic attack or mini-stroke) in August 1940. When Johnson returned to action, in 1942, he began a heavy schedule of performing, composing, and recording, leading several small live and groups, now often with racially integrated bands led by musicians such as Eddie Condon, Yank Lawson, Sidney de Paris, Sidney Bechet, Rod Cless, and Edmond Hall. In 1944, Johnson and Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith participated in stride piano contests in Greenwich Village from August to December. He recorded for jazz labels including Asch, Black &amp; White, Blue Note, Commodore, Circle, and Decca. In 1945, Johnson performed with Louis Armstrong and heard his works at Carnegie Hall and Town Hall in New York City. He was a regular guest star and featured soloist on Rudi Blesh&#x27;s &quot;This is Jazz&quot; broadcasts, as well as at Eddie Condon&#x27;s Town Hall concerts. As such, he was regarded as something as a distinguished pioneer of the idiom, and was often referred to as &quot;The Dean of Jazz Pianists&quot;. Never satisfied with the state of his craft, he continued his musical education, begun in the 1930s, studying with Maury Deutsch, who could also count Django Reinhardt and Charlie Parker among his pupils.

In the late 1940s, Johnson had a variety of jobs, including jam sessions at Stuyvesant Casino and Central Plaza, as well as becoming a regular on Rudi Blesh&#x27;s radio show. In 1949 as an 18-year-old, actor and band leader Conrad Janis put together a band of musicians, consisting of James P. Johnson (piano), Henry Goodwin (trumpet), Edmond Hall (clarinet), Pops Foster (bass) and Baby Dodds (drums), with Janis on trombone. Johnson permanently retired from performing after suffering a severe, paralyzing stroke in 1951. Johnson survived financially on his songwriting royalties while he was paralyzed. He died four years later in Jamaica, New York and is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Maspeth, Queens. Perfunctory obituaries appeared in even &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The pithiest and most angry remembrance of Johnson was written by John Hammond and appeared in &quot;DownBeat&quot; under the title &quot;Talents of James P. Johnson Went Unappreciated&quot;.

== Compositions ==
Johnson composed many hit tunes in his work for the musical theatre, including &quot;Charleston&quot;. It debuted in his Broadway show &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot; in 1923, although by some accounts Johnson had written it years earlier. It became one of the most popular songs of the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;. He also wrote &quot;If I Could Be With You (One Hour Tonight)&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Modernistic&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry, Baby&quot;, &quot;Keep off the Grass&quot;, &quot;Old Fashioned Love&quot;, &quot;A Porter&#x27;s Love Song to a Chambermaid&quot;, &quot;Carolina Shout&quot;, and &quot;Snowy Morning Blues&quot;. He wrote waltzes, ballet, symphonic pieces and light opera; many of these extended works exist in manuscript form in various stages of completeness in the collection of Johnson&#x27;s papers housed at the Institute of Jazz Studies, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey. Johnson&#x27;s success as a popular composer qualified him as a member of ASCAP in 1926.

Premiered in 1928, Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Yamekraw, a Negro Rhapsody&quot;, was named after a black community in Savannah, Georgia. William Grant Still was orchestrator and Fats Waller the pianist as Johnson was contractually obliged to conduct his and Waller&#x27;s hit Broadway show &quot;Keep Shufflin&quot;. &quot;Harlem Symphony&quot;, composed during the 1930s, was performed at Carnegie Hall in 1945 with Johnson at the piano and Joseph Cherniavsky as conductor. He collaborated with Langston Hughes on the one-act opera, &quot;De Organizer&quot;. A fuller list of Johnson&#x27;s film scores appears below.

===Pianist===

Along with Fats Waller and Willie &#x27;The Lion&#x27; Smith (&#x27;The Big Three&#x27;), and Luckey Roberts, Johnson embodies the Harlem Stride piano style, an evolution of East Coast ragtime infused with elements of the blues. His &quot;Carolina Shout&quot; was a standard test piece and rite of passage for every contemporary pianist: Duke Ellington learned it note for note from the 1921 QRS Johnson piano roll. Johnson taught Fats Waller and got him his first piano roll and recording assignments.

Harlem Stride is distinguished from ragtime by several essential characteristics: ragtime introduced sustained syncopation into piano music, but stride pianists built a more freely swinging rhythm into their performances, with a certain degree of anticipation of the left (bass) hand by the right (melody) hand, a form of tension and release in the patterns played by the right hand, interpolated within the beat generated by the left. Stride more frequently incorporates elements of the blues, as well as harmonies more complex than usually found in the works of classic ragtime composers. Lastly, while ragtime was for the most part a composed music, based on European light classics such as marches, pianists such as Waller and Johnson introduced their own rhythmic, harmonic and melodic figures into their performances and, occasionally, spontaneous improvisation. As the second generation stride pianist Dick Wellstood observed, in liner notes for recordings by the stride pianist Donald Lambert, most of the stride pianists of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were not particularly good improvisers. Rather, they would play their own, very well worked out, and often rehearsed variations on popular songs of the day, with very little change from one performance to another. It was in this respect that Johnson distinguished himself from his colleagues, in that (in his own words), he &quot;could think of a trick a minute&quot;. Comparison of many of Johnson&#x27;s recordings of a given tune over the years demonstrates variation from one performance to another, characterized by respect for the melody, and reliance upon a worked out set of melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic devices, such as repeated chords, serial thirds (hence his admiration for Bach), and interpolated scales, on which the improvisations were based. This same set of variations might then appear in the performance of another tune.

==Legacy==
Johnson may be thought of as both the last major pianist of the classic ragtime era and the first major jazz pianist. As such, he is considered an indispensable bridge between ragtime and jazz. Johnson&#x27;s musical legacy is also present in the body of work of his pupil, Thomas &quot;Fats&quot; Waller, as well as scores of other pianists who were influenced by him, including Art Tatum, Donald Lambert, Louis Mazetier, Pat Flowers, Cliff Jackson, Hank Duncan, Claude Hopkins, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Don Ewell, Johnny Guarnieri, Dick Hyman, Dick Wellstood, Ralph Sutton, Joe Turner, Neville Dickie, Mike Lipskin, and Butch Thompson.

Johnson was a pioneer, and one of the main originators of what is known today as the (Harlem) stride style of jazz piano playing. &quot;Stride piano has often been described as an orchestral style and indeed, in contrast to boogie-woogie blues piano playing, it requires a fabulous conceptual independence, the left hand differentiating bass and mid-range lines while the right supplies melodic issues.&quot; Johnson honed his craft, playing night after night, catering to the egos and idiosyncrasies of the many singers he encountered, which necessitated being able to play a song in any key. He developed into a sensitive and facile accompanist, the favorite accompanist of Ethel Waters and Bessie Smith. Waters wrote in her autobiography that working with musicians such as, and most especially, Johnson &quot;made you want to sing until your tonsils fell out&quot;.

==Honors and recognitions==
Two Romare Bearden paintings bear the name of Johnson compositions: &quot;Carolina Shout&quot;, and &quot;Snow(y) Morning&quot;.

On September 16, 1995, the U.S. Post Office issued a James P. Johnson 32-cent commemorative postage stamp.

Johnson is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Maspeth, Queens County, New York. Unmarked since his death in 1955, his grave was re-consecrated in 2009 with a headstone paid for with funds raised by an event arranged by the James P. Johnson Foundation, Spike Wilner and Dr. Scott Brown.

In 2020, Johnson&#x27;s song &quot;Carolina Shout&quot; was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Film scores==
Johnson&#x27;s compositions as film scores were used in a number of movies, which were compiled from previously written musical compositions. A partial list includes:

Multiple CDs of Johnson&#x27;s recordings have been released. &quot;Father of the Stride Piano&quot;, on CBS / Sony, is a re-issue of the 1962 Columbia Lp. Both collects some of Johnson&#x27;s best recordings for the Columbia label between 1921 and 1939. It includes &quot;&quot;Carolina Shout&quot;, &quot;Worried and Lonesome Blues&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Hungry Blues&quot; (from &quot;De Organizer&quot;) featuring unissued band sides and solos from the 1930s as well as several solos from the 1920s. By far, the most complete CD collections of his work, including alternate takes, has been produced by Michael Cuscuna and his associates at Mosaic Records with the box &quot;Classic James P. Johnson Sessions, 1921-1944&quot;, that includes all of Johnson&#x27;s piano solos, band sides, and blues accompaniments, done during this period, for the major commercial labels, exclusive of Decca/Brunswick, and RCA Victor. Even more complete, but without the alternate takes the french Chronological on Classics series. The eight discs devoted to Johnson cover the period 1921-1947. James P. is also featured prominently in the Mosaic re-issues of the Commodore (under Max Kaminsky&#x27;s name) and the HRS labels (Pee Wee Russells&#x27;s Rhythm Makers). The Decca CD, &quot;Snowy Morning Blues&quot;, contains 20 sides recorded for the Brunswick and Decca labels, between 1930 and 1944 with an eight-tune Fats Waller Memorial set, and two solos, &quot;Jingles&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to be Modernistic&quot;, which demonstrate Johnson&#x27;s hard swinging stride style.

Johnson&#x27;s complete Blue Note recordings (solos, band sides in groups led by himself as well as Edmond Hall and Sidney DeParis) were issued in a collection by Mosaic Records and, later, in a 2CD selection in 1998 entitled &quot;The Blue Note Jazzmen&quot;. Johnson&#x27;s recordings was compiled in the Giants of Jazz series by Time-Life Music. This three-LP collection contains 40 sides recorded from 1921 to 1945, and is supplemented with extensive liner notes, including a biographical essay by Frank Kappler, and criticism of the musical selections by Dick Wellstood, and the musicologist, Willa Rouder. Many of Johnson&#x27;s piano rolls, approximately 60, recorded between 1917 and 1927, have been issued on CD by the Biograph label.

A book of musical transcriptions of Johnson&#x27;s piano roll performances of his own compositions has been prepared by Dr. Robert Pinsker, to be published through the auspices of the James P. Johnson Foundation.
In the internet era, nearly all of Johnson&#x27;s recordings are now available on a YouTube channel, compiled by Mark Borowsky, M.D., titled, &quot; James P. Johnson: The Quiet Man Who Made the 20s Roar After Dr. Scott Brown &quot; . It is a companion site to the forthcoming definitive biography of James P, written by Dr. Brown, and scheduled for publication in 2025.

<text>Stride jazz piano, often shortened to stride, is a jazz piano style that arose from ragtime players. Prominent stride pianists include James P. Johnson, Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith, Fats Waller, Luckey Roberts, and Mary Lou Williams.

== Technique ==
Stride employed left hand techniques from ragtime, wider use of the piano&#x27;s range, and quick tempos. Compositions were written but were also intended to be improvised.

The term &quot;stride&quot; comes from the idea of the pianist&#x27;s left hand leaping, or &quot;striding&quot;, across the piano. The left hand characteristically plays a four-beat pulse with a single bass note (or an octave, major seventh, minor seventh or major tenth interval) on the first and third beats, and a chord on the second and fourth beats. Occasionally this pattern is reversed by placing the chord on the downbeat and bass notes on the upbeat. Compared to the ragtime style popularized by Scott Joplin, stride players&#x27; left hands travel greater distances on the keyboard.

Stride piano is highly rhythmic because of the alternating bass note and chord action of the left hand. In the left hand, the pianist usually plays a single bass note, or a bass octave or tenth, followed by a chord triad toward the center of the keyboard, while the right hand plays syncopated melody lines with harmonic and riff embellishments and fill patterns. Proper playing of stride jazz involves a subtle rhythmic tension between the left hand which is close to the established tempo, and the right hand, which is often slightly anticipatory.

Unlike ragtime pianists, stride pianists were not concerned with ragtime form and played pop songs of the day in the stride style. Ragtime was composed, but many stride pianists improvised. Some stride players didn&#x27;t read music. Stride used tension and release and dynamics. Stride can be played at all tempos, slow or fast depending on the underlying composition and treatment the pianist is performing. On occasion a stride jazz pianist might have the left hand shift into double time.

Some pianists have transcribed display pieces note for note from early recordings. However, this practice only illustrates a small part of stride jazz musical adventures.

James P. Johnson (1894–1955), known as the &quot;Father of Stride&quot;, created this style of jazz piano along with fellow pianists Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith (1893–1973), Thomas &quot;Fats&quot; Waller (1904–1943) and Luckey Roberts (1887–1968). One of Johnson&#x27;s contributions was to recast the &quot;straight&quot; feeling of ragtime with a more modern, swinging beat, sophisticated harmonies and dynamics. He discovered and employed the tenth or &quot;broken tenth&quot; interval. The pianist could not only substitute tenths for single bass notes but could also play broken (staggered) tenths up and down the keyboard

Stride pianist Art Tatum (1909–1956) (a fan of Fats Waller and Lee Sims, who was himself a fan of the European &quot;Impressionist&quot; pianists such as Claude Debussy and Erik Satie, and hosted a radio program Tatum enjoyed) introduced more complex harmonies into his playing, and, like Fats Waller, would start songs with legato explorations of chordal intricacies before launching into swing. Tatum was given a posthumous Grammy Award in 1974.

Stride pianists used devices such as arpeggios, black note slide-offs, varying rhythmic accents, and tension and release.

Stride pianists engaged in marathon cutting contests to show off their skills.

==Practitioners==

Other stride jazz pianists of the 20th century included Clarence Profit, Johnny Guarnieri, Mary Lou Williams, Cliff Jackson, Hank Duncan, Pat Flowers, Don Ewell, Joe Turner, Claude Hopkins, Ralph Sutton, Dick Wellstood, Dick Hyman, and Judy Carmichael. Others such as Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Jaki Byard developed the style for their own ends.

Other prominent stride jazz pianists are Butch Thompson, Mike Lipskin, Bernd Lhotzky, Louis Mazetier, Rossano Sportiello and Stephanie Trick, who perform internationally. Japanese pianist Hiromi Uehara&#x27;s solo concerts often include stride-based pieces.

Mrs Mills used a stride technique for her many sing-along and party tunes.

<text>Barney &amp; Friends is an American children&#x27;s television series targeted at children aged two to five, created by Sheryl Leach. The series first aired on PBS on April 6, 1992, and features Barney, a purple anthropomorphic &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; who conveys educational messages through songs and small dance routines with a friendly, huggable and optimistic attitude. The series ended on November 2, 2010, although new videos were still released on various dates after the last episode aired. Reruns aired on Sprout from 2005 to 2015, and from December 17, 2018 to January 25, 2020 on Sprout&#x27;s successor network, Universal Kids. On October 6, 2015, the series was initially renewed for revival with a new season to premiere in 2017, but that never came to fruition. A CGI-animated series aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Cartoonito on October 18, 2024, and streamed on Max on October 14, 2024.

While popular with its intended audience, &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; drew severe negative reaction from the older set, who mocked the title character in popular culture through song parodies and comedy routines such as being beaten up by NBA star Charles Barkley on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode.

==History and development==
&quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; was created by Sheryl Leach of Dallas, Texas. She came up with the idea of a children&#x27;s program after noticing that her son outgrew &quot;Wee Sing Together&quot;, and then recognizing that there were no videos to appeal to her son. Leach then brought together a team who created a series of home videos, &quot;Barney &amp; the Backyard Gang&quot;, initially released in 1988. The first three videos starred actress Sandy Duncan.

One day in 1991, the daughter of Connecticut Public Television executive Larry Rifkin rented one of the videos and was &quot;mesmerized&quot; by it. Rifkin thought the concept could be developed for PBS. Rifkin thought Barney had appeal because he was less neurotic than Big Bird. He pitched it to CPTV president Jerry Franklin, whose preschool son also fell in love with it. Franklin and Rifkin pitched the idea to all of their colleagues with preschoolers, and they all agreed that kids would love a &quot;Barney&quot; show. Franklin and Rifkin convinced Leach to let CPTV revamp the concept for television. The show debuted as &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; in 1992. The series was produced by CPTV and Lyrick Studios (later bought by HIT Entertainment).

Although the show was a runaway hit, PBS initially opted not to provide funding beyond the initial 30-episode run. When Rifkin and other CPTV executives learned this, they wrote letters to their fellow PBS member stations urging them to get PBS to reconsider. The Lyons Group, meanwhile, sent out notices through the Barney Fan Club, telling parents to write letters and make phone calls to their local PBS stations to show their support for &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;. By the time of the yearly member stations&#x27; meeting, station executives across the country were up in arms over the prospect of one of their most popular shows being canceled. Faced with an atmosphere that Rifkin later described as &quot;like an insurrection&quot;, PBS ultimately relented.

For several years, the show was taped at the Color Dynamics Studios facility at Greenville Avenue &amp; Bethany Drive in Allen, Texas, after which it moved to The Studios at Las Colinas in Irving, Texas, and then Carrollton, a suburb of Dallas. The TV series was produced by WNET from 2006 to 2010.

==Episode format==
===Opening sequence===
The episodes open with the theme song (over clips from various episodes) and the title card before it dissolves into the school (in seasons 1–6) or park (in seasons 7–14). The children are seen doing an activity, occasionally relating to the episode&#x27;s topic. They eventually cause Barney to come to life from a plush doll, transforming into the &quot;real&quot; Barney, how he appears in the children&#x27;s imaginations. Beginning in season 9, Barney&#x27;s transformation occurs in a clip at the end of the theme song.

===Main sequence===
Here, the main plot of the episode takes place. Barney and the children learn about the main topic of the episode, with Baby Bop, BJ, or Riff appearing during the episode and numerous songs themed relating to the subject featured in the series. The roles of Baby Bop, BJ, and Riff have grown larger in later seasons and later episodes venture outside of the school to other places within the neighborhood, and in season 13, to other countries around the world.

===Closing sequence===
Barney concludes with the song &quot;I Love You&quot;, then the children say goodbye to him and leave. Barney dissolves back into his original stuffed form and winks to the audience. The first story in season 10–11 episodes end with the characters singing &quot;A Friend Like You&quot; instead and Barney remaining alive.

The sequence transitions to &quot;Barney Says&quot; (in seasons 1–8 and 12 only) where Barney, who is off-screen, narrates what he and his friends had done that day, along with still snapshots from the episode. Barney ends the segment in seasons 1 and 2 by saying &quot;I love you!&quot; before the credits roll. In seasons 3–8 and 12, the segment ends with a pre-recorded clip of Barney saying, &quot;And remember, I love you!&quot; and waving goodbye.

==Characters and cast==
===Dinosaurs===
* (voiced by Bob West 1992–2000, and Dean Wendt 2001–2010; people who wore the Barney suit included David Joyner 1991-2001 and Carey Stinson): The main character is a purple and green &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; in stuffed animal likeness, who comes to life through a child&#x27;s imagination. His theme song is &quot;Barney is a Dinosaur&quot;, whose tune is based on &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;. Barney often quotes things as being &quot;Super dee-duper&quot;. Episodes frequently end with the song &quot;I Love You&quot;, sung to the tune of &quot;This Old Man&quot;. Despite being a carnivorous type dinosaur, Barney does not have a carnivore&#x27;s fearsome teeth. He likes many different foods such as fruits and vegetables, but his main favorite is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a glass of milk.
* (voiced by Julie Johnson): A green &quot;Triceratops&quot;, who was originally two years old, but turned three in &quot;Look at Me, I&#x27;m 3!&quot;. Baby Bop has been on the show since her debut in &quot;Barney in Concert&quot; on July 29, 1991. She wears a pink bow and pink ballet slippers and carries a yellow security blanket. She sings the song &quot;My Yellow Blankey&quot; to show how much her security blanket means to her. She likes to eat macaroni and cheese and pizza. She is the younger sister of BJ.
* (voiced by Patty Wirtz): A seven-year-old yellow &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, BJ has been on the show since September 27, 1993. He is the older brother of Baby Bop, whom he frequently calls &quot;Sissy&quot; and occasionally calls by her name. He sings &quot;BJ&#x27;s Song&quot; about himself. He wears a red baseball cap and red sneakers. He lost his hat in the episode &quot;Hats Off to BJ!&quot;. Pickles are his favorite food and he has tried them in various ways, such as on pizza.
* (voiced by Michaela Dietz): An orange six-year-old &quot;Hadrosaur&quot;, who is Baby Bop and BJ&#x27;s cousin, Riff has been on the show since September 18, 2006. He wears green sneakers. His theme music is &quot;I Hear Music Everywhere&quot;. Riff loves music and it is in almost everything he does. In the episode &quot;Barney: Let&#x27;s Go to the Firehouse&quot;, it was revealed that Riff also likes to invent things; he created a four-sound smoke detector (the first three were different alarm sounds and the final one his voice). He is shown to have an interest in marching bands and parades.

===Adults and children===
The adults and children on the show often appear as teachers, storytellers, or other characters.

====Multiple appearances====
===Puppets===
A lot of puppets appeared in many seasons. The most notable puppets were:
* Scooter McNutty, a brown squirrel (seasons: 4–6, 1997–2000) performed and voiced by Todd Duffey
* Miss Etta Kette, a purple bird (seasons: 4–6, 1997–2000) performed and voiced by Brice Armstrong; Armstrong also voices Beauregard the Cat in the video &quot;It&#x27;s Time for Counting&quot;.
* Booker T. Bookworm, an orange worm with interests in books (season 5: 1998–1999) performed and voiced by Earl Fisher

===Children===
Throughout the series&#x27; run, over 100 children have appeared in the series, with most of them from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Only a small portion of these actors have made notable appearances in media since their roles, including:
* Peyton Alex Smith: played Jamal in Season 10
* Danielle Vega: played Kim in seasons 4 to 6
* Demi Lovato: played Angela in seasons 7 to 8
* Selena Gomez: played Gianna in seasons 7 to 8
* Debby Ryan: played Debby in season 10
* Madison Pettis: played Bridget in season 10
* Jaren Lewison: played Joshua in seasons 12 to 13

==Episodes==

==Airings==
Other than the United States, the series has aired in Canada, Mexico and Latin America, France, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan (on English-based DVDs under the name &quot; and on television as simply &quot;), the Philippines, Turkey, Australia, and New Zealand, among others. Australian based company and distributor Southern Star handled non-US rights to the series from the mid-&#x27;90s until 2001 when HIT revoked the deal after acquiring Lyrick.

Two known co-productions of &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; have been produced outside of the US. The Israeli co-production &quot;Hachaverim shel Barney&quot; (The Friends of Barney) produced from 1997 to 1999 in Tel Aviv, Israel, was the first of these. Rather than dubbing the original American episodes in seasons 1 to 3, the episodes were adapted with a unique set and exclusive child actors. The second co-production was broadcast in South Korea from 2001 to 2003 on KBS (under the name &quot;바니와 친구들&quot; (&quot;Baniwa Chingudeul&quot; (Barney and Friends))). This one, however, adapted the first six seasons (including the first three that the Israel co-production did).

==Music==
The show&#x27;s theme song was &quot;I Love You&quot;, with new lyrics sung to the melody of the public domain song &quot;This Old Man&quot;. The new lyrics were written for the melody in 1982 by Indiana homemaker Lee Bernstein for a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;Piggyback Songs&quot; (1983), and these lyrics were adapted by Barney producers in the early 1990s, without knowing the words had been written by Bernstein. Upon discovering the usage of her lyrics, Bernstein retained lawyer Daniel Glavin who negotiated with Barney producers for writing credit and royalties, reported as a one-time payment of $7,500 plus $2,000 &quot;every several years.&quot; In 1994 when Barney-related licensing was bringing in an estimated $50 million for the Lyons Group, Bernstein sought a higher royalty payment in court.

A majority of the albums of &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; feature Bob West as the voice of Barney; however, the recent album &quot;The Land of Make-Believe&quot; has Dean Wendt&#x27;s voice.

The song &quot;I Love You&quot; was among those used by interrogators at Guantanamo Bay detention camp to coerce detainees.

==Awards and nominations==
==Reception and legacy==

Several people have concluded that episodes contain a great deal of age-appropriate educational material, including Yale University researchers Dorothy and Jerome Singer, who called the program a &quot;model of what preschool television should be&quot;. Others have criticized the show for a lack of educational value, as well as being repetitive.

The show is often cited as a contributing factor to the perceived sense of entitlement seen in millennials, who grew up watching the show. One specific criticism is:
In 1992, the &quot;Barney&quot; franchise generated in retail sales.

The creator and performer of the San Diego Chicken mascot, Ted Giannoulas, called Barney a &quot;ubiquitous and insipid creature&quot; in a 1999 court case.

&quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; ranked No. 50 on &quot;TV Guide&quot; 2002 list of the 50 worst TV shows of all time.

In a 1993 newspaper article, Jerry Franklin, the head of Connecticut Public Television, which co-produced &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; at the time, was quoted thus:
Howard Blumenthal, producer of &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, said &quot;Even the most knowledgeable people … can&#x27;t really understand why that [Barney] phenomenon happened and another didn&#x27;t&quot;.

<doc id="212651" wikidata="Q2364941" url="?curid=212651" title="Witchcraft Acts">
<text>The Witchcraft Acts were a historical succession of governing laws in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and the British colonies on penalties for the practice, or—in later years—rather for pretending to practice witchcraft.

==Witchcraft Act 1541==
Religious tensions in England during the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in the introduction of serious penalties for witchcraft. Henry VIII&#x27;s Witchcraft Act 1541 (33 Hen. 8. c. 8) was the first to define witchcraft as a felony, a crime punishable by death and the forfeiture of goods and chattels. It was forbidden to:
The Act also removed the benefit of clergy, a legal device that exempted the accused from the jurisdiction of the King&#x27;s courts, from those convicted of witchcraft. This statute was repealed by Henry&#x27;s son, Edward VI, in 1547.

==Witchcraft Act 1562==
&quot;An &quot;1562&quot; Act Against Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts&quot; (5 Eliz. 1. c. 16) was passed early in the reign of Elizabeth I. It was in some respects more merciful towards those found guilty of witchcraft than its predecessor, demanding the death penalty only where harm had been caused; lesser offences were punishable by a term of imprisonment. The Act provided that anyone who should &quot;use, practise, or exercise any Witchcraft, Enchantment, Charm, or Sorcery, whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroyed&quot;, was guilty of a felony without benefit of clergy, and was to be put to death.

Indictments for homicide caused by witchcraft begin to appear in the historical record in the period following the passage of the 1563 Act. Out of the 1,158 homicide victims identified in the surviving records, 228 or 20.6% were suspected of being killed by witchcraft. By comparison, poison was suspected in only 31 of the cases. Out of the 157 people accused of killing with witchcraft, roughly half were acquitted. Only nine of the accused were men.

==Scottish Witchcraft Act 1563==

Under the Scottish Witchcraft Act 1563, enacted effective 4 June 1563, both the practice of witchcraft and consulting with witches were capital offences. This Act remained on Scottish statute books until it was repealed as a result of a House of Lords amendment to the bill for the post-union Witchcraft Act 1735.

==Irish Witchcraft Act 1586==

The Irish act (28 Eliz. 1. c. 2 (I), &quot;An Act against Witchcraft and Sorcerie&quot;) was largely identical to the English Witchcraft Act 1562. The penalty for causing death by witchcraft was as a felony without benefit of clergy (that is, capital punishment), which was also the penalty for a second offence of causing injury or material loss by witchcraft; for a first such offence, the penalty was one year&#x27;s imprisonment including six hours in the pillory once per quarter. This was also the penalty for a first offence of using witchcraft to &quot;discover hidden treasure, ... or stolen goods, or to provoke unlawful love&quot;; for a second such offence, it was life imprisonment. 

The last prosecution under the 1586 act was the 1711 Islandmagee witch trial. Nobody is known for certain to have been executed under the act. Of those accused of causing death by witchcraft, William Sellor was convicted at the Islandmagee trial, but there is no surviving record of his sentence; Florence Newton died during her 1661 trial; Marion Fisher&#x27;s 1655 conviction was overturned by Sir James Barry; and the strangling of a suspected witch in Antrim in 1698 was a lynching.

The 1586 act was repealed in 1821.

==Witchcraft Act 1603==
In 1603, the year James I&#x27;s accession to the English throne, the Elizabethan Act was broadened by Edward Coke and others to bring the penalty of death without benefit of clergy to any one who invoked evil spirits or communed with familiar spirits. The Act&#x27;s full title was &quot;An Act against Conjuration, Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits&quot;, (1 Jas. 1. c. 12). It was this statute that was enforced by Matthew Hopkins, the self-styled Witch-Finder General.

The Acts of Elizabeth and James changed the law of witchcraft by making it a felony, thus removing the accused from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to the courts of common law. This provided, at least, that the accused persons theoretically enjoyed the benefits of ordinary criminal procedure. Burning at the stake was eliminated except in cases of witchcraft that were also petty treason; most convicted were hanged instead. Any witch who had committed a minor witchcraft offence (punishable by one year in prison) and was accused and found guilty a second time was sentenced to death.

===Colonial use===

The Witchcraft Act 1603 was employed in the British American colonies, e.g., in the trial of Margaret Mattson, a woman accused of witchcraft in the Province of Pennsylvania. (She was acquitted by William Penn after trial in Philadelphia in 1683.)

==Scottish Witchcraft Act 1649==
Through the 1640s the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and the Commission of the Kirk lobbied for the enforcement and extension of the Witchcraft Act 1563, which had been the basis of previous witch trials. The Covenanter regime passed a series of acts to enforce godliness in 1649, which made capital offences of blasphemy, the worship of false gods and for beaters and cursers of their parents. They also passed a new witchcraft act that ratified the existing act of 1563 and extended it to deal with consulters of &quot;Devils and familiar spirits&quot;, who would now be punished with death.
==Witchcraft Act 1735==
The Witchcraft Act 1735 (9 Geo. 2 c. 5) marked a complete reversal in attitudes. Penalties for the practice of witchcraft as traditionally constituted, which by that time was considered by many influential figures to be an impossible crime, were replaced by penalties for the pretence of witchcraft. A person who claimed to have the power to call up spirits, or foretell the future, or cast spells, or discover the whereabouts of stolen goods, was to be punished as a vagrant and a con artist, subject to fines and imprisonment. The Act applied to the whole of Great Britain, repealing both the 1563 Scottish act and the 1604 English act.

The Witchcraft Act 1735 remained in force in Britain well into the 20th century, until its eventual repeal with the enactment of the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 (14 &amp; 15 Geo. 6. c. 33).

The Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 was repealed on 26 May 2008 by new Consumer Protection Regulations following an EU directive targeting unfair sales and marketing practices.

<text>Mike A. Caro (born May 16, 1944) is an American professional poker player, pioneer poker theorist, author of poker books, and casino executive.

==Author==
In 1978 Caro contributed 50 statistical tables to Doyle Brunson&#x27;s &quot;Super/System&quot; and wrote that book&#x27;s chapter on draw poker. He acts as a consultant to many casinos, providing odds, and he helped develop the Poker Probe, the first serious commercial PC program for analyzing poker situations. He is the founder of the Mike Caro University of Poker, Gaming and Life Strategy, the world&#x27;s first permanent poker school. He was an early predictor that real money online poker would work.

Caro is the author of a number of books about poker, including:
* &quot;The Body Language of Poker&quot;
* &quot;Bobby Baldwin&#x27;s Winning Poker Secrets&quot;
* &quot;Caro on Gambling&quot; – a collection of his columns published in &quot;Gambling Times&quot; magazine
* &quot;Mike Caro&#x27;s Book of Poker Tells&quot; – There is also a companion Video/DVD
* &quot;Caro&#x27;s Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker&quot;
* &quot;Gambling Times Official Rules of Poker&quot;
* &quot;Gambling Times Quiz Book&quot;
* &quot;Master Hold&#x27;em and Omaha Poker&quot;
* &quot;New Poker Games&quot; – Descriptions and rules of esoteric or newly invented poker variants
* &quot;Odds Quick and Simple&quot;
* &quot;Professional Hold&#x27;em Play by Play&quot;
* &quot;Poker at the Millennium by Mike Caro &amp; Mike Cappelletti&quot;
* &quot;Poker for Women: A Course in Destroying Male Opponents at Poker and Beyond&quot;
* &quot;Caro’s Most Profitable Hold’em Advice&quot;

He also has made multiple videos, some of which correspond to his books. He was formerly editor-in-chief of &quot;Poker Player&quot; magazine and senior editor of &quot;Gambling Times&quot; magazine.

Mike Caro coined the famous poker tells &quot;Weak means Strong&quot; and &quot;Strong means Weak&quot;, meaning that players will try to fool other players by acting the opposite way of the true strength of their poker hand.

In 1984 at the World Series of Poker he demonstrated Orac (Caro backwards), a poker-playing computer program that he had written. Orac was the world&#x27;s first serious attempt at an AI poker player, and most poker professionals were surprised at how well it played.

==Casino executive and poker player==
Caro was the chief strategist for the Bicycle Casino when it opened in 1984 and was named the general manager of the Huntington Park Casino in 1986. In 1992 he helped organize the &quot;World Poker Finals&quot; at Foxwoods Resort Casino, the first corporate sponsored tournament.

He is also a persistent advocate for four-color decks in card rooms and tournaments. , his total career live tournament winnings exceed $175,000.

His wife, Phyllis, is director of poker operations at Hollywood Park Casino.

The Green Hornet appeared in film serials in the 1940s, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; television series in the 1960s, (which costarred Bruce Lee in his first adult role), multiple comic book series from the 1940s onwards, and a film in 2011.

The franchise is owned by Green Hornet, Inc., which licenses the property across a wide variety of media that includes comics, films, TV shows, radio and books. As of the 2010s, the comic-book rights are licensed to Dynamite Entertainment.

==History==
Though various incarnations sometimes change details, in most versions the Green Hornet is the alter ego of Britt Reid (), the wealthy young publisher of the &quot;Daily Sentinel&quot; newspaper. By night, clad in a long green overcoat, gloves, green fedora hat and green mask, Reid fights crime as the mysterious vigilante known as &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. He is accompanied by his loyal and similarly masked partner and confidant, Kato, who drives their technologically advanced car, the &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. Though both the police and the general public believe the Hornet to be a wanted criminal, Reid uses that perception to help him infiltrate the underworld, leaving behind for the police the criminals and any incriminating evidence he has found.

In the original radio incarnation, Britt Reid is the son of Dan Reid Jr., the nephew of the Lone Ranger (whose first name is never given, contrary to later articles), making the Green Hornet the great-nephew of the Ranger. The relationship is alluded to at least once in the radio shows, when Dan Reid visits his son to question him on why Britt has never captured the Hornet. On learning the truth behind his son&#x27;s dual identity, Dan Reid recalls his days riding with his uncle, as the &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture plays briefly and softly in the background.

==Radio series==

The character debuted in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, an American radio program that premiered on January 31, 1936, on WXYZ, the same local Detroit station that originated its companion shows &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;Challenge of the Yukon&quot;. Beginning on April 12, 1938, the station supplied the series to the Mutual Broadcasting System radio network, and then to NBC Blue and its successors, the Blue Network and ABC, from November 16, 1939, through September 8, 1950. It returned from September 10 to December 5, 1952. It was sponsored by General Mills from January to August 1948, and by Orange Crush in its brief 1952 run.

==Film==
===Serials===
&quot;The Green Hornet&quot; was adapted into two movie serials, 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; and, in 1941, &quot;The Green Hornet Strikes Again!&quot; Disliking the treatment Republic gave &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; in two serials, George W. Trendle took his property to Universal Pictures, and was much happier with the results. The first serial, titled simply &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1940), stars Gordon Jones in the title role, albeit dubbed by original radio Hornet Al Hodge whenever the hero&#x27;s mask was in place, while &quot;The Green Hornet Strikes Again!&quot; (1941) stars Warren Hull. Keye Luke, who played the &quot;Number One Son&quot; in the Charlie Chan films, plays Kato in both. Also starring in both serials are Anne Nagel as Lenore Case, Britt Reid&#x27;s secretary, and Wade Boteler as Mike Axford, a reporter for the &quot;Daily Sentinel&quot;, the newspaper that Reid owns and publishes. Ford Beebe directed both serials, partnered by Ray Taylor on &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; and John Rawlins on &quot;The Green Hornet Strikes Again!&quot;, with George H. Plympton and Basil Dickey contributing to the screenplays for both serials. &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; runs for 13 chapters while &quot;The Green Hornet Strikes Again!&quot; has 15 installments, with the Hornet and Kato smashing a different racket in each chapter. In each serial, they are all linked to a single major crime syndicate which is itself put out of business in the finale, while the radio program had the various rackets completely independent of each other.

===&quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (2006)===

A 10-minute 2006 French short film titled &quot;Le frelon vert&quot; is based on the Green Hornet.

===&quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (2011)===

A film version of the character had been contemplated since the 1990s, with Universal Pictures and Miramax each attempting to develop a film. Sony Pictures announced plans for a feature film of the superhero in 2008. Eventually, Sony Pictures, through its subsidiary Columbia Pictures, released an action-comedy Green Hornet feature on January 14, 2011, starring Jay Chou and Seth Rogen, who co-wrote the script with &quot;Superbad&quot; co-writer Evan Goldberg. It was directed by Michel Gondry. Jay Chou co-starred as Kato. Also starring were Cameron Diaz as Lenore Case, Edward James Olmos as Mike Axford, David Harbour as Frank Scanlon, Christoph Waltz as the main villain Benjamin Chudnofsky, and Tom Wilkinson as James Reid.

===Reboot===
In 2016, Paramount Pictures and Chernin Entertainment acquired the rights to The Green Hornet and started preliminary work on developing a reboot with Gavin O&#x27;Connor as producer and director of the film and Sean O&#x27;Keefe as writer. In 2020, Amasia Entertainment gained the rights of the Green Hornet and officially teamed with Universal Pictures for the reboot titled &quot;Green Hornet and Kato&quot; with David Koepp writing the script. On June 23, 2022, Deadline reported that Leigh Whannell will direct the reboot.

==Television==

=== &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (1966–1967) ===

&quot;The Green Hornet&quot; is a television series shown on the ABC U.S. television network. It aired for the 1966–1967 television season and stars Van Williams as both the Green Hornet and Britt Reid, and Bruce Lee as Kato. With his insistence on using his martial arts skills, Bruce Lee stole the show as Kato. This was the first time Asian martial arts fighting was seen on American TV. The show launched Bruce Lee&#x27;s career as a popular actor in the US as well as in Hong Kong. Audience interest even led to Van Williams asking to learn some martial art moves.

Williams and Lee&#x27;s Green Hornet and Kato appear as anti-heroes in the second season of the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series in the two-part episode &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; / &quot;Batman&#x27;s Satisfaction&quot;. The episode ended with Batman himself questioning whether or not the Green Hornet was really a criminal. Unlike the &quot;campy&quot; version of &quot;Batman&quot;, this version of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; was played more seriously.

=== Animated series ===
In July 2020, Kevin Smith and WildBrain announced plans to develop a &quot;Green Hornet&quot; animated series set in the present day and focused on a reimagined Green Hornet and female Kato. On February 28, 2023, Smith confirmed in an episode of Fatman Beyond that the series would be 10 episodes.

==Comic books==

===Early comics===
Green Hornet comic books began in December 1940. The series, titled &quot;Green Hornet Comics&quot; published by Helnit Comics with the writing attributed to Fran Striker. The stories were loosely based on episodes of the radio show. This series ended after six issues.

Several months later, Harvey Comics launched its own version, beginning with issue #7. This series lasted until issue #47 in 1949; during that time it also changed its title twice: first to &quot;Green Hornet Fights Crime&quot; (issue #34) and later to &quot;Green Hornet, Racket Buster&quot; (issue #44).

Harvey additionally used the character in the public-service one-shot &quot;War Victory Comics&quot; in 1942, and gave him one adventure in each of two issues of &quot;All-New Comics&quot;, #13 (where he was also featured on the cover) and #14, in 1946.

In 1953, several months after the radio series ended, Dell Comics published a one-shot with the character (officially entitled &quot;Four Color&quot; #496). Both stories therein share titles with late-era radio episodes (&quot;The Freightyard Robberies&quot;, June 23, 1949; and &quot;[The] Proof of Treason&quot;, October 17, 1952) and might be adaptations.

In 1967, Gold Key Comics produced a 3-issue series based on the TV show.

===NOW Comics===
In 1989, NOW Comics introduced a line of Green Hornet comics, initially written by Ron Fortier and illustrated by Jeff Butler. It attempted to reconcile the different versions of the character into a multigenerational epic. This took into account the character&#x27;s ancestral connection to The Lone Ranger, though due to the legal separation of the two properties, his mask covered his entire face (as in the Republic serials) and he could not be called by name. In this interpretation, the Britt of the radio series had fought crime as the Hornet in the 1930s and 1940s before retiring. In NOW&#x27;s first story, in &quot;Green Hornet&quot; #1 (November 1989), set in 1945, the nationality of the original Kato (named in this comic series Ikano Kato) is given as Japanese, but because of the American policy regarding the Japanese minority during World War II, Reid referred to Kato as Filipino in order to prevent Kato&#x27;s being sent to an American internment camp.

The NOW comics considered the 1960s television character as the namesake nephew of the original, 1930s–1940s Britt Reid, referred to as &quot;Britt Reid II&quot; in the genealogy, who took up his uncle&#x27;s mantle after a friend is assassinated. Britt Reid II eventually retired due to a heart attack, and Kato—given the first name Hayashi, after that of the first actor to play Kato on radio—goes on to become a star of ninja movies. The NOW comics established Hayashi Kato as Ikano Kato&#x27;s son. Britt Reid&#x27;s nephew, Paul Reid, a concert pianist, takes on the role of the Hornet after his older brother Alan, who had first taken on the mantle, is killed on his debut mission. Paul Reid is assisted by Mishi Kato, Hayashi&#x27;s much-younger half-sister who was trained by Ikano Kato. Her being female caused problems between the publishers and the rights-holders, who withdrew approval of that character and mandated the return of &quot;the Bruce Lee Kato&quot;. After Mishi&#x27;s departure—explained as orders from her father to replace an injured automobile designer at the Zürich, Switzerland, facility of the family corporation, Nippon Today—Hayashi Kato returned to crime fighting alongside the Paul Reid Green Hornet. Mishi Kato returned in volume two as the Crimson Wasp, following the death of her Swiss police-officer fiancé, on orders of a criminal leader. In NOW&#x27;s final two issues, vol. 2, #39–40, a fourth Kato—Kono Kato, grandson of Ikano and nephew of Hayashi and Mishi—took over as Paul Reid&#x27;s fellow masked vigilante. The comics also introduced Diana Reid, the original Britt Reid&#x27;s daughter, who had become district attorney after the TV series&#x27; Frank Scanlon had retired. A romantic relationship eventually formed between her and Hayashi Kato.

NOW&#x27;s first series began in 1989 and lasted 14 issues. Volume Two began in 1991 and lasted 40 issues, ending in 1995 when the publisher went out of business. Kato starred solo in a four-issue miniseries in 1991, and a two-issue follow-up in 1992, both written by Mike Baron. He also wrote a third, first announced as a two-issue miniseries, then as a graphic novel, but it was never released due to the company&#x27;s collapse.

&quot;Tales of the Green Hornet&quot;, consisting of nine issues spread out over three volumes (two, four, and three issues, respectively), presented stories of the two previous Hornets. Volume One featured Green Hornet II, and its story was plotted by Van Williams, star of the 1960s TV series, and scripted by Bob Ingersoll. The follow-ups were written by James Van Hise. Other miniseries included the three-issue &quot;The Green Hornet: Solitary Sentinel&quot;; the four-issue &quot;Sting of the Green Hornet&quot;, set during World War II and Clint McElroy&#x27;s three-issue &quot;Dark Tomorrow&quot; (June–August 1993), featuring a criminal Green Hornet in 2080 being fought by the Kato of that era.

Discounting depictions of the cars utilized by the 1940s and 1960s Hornets, there were two versions of the Black Beauty used in the NOW comic series. The first was based on the Pontiac Banshee. The second was a four-door sedan based on the eleventh-generation Oldsmobile 98 Touring Sedan.

===Dynamite Entertainment===

In March 2009, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the license to produce &quot;Green Hornet&quot; comic books. Its first release was a miniseries written by Kevin Smith with pencils by Jonathan Lau. Revamped in 2010 as an ongoing series set in modern times, the new &quot;Green Hornet&quot; stars Britt Reid Jr., the rebellious and spoiled son of Britt Reid Sr., now a retired industrial and family man. When Britt Sr. is slain by the Black Hornet, a yakuza mobster whose family was shamed by the original Green Hornet, the aging but still fit Kato returns. With his daughter, Mulan Kato, who has taken over the costumed identity of her father, he brings Britt Jr. to China for training and safekeeping as he becomes the new Green Hornet. Writer Jai Nitz also wrote &quot;Green Hornet: Parallel Lives&quot;, a miniseries prequel to the 2011 Green Hornet feature film.

In 2013, an eight-issue miniseries called &quot;Masks&quot; brought together famous heroes from the pulp era. It starred The Shadow, The Green Hornet and Kato, The Spider and a 1930s descendant of Zorro. It was written by Chris Roberson with art by Alex Ross and Dennis Calero.

Kevin Smith and Ralph Garman wrote a crossover title, &quot;Batman &#x27;66 meets the Green Hornet&quot;, released in June 2014.

A crossover with Miss Fury was announced in August 2024.

==Comic strip==
In 2018, the Green Hornet appeared in newspaper strips as a guest-star in Dick Tracy by Mike Curtis (script) and Joe Staton (art), continuing the trend of Tracy stories reviving characters from defunct strips.

==Prose fiction==
Western Publishing subsidiary Whitman Books released four works of text fiction based on the character, targeting younger readers. There were three entries in the children&#x27;s line of profusely illustrated Big Little Books, &quot;The Green Hornet Strikes!&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet Returns&quot;, and &quot;The Green Hornet Cracks Down&quot;, in 1940, 1941 and 1942, respectively, all attributed to Fran Striker. In 1966, their line for older juveniles included &quot;Green Hornet: Case of the Disappearing Doctor&quot; by Brandon Keith, a tie-in to the television series. At about the same time, Dell Publishing released a mass-market paperback, &quot;The Green Hornet in The Infernal Light&quot; by Ed Friend, not only derived from the small-screen production as well, but, &quot;allegedly based on one of the TV episodes&quot;.

In 2009, Moonstone Books gained the prose license and has released three Green Hornet anthologies as part of its &quot;Chronicles&quot; line: &quot;The Green Hornet Chronicles&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet Casefiles&quot;, and &quot;The Green Hornet: Still at Large&quot;.

=== Video games ===
The Green Hornet and Kato appears in &quot;The Green Hornet: Wheels of Justice&quot; (2010) for iPhone, based on the film.

==Merchandising==
Few examples of &quot;Green Hornet&quot; merchandise have appeared since the 1960s. To coincide with the 2011 movie, Factory Entertainment produced six-inch action figures and a die cast Black Beauty, among other collectibles. Hollywood Collectibles has made a full-size prop gas gun replica. Mezco Toyz has made a set of 12-inch action figures, with the prototypes donated to the Museum of the Moving Image.

CKE Restaurants, Inc., the parent company of Carl&#x27;s Jr. and Hardee&#x27;s, teamed with the studio on a promotional marketing partnership that included commercials featuring Seth Rogen and Jay Chou in character as the Green Hornet and Kato; a beverage promotion with Dr. Pepper; &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; food items, kids&#x27; meal toys, and employee uniforms; and a contest with the grand prize of the Black Beauty car from the film.

In 2012, Factory Entertainment released screen accurate replicas of the Hornet Sting, Gas Gun, and Kato&#x27;s Dart from the 1960&#x27;s television series. A plaque signed by Van Williams was included in a limited run of &quot;Signature Edition&quot; replicas.

In June 2018, the toy company Funko released a Funko Pop figure of the Green Hornet as a Specialty Series figure. This was later followed up with multiple Funko Pop figures of the Green Hornet and Kato, released as exclusives at San Diego Comic-Con and New York Comic Con. In January 2020, Funko announced Green Hornet and Kato figures as part of their initial SODA vinyl figure offerings with a limited run of 6000 each.

In late 2021, Diamond Select Toys announced the start of a new line of Green Hornet and Kato collectible merchandise in partnership with The Green Hornet Inc. and the Bruce Lee Family. Their line of collectibles include a mini bust of Kato and various action figures of Kato in different outfits.

In 2022, Aurora Plastics Corporation, under their Polar Lights brand, reissued a model of the Black Beauty car from the 1960&#x27;s television series. Aluminum Model Toys released their own model kit of the Black Beauty in the same year.

<text>Bell Centre (French: &quot;Centre Bell)&quot;, formerly known as Molson Centre, is a multi-purpose arena located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Opened on March 16, 1996, it is the home arena of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), replacing the Montreal Forum and it is the largest indoor arena in Canada. It is owned by the Molson family via the team&#x27;s ownership group Groupe CH, and managed via Groupe CH subsidiary Evenko.

With a capacity of 21,105 in its hockey configuration, Bell Centre is the second largest ice hockey arena in the world after the SKA Arena in St. Petersburg, Russia. Alongside hockey, Bell Centre has hosted major concerts, and occasional mixed martial arts and professional wrestling events. Since it opened in 1996, it has consistently been listed as one of the world&#x27;s busiest arenas, usually receiving the highest attendance of any arena in Canada. In 2012, it was the fifth-busiest arena in the world based on ticket sales for non-sporting events.

==History==
Construction began on the site on June 22, 1993, almost two weeks after the Canadiens defeated the Los Angeles Kings at the Forum for their 24th and most recent Stanley Cup. When the arena officially opened in 1996, its name initially reflected Molson, Inc., a brewing company which was owner of the Canadiens at the time. Molson elected not to keep the naming rights when they sold the team and the name was officially changed on September 1, 2002, after Bell Canada acquired the naming rights.

On October 14, 2015, it was announced that Bell Centre would undergo renovations, including the replacement of all the seats, renovated hallways and concessions, new restaurants, public Wi-Fi, and the planned conversion of Avenue des Canadiens-de-Montréal (the section of De la Gauchetière Street on which the arena is situated) into a pedestrian-only street. The renovations, which were not expected to interfere with normal operations, have a budget of $100 million.

==Location==
Bell Centre is located in downtown Montreal in the borough of Ville-Marie, near the corner of Canadiens-de-Montréal Avenue (formerly De la Gauchetière west) and de la Montagne Street. The Lucien L&#x27;Allier commuter rail terminal, to which it is connected, is next door on that corner. In addition it is located across the street from the 1250 René-Lévesque skyscraper. It is easily accessible by public transportation, as it is linked to both Lucien-L&#x27;Allier and Bonaventure Metro stations. It is also connected to the underground city and Central Station.

==Arena information==

The building covers an area of (). It has a seating capacity of 21,105, making it the second largest hockey arena in the world. It also holds six restaurants.

Capacities of the arena from highest to lowest are:

* Basketball: 22,114

* Hockey: 21,105
* Concerts: 15,000-19,200
* Amphitheatre: 10,000–14,000
* Theatre: 5,000–9,000

A new scoreboard was installed prior of the 2008–09 season. This scoreboard consisted of four video panels. It was the biggest in the NHL until 2012.

It is one of only two NHL arenas that uses an old-style siren to mark the end of periods instead of a horn; the other is TD Garden in Boston. The sirens were inherited from the arenas&#x27; predecessor facilities, coming from the disused Montreal Forum and the Boston Garden respectively.

===Seating===
Unlike most North American arenas, which have generally been designed by Populous and its predecessors, the Bell Centre was designed by a local consortium, and has many unique design features. The grandstands are sloped steeply to improve sight lines. Washrooms on the 100 level are centralized on a specific lower level located at each end.

Bell Centre is arranged in a three-tier layout: The lower 100 section, commonly referred to as &quot;the reds&quot; since these seats are coloured red; the 200 section situated between the two levels of private and corporate boxes, known as &quot;Club Desjardins&quot; (which features premium amenities such as larger seats and free food and non-alcoholic drinks), and the upper 300–400 section.

The 300–400 section is divided into three zones by seat colour: white section rows AA–FF, the grey section rows A–D, and the blue section, labelled &quot;400,&quot; and consisting of rows A–D. The ends of the 400 section are further divided into two more groups. At the end where the Canadiens shoot towards twice is the Coors Light Zone, featuring section cheerleaders and a band playing in the hallway. At the opposite end is the Family Zone, which features child-specific ticket prices and limited alcohol.

Seats behind the press gondola, in Sections 318, 319, and 320, feature their own scoreboards on the back of the gondola due to the normal scoreboard being blocked.

===Interior===

After some early complaints of a generic feel, especially compared to the Forum, the Canadiens started to incrementally decorate the building with celebrations of the team&#x27;s history, including a ring of players around the top level of seating. The Molson Ex Zone features a live band stage and its own red theme.

==Entertainment==
Bell Centre is the main venue in Montreal for large-scale entertainment events. Many artists have performed at the arena, like Olivia Rodrigo, Céline Dion, Les Cowboys Fringants, Gloria Estefan, Stromae, Twenty One Pilots, Tina Turner, Depeche Mode, Prince, Drake, Shakira, Elton John, Billy Joel, Shania Twain, Cher, Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Rush, Coldplay, Rihanna, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Slipknot, U2, Nicki Minaj, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato, Katy Perry, Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga, Janet Jackson, Roger Waters, Spice Girls, Justin Timberlake, Barbra Streisand, Madonna, Metallica, Iron Maiden, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Imagine Dragons, Dua Lipa and Kylie Minogue.

The singer who has performed the most times at the Bell Centre is Céline Dion with 50 performances between 1996 and 2020 from her Falling into You: Around the World tour in 1996 and 1997, Let&#x27;s Talk About Love World Tour in 1998 and 1999, Taking Chances World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Summer Tour 2016 in 2016 and Courage World Tour in 2019 and 2020. On December 31, 1999, she performed the final show of the Let&#x27;s Talk About Love World Tour, which was her last performance before a three-year hiatus from the music industry.

In August 1999, the third national tour of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; visited for a 12-day run. Robert Marien, who originated the role of Jean Valjean in Paris in 1980, as well as in the bilingual Canadian tour which started in Montreal in 1991, joined the cast exclusively for the Montreal stop.

==Sports==

===Ice hockey===
The final two games of the three-game 1996 World Cup of Hockey championship series were held at Bell Centre (the United States won both games, defeating Canada in the series 2–1). Bell Centre was also host to two pool games in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. The Bell Centre was the host of the 2009 NHL All-Star Game and hosted the 2009 and 2022 NHL Entry Drafts, the latter of which saw the Canadiens take Juraj Slafkovský first overall.

Montreal Canadiens home games have been consistently sold out since January 2004. Additionally, the Canadiens have among the top attendance figures in the NHL. For the 2009–2010 season, the Habs had the highest attendance played at their home arena. All 21,273 seats were sold in 45 minutes on May 12, 2010, for fans to watch the 7th game in the playoff series versus the Pittsburgh Penguins, which was shown on the big screens. Noise levels in the arena allegedly reached as high as 110 dB when goals were scored by the Canadiens, most notably, during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, during Game #6 against the Pittsburgh Penguins on May 10, 2010, making it one of the loudest NHL arenas during hockey games.

On December 9, 2014, the Canadiens hosted the Vancouver Canucks, the first home game since the death of Jean Béliveau. The game was preceded by a memorial tribute to him. Bell Centre remained sold-out that night with 21,286 fans in attendance and one empty seat left for Mr. Beliveau, with the official attendance shortened by one to honour him.

Bell Centre hosted its first Stanley Cup Finals in 2021, with games three and four against the defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning played inside the arena. The Canadiens, officially named Le Club de hockey Canadien or CHC, were allowed to have 2,500 fans during the first and second round, then 3,500 for the semifinals and the Stanley Cup Finals due to Quebec government public health restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec. The Canadiens had hoped to further increase their arena capacity limit to 50% of the arena&#x27;s total capacity for the Stanley Cup Finals, however, that request was denied by the Quebec government. While the arena&#x27;s capacity was limited during the playoffs, thousands more fans gathered outside the arena to watch the games on a TV screen outside of the La Cage sports bar situated adjacent to the Bell Centre.

From September 26th to October 8th, 2021, 7,500 fans were allowed at Bell Centre for the pre-season games, and for the opening night on October 16, the Quebec government made new rules and stated that the Canadiens could return to its full capacity of 21,105 people.

On April 20, 2024, the Bell Centre hosted its first home game for the new club named Montreal Victoire of the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League (PWHL), a match against the Toronto Sceptres that was marketed as the &quot;Duel at the Top&quot;, reflecting the two teams&#x27; position atop the league standings at the time. The sellout crowd of 21,105 set a new attendance record for a women&#x27;s hockey game. The PWHL returned to the Bell Centre on March 1, 2025 between the Montreal Victoire and the Boston Fleet.

The Bell Centre was one of two host venues for the NHL 4 Nations Face-Off in February 2025, alongside TD Garden in Boston. The first four round robin games were played at the Bell Centre, featuring national teams representing the United States, Canada, Sweden and Finland.

===Basketball===

Since October 2010, Bell Centre has hosted selected NBA preseason games, primarily featuring the Toronto Raptors; the first was held on October 22, 2010, with the Raptors hosting the New York Knicks. It has since hosted preseason games as part of the NBA Canada Series, which have also included all-U.S. games.

===Mixed martial arts===
Bell Centre hosted &quot;UFC 83: Serra vs. St-Pierre 2&quot; in April 2008, marking the first UFC mixed martial arts event to take place in Canada. The main event was a rematch between Welterweight champion Matt Serra and Montreal native Georges St-Pierre. The tickets available to the public sold out in under one minute, and the event set the all time UFC attendance record, at that time (since surpassed by &quot;UFC 129: St-Pierre vs. Shields&quot; in Toronto). Other UFC events have subsequently been held at Bell Centre, including &quot;UFC 97: Redemption&quot;, &quot;UFC 113: Machida vs. Shogun 2&quot;, &quot;UFC 124: St-Pierre vs. Koscheck 2&quot;, &quot;UFC 154: St-Pierre vs. Condit&quot;, &quot;UFC 158: St-Pierre vs. Diaz&quot; and &quot;UFC 186: Johnson vs. Horiguchi&quot;, the most recent three of which were headlined by St-Pierre.

=== Professional wrestling ===
Bell Centre has occasionally hosted WWE professional wrestling events, including four pay-per-views (Survivor Series in 1997, No Way Out in 2003, Breaking Point in 2009 and Elimination Chamber in 2023), as well as 11 broadcasts of &quot;Raw&quot; and 8 broadcasts of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Elimination Chamber 2023 marked the first time that the Chamber structure was on Canadian soil and only the second time in history that the structure was outside of the United States, following the 2022 event that was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and featured Laval native Sami Zayn competing in the event&#x27;s main event match for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Roman Reigns. In April 2019, Bell Centre hosted both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; on consecutive nights for the 2019 Superstar Shake-up, the first time in WWE history that the event was held at an arena outside of the United States. On August 19, 2022, Bell Centre hosted the 1,200th episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

During Survivor Series 1997, Bell Centre was the site of the infamous &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot;—a match where Calgary-native Bret Hart controversially lost the WWF Championship to his rival Shawn Michaels. Hart had signed a contract to leave WWF for the rival World Championship Wrestling (WCW) the following month, and did not want to lose a championship match to Michaels in his own country. The original plan was for the match to end by disqualification after a brawl between the wrestlers&#x27; allies, which would have allowed Hart to lose or vacate the championship at a later date before leaving the promotion. However, WWF owner Vince McMahon intervened without Hart&#x27;s knowledge, and had the referee declare a Michaels victory by submission after performing a Sharpshooter on Hart, even though he had not actually submitted. Wrestling writer Mike Johnson considered the match to be &quot;arguably the most talked-about match in the history of professional wrestling&quot;. Eight years later, in the same venue, Michaels cut his infamous &quot;Who&#x27;s your daddy, Montreal?&quot; heel promo in the lead-up to his impending match with Hulk Hogan at SummerSlam 2005, where he referenced the Screwjob during his promo, receiving plenty of heat from the Montreal fans.

Brock Lesnar made his televised WWE debut at Bell Centre on the March 18, 2002 &quot;Raw&quot; after WrestleMania X8 in Toronto, interfering in the Hardcore match that was taking place between Maven and Al Snow. A wall on the concourse of the arena depicting iconic events that took place inside the arena includes Lesnar&#x27;s debut among others.

In December 2023, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) made its Montreal debut, with broadcasts of &quot;Collision&quot; and &quot;Dynamite&quot;.

=== Figure skating ===
The Bell Centre was scheduled to host the 2020 World Figure Skating Championships in March of that year, but these were cancelled as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was eventually used to host the 2024 edition, in lieu of the earlier planned event. This was the second time the championship took place in Montreal, the first having been held in the old Forum in 1932.

==Retired jerseys==
The following numbers have been retired by the Canadiens and hang from the rafters:
While Elmer Lach and Henri Richard both wore the number 16, they were given separate ceremonies unlike Cournoyer and Moore. All have their own banner.

On October 18, 2005, the Canadiens also raised the following numbers on a single banner in honour of the former MLB team Montreal Expos, who left the city for Washington, D.C. after the 2004 season:
* 8 Gary Carter
* 10 Andre Dawson and Rusty Staub
* 30 Tim Raines

The only other banners hanging from the rafters at the arena are those of the Canadiens&#x27; Stanley Cup championship banners. Unlike other NHL arenas, the Canadiens do not display division or conference championship banners.

<doc id="212671" wikidata="Q1753552" url="?curid=212671" title="So I Married an Axe Murderer">
<text>So I Married an Axe Murderer is a 1993 American romantic black comedy film, directed by Thomas Schlamme and starring Mike Myers and Nancy Travis. Myers plays Charlie MacKenzie, a man afraid of commitment until he meets Harriet (Travis), who works at a butcher shop, and who may be a serial killer. Myers also plays Stuart, Charlie&#x27;s father. The film received a mixed reception from critics and did not fare well at the box office, grossing $27 million, but it has gained a cult following in the years since its release. A miniseries called &quot;The Pentaverate&quot;, created by Myers and based on the in-universe conspiracy theories mentioned in this film, was released in May 2022 on Netflix.

==Plot==
Charlie MacKenzie is a popular local beat poet living in San Francisco who makes his frequent break-ups the subject of his poems. His best friend Tony, a recently promoted police detective, believes that Charlie is afraid of commitment and will identify (or invent) any reason to break up with someone.

While purchasing dinner for his Scottish-born parents, Stuart and May, he encounters a butcher named Harriet, and is attracted to her. During his visit with his family, Charlie and May discuss his most recent break-up, and May brings up a tabloid article about a bride known as &quot;Mrs. X&quot;, who kills her husbands on their honeymoons using an axe.

Charlie goes back to the butcher shop and offers to help Harriet. The two find common bonds and start to date. After staying at her place one night, Charlie meets Harriet&#x27;s eccentric sister, Rose, who warns Charlie to be careful. He learns Harriet used to live in Atlantic City, was involved with a trainer in Russian martial arts, and screams for someone named Ralph in her sleep. Charlie arranges a dinner with her to meet his parents, who say she is their favourite of all his partners. Charlie reads the article about Mrs. X, which identifies two of her victims as a martial arts expert and a man named Ralph.

Charlie becomes fearful and asks Tony to investigate Harriet and the Mrs. X story. Tony reveals that the husbands of Mrs. X were all reported missing alongside their wives, assuring that Harriet is unlikely to be Mrs. X. Charlie remains on edge, and after a few more troubled dates, breaks up with her. Tony reports that a killer in the Mrs. X story has confessed. Relieved, Charlie apologizes to Harriet by reciting one of his beat poems to her from her rooftop. They make up, and Harriet explains away some of her history, such as Ralph being the name of a woman she knows.

At his parents&#x27; wedding anniversary Charlie proposes to Harriet. She accepts after some hesitation. Following the wedding ceremony, they embark on a honeymoon to a secluded mountain hotel. After they depart, Tony learns that the confessed killer is actually a compulsive liar. He sends a photo of Harriet to the known associates of the missing husbands, and all identify her as their friends&#x27; wife. With phone lines to the hotel down due to a storm, Tony charters a plane. Once he lands, he calls Charlie locally and warns him that Harriet really is Mrs. X, but the hotel phone line is knocked out and power is lost.

Charlie panics and tries to stay away from Harriet without letting her know what he knows, but the hotel staff force him into the honeymoon suite for their first night together. After locking Harriet in the closet, Charlie discovers a letter, purportedly written by him, explaining his absence to Harriet. Rose appears wielding an axe and reveals herself as the Mrs. X killer. She feels that Harriet&#x27;s husbands are taking her sister from her, motivating her to kill them on their honeymoon night and leave letters behind claiming to be from them, leading Harriet to believe that each husband abandoned her. Charlie flees from Rose.

Tony leads the police into the hotel and arrests Harriet, still believing her to be the murderer. Charlie, having been chased to the hotel roof by Rose, gets Tony&#x27;s attention as they take Harriet away. While the police make their way up to the roof, Rose swings the axe at Charlie and is thrown off the building. Tony catches her, and she is arrested and taken away. Charlie and Harriet resume their lives as a happy couple.

==Cast==
==Production==
The genesis of the film originated in 1987, when producer Robert N. Fried, who had recently left Orion Pictures to set up on his own, met with writer Robbie Fox to discuss story ideas. They ended up talking about the problems they had with women and agreed that &quot;most women appeared to be out to destroy us!&quot; Fried and co-producer Cary Woods formed their own production company in 1992. &quot;So I Married An Axe Murderer&quot; was their first film, for which they were given a $20 million budget. Fox wrote the screenplay in 1987. In the original version, Charlie was Jewish and, according to Fried, it was &quot;initially conceived as being more about paranoia than commitment&quot;. Myers wanted changes to the script that would allow him to perform both serious acting and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;–style comedy.

He extensively rewrote the script with writer Neil Mullarkey, an old friend from Britain. According to Myers, they changed the story and many of the comedic moments. Fox was asked to consider a new set of credits that gave him a &quot;story by&quot; and co-screenplay credit. He rejected the proposal and in arbitration, the Writers Guild of America decided that Fox would receive sole screenwriting credit. Fried and Myers were upset that Mullarkey, who had put much work into the script, did not receive any credit.

===Casting===
Friend and co-producer Cary Woods asked Mike Myers to play Charlie MacKenzie because of the success he had with the film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. He agreed because he liked the script, as many of his friends also had a fear of commitment, and &quot;were all suffering from cold feet and what is cold feet but a low-grade terror? This story just expands on that terror.&quot; Before Myers was asked, Woody Allen considered playing Charlie. Chevy Chase, Albert Brooks, and Martin Short also considered the role but did not like the character. Sharon Stone was initially set to play Harriet Michaels, the supposed axe murderer of the film&#x27;s title.

Like Myers, who has two roles in the film, Stone wanted to play both Harriet and Rose, (who ended up being played by Amanda Plummer). Studio executives at Sony did not like the idea of Stone playing both roles, and she therefore refused to accept the part. Nancy Travis, Fried&#x27;s partner (and future wife), was then cast as Harriet. Travis was drawn to Harriet&#x27;s &quot;qualities of danger and compassion mixed with humor [which] make her an intriguing character.&quot;

Anthony LaPaglia said that his character &quot;has grand illusions of being &quot;Serpico&quot;; you know he&#x27;s ready to fight crime like his hero did. But he&#x27;s just not competent.&quot; When the actors attended the first cast read-through of the script, Stuart had not yet been cast. Myers read the character&#x27;s lines and the filmmakers so enjoyed his interpretation that they realized he could play that role as well. The film also features cameos by Charles Grodin, Phil Hartman, Michael Richards, Mike Hagerty, Debi Mazar, Steven Wright, and Alan Arkin, the latter appearing uncredited as Tony&#x27;s sensitive boss. They all agreed to be in the film for the opportunity of working with Myers.

===Principal photography===
To fit both Charlie and his father in the same scene together, the filmmakers used a split-screen process. To play Stuart required Myers undergoing three to four hours of prosthetic makeup. While filming scenes in the butcher shop, Nancy Travis was distracted by Myers&#x27; antics and severed a fingertip on her left hand while chopping vegetables. A local doctor successfully re-attached the tip. Travis said that she and Myers frequently improvised together, and he taught her more about comedy and showed her &quot;how to be relaxed and spontaneous on the set.&quot;

There were stories in the press that Myers&#x27; over-inflated ego forced extensive re-shoots on the film, and that he tried to deny Robbie Fox credit for writing the film. On the set, director Thomas Schlamme said that he had his differences with Myers over how the film should be shaped. He said that Myers was &quot;taking a stretch beyond his usual self and was playing outside himself. Personality clashes were bound to happen. We struggled.&quot; The director denied that Myers was a control freak, and praised the &quot;total commitment to his work. (But) yes, it was difficult.&quot; There were reports that the film went over budget, with in-fighting among the principal actors and lengthy release delays, and that it was unfunny. Despite these early reports, &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; scored high at test screenings.

===Locations===
Set in San Francisco, California, the film features familiar sights and neighborhoods of the Golden State metropolis, including the Golden Gate Bridge, the Palace of Fine Arts and Alcatraz. One scene on Alcatraz was filmed in &quot;A&quot; block, an area that was unchanged from its 1912 configuration and is not open to the public. The space for actors, crew and equipment is narrow, a challenge also faced by the makers of &quot;The Rock&quot;, which features Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery as characters breaking in to the prison complex. The tiny Cloverdale Municipal Airport is also in the film.

The restaurant where Charlie and Harriet double-date with Tony and Susan is the Fog City Diner, which closed its doors in 2013. The butcher shop used for &quot;Meats of the World&quot; was Prudente Meats on Grant Avenue, in the North Beach Section of San Francisco.

The scene where Charlie breaks up with Harriet was set in Alamo Square, with the San Francisco skyline in the background.

The final scenes are set at Dunsmuir House in the East Oakland foothills. Additional special effects and matte paintings created the illusion that the location was secluded among mountains. The exterior shot for the café, Cafe Roads, where Myers recites his beat poetry, is the bar Vesuvio, at Columbus Avenue and Jack Kerouac Alley. The filmmakers set the story in San Francisco, which they viewed as an ideal place for a poet like Charlie to gravitate to.

Myers has said that he was attracted to its &quot;coffeehouse culture, with its clothes and music and its whole sensibility ... people aren&#x27;t going to bars as much. They tend to go out and have coffee.&quot; Several sets were built in warehouses near Candlestick Park, and these soundstages were used for many weeks.

===Deleted scenes===
At least two deleted scenes are known to exist - one filmed on BART, and an epilogue which revealed that Charlie and Harriet have a son named Stuart, after Charlie&#x27;s father.

===Score===
The film&#x27;s original score was composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton. Due to the film&#x27;s emphasis on popular music, several of Broughton&#x27;s cues were replaced with existing songs, such as his main title music being supplanted by The Boo Radleys&#x27; version of &quot;There She Goes,&quot; and &quot;Butcher Shop Montage&quot; having Big Audio Dynamite&#x27;s &quot;Rush&quot; substituted.

Broughton appreciated the support of music supervisor Danny Bramson and director Thomas Schlamme, stating &quot;I was given the opportunity to make my case, and I didn&#x27;t get slighted... But the way it ended up was the way it ended up. It was done with a lot of creative latitude, and creative permission and confidence. I can&#x27;t complain about the way it came out.&quot;

Intrada Records released an album of his music on November 25, 2013, featuring the complete score, plus alternates and original versions of cues.

Total Time: 52:56

== Release ==
&quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; was first shown at a screening to benefit the local San Francisco film office, on July 27, 1993, at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater. It had its official world premiere at the Galaxy Theater in Hollywood on July 28, with Myers, Travis, and LaPaglia in attendance. The film did not perform well at the box office. It was released on July 30 in 1,349 theaters, and grossed $3.4 million during its opening weekend, and a total of $11.5 million in the United States and Canada. It grossed an estimated $15 million internationally for a worldwide total of $27 million.

==Reception==
&quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; had a mixed critical reception. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 55% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; is a unique rom-com with moments of heart and hilarity—even if they&#x27;re all too scattered to cohere into a consistent whole.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 54 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B&quot; on scale of &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F.&quot;

Roger Ebert, in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, described the film as &quot;a mediocre movie with a good one trapped inside, wildly signaling to be set free.&quot; He rated it two and a half stars out of four. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter Travers felt that &quot;Juggling mirth, romance and murder requires a deft touch—think of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Trouble with Harry&quot;. &quot;Axe&quot; is a blunt instrument.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s reviewer gave the film a &quot;C−&quot; and said, &quot;In some perverse way, &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; seems to be asking us to laugh at how not-funny it is.&quot;

In a review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson had a mixed reaction to Myers&#x27; performance, writing &quot;Everything he does is charmingly lightweight and disposable and reasonably impossible to resist. And in the end, because the character is so easily within reach for him, you may come away feeling a little cheated, as if you hadn&#x27;t quite seen a movie at all.&quot; However, Janet Maslin&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that it came as &quot;a welcome surprise that &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;, which might have been nothing more than a by-the-numbers star vehicle, surrounds Mr. Myers with amusing cameos and gives him a chance to do more than just coast.&quot;

In his review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Edward Guthmann called the film a &quot;trifle, at best—but it&#x27;s so full of good spirits, and so rich with talented actors having a marvelous time, that its flaws tend to wash away.&quot;

==Home media==
A DVD of the film was released in June 1999. The DVD artwork differed from the original film poster, which had Harriet holding an axe behind her back.

==Legacy==
===&quot;The Pentaverate&quot;===

On April 17, 2019, it was announced that Netflix had picked up a then untitled six-episode miniseries from Myers where he will star as multiple characters. In June 2021, it was announced that the miniseries will be titled &quot;The Pentaverate&quot;, based on the film&#x27;s conspiracy theories as discussed by Stuart and Tony as they peruse the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. The series would feature Ken Jeong, Keegan-Michael Key, Mazar, Jennifer Saunders, and Lydia West, with Jeremy Irons serving as the narrator. Myers, Tim Kirkby, John Lyons, Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns, and Jason Weinberg will serve as executive producers with the latter three through Jax Media.

<doc id="212673" wikidata="Q1530725" url="?curid=212673" title="Glen Clark">
<text>Glen David Clark (born November 22, 1957) is a Canadian retail executive and former politician who served as the 31st premier of British Columbia from 1996 to 1999.

==Early life and education==
Clark attended independent Roman Catholic schools, namely St. Jude’s Elementary and Notre Dame Secondary in East Vancouver. At Notre Dame, Clark was known as a small, fearless linebacker for the football team. He was also student council president and played the lead male role in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and later performed in &quot;South Pacific&quot;. Clark earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Simon Fraser University and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of British Columbia. Before entering politics, he was part of the labour movement and worked as a natural resource policy consultant.

==Premier of British Columbia==

Clark was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 1986 provincial election. He served as the Minister of Finance and Corporate Relations and then as the Minister of Employment and Investment in the government of Mike Harcourt. When Harcourt resigned as a result of the Bingogate scandal, Clark stood for and won the leadership of the BC NDP and therefore became BC&#x27;s 31st premier. Clark called an election in 1996 in which his party narrowly held onto its majority. Although it received fewer votes across the province than the second-place BC Liberal Party, the NDP was able to hold on to power by winning all but eight seats in Vancouver.

Clark largely continued the policies of the Harcourt government, particularly its implementation of the B.C. Benefits welfare reform package, similar to reforms carried out by Ralph Klein in Alberta and Mike Harris in Ontario. When the 1997 party convention adopted a motion condemning the reforms and calling for an increase in welfare rates, Clark responded, &quot;No. We have a deficit.&quot;

===Scandals===

====Fast ferry scandal====
Clark undertook the B.C. fast ferries initiative, which was designed to upgrade the existing BC Ferries fleet as well as jump start the shipbuilding industry in Vancouver. Although the ferries were eventually produced, the project had massive cost overruns and long delays, and the ferries were never able to function up to expectations. The ferries were later sold by the incoming Liberal government, for a fraction of their original price, to the American owned Washington Marine Group.

====Casinogate====
In March 1999, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police executed a search warrant and searched the Clark household. The media was tipped off about the raid, and BCTV showed live, primetime coverage of the premier pacing inside his house while the search was conducted. Two weeks later the RCMP conducted a search of the Premier&#x27;s Office.

The subsequent investigation spawned intense coverage by the media. However, subsequent coverage also exposed numerous inaccuracies in the way the story was initially portrayed, with some critics alleging a media or RCMP conspiracy to smear him for ideological reasons.

Clark resigned suddenly on the night of August 21, 1999, following allegations that he had accepted favours (in the form of free renovations worth $10,000, which he had actually paid for) from Dimitrios Pilarinos in return for approving a casino application. He was later formally charged with committing breach of trust, a criminal offence.

Conflict of interest commissioner H.A.D. Oliver concluded in 2001 that Clark had violated conflict of interest laws in British Columbia. However, Clark was acquitted of all criminal charges by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on August 29, 2002, with Justice Elizabeth Bennett ruling that while Clark had unwisely left himself open to a perception of unethical behaviour, there was no solid evidence that he had actually done anything illegal.

==After political life==
Upon Clark&#x27;s resignation, Deputy Premier Dan Miller acceded to the interim leadership of the New Democratic Party and the premiership. Miller was succeeded by Ujjal Dosanjh after winning the party&#x27;s leadership convention in 2000. Due in part to the scandals surrounding Clark, the NDP was heavily defeated by the BC Liberals under Gordon Campbell in the 2001 provincial election, winning just two seats.

In 2001 Jim Pattison hired Clark to manage his Neon Products Company. Later, Clark was president and chief operating officer of the Jim Pattison Group in Vancouver until he stepped down at the end of 2022.

<text>Michael Franklin Harcourt OC (born January 6, 1943) is a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 30th premier of British Columbia from 1991 to 1996, and before that as the 34th mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia&#x27;s largest city, from 1980 to 1986.

== Early life and education ==
Harcourt was student council president at Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School and studied at the University of British Columbia, where he graduated BA and LLB. He founded and became the first director (1969–1971) of the Vancouver Community Legal Assistance Society, reputedly Canada&#x27;s first community law office.

== Municipal politics ==
Harcourt served as a Vancouver alderman from 1973 to 1980. He was first elected as a member of the Electors&#x27; Action Movement (TEAM). He was Mayor of Vancouver from 1980 to 1986. As mayor, his term in office was dominated by planning for Expo 86, an event that saw many new developments come to the city, and an event he adamantly opposed coming to the city in the first place.

== Provincial politics and premiership ==
He was first elected to the British Columbia Legislature in the 1986 British Columbia election. He became the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party (NDP) and the leader of the Official Opposition in the following year. He was considered to be a moderate within the ranks of his social democratic party.

In the 1991 provincial election, Harcourt led the NDP back to power, defeating the Social Credit party led by Rita Johnston. That marked the second time that the NDP had ever been in power in British Columbia (BC) and the first since 1975.

On taking office, Harcourt&#x27;s government increased the basic rate of monthly social assistance by 5%, from $500 to $525. By 1993, it had reached $535 per month, coupled with increases in other rates and a relaxation of means testing of applicants. As Ralph Klein introduced severe spending cuts in neighbouring Alberta, Harcourt accused him in December 1993 of driving Albertan welfare recipients into British Columbia. An increase in out-of-province applications for income assistance and surge in welfare rolls and spending (&quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; noted in 1993 that almost 10% of the population were claiming social assistance), coupled with a shift towards an intolerant view of welfare fraud in Canadian politics, affected the government&#x27;s standing. A controversial news story about welfare fraud among British Columbia&#x27;s Somali Canadian community, after the government had denied that system abuse was taking place, further hurt its standing.

Harcourt reacted by abandoning his social democratic policy and moving to the right on welfare. He fired Joan Smallwood as Minister of Social Services, replaced her with Joy MacPhail, reduced welfare rates, and made it more difficult for families to claim assistance. Announcing the policy shift in September 1993, he infamously described it as a crackdown on &quot;cheats, deadbeats and varmints&quot;. He later expressed regret for those comments by blaming a &quot;relentless&quot; coverage of welfare fraud causes by the media for the action. The resulting BC Benefits welfare reform package, which included budget cuts, new restrictions, and a reduction in the basic rate to $500 per month, the same it had been when Harcourt took office, proved hard to accept for the NDP and had a lasting effect on its reputation by hampering its attempts to condemn later governments for undertaking similar welfare crackdowns.

The NDP government under Harcourt entered into a contract with Carrier Lumber to build roads and construct new mills to handle an increased volume of wood because of the infestation of the mountain pine beetle. On May 13, 1992, Harcourt ignored the contract between his government and Carrier Lumber and promised several First Nations that no timber would be harvested and that no roads would be built without their agreement. Phillip Halkett, deputy minister of forests, testified at trial, &quot;The Premier had no authority to make that promise.&quot; The courts awarded Carrier Lumber $156 million and ruled that there had been a deliberate attempt to destroy the company and that government officials had conspired to withhold 2,000 pages of documents in an attempt to defeat Carrier&#x27;s damage suit. Justice Glenn Parrett of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in his reasons stated of the NDP government, &quot;It is difficult to conceive of a more compelling and cynical example of duplicity and bad faith.&quot;

Harcourt resigned as premier in February 1996 as the result of &quot;Bingogate&quot;, a scandal in which David Stupich, a former NDP member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and member of Parliament (MP) from BC, used money raised by a charity bingo to fund the party. While it was determined by a BC Ministry of Justice special prosecutor that Harcourt was not directly responsible for the scandal, he took political responsibility for it. He was succeeded as premier by Glen Clark in 1996. He did not run for another term as MLA in the 1996 British Columbia general election; Jenny Kwan succeeded him as the NDP candidate and later MLA of Vancouver-Mount Pleasant.

Harcourt&#x27;s challenges as premier, with both the legislature and the media, were chronicled in Vancouver journalist Daniel Gawthrop&#x27;s book &quot;Highwire Act: Power, Pragmatism, and the Harcourt Legacy&quot;, which was published shortly after his resignation as the NDP was preparing for the leadership convention in which Clark was named his successor.

== Post-politics ==
After serving as premier, Harcourt became associated with the University of British Columbia (UBC). He was involved in research relating to sustainable development and cities.

Harcourt was severely injured in a near-fatal fall at his cottage on Pender Island in November 2002, which resulted in a severe spinal-cord injury. After 13 years as a partial quadriplegic, he describes 20 percent of his body as still paralyzed. The former premier received a widespread outpouring of empathy and support from his fellow British Columbians and his rapid recovery astonished doctors. He spent several months at the world-renowned facility GF Strong. He later published a book about his ordeal, called &quot;Plan B.&quot;

He was named as a special advisor to Prime Minister Paul Martin on cities on December 12, 2003.

His book &quot;City Making in Paradise&quot; was released in August 2007.

In November 2007, he received an honorary doctoral degree in law (LLD) from UBC. In February 2009, he was appointed associate director of the new UBC Continuing Studies Centre for Sustainability, where his mandate was to contribute to the development of educational programs that emphasized practical knowledge in tackling climate change and other sustainability issues.

In 2008, Harcourt became a key adviser to then–newly elected mayor of Vancouver Gregor Robertson, including topics about transparency and transportation.

In 2011, Harcourt joined five other former mayors of Vancouver to urge the federal government to halt its efforts to close Insite.

In the January 31, 2014, issue of &quot;High Country News&quot; Harcourt stated he was recruited in the 1960s by an activist group to oppose a freeway that would have connected the Trans-Canada Highway to downtown Vancouver. &quot;You&#x27;ve been hired to stop the freeway&quot;, he recalled being told.

Harcourt revealed in April 2014 that he had allowed his NDP membership to lapse and now considers himself an independent. &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a trial separation or a decree absolute&quot;, he told the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; in an interview. Harcourt cited several complaints against his former party, including former leader Adrian Dix&#x27;s decision to oppose the Kinder Morgan pipeline and the party&#x27;s general disposition against mining, logging and other resource-extraction industries, the party&#x27;s 2009 opposition to the BC Liberal government&#x27;s proposed carbon tax, and the 2010 caucus revolt that forced the resignation of then-leader Carole James.

Harcourt had repeatedly supported the legalization of cannabis and, in May 2014, announced that he would be an advisor to True Leaf Medicine, a Vernon-based start-up company seeking Health Canada approval to produce and sell medicinal marijuana. Harcourt admitted previous personal use of marijuana in the 1960s and 1970s.
