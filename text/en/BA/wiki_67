<text>Human migration is the movement of people from one place to another, with intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily, at a new location (geographic region). The movement often occurs over long distances and from one country to another (external migration), but internal migration (within a single country) is the dominant form of human migration globally.

Migration is often associated with better human capital at both individual and household level, and with better access to migration networks, facilitating a possible second move. It has a high potential to improve human development, and some studies confirm that migration is the most direct route out of poverty. Age is also important for both work and non-work migration. People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in large groups. There are four major forms of migration: invasion, conquest, colonization and emigration/immigration.

People moving from their home due to forced displacement (such as a natural disaster or civil disturbance) may be described as displaced persons or, if remaining in the home country, internally-displaced persons. People who flee to a different country due to political, religious, or other types of persecution in their home country can formally request shelter in the host country. These people are commonly referred to as asylum seekers. If the application is approved, their legal classification changes to that of refugees.

== Definition ==
Depending on the goal and reason for relocation, migrants can be divided into three categories: migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Each category is defined broadly as the combination of circumstances that motivate a person to change their location. As such, &quot;migrants&quot; are traditionally described as persons who change the country of residence for general reasons. These purposes may include better job opportunities or healthcare needs. This term is the most widely understood, as anyone changing their geographical location permanently is a migrant.

In contrast, &quot;refugees&quot; are defined by the UNHCR as &quot;persons forced to flee their country because of violence or persecution&quot;. The reasons for the refugees&#x27; migration usually involve war actions within the country or other forms of oppression, coming either from the government or non-governmental sources. Refugees are usually associated with people who must unwillingly relocate as fast as possible; hence, such migrants are likely to relocate undocumented.

Asylum seekers are associated with persons who also leave their country unwillingly, yet, who also do not do so under oppressing circumstances such as war or death threats. The motivation to leave the country for asylum seekers might involve an unstable economic or political situation or high rates of crime. Thus, asylum seekers relocate predominantly to escape the degradation of the quality of their lives.

Nomadic movements usually are not regarded as migrations, as the movement is generally seasonal, there is no intention to settle in the new place, and only a few people have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times. Temporary movement for travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute is also not regarded as migration, in the absence of an intention to live and settle in the visited places.

== Migration patterns and related numbers ==
There exist many statistical estimates of worldwide migration patterns. The World Bank has published three editions of its &quot;Migration and Remittances Factbook&quot;, beginning in 2008, with a second edition appearing in 2011 and a third in 2016. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has published ten editions of the &quot;World Migration Report&quot; since 1999. The United Nations Statistics Division also keeps a database on worldwide migration. Recent advances in research on migration via the Internet promise better understanding of migration patterns and migration motives.

Structurally, there is substantial South–South and North–North migration; in 2013, 38% of all migrants had migrated from developing countries to other developing countries, while 23% had migrated from high-income OECD countries to other high-income countries. The United Nations Population Fund says that &quot;while the North has experienced a higher absolute increase in the migrant stock since 2000 (32 million) compared to the South (25 million), the South recorded a higher growth rate. Between 2000 and 2013, the average annual rate of change of the migrant population in developing regions (2.3%) slightly exceeded that of the developed regions (2.1%).&quot;

Substantial internal migration can also take place within a country, either seasonal human migration (mainly related to agriculture and tourism to urban places), or shifts of the population into cities (urbanisation) or out of cities (suburbanisation). However, studies of worldwide migration patterns tend to limit their scope to international migration.
Almost half of these migrants are women, one of the most significant migrant-pattern changes in the last half-century. Women migrate alone or with their family members and community. Even though female migration is largely viewed as an association rather than independent migration, emerging studies argue complex and manifold reasons for this.

As of 2019, the top ten immigration destinations were:

* United States
* Germany
* Saudi Arabia
* Russian Federation
* United Kingdom
* United Arab Emirates
* France
* Canada
* Australia
* Italy

In the same year, the top countries of origin were:

* India
* Mexico
* China
* Russian Federation
* Syrian Arab Republic
* Bangladesh
* Pakistan
* Philippines
* Afghanistan
* Indonesia
Besides these rankings, according to absolute numbers of migrants, the &quot;Migration and Remittances Factbook&quot; also gives statistics for top immigration destination countries and top emigration origin countries according to percentage of the population; the countries that appear at the top of those rankings are entirely different from the ones in the above rankings and tend to be much smaller countries.
New York City&#x27;s multiple Chinatowns in Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, as large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York, with the largest metropolitan Chinese population outside Asia, The New York metropolitan area contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, comprising an estimated 893,697 uniracial individuals as of 2017.

As of 2013, the top 15 migration corridors (accounting for at least two million migrants each) were:

# Mexico–United States
# Russian Federation–Ukraine
# Bangladesh–India
# Ukraine–Russian Federation
# Kazakhstan–Russian Federation
# China–United States
# Russian Federation–Kazakhstan
# Afghanistan–Pakistan
# Afghanistan–Iran
# China–Hong Kong
# India–United Arab Emirates
# West Bank and Gaza–Jordan
# India–United States
# India–Saudi Arabia
# Philippines–United States
== Economic impacts ==

=== World economy ===

The impacts of human migration on the world economy have been largely positive. In 2015, migrants, who constituted 3.3% of the world population, contributed 9.4% of global GDP.

At a microeconomic level, the value of a human mobility is largely recognized by firms. A 2021 survey by the Boston Consulting Group found that 72% of 850+ executives across several countries and industries believed that migration benefited their countries, and 45% considered globally diverse employees a strategic advantage.

According to the Centre for Global Development, opening all borders could add $78 trillion to the world GDP.

=== Remittances ===
Remittances (funds transferred by migrant workers to their home country) form a substantial part of the economy of some countries. The top ten remittance recipients in 2018.
In addition to economic impacts, migrants also make substantial contributions in sociocultural and civic-political life. Sociocultural contributions occur in the following areas of societies: food/cuisine, sport, music, art/culture, ideas and beliefs; civic-political contributions relate to participation in civic duties in the context of accepted authority of the State. It is in recognition of the importance of these remittances that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 targets to substantially reduce the transaction costs of migrants remittances to less than 3% by 2030.

== Voluntary and forced migration ==
Migration is usually divided into &quot;voluntary migration&quot; and &quot;forced migration&quot;. The distinction between &quot;involuntary&quot; (fleeing political conflict or natural disaster) and &quot;voluntary migration&quot; (economic or labour migration) is difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated. The World Bank estimated that, as of 2010, 16.3 million or 7.6% of migrants qualified as refugees. This number grew to 19.5 million by 2014 (comprising approximately 7.9% of the total number of migrants, based on the figure recorded in 2013). At levels of roughly 3 percent the share of migrants among the world population has remained remarkably constant over the last 5 decades.

=== Voluntary migration ===

Voluntary migration is based on the initiative and the free will of the person and is influenced by a combination of factors: economic, political and social: either in the migrants&#x27; country of origin (determinant factors or &quot;push factors&quot;) or in the country of destination (attraction factors or &quot;pull factors&quot;). &quot;Push-pull factors&quot; are the reasons that push or attract people to a particular place. &quot;Push&quot; factors are the negative aspects(for example wars) of the country of origin, often decisive in people&#x27;s choice to emigrate. The &quot;pull&quot; factors are the positive aspects of a different country that encourages people to emigrate to seek a better life. For example, the government of Armenia periodically gives incentives to people who will migrate to live in villages close to the border with Azerbaijan. This is an implementation of a push strategy, and the reason people do not want to live near the border is security concerns given tensions and hostility because of Azerbaijan.

Although the push-pull factors are opposed, both are sides of the same coin, being equally important. Although specific to forced migration, any other harmful factor can be considered a &quot;push factor&quot; or determinant/trigger factor, such examples being: poor quality of life, lack of jobs, excessive pollution, hunger, drought or natural disasters. Such conditions represent decisive reasons for voluntary migration, the population preferring to migrate in order to prevent financially unfavorable situations or even emotional and physical suffering.

=== Forced migration ===
There are contested definitions of forced migration. However, the editors of a leading scientific journal on the subject, the &quot;Forced Migration Review&quot;, offer the following definition: Forced migration refers to the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (displaced by conflict) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects. These different causes of migration leave people with one choice, to move to a new environment. Immigrants leave their beloved homes to seek a life in camps, spontaneous settlement, and countries of asylum.

By the end of 2018, there were an estimated 67.2 million forced migrants globally25.9 million refugees displaced from their countries, and 41.3 million internally displaced persons that had been displaced within their countries for different reasons. In 2022, 6 million Ukrainian people fled their country; meanwhile, 3 million Syrian people fled in 3 years.

== Transit migration ==
Transit migration is a highly debated term with no official definition. The common understanding is that it describes immigrants who are in the process of moving to an end goal country. The term was first coined by the UN in 1990 to describe immigrants who were traveling through countries surrounding Europe to end up in a European Union state. Another example of transit migrants is Central Americans who travel through Mexico in order to live in the United States.

The term &quot;transit migration&quot; has generated a lot of debate among migration scholars and immigration institutions. Some criticize it as a Eurocentric term that was coined to place responsibility of migrants on states outside the European Union; and also to pressure those states to prevent migration onward to the European Union. Scholars note that EU countries also have identical migrant flows and therefore it is not clear (illogical or biased) why it is only migrants in non-EU countries that are labeled as transit migrants. It is also argued that the term &quot;transit&quot; glosses over the complexity and difficulty of migrant journeys: migrants face many types of violence while in transit; migrants often have no set end destination and must adjust their plan as they move (migrant journeys can take years and go through several stages).

== Contemporary labor migration theories ==

=== Overview ===
Numerous causes impel migrants to move to another country. For instance, globalization has increased the demand for workers in order to sustain national economies. Thus one category of economic migrants – generally from impoverished developing countries – migrates to obtain sufficient income for survival. Such migrants often send some of their income homes to family members in the form of economic remittances, which have become an economic staple in a number of developing countries. People may also move or are forced to move as a result of conflict, of human-rights violations, of violence, or to escape persecution. In 2014, the UN Refugee agency estimated that around 59.5 million people fell into this category. Other reasons people may move include to gain access to opportunities and services or to escape extreme weather. This type of movement, usually from rural to urban areas, may be classed as internal migration. Sociology-cultural and ego-historical factors also play a major role. In North Africa, for example, emigrating to Europe counts as a sign of social prestige. Moreover, many countries were former colonies. This means that many have relatives who live legally in the (former) colonial metro pole and who often provide important help for immigrants arriving in that metropole.

Relatives may help with job research and with accommodation. The geographical proximity of Africa to Europe and the long historical ties between Northern and Southern Mediterranean countries also prompt many to migrate. Whether a person decides to move to another country depends on the relative skill premier of the source and host countries. One is speaking of positive selection when the host country shows a higher skill premium than the source country. On the other hand, negative selection occurs when the source country displays a lower skill premium. The relative skill premia define migrants selectivity. Age heaping techniques display one method to measure the relative skill premium of a country. A number of theories attempt to explain the international flow of capital and people from one country to another.

=== Research contributions ===
Recent academic output on migration comprises mainly journal articles. The long-term trend shows a gradual increase in academic publishing on migration, which is likely to be related to the general expansion of academic literature production, and the increased prominence of migration research.
Migration and its research have further changed with the revolution in information and communication technologies.

=== Neoclassical economic theory ===
This migration theory states that the main reason for labour migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labour demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labour but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labour supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labour tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labour comes changes in the sending and the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory best describes transnational migration because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.

=== Dual labor market theory ===
Dual labour market theory states that pull factors in more developed countries mainly cause migration. This theory assumes that the labour markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labour, and the secondary market, which is very labour-intensive, requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries results from a pull created by a need for labour in the developed countries in their secondary market. Migrant workers are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labour market because the native labourers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labour pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.

=== New economics of labor migration ===
This theory states that migration flows and patterns cannot be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives but that wider social entities must also be considered. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion from a household that has insufficient income. In this case, the household needs extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labour abroad. These remittances can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital. Recent research has examined a decline in US interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorising that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers&#x27; ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel. Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labour reallocation.

=== Relative deprivation theory ===

Relative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbours or other households in the migrant-sending community is essential in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas with a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may decrease it. There are two stages of migration for workers: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalise on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbours and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.

=== World systems theory ===
World-systems theory looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change. Trade with one country, which causes an economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonisation, the economic dependence of former colonies remains on mother countries. However, this view of international trade is controversial, and some argue that free trade can reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labour-intensive goods, which causes an increase in the employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. Exporting capital-intensive goods from rich countries to developing countries also equalises income and employment conditions, thus slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.

=== Osmosis theory ===
Based on the history of human migration osmosis theory studies the evolution of its natural determinants. In this theory migration is divided into two main types: simple and complicated. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. The complicated migration is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants, notably earning, unemployment, networks, and migration policies. Osmosis theory explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of osmosis. In this respect, the countries are represented by animal cells, the borders by the semipermeable membranes and the humans by ions of water. According to the theory, according to the osmosis phenomenon, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. To measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the second principle of thermodynamics used to measure the osmotic pressure.

== Social-scientific theories ==

=== Sociology ===
A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a sociological perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects and is affected by, matters of race and ethnicity, as well as social structure. They have produced three main sociological perspectives:
* symbolic interactionism, which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level
* social conflict theory, which examines migration through the prism of competition for power and resources
* structural functionalism (based on the ideas of Émile Durkheim), which examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of despair and aimlessness and the consolidation of social networks

In the 21st century, as attention has shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how transnationalism allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins. In this framework, work on social remittances by Peggy Levitt and others has led to a stronger conceptualisation of how migrants affect socio-political processes in their countries of origin. Much work also takes place in the field of integration of migrants into destination-societies.

===Political science===
Political scientists have put forth a number of theoretical frameworks relating to migration, offering different perspectives on processes of security, citizenship, and international relations. The political importance of diasporas has also become in the 21st century a growing field of interest, as scholars examine questions of diaspora activism, state-diaspora relations, out-of-country voting processes, and states&#x27; soft power strategies. In this field, the majority of work has focused on immigration politics, viewing migration from the perspective of the country of destination. With regard to emigration processes, political scientists have expanded on Albert Hirschman&#x27;s framework on &#x27;&quot;voice&quot; vs. &quot;exit&quot; to discuss how emigration affects the politics within countries of origin.

== Historical theories ==

=== Ravenstein ===

Certain laws of social science have been proposed to describe human migration. The following was a standard list after Ernst Georg Ravenstein&#x27;s proposal in the 1880s:

# every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.
# the majority of migrants move a short distance.
# migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.
# urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.
# families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.
# most migrants are adults.
# large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.
# migration stage by stage (step migration).
# urban, rural difference.
# migration and technology.
# economic condition.

=== Push and pull ===
Demographer Everett S. Lee&#x27;s model divides factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull. Push factors are things that are unfavourable about the home area that one lives in, and pull factors are things that attract one to another host area.

Push factors:

* Not enough jobs
* Few opportunities
* Conscription (draft young men into army)
* Famine or drought
* Political fear of persecution
* Poor medical care
* Loss of wealth
* Natural disasters
* Death threats
* Desire for more political or religious freedom
* Pollution
* Poor housing
* Discrimination
* Poor chances of marrying
* War or threat of invasion
* Disease

Pull factors:

* Job opportunities
* Better living conditions
* The feeling of having more political or religious freedom
* Enjoyment
* Education
* Better medical care
* Attractive climates
* Security
* Family links
* Industry
* Better chances of marrying
=== Climate cycles ===
The modern field of climate history suggests that the successive waves of Eurasian nomadic movement throughout history have had their origins in climatic cycles, which have expanded or contracted pastureland in Central Asia, especially Mongolia and to its west the Altai Mountains. People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that essential flocks could graze, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of Anatolia, the Pannonian Plain, into Mesopotamia, or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term &quot;migratory domino effect&quot; to describe this process in the context of Sea People invasion.

=== Food, sex, and security ===
The theory is that migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation; Idyorough (2008) believes that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic. Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities. The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities. Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist, but they do so to meet the basic human needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species. Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.

=== Other models ===
* Zipf&#x27;s inverse distance law (1956)
* Gravity model of migration and the friction of distance
* Radiation law for human mobility
* Buffer theory
* Stouffer&#x27;s theory of intervening opportunities (1940)
* Zelinsky&#x27;s Mobility Transition Model (1971)
* Bauder&#x27;s regulation of labour markets (2006): &quot;suggests that the international migration of workers is necessary for the survival of industrialised economies...[It] turns the conventional view of international migration on its head: it investigates how migration regulates labour markets, rather than labour markets shaping migration flows.&quot;

== Migration governance ==
By their very nature, international migration and displacement are transnational issues concerning the origin and destination States and States through which migrants may travel (often referred to as &quot;transit&quot; States) or in which they are hosted following displacement across national borders. And yet, somewhat paradoxically, the majority of migration governance has historically remained with individual states. Their policies and regulations on migration are typically made at the national level. For the most part, migration governance has been closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay of non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the defining elements of a State. Comparative surveys reveal varying degrees of openness to migrants across countries, considering policies such as visa availability, employment prerequisites, and paths to residency.

Bilateral and multilateral arrangements are features of migration governance at an international level. There are several global arrangements in the form of international treaties in which States have reached an agreement on the application of human rights and the related responsibilities of States in specific areas. The 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention) are two significant examples notable for being widely ratified. Other migration conventions have not been so broadly accepted, such as the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which still has no traditional countries of destination among its States parties. Beyond this, there have been numerous multilateral and global initiatives, dialogues and processes on migration over several decades. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (Global Compact for Migration) is another milestone, as the first internationally negotiated statement of objectives for migration governance striking a balance between migrants&#x27; rights and the principle of States&#x27; sovereignty over their territory. Although it is not legally binding, the Global Compact for Migration was adopted by consensus in December 2018 at a United Nations conference in which more than 150 United Nations Member States participated and, later that same month, in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), by a vote among the Member States of 152 to 5 (with 12 abstentions).

===Migration programs===
Colonialism and colonization opens up distant territories and their people to migration, having dominated what is identified as modern migration. Colonialism globalized systems of migration and established ties effective until today.

While classic modern colonialism relied on the subjugation and rule of local indigenous peoples by small groups of conquering metropolitan people, soon forced migration, through slavery or indentured servitude supplanted the subjugated local indigenous peoples.
Settler colonialism later continued or established the rule of the colonizers through migration, particularly settlement.
Settler colonies relied on the attraction of metropolitan migrants with the promise of settlement and increasingly outnumbering, displacing or killing indigenous peoples.

Only in the late stage of colonialism migration flows oriented towards the metropole instead of out or outside of it. After decolonization migration ties between former colonies to former metropoles have been continuing. Today&#x27;s independent countries have developed selective or targeted foreign worker policies or programs, with the aim of boosting economies with skilled or relatively cheap new local labour, while discrimination and exploitation are often fed by ethnic nationalist opposition to such policies.

<text>The University of Toronto Faculty of Law (U of T Law, UToronto Law) is the law school of the University of Toronto. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; has consistently assessed the Faculty as the highest ranked common law school in Canada and the highest ranked in terms of faculty journal citations. The Faculty offers the JD, LLM, SJD, MSL, and GPLLM degrees in law.

Among its alumni are four Canadian Prime Ministers, 14 Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, including one of the nine currently-sitting Justices, Sheilah Martin, five Nobel Prize Laureates, three Chiefs of Staff to the Prime Minister, two Premiers of Ontario, and two Mayors of Toronto. A number of deans of law schools around the world—Stanford Law School, Columbia Law School, University of Oxford Faculty of Law, UC Berkeley School of Law, University of Manitoba, and Queen&#x27;s Faculty of Law—are University of Toronto Law graduates.

The current Dean of the Faculty of Law (as of January 1, 2021) is Jutta Brunnée, an international and environmental law scholar.

==History==
The University of Toronto Faculty of Law was established as a teaching faculty in 1887 pursuant to the &quot;University Federation Act&quot;, which was proclaimed into force in 1889. An earlier faculty of law had existed at King&#x27;s College between 1843 and 1854, but was abolished by an Act of Parliament in 1853.

The Faculty of Law was officially opened in 1889, with two part-time professors appointed at its inauguration, William Proudfoot and David Mills. The Faculty awarded LL.B. degrees to graduates of its program. However, the Law Society of Upper Canada at the time refused to accept the University of Toronto Faculty of Law as an accredited law school, preferring instead to maintain control over the profession by establishing its own school, the Osgoode Hall Law School. Thus, students who graduated from the Faculty were still required to complete a full three-year articling term and complete courses at Osgoode Hall in order to join the legal profession. As a result, the Faculty&#x27;s enrollment numbers in the early years were relatively low.

It was not until 1949 that the Faculty adopted its current form. In the 1940s, the Faculty played the leading role in making legal education in Ontario into a modern academic degree course, rather than an apprenticeship.

In 1949, Cecil (&quot;Caesar&quot;) Wright assumed the deanship of the Faculty of Law. He first had to resign his post as Dean of Osgoode Hall Law School, the seat of the Law Society of Upper Canada, rejecting the Law Society&#x27;s apprenticeship model of legal education in favour of the University of Toronto&#x27;s vision of a full-time legal education, hinging on the professional bachelor of laws degree and embedded within a university. Wright brought with him his colleagues John Willis and Bora Laskin, the latter of whom would go on to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Despite the Faculty of Law&#x27;s academic program, the Law Society of Upper Canada refused to recognize it as a degree-granting institution for the purposes of accreditation. In the early 1950s, law students and their supporters petitioned the Law Society, and in 1953, a group of 50 student protesters marched on Osgoode Hall demanding formal recognition for the Faculty of Law. Finally, in 1958, after years of negotiation and discord, the Law Society began to give credit to graduates of the law school seeking admission to the Ontario bar.

== Reputation and admissions ==
The University of Toronto Faculty of Law has consistently been rated as the top law school for Common Law in Canada. The Faculty has held the number one spot in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; law school rankings for Common Law since it began to evaluate law schools in 2007. In 2011, the school was ranked 13th globally by the QS World University Rankings in the subject of law, along with a few select schools from US, UK, and Australia. In 2018, the Times Higher Education ranked the Faculty the 10th best law school in the world. In 2022, the Times Higher Education ranked the Faculty the 16th best law school in the world.

The Faculty of Law has high admission criteria with an acceptance rate of 13.5% and a yield rate of 70.1% for 2011–12. The Faculty features a 98% yield rate in the province of Ontario, the province that accounts for about half of the country of Canada&#x27;s English-language common-law population. The median undergraduate GPA of students accepted into the J.D. program is 3.88, and the median Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score is 168.

==Location and buildings==
The Faculty of Law lies at the geographic centre of the University of Toronto in the downtown Toronto area. It is located at the corner of Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent and Hoskin Avenue, south of the Royal Ontario Museum and slightly north of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

===Falconer Hall===
Falconer Hall is home to the faculty&#x27;s graduate program, including offices and common rooms for graduate students, and four seminar rooms. The building was originally constructed for Edward Rogers Wood as a family home and named Wymilwood. It was temporary home of York University from September 1960 to fall of 1961.

===Flavelle House===
Flavelle House contains a conference centre, the Rowell Room student lounge, and staff offices. The building was constructed in 1902 as the private residence of Joseph Flavelle, and it was given to the University of Toronto upon his death in 1939. It backs onto Philosopher&#x27;s Walk, which can be seen from many of the south and west-facing rooms.

===Jackman Law Building===

In 2011, the Faculty of Law launched a campaign to raise money for the renovation and expansion of Flavelle House, with a goal of raising $53 million. The new building is named the Jackman Law Building in honour of Henry N.R. &quot;Hal&quot; Jackman, who donated $11 million to the faculty&#x27;s building campaign in 2012, the largest single gift the faculty has ever received.

The new Faculty of Law building includes the conjoined Flavelle House, Laskin Pavilion, and Jackman Crescent, with the Queen&#x27;s Park Forum connecting them all. It is located at 78 Queen&#x27;s Park facing onto the Legislative Building on Queen&#x27;s Park and has a view of downtown Toronto&#x27;s skyline. Construction on the new building began in the summer of 2013 and was completed and ready for occupancy in mid-2016. The structure can be seen both from the corner of Queen&#x27;s Park and from Hoskin Street. The Faculty of Law building is situated across from Trinity College, Toronto, separated by Philosopher&#x27;s Walk, formerly Taddle Creek. Its location was formerly home to Toronto&#x27;s Industrial Age Millionaire&#x27;s Row, with many of the buildings, previously serving as mansions, donated to the University of Toronto in the intervening century. It is next to the Faculty of Music and just south of the Royal Ontario Museum, formerly part of the University of Toronto.

The Jackman Law Building includes the faculty&#x27;s principal classrooms, faculty offices, student services offices, faculty and student common rooms, the Rosalie Silberman Abella Moot Court, as well as the Bora Laskin Law Library.

The Jackman Law Building was designed as a joint venture between B+H Architects and Hariri Pontariri Architects.

==Faculty members==

The Faculty of Law has over 50 full-time faculty members, and about 640 undergraduate and graduate students. Its &quot;Distinguished Visitors&quot; program brings short-term visiting professors from the world&#x27;s leading law schools to teach at the school each year. Past visiting professors have included: Zhenmin Wang, Dean of the Faculty of Law at Tsinghua University; Aharon Barak, former President of the Supreme Court of Israel; and David M. Malone, former Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations.

Among the permanent faculty members are many who are regarded as the leading scholars in their fields and who have also written many standard textbooks used by most students across Canada. These include Stephen Waddams (Contract Law), Ernest Weinrib (Tort Law), Kent Roach (Criminal Law), Hamish Stewart (Evidence Law), Larissa Katz (Property Law), Mohammad Fadel and Anver Emon (Islamic Law), Trudo Lemmons (Health Law), Edward Iacobucci (Competition Law), Anthony Duggan and Anita Anand (Business Law), Ayelet Shachar (Immigration Law), Martin Friedland (Legal History), Arthur Ripstein (Legal Philosophy), Benjamin Alarie (Tax Law), Carol Rogerson (Family Law), and Michael Trebilcock (Law and Economics), among many others.

Gord Kirke has taught in the Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws programs since 1985.

==Academic programs==

The faculty offers five degrees in law, with several combined degree programmes with other University of Toronto faculties.

=== JD program ===

The Juris Doctor or JD degree is the faculty&#x27;s undergraduate level of a professional law degree, with about 200 students in every class and 600 in total. Students require an undergraduate degree prior to admission and must take the LSAT. In 2001, the Faculty of Law became the first law school in Canada to offer the Juris Doctor (JD) designation rather than the Bachelor of Laws (LLB). It followed many law schools in the United States, which had phased out the LLB over the 20th Century. The JD designation is intended to reflect the fact that the vast majority of the school&#x27;s graduates enter the law school with at least one university degree. (In fact, approximately one quarter enter with one or more graduate degrees.) The JD designation does not, however, reflect significant changes in the law school&#x27;s curriculum. The move to the JD was controversial at the time it was announced, though it has now gained wide acceptance and has been emulated by almost all Canadian law schools. Graduates of the faculty&#x27;s JD programme are academically qualified to teach law at most law schools in North America, though an extensive record of legal publications is usually an additional prerequisite for tenure-track employment. Despite its name, holders of the JD are not legally entitled to use the prefix &quot;Doctor&quot;, unlike other professional doctorates (e.g., MD, PharmD, DDS) offered by the university.

=== Combined JD programs ===

In addition to the regular JD program, the faculty offers the most combined law degrees in Canada. Students concurrently pursue their JD with a second degree from another faculty at the university. These include the JD/MBA (business) with the Rotman School of Management, JD/MGA (international organizations) and JD/MPP (government) with the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, JD/MSW (social work) with the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, and the JD/MA and JD/Ph.D. (arts and science) with the Faculty of Arts and Science, among others. While about one-fifth of the class currently is enrolled in a combined program, the most popular is the JD/MBA with an enrollment of over 20 students per year, making up over 10% of the overall JD class. Its combined JD/MBA program is the largest in Canada and possibly the world with students pursuing careers in business law, corporate leadership, consulting and investment banking.

=== LLM program ===

The Master of Laws (LLM) is a one-year degree that can be taken in either a thesis-intensive format or a coursework-only format. The Faculty offers concentrations in the area of Business Law, Criminal Law, Legal Theory, and Health Law, Ethics and Policy within the LLM degree program. Each year there are about 50 LLM students, with admission being restricted to students with outstanding academic performance in their first law degree (i.e., JD or LLB).

=== GPLLM program ===

The Global Professional Master of Laws (GPLLM) is a 12-month executive-style master of laws offered during evenings and weekends and taught by a combination of law and business faculty. The Faculty offers concentrations in the area of Business Law, Canadian Law in a Global Context, Innovation, Law and Technology, and Law of Leadership. Each year there are about 80 GPLLM students. Prior legal education is not required for admission, and the degree is designed for working professionals in occupations closely aligned with the law but not legal in nature.

=== MSL program ===

The Master of Studies in Law (MSL) is a very small program designed for established academics and scholars who work and write in a discipline related to law, and wish to acquire a knowledge of the law in order to add a legal dimension to scholarship in their own discipline.

=== SJD program ===

The Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD) is a research doctorate degree aimed at aspiring scholars. The SJD program provides an opportunity for outstanding law graduates to pursue original academic research at the highest level in a focused area of law. The programme includes graduate legal coursework and a 90,000 – 100,000 word dissertation that makes an original contribution to legal scholarship. Eligible candidates generally hold a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) or Juris Doctor (JD) and a Master of Laws (LLM) from recognized universities with an excellent academic record and have demonstrated, through substantive writing, their ability to engage in and generate high-level thought and quality research. While common in the United States, the University of Toronto is the only university in Canada to offer the SJD as its terminal law degree. All other Canadian universities offer a Ph.D. in law, while the University of Ottawa grants a Doctor of Laws (LL.D) as its terminal degree. Under Ontario law, holders of the SJD are entitled to use the prefix &quot;Doctor&quot; with their name.

=== Legal clinics and internships ===
The Faculty of Law offers its students internship programs in pro bono work and international human rights law, and supports a range of legal clinics staffed by students as well as practitioners.

==Tuition and financial aid==
Total tuition and other fees for entering Juris Doctor (JD) students as of 2020-21 are $34,633.51. The Faculty of Law has, by far, the highest tuition fees of any law school in Canada. It also has a financial aid program, which 48% of students qualified for in 2015-2016, with the average first-year student who qualified for aid receiving a $9,132 bursary.

All students who have eligible unmet need, according to the financial aid policy, receive assistance in the form of bursaries and Faculty interest payments on private loans during the three years of law school. The Faculty&#x27;s financial aid program uses a &quot;deemed parental contribution&quot; as part of determining a student&#x27;s unmet need. There is no deemed parental contribution below an income threshold that is around the average Canadian household income. The deemed parental contribution phases out for students above the age of 30.

The Faculty of Law is the only law school in Canada with a back-end debt relief program for graduates who choose to pursue low income employment. The &quot;back end debt relief program&quot; is targeted to relieve debt with respect to financial aid/interest-free loans that are recognized by the faculty; most third-party debt (lines of credit; credit cards; mortgage debt) is not recognized and is not eligible for faculty support.

== Grading system ==
The JD program uses a modified honours-pass-fail grading system, announced in 2011–2012 and implemented in 2012–2013. It followed on Harvard Law School&#x27;s and Stanford Law School&#x27;s implementation announced in 2008-2009 and 2007-2008, respectively, of a modified pass-fail system first brought in place by Yale Law School decades before in the 1960s. The grades awarded are High Honours (HH), Honours (H), Pass with Merit (P), Low Pass (LP) and Fail (F). Toronto along with Harvard, Stanford, and Yale as well as UC Berkeley which has also had a similar system for decades, are the only law schools that use modified pass-fail systems in North America. Students beginning law school prior to 2012 are grand-parented and continue to be graded under a modified letter grade system. Students hoping to graduate with &#x27;distinction,&#x27; indicating they finished in the top 10% of their class, can expect to require a mix of High Honours (HH) and Honours (H) grades.

== Student organizations ==
Students manage a wide range of organizations and activities at the Faculty of Law. Activities include free legal clinics such as Downtown Legal Services, mooting, law journals, and interest oriented clubs. The umbrella organization for JD students at the Faculty of Law is the Students&#x27; Law Society. The umbrella organization for graduate students is the Graduate Students&#x27; Law Society. The student societies act as student governments, providing funding to student organizations and advocating on behalf of students to the faculty and administration.

The four student-run law journals at the Faculty are:
*&quot;University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review&quot;
*&quot;Journal of International Law and International Relations&quot; (defunct since 2018)
*&quot;Journal of Law and Equality&quot;
*&quot;Indigenous Law Journal&quot;

== Post-graduation employment ==
The Faculty has the highest employment rate and average starting salaries for legal graduates in the country, taking the largest proportion of positions at Bay Street Seven Sisters firms in Canada every year. Over 95% of the school&#x27;s JD graduates secure legal employment (as articling law students in Canada or licensed lawyers in jurisdictions where there is no apprenticeship such as the US) before graduation, the highest in the country.

<text>Han Xiangzi, courtesy name Qingfu or Beizhu, is a Chinese mythological figure and one of the Eight Immortals in the Taoist pantheon. He studied Taoist magical arts under the tutelage of Lü Dongbin, another of the Eight Immortals. Han Xiangzi is often depicted carrying a &quot;dizi&quot; (Chinese flute), so he is also regarded as the patron deity of flutists. He is also believed to be the composer of the Taoist musical piece &quot;Tian Hua Yin&quot; ().

==Historical identity==
It is not known if Han Xiangzi existed historically. However, he is believed to be Han Xiang, a grandnephew of Han Yu, a prominent politician, poet and Confucian scholar who lived in the Tang dynasty. There are at least three different accounts about Han Xiang and Han Yu&#x27;s grandnephew.

Han Yu once dedicated three poems to his grandnephew, Han Xiang, whose courtesy name was &quot;Qingfu&quot;. The three poems are &quot;Zuo Qian Zhi Languan Shi Zhisun Xiang&quot; (), and the two-part poem &quot;Su Zeng Jiang Kou Shi Zhisun Xiang&quot; (). In 819, during the reign of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, the emperor arranged a grand ceremony for an alleged Buddhist relic to be escorted to the imperial palace in Chang&#x27;an and encouraged the people to worship the relic and donate to Buddhist monasteries. Han Yu wrote a memorial to Emperor Xianzong to advise him against doing so, and drew on the example of Emperor Wu of Liang and Hou Jing to caution the emperor. Emperor Xianzong was furious and wanted to execute Han Yu, but eventually pardoned him, demoted him, and sent him out of Chang&#x27;an to serve as the Prefect of Chao Prefecture (潮州; present-day Chaozhou, Guangdong). Along the way, Han Yu passed by Lan Pass (; in present-day Lantian County, Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi), where Han Xiang came to join him on his journey. Han Yu wrote the poem &quot;Zuo Qian Zhi Languan Shi Zhisun Xiang&quot; and dedicated it to Han Xiang.

The historical text &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; mentioned that Han Yu had a grandnephew, Han Xiang, whose courtesy name was &quot;Beizhu&quot;. Han Xiang served as a &quot;da li cheng&quot; (), an official in the Ministry of Justice, under the Tang government.

In the miscellany &quot;Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang&quot;, Han Yu had an unnamed grandnephew who lived in the Huai River region. He instructed his grandnephew to study Confucian classics in a school, but his grandnephew showed no interest in his studies and bullied his classmates. Han Yu then arranged for his grandnephew to study in a Buddhist school, but the abbot complained that he was defiant and reckless. Han Yu then brought his grandnephew home and scolded him for not spending his time productively. However, his grandnephew claimed that he had the special ability to change the colour of peony flowers, and demonstrated it in front of him. Han Yu was greatly surprised. His grandnephew then returned to the Huai River region and led the rest of his life as a simple commoner.

==Legends==

According to the 17th century novel Han Xianzi Quanzhuan (The Story of Han Xiangzi: The Alchemical Adventures of a Daoist Immortal), Han Xiangzi was a son of Han Hui, the elder brother of Han Yu (a famous statesman and poet from Tang Dynasty). After the death of Han Hui and his wife, Xiangzi was raised in Han Yu’s household, as if he was Han Yu’s son. Han Yu had great expectations of his nephew, unfortunately the latter had no intention of entering government service. Instead he liked to cultivate himself according to Taoist doctrine.

Han Yu then married his nephew to Lin Luying, the daughter of scholar Lin, in hopes that Xiangzi would forget his pursuit of Taoism and have more interest in worldly matters. However, Han Xiangzi never impregnated his wife, and several years later he ran away from home to join Lü Dongbin and Zhongli Quan. After Han Xiangzi successfully became immortal, he returned to earth to deliver his uncle, his aunt and his wife (so they could become immortals too). After several failed attempts to break Han Yu’s Confucian obstinacy, Xiangzi finally delivered him after saving his uncle’s life from a snowstorm at Languan (Blue Pass). Later he did the same to his aunt and wife.

There are similar stories of Han Xiangzi’s origin in other accounts such as &quot;The Eight Immortals Depart and Travel to the East&quot; () and &quot;The Eight Immortals Achieving the Tao&quot; ( Baxian Dedao). However, the Dongyouji’s and Baxian Dedao’s version are shorter and didn’t mention Han Xiangzi’s marriage.

Han is often said to carry &quot;a basket of flowers and a jade flute&quot;.

==Han Xiangzi’s Prophecy==
This story was recorded in both Xiyouji (Journey to the West) and Han Xianzi Quanzhuan.

It was said that after achieving his immortality Han Xiangzi went to his uncle’s birthday. Han Yu once again tried to convince his nephew to abandon his pursuit of Taoism. In response, Xiangzi said that their paths were different. Before leaving, Xiangzi put some earth in a flower-pot and forthwith there came forth a bouquet of perfect peonies. On the petals of these flowers, written in gold, were two verses:
Many years later Emperor Xianzong of Tang was offended by Han Yu&#x27;s criticism of Buddhism. Thus he was demoted from his position in government and banished to Chaozhou. On his way to Chaozhou, Han Yu&#x27;s journey was blocked due to heavy snowfall on Languan (Blue Pass). At this point he remembered his nephew’s prophecy and cried. Suddenly Han Xiangzi appeared before him, swept away the snow and opened a road for him. Realizing his past mistakes, Han Yu finally converted to Taoism.

==Han Xiangzi and the Dragon Girl (Longnu)==
The love story between Han Xiangzi and Dragon Girl (Longnu) is a famous folktale in China and has been adapted to many television series as well as opera. It was said that one day Han Xiangzi visited the East Sea and played his flute on the shore. The 7th daughter of the Dragon King was curious to the beautiful melody and emerged from the sea. She transformed herself into a silver eel, then danced in front of the immortal boy. Upon realizing that Han Xiangzi had noticed her, the Dragon Girl transformed herself into her true shape and thus they became lovers. 

One day an old woman appeared in front of Han Xiangzi. She informed him that the Dragon King had locked away her daughter at the bottom of the ocean, because he forbade her relationship with Xiangzi. The old lady then took a magical golden bamboo (or Azure Deep Sea jade in another version ) from her bag and handed it over to Xiangzi. Actually this was a memento from the Dragon Girl for him. With a broken heart, Han Xiangzi turned the golden bamboo into a magical flute and carried it wherever he went.

The Dragon Girl has appeared in several of the television series depicting the Eight Immortals, such as: Dongyouji-Legend of the Eight Immortals (portrayed by Yvonne Lim), Eight Avatar (portrayed by Jia Qing) and Penglai Baxian (portrayed by Li Qian)

==Modern depictions==
In the television show &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot;, Han Xiangzi was shown to be the Immortal who sealed away Hsi Wu, The Sky Demon. Han Xiangzi also appeared in tv series adaption of Eight Immortals:
*Dongyouji (Legend of Eight Immortals), played by Jerry Chang.
*Eight avatar, played by Roger Kwok.
*Penglai Baxian, played by Xu Haiqiao

<doc id="221786" wikidata="Q197181" url="?curid=221786" title="Zhang Guolao">
<text>Zhang Guo, better known as Zhang Guolao, is a Chinese mythological figure and one of the Eight Immortals in the Taoist pantheon. Among the Eight Immortals, Zhang Guolao, Zhongli Quan and Lü Yan are the only ones who appear in historical records as genuine figures in society at specific times and places. His existence is said to have begun around the middle or end of the 7th century, and ended approximately in the middle of the 8th. The epithet &quot;Lao&quot; added at the end of his name means &quot;old&quot;.

==Life==
Zhang was a Taoist &quot;fangshi&quot; (translated as &quot;occultist-alchemist&quot;) who lived as a hermit on Zhongtiao Mountain (; southeast of present-day Yongji, Shanxi) in Hengzhou () during the Tang dynasty. By the time Wu Zetian came to power, he claimed to be several hundred years old. A strong believer in the magic of necromancy, he also declared that he was a Grand Minister to the mythical Emperor Yao in his previous life. Zhang also had a love for wine and winemaking. He was known to make liquor from herbs and shrubs as a hobby. Other members of the Eight Immortals drank his wine, which they believed to have healing or medicinal properties. He was also known to be a master of &quot;qigong&quot; and could go without food for days, surviving on only a few sips of wine.

Zhang was the most eccentric of the Eight Immortals, seen clearly in the style of Chinese martial arts dedicated to his memory. The style includes moves such as delivering a kick during a backflip or bending so far back that your shoulders touch the ground. He was known to be quite entertaining, often making himself invisible, drinking water from the petals of poisonous flowers, snatching birds in flight from the sky, as well as wilting flowers simply by pointing in their direction.

==Depiction in art and culture==
Zhang appears frequently in Chinese paintings and sculpture, either with the Eight Immortals or alone, and, like the other immortals, can be seen in many different common artistic mediums and everyday objects. He is typically shown riding his white donkey, usually seated facing backwards. His emblem is a fish drum, which is a tube-shaped bamboo drum with two iron rods or mallets that he carries with him, or carrying a phoenix feather or a peach, representing immortality. Since he represents old age, in the Taoist &quot;fengshui&quot; tradition, a picture or statue of him can be placed in the home or bedroom of an elderly person to help bring them a long life and a good, natural death. A picture of him on his mule offering a descendant to a newly wed couple can also be found in Taoist nuptial chapels.

==Legends==
Zhang was known for wandering between the Fen River and Qin territories during his lifetime and was known to travel at least a thousand &quot;li&quot; per day on a white donkey or mule. When his journey was finished, he folded his mule up and placed it in his pocket or a small box. When he wished to use the mule again, he poured water on it from his mouth and the mule regained its form.

The Tang dynasty emperors Taizong and Gaozong often invited Zhang to their imperial courts, but he always declined these invitations. Once, when asked by Wu Zetian, he finally agreed to leave his hermitage. As he reached the gate of the Temple of the Jealous Woman, he died suddenly. His body was seen decomposing and being consumed by worms, but he was later seen, alive and well, on Zhongtiao Mountain in Hengzhou.

In 735, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang dynasty, Zhang was called to Luoyang, where he was elected as the chief of the Imperial Academy, with the honorable title &quot;Very Perspicacious Teacher.&quot; At this time, the Taoist Ye Fashan was highly favoured in the imperial court, thanks to his skill in necromancy. When asked who Zhang Guolao was, Ye replied, &quot;I know, but if I were to tell your Majesty, I should fall dead at your feet, so I dare not speak unless your Majesty will promise that you will go barefooted and bareheaded to ask Zhang to forgive you, in which case I should immediately revive.&quot;

Having been promised by Emperor Xuanzong, Ye Fashan then said: &quot;Zhang Guolao is a white spiritual bat which came out of primeval chaos.&quot; Zhang was believed by some to be able to transform himself into a bat, another symbol of permanence. After giving this information, Ye immediately dropped dead at the emperor&#x27;s feet. Emperor Xuanzong, with bald head and feet, went to Zhang as he had promised. After the emperor begged Zhang for forgiveness for his indiscretion, Zhang then sprinkled water on Ye&#x27;s face, and he revived. Soon after, between 742 and 746, Zhang fell ill and returned to die on Zhongtiao Mountain in Hengzhou. When his apprentices opened his tomb, they found it empty.

==Modern depiction==
In the television show Jackie Chan Adventures, Zhang Guolao is the Immortal who sealed away Po Kong, The Mountain Demon. He is depicted as a white-haired old man with a long, flowing beard and a topknot.

<doc id="221788" wikidata="Q523630" url="?curid=221788" title="Steve Kerr">
<text>Stephen Douglas Kerr (born September 27, 1965) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the U.S. national team. He is known as one of the most accurate three-point shooters in NBA history and holds the record for highest career three-point percentage. Kerr is also a nine-time NBA champion, having won five titles as a player and four as head coach of the Warriors. He was named one of the 15 Greatest Coaches in NBA History.

Kerr played college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats. He was a two-time first-team all-conference player in the Pac-10 (now known as the Pac-12) and earned All-American honors as a senior in 1988. In the 1987–88 season, Kerr set the NCAA single-season three-point field goal percentage record (57.3%). Selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the 1988 NBA draft, Kerr played 15 seasons in the NBA. He won five NBA championships as a player—three with the Chicago Bulls and two with the San Antonio Spurs—and retired as the all-time NBA leader in single-season three-point shooting percentage and career three-point shooting percentage.

Following his retirement as a player, Kerr became a minority owner of the Phoenix Suns as part of a group led by Robert Sarver that purchased the team in 2004. In June 2007, Phoenix named Kerr the team&#x27;s president of basketball operations and general manager. Kerr announced he was leaving the position in June 2010. After stepping down from his post with the Suns, Kerr worked as a color commentator for &quot;NBA on TNT&quot; until 2014.

In May 2014, Kerr was named head coach of the Golden State Warriors. Under his leadership, the franchise entered the most successful period in its history, reaching the NBA Finals six times and winning four championships (in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022). The 2015–16 Warriors won an unprecedented 73 games, breaking the record for the most wins in an NBA season, which was formerly held by the 1995–96 Bulls which he also played for.

==Early life and international play==
Kerr was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to Malcolm H. Kerr, a Lebanese-born American academic, and his wife Ann Kerr (née Zwicker), a California-born academic, both of whom specialized in the Middle East. He has three siblings. His grandfather, Stanley Kerr, volunteered with the Near East Relief after the Armenian genocide and rescued women and orphans in Aleppo and Marash before eventually settling in Beirut. Kerr spent much of his childhood in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries. While in Beirut in the summer of 1983, he met a number of U.S. Marines who were later killed in the Beirut barracks bombings. Kerr attended Cairo American College in Egypt, the American Community School in Beirut, Lebanon, and Palisades High School (now Palisades Charter High School) in Los Angeles, graduating in 1983.

Malcolm Kerr was killed by members of the Islamic Jihad on January 18, 1984 at the age of 52 while he was serving as president of the American University of Beirut. He was shot twice in the back of his head by gunmen using suppressed handguns in the hallway outside his office. Steve was only 18 years old at the time, and a college freshman; regarding his father&#x27;s death, Kerr has said: &quot;Before my father was killed, my life was impenetrable. Bad things happened to other people.&quot; Ann Kerr married Kenneth Coogan Adams in December 2008, becoming Ann Kerr-Adams. Kenneth Adams died on September 12, 2017.

In the summer of 1986, Kerr was named to the U.S. national team that competed in the FIBA World Championship in Spain. The team won the title for the first time since 1954, and was the last American men&#x27;s senior squad not to feature NBA players that had won a major international tournament. Kerr suffered a knee injury during the competition.

==College career==

Minimally recruited out of high school, Kerr played basketball at the University of Arizona from 1983 to 1988. Kerr injured his knee playing in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, forcing him to miss the Wildcats&#x27; entire 1986–87 season.

During pre-game warmups at arch-rival Arizona State University in 1988, Kerr was taunted by Sun Devils fans with chants that included &quot;PLO&quot; and &quot;Where’s your father?&quot; Though tearful, Kerr led the Wildcats to victory, scoring 20 points in the first half, making all six of his three-point attempts. Arizona State athletic director Charles Harris sent a letter of apology to Kerr a few days later. Along with fellow All-American teammate Sean Elliott, Kerr helped the Wildcats reach the Final Four of the 1988 NCAA tournament. A two-time first-team All-Pac-10 selection, he also set an NCAA single-season record for 3-point percentage (57.3%, 114–199) in 1987–88. The NCAA introduced the three-point shot while he was redshirting. In his only collegiate season with the three-point shot, he established standards that formerly stood as Pac-12 records for nearly two decades: single-season three-point shots made (114; stood until Salim Stoudamire posted 120 in 2005), Pac-12 tournament run three-point field goal percentage (.750, min 5 made; Marcus Williams, .833, 2006). Kerr led the Pac-10 in free throw shooting in 1985–86 (89.9%).

Kerr graduated from the University of Arizona in 1988 with a Bachelor of General Studies, with an emphasis on history, sociology, and English.

==Professional career==

===Phoenix Suns (1988–1989)===
Kerr was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the 1988 NBA draft. He was chosen as the 50th overall pick. He averaged 2.6 points per game for the Suns in his rookie season.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (1989–1992)===
In 1989, Kerr was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for draft consideration. In more than three seasons with the Cavaliers, he set the team&#x27;s franchise single-season (.507, 1989–90) and career three-point field goal percentage (.472) records.

===Orlando Magic (1992–1993)===
In December 1992, Kerr was traded to the Orlando Magic for draft considerations. He averaged 2.6 points per game during his tenure with Orlando.

===Chicago Bulls (1993–1998)===
In 1993, Kerr signed with the Chicago Bulls. He played five seasons for the Bulls and typically came off of the bench, playing the role of three-point shooting specialist. The Bulls made the playoffs in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, but without Michael Jordan&#x27;s presence for all of 1994 and much of 1995, the team was unable to advance to the Finals. However, with Jordan back full-time for the 1995–96 season, the Bulls set a then-NBA record of 72–10 and defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Finals in six games.

In 1997, the Bulls logged a 69–13 regular-season record and reached the 1997 NBA Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz. At the end of Game 6, with the score tied at 86, Kerr took a pass from Jordan and made a 17-foot jump shot to win the championship for the Bulls. Kerr also won the Three-Point Contest at the 1997 NBA All-Star Weekend.

In the last minute of Game Two of the 1998 NBA Finals against Utah, Kerr missed a three-pointer, grabbed his own rebound, and made a pass to Jordan. Jordan made a crucial three-point play, putting the Bulls in the lead for good and helping the team tie the series at one game apiece. The Bulls went on to win the series in six games.

Kerr set the Bulls&#x27; franchise single-season (.524, 1994–95) and career three-point field goal percentage (.479) records. During his tenure with the Bulls, Kerr averaged 8.2 points per game on 50.7% shooting.

===San Antonio Spurs (1999–2001)===
In January 1999, Kerr was acquired by the San Antonio Spurs in a sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls, whereby Chuck Person and a first-round pick in the 2000 NBA draft was sent to Chicago. The Spurs reached the 1999 NBA Finals and won their first NBA Championship with a 4–1 series victory over the New York Knicks. Kerr and Frank Saul were the only two players in NBA history to have won three championships with two different teams in consecutive seasons, until Patrick McCaw, whom Kerr later coached with the Warriors, achieved the same feat in 2019.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2001–2002)===
On July 24, 2001, Kerr was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers alongside Derek Anderson in a deal that brought Steve Smith to the Spurs. Kerr would remain in Portland for the 2001–02 season, playing in 65 games and averaging 4.1 points per game.

===Return to San Antonio (2002–2003)===
On August 2, 2002, Kerr was traded back to San Antonio along with Erick Barkley and a 2003 second-round pick. In return, the Trail Blazers received Charles Smith, Amal McCaskill, and Antonio Daniels. Kerr played in nearly every game (75) the following year, which was his final season in the league. In Game 6 of the 2003 Western Conference Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, Kerr made four second-half three-pointers that helped the Spurs win the game and eliminate Dallas from the playoffs. The Spurs eventually won the NBA championship by beating the New Jersey Nets during the 2003 NBA Finals in six games.

===Retirement===
Kerr announced his retirement after the 2003 NBA Finals. During his NBA career, Kerr won five NBA championships. He retired as the league&#x27;s all-time leader in single-season three-point shooting percentage (.524 in 1994–95) and career three-point shooting percentage (.454). As of 2024, Kerr is the only NBA player to win four straight NBA titles after 1969.

==Broadcaster and commentator==
In 2003, Kerr became a broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT), offering commentary alongside analyst Marv Albert. During his tenure, Kerr performed a segment sponsored by Coors Light called &quot;Steve&#x27;s Refreshing Thoughts&quot; in which he brought up interesting facts in NBA history. This segment continued through sponsorship and became known as &quot;Steve Wonders&quot;, sponsored by Sprint. In the same time period, Kerr also contributed to Yahoo! as an NBA commentator.

Kerr has provided his voice for the in-game commentary of EA Sports video games &quot;NBA Live 06, NBA Live 07, NBA Live 08, NBA Live 09&quot; and &quot;NBA Live 10&quot; with Albert. He has also provided his voice as a color analyst for &quot;NBA 2K12&quot;, &quot;NBA 2K13&quot;, &quot;NBA 2K14&quot; and &quot;NBA 2K15&quot;. Kerr remained a commentator in &quot;NBA 2K15&quot; despite becoming the Golden State Warriors coach for the 2014–15 season several months prior to the game&#x27;s release. His commentary also appears during All-Star play in the seventh gen port of &quot;NBA 2K16&quot;.

Kerr left broadcasting in 2007 to become general manager for the Phoenix Suns, but it was confirmed on June 28, 2010, that he would return as an NBA analyst for TNT starting with the 2010–11 NBA season. In 2011, he also called the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship on Turner Sports and CBS, teaming up with lead broadcasters Jim Nantz and Clark Kellogg for the First Four and Final Four games, and with Albert in other rounds. Kerr was also a regular contributor to the website &quot;Grantland&quot; from 2011 until it closed in 2015.

In 2023, Kerr portrayed a cartoon version of himself on the animated series &quot;Clone High,&quot; where he was the judge of a fictitious reality show called Tropical Hospital.

==Executive career==

===Phoenix Suns (2004–2010)===
On April 15, 2004, Kerr was announced as a member of a potential group of buyers that would acquire his old team, the Phoenix Suns, from Jerry Colangelo for $300 million. Kerr became part of Suns management, acting as a consultant. During the 2006 NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the San Antonio team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.

On June 2, 2007, Kerr announced that he would become the general manager of the Phoenix Suns beginning with the 2007–08 season. In 2008, the Suns traded forward Shawn Marion and guard Marcus Banks to the Miami Heat in exchange for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. The Suns were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games in the first round of the playoffs. On December 10, 2008, Kerr continued to remake the Suns roster by trading Boris Diaw, Raja Bell, and Sean Singletary to the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Jason Richardson, Jared Dudley, and the Bobcats&#x27; 2010 second-round draft pick, which was used to draft Gani Lawal of Georgia Tech. On June 25, 2009, he traded O&#x27;Neal to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ben Wallace, Sasha Pavlovic, a future second-round draft pick and cash.

On May 5, 2010, the Suns wore their &quot;Noche Latina&quot; &quot;Los Suns&quot; jerseys in Game 2 against the Spurs to be united against the controversial Arizona immigration law. Kerr himself compared the law to Nazi Germany.

In 2010, Kerr left the Suns as president of basketball operations and general manager. He continued to own less than one percent of the Suns&#x27; organization until 2014, when he decided to coach the Golden State Warriors.

==Coaching career==

===Golden State Warriors (2014–present)===
====2014-15 season: Emergence of Stephen Curry and the beginning of a dynasty====
On May 14, 2014, Kerr reached an agreement to become the head coach for the Golden State Warriors, succeeding Mark Jackson in a five-year, $25 million deal. Kerr coached in the 2014 Summer League for the Warriors. During the 2014–15 season, the team&#x27;s offense employed elements of the triangle offense from his playing days in Chicago under Phil Jackson, the spacing and pace of Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, and the uptempo principles Mike D&#x27;Antoni and later Alvin Gentry used in Phoenix when Kerr was the general manager.

After the Warriors beat the Houston Rockets to win their 14th consecutive game, Kerr became the first coach to start his career with a 19–2 record. This beat out Al Cervi and his 18–2 start with the Syracuse Nationals. On December 10, 2014, Kerr became the first NBA rookie head coach to win 21 of his first 23 games. He was named the head coach of the Western Conference team for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game after the Warriors had the best record in the conference. On April 4, the Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks 123–110 to clinch home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, and Kerr got his 63rd win of the season to become the highest winning rookie head coach in NBA history, passing Tom Thibodeau and his 62 wins with the Chicago Bulls in the 2010–11 season. In the NBA Coach of the Year voting, Kerr was the runner-up to Mike Budenholzer.

The Warriors ultimately finished with one of the best regular seasons in NBA history, and the greatest in the team&#x27;s 69-year history. They ended with an overall record of 67–15, becoming the 10th team to win 67 or more games in a single season and point guard Stephen Curry won his first of two consecutive regular season MVP awards. It was the first time the Warriors had ever won as many as 60 games in a season; their previous high was 59 in the 1975–76 season. They also ended with a 39–2 home record, which is tied for the second-best home record in NBA history. The Warriors were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving–led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. The Warriors became the first team in NBA history to have two win streaks over 15 at home (18 and 19).

In the opening round of the playoffs against the New Orleans Pelicans, Kerr led the Warriors to their first four-game playoff sweep since the 1975 NBA Finals. Afterwards, the team beat the Memphis Grizzlies (4–2, in the second round). Down 2–1 in the series, Kerr made an unconventional adjustment in Game 4 to leave the Grizzlies&#x27; Tony Allen open and have his defender, center Andrew Bogut, guard the interior. Kerr&#x27;s strategy was lauded after Allen, Memphis&#x27; best wing defender but a poor jump-shooter, was benched and limited to 16 minutes after missing wide open shots. The Warriors then defeated the Houston Rockets (4–1, in the Western Conference finals), making the NBA Finals for the first time in 40 years.

The Warriors faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 NBA Finals. Kerr and coach David Blatt were both in their first season as NBA head coaches, and this was the first time a pair of rookie head coaches faced each other in the NBA Finals since the NBA&#x27;s first year of existence, in 1947 with Eddie Gottlieb of the Philadelphia Warriors and Harold Olsen of the Chicago Stags competing. After the Warriors went down 2–1 to Cleveland, Kerr started swingman Andre Iguodala in place of Bogut, jump-starting their stagnant offense for a 103–82 road victory that evened the series. It was Iguodala&#x27;s first start of the season, and the small unit came to be known as the Death Lineup. After the game, Kerr admitted to lying to the press in response to pregame questions about potential changes to his starting lineup. The Warriors went on to win the championship in six games, defeating the Cavaliers, giving Kerr his sixth championship and his first as a head coach.

====2015–16: Several-month absence amid historic season====
After the first two days of the defending champion Warriors&#x27; training camp, Kerr took an indefinite leave of absence to rehabilitate his back, which had caused problems since the 2015 NBA Finals. Around this time, assistant coach Luke Walton assumed Kerr&#x27;s coaching duties. Kerr missed all of 2015 and most of January 2016, although technically the NBA credited Walton&#x27;s win–loss record to Kerr. Kerr said &quot;I think it&#x27;s ridiculous&quot;, when asked about getting all of Walton&#x27;s wins. On January 22, 2016, Kerr returned to coaching after missing 43 games, but warned he might need to miss games occasionally if there was a recurrence of the headaches and pain related to the spinal fluid leak that sidelined him. The Warriors went 39–4 with interim coach Luke Walton. The Warriors went 34–5 after Kerr returned to coaching, and the team broke the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls 72–10 record by winning 73 games. For his record-breaking season, Stephen Curry was named the league&#x27;s first ever unanimous MVP in history, becoming the 11th player in history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004–05 and 2005–06. His scoring average increase of 6.3 is the largest ever by a reigning MVP. Kerr became the first person in NBA history to be a part of 70-win teams as a player and head coach and was named 2015–16 NBA Coach of the Year. Kerr led the Warriors to the 2016 NBA Finals, where they would again face the Cleveland Cavaliers, but the Warriors lost in seven games despite a 3–1 lead.

====2016–19: Arrival of Kevin Durant, back to back championships====
On July 4, 2016, Golden State had made a landmark acquisition, signing free agent and 7-time NBA All-Star Kevin Durant and the Warriors were immediately hailed as a &quot;superteam&quot; by the media and fans, forming a new All-Star &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; of Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. On November 20, 2016, the NBA announced that Kerr had been fined $25,000 for public criticism of officiating during a radio interview with KNBR 680 three days prior. The Warriors broke over 20 NBA records on their way to equaling their 2014–15 regular-season record of , their second most wins in franchise history.

He missed time during the 2017 playoffs due to recurring back issues. Associate head coach Mike Brown acted as acting head coach during periods of Kerr&#x27;s absence, and Brown continued head coaching into the playoffs leading the Warriors to a 13–0 record in the postseason. Kerr returned in Game 2 of the 2017 NBA Finals, where the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history. Kerr is the fourth coach in NBA history to win two championships in his first three seasons of coaching. He won his third championship as a head coach when the Warriors swept the Cleveland Cavaliers in four games during the 2018 NBA Finals to give Kerr his eighth championship of his career. The Warriors reached their fifth straight Finals under Kerr in 2019, but were defeated by the Toronto Raptors in six games. During Game 5, starting power forward Kevin Durant tore his Achilles, and in Game 6, starting shooting guard Klay Thompson tore his ACL.

====2019–present: Injury-plagued season before a return to the promise land====
During the 2019–20 season, with Thompson out for the year and franchise point guard Stephen Curry only playing five games due to a hand injury, the Warriors finished with the worst record (15–50) in the league. It marked the first time in Kerr&#x27;s coaching career that he had missed the playoffs. In 2020–21, with Thompson still out due to an Achilles tear but Curry healthy, the Warriors qualified for the newly implemented play-in tournament, but ultimately did not qualify for the playoffs for the second straight season. The Warriors returned to the playoffs in 2021–22 and reached the 2022 NBA Finals. They defeated the Boston Celtics in six games, giving Kerr his fourth championship as a head coach and his ninth championship overall.

In the 2022–23 season, Kerr and the Warriors reached the Western Conference Semifinals, where they were defeated in six games by the Los Angeles Lakers.

===United States national team===
Kerr was an assistant coach on the gold medal-winning 2020 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team. In December 2021, he was named head coach of the U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team. In 2023, Kerr led the United States team to a disappointing fourth place finish at the FIBA World Cup as the U.S. failed to win a medal for the second consecutive tournament after an overtime loss to Canada in the bronze medal game, 127–118. Despite finishing fourth at the 2023 FIBA World Cup, it was the first U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team to lose three games at the World Cup or Olympics since 2004. 
====2024 Summer Olympics====
At the 2024 Summer Olympic Men&#x27;s Basketball Tournament, Kerr coached the US Team to its fifth consecutive gold medal at Paris&#x27; Bercy Arena in a win over host country France. This was a reprise of the win over the French Team at the Tokyo Olympics. 

===Legacy===
Kerr is the first head coach in NBA history to lead his team to 67 or more wins in three consecutive seasons. Kerr was named one of the Top 15 Coaches in NBA History in 2022, when the league commemorated its 75th anniversary.

== Personal life ==
Kerr married Margot Brennan, his college sweetheart, in 1990. They have three children. He is a keen soccer fan and an avid supporter of Liverpool. In 2023, Kerr bought a minority stake in club Mallorca.

=== Political views and activism ===
Prior to and following the 2016 United States presidential election, Kerr has been publicly critical of Donald Trump. In an interview following that election, he voiced the opinion that Trump&#x27;s rise to power was based on insults against women and minorities. He compared Trump&#x27;s campaign performances and the crude responses of his supporters to the sensationalism of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;. Kerr made clear his &quot;disgust&quot; with Trump&#x27;s disrespectful public discourse and disappointment with Trump&#x27;s leadership of the country. On October 27, 2020, an ad created by the anti-Trump Republican Lincoln Project Super PAC was first broadcast. In it, along with Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers, Kerr endorsed Joe Biden for president in the November presidential election. In the advertisement, he said, &quot;I stand for truth over lies&quot;, &quot;categorically reject white supremacy&quot;, and &quot;believe a presidency should be transparent.&quot;
Kerr has been a strong supporter of gun control, expressing criticism with the government&#x27;s response to school shootings. On May 24, 2022, during a press conference for Game 4 of the NBA&#x27;s 2022 Western Conference finals after that day&#x27;s Robb Elementary School shooting in Texas where 19 children and two teachers were murdered by a gunman wielding semi-automatic weapons, Kerr reiterated these points emotionally. He said, regarding the filibuster, that Republicans in the U.S. Senate were &quot;holding us hostage&quot;, by using it to prevent a vote on gun control legislation.

Kerr has voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movements across the United States, praising the efforts of peaceful protests and hopes that more people will take action to stand up to systemic racial injustice to black people.

Kerr spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention on August 19, 2024.

<text>Zhongli Quan, courtesy name Jidao, is a Chinese mythological figure and one of the Eight Immortals in the Taoist pantheon. He is also known as Han Zhongli because he was said to have been born in the Han dynasty. In legend, he holds a peach and wields a large feather fan which can resurrect the dead and transform stones into silver or gold.

==Life==
Zhongli was born in Yanjing. According to legend, bright beams of light filled the labour room during his birth. After he was born, he did not stop crying until seven full days had passed. He was destined for greatness from the day he was born by showing features such as a broad forehead, thick ears, long eyebrows, deep eyes, red nose, square mouth, high cheeks, and scarlet lips. Stories depict that either seven days or seven years later, he began to speak, and the first sentence he uttered was, &quot;my feet have wandered in the purple palace of the [immortals], my name is recorded in the capital of the jade emperor.&quot; Later Taoists celebrate his birthday on the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the Chinese calendar. Following his father&#x27;s example, he became a member of the court, advancing to be general of one of the armies of the Han dynasty. During his time as a general, his army fought against Tibet. In his last battle he was beaten by the Tibetans, forcing him to flee into the mountainous areas surrounding him. There he came across an old man who led him to a spiritual sanctuary where he was welcomed in and told that he could stay as long as was needed. There he learned the ways of the immortal rituals and extensive amounts of alchemy. After three hard days of teaching, he was dismissed and told to use his newfound powers to serve his people. When he turned back to talk to the man, he and his home had vanished. Using his power of alchemy and his magical fan, he created silver and gold coins from stones and saved people from poverty and famine.

There are two stories that depict how he became one of the immortals. In the first, it was in his continuous use of the immortal powers and his magical fan that eventually caused his descent into the shimmering cloud of the immortals. In the second, he was meditating near a wall of his hermitage when all of a sudden it collapsed. Behind the wall was a jade vessel that took him as an immortal to the shimmering cloud.

In Taoism, he is known as &quot;Zhengyang Zushi&quot; (), literally &quot;True-Yang Ancestor-Master&quot;. He is also called &quot;Master of the Cloud-Chamber&quot; () in accounts describing his encounter with Lü Dongbin before achieving immortality.

==Depiction==
Usually depicted with his chest and belly bare and holding a fan made of feathers or horse hair, Zhongli is often set apart from the other immortals in pictures by wisps of hair on his temples and a beard down to his navel. He is known for his pleasing disposition, and is often painted or drawn drinking wine.

He is regularly venerated as the &quot;patron of silversmiths&quot;.

==Modern depiction==
In the television show &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot;, Zhongli was eventually revealed to be the Immortal who sealed away Xiao Fung, The Wind Demon, even though he was initially depicted as having sealed away Dai Gui, The Earth Demon.

<text>The Faculty of Law is one of the professional graduate schools of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is the oldest law school in Canada. 180 candidates are admitted for any given academic year. For the year 2021 class, the acceptance rate was 10%.

Notable alumni include Prime Ministers John Abbott and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, thirteen Justices of the Supreme Court (Including the most recent appointments, Mahmud Jamal and Nicholas Kasirer), as well as Members of Parliament. Marc Miller, a member of the current Cabinet of Canada, is a graduate from the Faculty.

== Academics ==

=== Bachelor of Civil Law and Juris Doctor program ===
The McGill Faculty of Law offers a unique combined Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) and Juris Doctor (JD) program. The BCL/JD program emphasizes a transsystemic and polyjural approach that integrates common law and civil law, sometimes within a single class. More recently, the Faculty has incorporated Indigenous law into its curriculum in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission&#x27;s recommendations for Canadian law schools.

In 2016, the Faculty reviewed its curriculum and added Integration Week: an introductory week of group work and lectures for first-year students. They also added two Focus Weeks—one in fall and one in winter—that allow students to take intensive one-week courses. In winter 2023, the first student seminar on Abolitionist practices and Transformative Justice was launched.

The duration of BCL/JD program is somewhat flexible: the program can be completed in 3, 3.5, or 4 years. Students who opt for a minor, major, or honours program generally require 4 years to complete their degree. Majors are offered in International Human Rights and Development and in Commercial Negotiation and Dispute Resolution.

The Faculty of Law, in collaboration with the Desautels Faculty of Management and the Faculty of Art&#x27;s School of Social Work, offers joint programs that combine the BCL/JD program with either a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or a Master of Social Work (MSW). A joint program takes 4 to 5 years to complete.

The Faculty of Law&#x27;s Admissions Office has an acceptance rate of 15.9%.

=== Master of Laws (LLM) ===
The Faculty offers four LLM programs for students: one general LLM program, and three specialized LLM programs in Air and Space Law, Environment, and Bioethics. 
Except for the LLM Bioethics program, all programs have thesis and non-thesis options. The non-thesis Master&#x27;s of Law option prioritizes course work and can be completed in twelve months. The thesis option prioritizes research; it can be completed in sixteen to twenty-four months. 
Student in the LLM Bioethics program write a thesis.

=== Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) ===
The Faculty offers three DCL programs in General Law, Comparative Law, and Air and Space Law. Students generally complete the DCL program in 3 to 4 years.

=== Graduate Certificates ===
The Faculty offers graduate certificates in Comparative Law and in Air and Space Law. Graduate certificates are awarded upon completing a set number of credits. Certificates are based on coursework, and no thesis is required.

== History ==
The Faculty of Law was officially created in 1853, after a petition signed by young men studying law in Montreal was made to McGill in 1848. With the incoming class of 1969, the Faculty added a stand-alone common law degree, suitable to the practice of law in other Canadian provinces, which could be taken individually or jointly with the traditional Civil Law curriculum. The joint degree was then referred to as the National Programme, and taught common law and civil law in separate courses, but combined their study in a year-long introductory &quot;Foundations&quot; course and in some upper-year seminars. In 1951, McGill inaugurated its first post-graduate law program with the creation of its Institute of Air &amp; Space Law. The institute was founded by John Cobb Cooper, who had served as a senior official in Pan American World Airways, and the International Air Transport Association. Canada&#x27;s only United Nations organ, the International Civil Aviation Organization, is also headquartered in Montreal.

With the incoming class of 1999, the Faculty eliminated its civil, common, and national programs, and replaced them with a single program, which includes some mandatory first-year courses and some upper-year courses which integrate both common and civil law. This joint and bilingual degree, which all students must take, is now referred to as the transsystemic program. This program underwent slight revisions during a curriculum renewal unrolled in 2016. Under the newly revised program, criminal and property law are taught differently; incoming students also undergo two &quot;integration weeks&quot; (one in the fall and winter).

The Transsystemic program was created under the direction of former Dean Stephen Toope, whereby every student graduates with degrees in both civil law and common law. This means that, from the first year, courses now explore civil and common law concepts in close comparison. Students analyse and critically evaluate the two traditions, their histories, and their social, political, and cultural contexts. Undergraduate students may participate in international exchange programs, and in the International Courts and Tribunals Program, which in 2006 received a Scotiabank-AUCC Award for Excellence in Internationalization.

Since 1976, the Faculty of Law&#x27;s Institute of Air and Space Law, has annually published the first and only bilingual journal in the field of air and space law, the Annals of Air and Space Law. Other Faculty of Law bilingual publications include the McGill Law Journal and the McGill Journal of Sustainable Development Law.

== The Buildings ==
Old Chancellor Day Hall and New Chancellor Day Hall are the names of two joined buildings at McGill University&#x27;s downtown campus that house the Faculty of Law. Old Chancellor Day Hall was designed by noted architect Bruce Price for businessman James Ross. New Chancellor Day Hall was completed in 1967 by architecture firm Bland, Lemoyne, Edwards, and Shine. The Old and New Chancellor Day buildings are connected by an underground passage and by an atrium, which also connects to the Nahum Gelber Law Library.
Today, Old Chancellor Day Hall is used for administrative and faculty offices. New Chancellor Day Hall includes all classrooms, a moot court room, student spaces, law student services, and administrative and faculty offices.

=== Old Chancellor Day Hall ===
In 1892, Canadian civil engineer, businessman, and philanthropist James Ross hired architect Bruce Price (whose other masterworks included Windsor Station and Château Frontenac) to design a château-style mansion in Montreal&#x27;s Golden Square Mile, on Peel Street. Built largely of yellow sandstone from New Brunswick, the James Ross House was one of the most expensive private homes built in Canada during the nineteenth century. The house was a social centre for the Golden Square Mile.

His son John Kenneth Leveson Ross, a noted bon vivant and sportsman, inherited both the house and the Ross fortune. In the 1919, J.K.L. Ross hired architects Trowbridge and Livingstone to undertake $600,000 of renovations that affected every room in the house. The renovation included adding a private bathroom to each bedroom, covering up a skylight, and putting in windows to create a library/reading room in what is now the Common Room. John Ross declared bankruptcy in 1928, and the James Ross House was sold at auction in 1929 for a mere $51,000. The mansion was subsequently purchased by J.W. McConnell in 1948 as a gift to McGill University.

While the university may have initially planned to use it for a student residence, the Faculty of Law officially moved into the mansion in a ceremony attended by many members of the judiciary and the Montreal Bar on 9 February 1950. At the ceremony, McGill&#x27;s Chancellor, Orville S. Tyndale, declared on behalf of the Board of Governors that the mansion would be named Chancellor Day Hall in honour of McGill&#x27;s first Chancellor, Charles Dewey Day. The opening ceremony was held in the students&#x27; handsomely furnished common room, a gift from Maurice Pollack.

On 9 July 2014, Old Chancellor Day Hall closed for 14 months for renovations to upgrade the building&#x27;s heating, electrical systems, plumbing, windows, and more. Thirty-four staff and faculty members were relocated to New Chancellor Day Hall and to temporary offices on McGill College Avenue.

In December 2017, representatives of the Clan Ross Association of Canada and members of the Faculty of Law unveiled a plaque commemorating James Ross. The plaque is located near the main entrance.

=== New Chancellor Day Hall ===
New Chancellor Day Hall was built in 1967 to address the Faculty of Law&#x27;s growing program and increased enrolment. 
A six-storey precast concrete tower designed by architectural firm Bland, Lemoyne, Edwards, and Shine was erected just west of Chancellor Day Hall and connected to it by a corridor, at the cost of $1.825 million. This extension was named New Chancellor Day Hall and blended with the adjacent Stewart Biological Sciences Building. New Chancellor Day Hall included additional classrooms, study spaces, and a moot court. Prior to the construction of the Gelber Law Library, the top floors of New Chancellor Day Hall housed the library.

The building was inaugurated on 21 January 1967. During the bilingual ceremony, the Faculty of Law awarded seven honorary degrees, including degrees to Chief Justice Robert Taschereau of Canada, Chief Justice Earl Warren of the United States, and Lord Denning of Great Britain. 
Following the inauguration of the Gelber Law Library in 1998, the empty floors of New Chancellor Day that had previously been used as the library were used by McGill University to house various small research units attached to different faculties. In 2005, all student services at the Faculty of Law were consolidated on the fourth floor of New Chancellor Day Hall.

From 2008 to 2009, New Chancellor Day Hall underwent major renovations. The project overhauled the third, fifth, and sixth floors. New architectural features included adding a massive skylight above a staircase between the fifth and sixth floors, piercing windows on the sixth floor, and creating partially frosted glass partitions between offices to allow natural light inside interior offices. The third floor is devoted to student spaces – accommodating a multimedia classroom with movable walls and a seminar room. The third floor is also home to multiple student clubs, student-run law journals, and the graduate students&#x27; lounge. The fifth and sixth floors feature a conference room, and house some of the Faculty&#x27;s research units, as well as offices for professors, staff, graduate students, and visiting scholars.

=== Nahum Gelber Law Library ===
The Nahum Gelber Law Library is one of the 13 branches of the McGill University Library and houses over 220,000 volumes of statutes, regulations, law reports, treatises, books, journals and other legal material. Designed by Dan Hanganu, the Nahum Gelber Law Library was inaugurated September 1998. The building was designed to link to New and Old Chancellor Day Halls via a two-level atrium for socializing and studying.

The Gelber Library is home to the Wainwright Collection, which was established in 1958 with the acquisition of several hundred volumes dedicated to the history of French law. The collection is primarily composed of early French jurists on general civil law before the Codification of 1804 and was the personal library of French legal historian François Olivier-Martin. Over the years, the Wainwright fund has allowed the Library to expand the collection beyond the classic vision of civil law, centred on France, to reflect the global influence of civil law across languages and continents. Today, the collection consists of 800 works comprising 1200 volumes and is conserved in controlled atmospheric conditions in the Peter M. Laing Room, located on the second floor of the Gelber Law Library.

== Reputation ==
Graduates of the Faculty consistently account for one quarter of Canada&#x27;s Supreme Court clerkships, more than any law school in Canada. One of the small number of elite law schools internationally that may submit International Court of Justice (ICJ) clerkship applications, it also consistently places graduates at the ICJ, and has a better placement record than any other Canadian law school.

Its flagship law review, the &quot;McGill Law Journal&quot;, is the most cited law faculty review by Canada&#x27;s Supreme Court, and was ranked the best overall student-run law journal in the world outside of the United States. It also publishes the &quot;Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation&quot;, the standard reference work for almost all Canadian law reviews, Canadian law schools, and courts.

The McGill University Faculty of Law has consistently placed as the top ranking law school in Canada and has the highest acceptance requirements. The alumni from McGill University&#x27;s law school consist of a diverse group of distinguished leaders on a global scale. It has historically placed in the top ~20 law schools globally on multiple ranking systems. It was recently ranked the 22nd best law school worldwide in the 2019 QS World Ranking. It was ranked the 16th best law school in the world in the 2021 Times Higher Education World Rankings, marking consistent showings for McGill in the top 20 worldwide in the ranking. For the 2023 ranking, the Times Higher Education ranked the Faculty the 17th best law school in the world.

In 2023, the McGill University Faculty of Law had a 97.3% bar pass rate, the best rate in Quebec.

== Controversies ==
In 2018, the Faculty, along with the McGill Office for Students with Disabilities, were sued by a blind law student who alleged that he was systematically denied access to accommodation measures. His lawsuit was covered by local and national media outlets.

After dissatisfaction with McGill University&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and a continued pattern of overriding or limited Faculty decision-making, the full-time professors at the Faculty of Law formed the Association of McGill Professors of Law (AMPL) and filed for certification with Quebec&#x27;s Tribunal administratif du travail on November 7, 2021. McGill disputed the right of the union to be certified but lost before the Tribunal on November 8, 2022. The parties immediately commenced negotiations over a collective agreement. Because McGill University failed to negotiate in good faith, AMPL members conducted a one day strike on February 13, 2024 to advance negotiations. The University continued to delay negotiations and failed to advance counterproposals forcing AMPL to call an unlimited strike, which began on April 24, 2024.

Soon after the strike began, McGill University&#x27;s Provost and Executive Vice-President, Christopher Manfredi, in a private email to McGill&#x27;s President and Vice-Chancellor, Deep Saini and Law Dean, Robert Leckey, on which he inadvertently included a law student and journalist, questioned the ability of McGill law students to read, concluding “I’m a bit worried about the people we’re sending into the legal profession.” Manfredi was concerned that McGill Law Students were strongly siding with AMPL during the strike. While Manfredi apologized to students, neither Saini nor Leckey distanced themselves from Manfredi&#x27;s original comments.

After failing to negotiate with the union for over five weeks, McGill announced it would hold graduation ceremonies for students normally completing their studies in Winter 2024 even though those students had no grades and their graduation status had not been conferred in accordance with University regulations. The provincial law societies are allowing students to write their bar exams but those students will not be eligible to become lawyers until McGill submits final grades, something it cannot do while its professors are on strike.

The union suspended the strike on June 20 with McGill having promised negotiating dates in August. Rather than negotiate, McGill called on the Quebec Minister of Labor, Jean Boulet, to impose arbitration. When he did, McGill refused to negotiate further with the union. As a result, the union returned to strike on August 26, 2024.

On August 30, 2024 the Quebec Labor Tribunal ruled that McGill, Provost Christopher Manfredi, Vice-President Fabrice Labeau, and Dean Robert Leckey had prima facie violated the Quebec Labor Code by writing to union members directly to criticize the union. The Labour Tribunal ordered McGill to cease this violation, to obtain the consent of the union before any further communications, and to post the order against McGill so that employees can see it.

== Student life ==

=== Law Student Association ===
The overarching student organization is the Law Student&#x27;s Association (LSA): an elected group of law students who represent the student body. The LSA was created in 1912 and incorporated in 1992. The executives and representatives of the LSA are elected by McGill&#x27;s law students.

During the school year, the LSA hosts a weekly coffeehouse on Thursday evenings designed to encourage students to network and socialize over food and drink. The coffeehouse tradition was started in 1989 by David Lametti when he was part of the LSA. Some coffeehouse events are sponsored by law firms for networking with students, while others are hosted by student associations and clubs.

=== Christie Bike Ride ===
The Dugald Christie Memorial Community Bike Ride, also called the Christie Bike Ride, is an annual charity fundraiser organized by McGill Law students. Funds are distributed to local organizations that increase access to justice, especially for marginalized communities. Past recipients of the funds include Project Genesis, Head and Hands, and the Native Women&#x27;s Shelter of Montreal.

The Christie Bike Ride was started in 2009 in honour of alumnus Dugald Christie. Christie was a Vancouver-based lawyer that championed access to justice for low-income communities. He was killed while cycling from Vancouver to Ottawa to raise awareness about access to justice.

=== Journals ===

==== McGill Law Journal ====
The McGill Law Journal (MLJ) was founded by Gerald Le Dain and Jacques-Yvan Morin in 1952. The MLJ publishes four volumes a year on general law topics. The MLJ is frequently cited by the Supreme Court of Canada and is the most cited student-run law journal by the Court.

The McGill Law Journal also publishes the Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation. The original Guide was published in 1986 and was intended to standardize Canadian legal citations. Today, the Guide is used by most Canadian legal journals. The McGill Law Journal regularly hosts office hours to assist McGill students using the Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation.

==== McGill Journal of Sustainable Development Law ====
The McGill Journal of Sustainable Development Law (MJSDL) was established in 2004 and focuses on sustainable development and environmental law and policy. It is peer-reviewed and published bi-annually.

==== McGill Journal of Law and Health ====
The McGill Journal of Law and Health (MJLH) was established in 2007. It is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal and is published annually. The MJLH focuses on health law and has been cited four times by the Supreme Court of Canada. Most recently, an article from the journal was cited in the Reference Re Assisted Human Reproduction Act.

==== McGill Journal of Dispute Resolution ====
The McGill Journal of Dispute Resolution (MJDR) is a bilingual peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to scholarship in the fields of arbitration, mediation, facilitation, negotiation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The McGill Journal of Dispute Resolution was first published in 2015.

=== Legal Information Clinic at McGill ===
The Legal Information Clinic at McGill is a non-profit legal information clinic for McGill students and the Montreal community. The Legal Information Clinic is a separate entity from McGill but is run by McGill law students. Originally founded in 1973 by then-law student Michael Bergman, the Clinic works on more than 2,000 cases a year.

The Clinic also provides a student advocacy service for McGill students accused of disciplinary offences or looking to resolve disputes with McGill University.

=== Quid Novi ===
Quid Novi, also known colloquially as the Quid, is the Faculty of Law&#x27;s student-run newspaper. Since the publication of its first edition in March 1981, Quid Novi has been a forum for both students and faculty to share news and opinions on both legal and non-legal matters. Quid Novi is published on a weekly basis during the academic year.

=== L.E.X. Outreach Program ===
The Faculty of Law of McGill University founded the Law-Éducation-Connexion Outreach Program, also called the L.E.X. Outreach Program, in 2006. The program has law student volunteers deliver presentations at local schools and answer student questions. The program targets youth in communities that are traditionally underrepresented in the legal field and schools that have high dropout rates, with the goal of encouraging an interest in post-secondary education and legal studies. In 2009, the program was expanded following a donation from the Beaverbrook Canadian Foundation.

<text>Security for costs is a common law legal concept of application only in costs jurisdictions, and is an order sought from a court in litigation.

The general rule in costs jurisdiction is that &quot;costs follow the event&quot;. In other words, the loser in legal proceedings must pay the legal costs of the successful party. Where a defendant has a reasonable apprehension that its legal costs will not be paid for by the plaintiff if the defendant is successful, the defendant can apply to the court for an order that the plaintiff provide security for costs. Furthermore, the amount that is ordered by the Judge is in direct correlation to the strength or weakness of the plaintiff&#x27;s case brought herewith. The weaker the probability of the plaintiff prevailing, the higher the security order.

The concept of security for costs derives from the Roman law principle of &quot;cautio iudicatum solvi&quot; (Latin, transl. &quot;A bond for payment of the judgment&quot;).

Often, security for costs rules will apply differently depending on whether the claimant is outside of the jurisdiction of the court: the law of security for costs recognises that orders of the court relating to payment of a party&#x27;s legal costs can be very difficult to enforce in non-common law jurisdictions, and so will order security to be provided. Security can also be ordered where a plaintiff is insolvent, or prone to vexatious litigation.

Security is usually provided in the form of a bank cheque paid into the court, or held in a trust account operated jointly by both the plaintiff&#x27;s and defendant&#x27;s lawyers.

If the defendant is successful, the money can be applied against the costs order. If the claimant is successful, the security is returned to the claimant.

== In England and Wales ==

In England and Wales, the rules for security for costs are contained in part 25 of the Civil Procedure Rules. Courts can grant security for costs for defendants (or cross-claimants, additional parties etc.) in England when the court &quot;is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order&quot; &quot;and&quot; there is either a specific statutory rule governing it or one of five specified conditions is true of the claimant (or party the order is sought against) when they:

# are not in the jursidiction, and not in a country that is a signatory to the 2005 Hague Convention
# &quot;are a company or other body (whether incorporated inside or outside Great Britain) and there is reason to believe that it will be unable to pay the defendant&#x27;s costs if ordered to do so&quot;
# have changed their address to avoid consequences of the litigation
# have either failed to provide an address or provided an incorrect one on the claim form
# are acting as a nominal claimant on behalf of someone else, and they are unlikely to be able to satisfy the costs
# they have taken steps in relation to their assets (e.g. hiding them) to prevent them from being recovered

Satisfying one (or more) of these pre-conditions is not enough. As stated, the court has to decide that it is &quot;just to make such an order&quot;—the power to grant security for costs is discretionary.

<text>Deng Yingchao (; 4 February 1904 – 11 July 1992) was the Chairwoman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference from 1983 to 1988, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and the wife of the first Chinese Premier, Zhou Enlai.

==Early life==
With ancestry in Guangshan County (), Henan, she was born Deng Wenshu () in Nanning, Guangxi. Growing up in a poverty-stricken family, her father died when she was at a young age and her single mother taught and practiced medicine. Deng studied at Beiyang Women&#x27;s Normal School. Deng participated as a team leader in the May Fourth Movement, where she met Zhou Enlai in 1919. They married on 8 August 1925 in Guangzhou. Deng joined the Communist Youth League of China (CYL) in 1924 and became a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1925. After the White Terror massacres in 1927, Deng worked underground in Shanghai for five years.

==Chinese Civil War==
Deng was one of the few women to survive the Long March. However, during the Long March she developed pulmonary tuberculosis.
After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Deng Yingchao, as the only female representative of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the first Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing. In March 1947, she has served as a member of the Rear Working Committee of the CCP Central Committee and acting secretary of the Women&#x27;s Committee of the CCP Central Committee. She was elected to serve on the Executive Council of the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation in 1948 and 1953. In June 1949, she was elected as a member of the Preparatory Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference and became a member of the drafting group of the &quot;Common Program&quot;. Later, entrusted by Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, she personally went to Shanghai and invited Soong Ching Ling to Beijing to participate in the preparation of the Central People&#x27;s Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
When the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded, Deng Yingchao was elected to the National Women&#x27;s first to the third vice chairman, honorary chairman of the Fourth; Chinese People&#x27;s Conseil national children&#x27;s vice chairman. Since the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Deng Yingchao has been a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but has never held a government position. It was not until the death of her husband Zhou Enlai in 1976 that she returned to the political arena of the Communist Party. In December of that year, at the third meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fourth National People&#x27;s Congress, she was added as the vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress.

In March 1978, after being re-elected as the vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People&#x27;s Congress, Deng Yingchao served as the second secretary of the newly restored CCP Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection at the third plenary session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party that year. Co-opted as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.

Soon thereafter, Deng Yingchao used her early contacts and contacts with the Kuomintang, as well as her network and reputation in the United Front work, to fully take charge of the work of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Taiwan, and concurrently served as the leader of the newly established &quot;Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs&quot;. In 1982, she served as Honorary Chairwoman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. From June 1983 to March 1988, she served as Chairwoman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

In September 1985, Deng Yingchao voluntarily applied for resignation as a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; and in April 1988, after the expiration of the term of the chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, she resigned and recuperated.

In 1987, she served as Honorary Chairwoman of China Population Welfare Foundation. On the same year, when party hard-liners ousted the party&#x27;s General Secretary, Hu Yaobang, in a campaign against &quot;bourgeois liberalism,&quot; it published a 25-year-old speech by Deng. In June 1989, during the Tiananmen Square protests, she supported the leadership&#x27;s decision to violently suppress the protests.

In October 1990, she resigned as honorary president of the Chinese Nursing Association, due to poor health. In 1991 she served as Honorary Chairwoman of China Society for People&#x27;s Friendships Studies.

== Political positions ==
Deng promoted the abolition of foot binding imposed on women.

During the Land Reform Movement, Deng emphasized the need to mobilize peasant women to further the agrarian revolution. In a 1947 policy meeting on land reform, she stated that &quot;women function as great mobilizers when they speak bitterness.&quot;

==Personal life==
Deng and Zhou had no children of their own. However, they adopted several orphans of &quot;revolutionary martyrs&quot;, including Li Peng, who later became the Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Death and legacy ==

After retiring, Deng Yingchao&#x27;s body gradually weakened; especially in 1990, she was admitted to the hospital five times because of colds and pneumonia; in August 1991, she began to suffer from renal failure and became unconscious several times.

At 6:55 am on July 11, 1992, Deng Yingchao died in Beijing Hospital at the age of 88. After cremation, her ashes were scattered in the same place where Zhou Enlai&#x27;s ashes had been scattered. The official Party evaluation of her is &quot;a great proletarian revolutionary, politician, famous social activist, staunch Marxist, outstanding leader of the party and the country, pioneer of the Chinese women&#x27;s movement, and highly respected chairman of the Sixth CPPCC&quot;.

There is a memorial hall dedicated to her and her husband in Tianjin ().

<text>[[Psychology]] (from psykhē &quot;breath, spirit, soul&quot;; and , &quot;-logia&quot; &quot;study of&quot;) is an academic and applied discipline involving the scientific study of human mental functions and behavior. Occasionally, in addition or opposition to employing the scientific method, it also relies on symbolic interpretation and critical analysis, although these traditions have tended to be less pronounced than in other social sciences, such as sociology. Psychologists study phenomena such as perception, cognition, emotion, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships. Some, especially depth psychologists, also study the unconscious mind.

<doc id="221798" wikidata="Q1043283" url="?curid=221798" title="National Zoological Park (United States)">
<text>The National Zoological Park, commonly known as the National Zoo, is one of the oldest zoos in the United States. The zoo is part of the Smithsonian Institution and does not charge admission. Founded in 1889, its mission is to &quot;provide engaging experiences with animals and create and share knowledge to save wildlife and habitats&quot;.

The National Zoo has two campuses. The first is a urban park located at Rock Creek Park in the Woodley Park neighborhood of Northwest Washington, D.C., 20 minutes from the National Mall by MetroRail. The other campus is the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI; formerly known as the Conservation and Research Center) in Front Royal, Virginia. On this land, there are 180 species of trees, 850 species of woody shrubs and herbaceous plants, 40 species of grasses, and 36 different species of bamboo. The SCBI is a non-public facility devoted to training wildlife professionals in conservation biology and to propagating rare species through natural means and assisted reproduction. The National Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

The two facilities host about 2,700 animals of 390 different species. About one-fifth of them are endangered or threatened. Most species are on exhibit at the Rock Creek Park campus. The zoo is home to birds, great apes, big cats, Asian elephants, insects, amphibians, reptiles, aquatic animals, small mammals and many more, but the best-known residents are giant pandas. The SCBI facility houses between 30 and 40 endangered species at any given time depending on research needs and recommendations from the zoo and the conservation community. The zoo was one of the first to establish a scientific research program. Because it is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Zoo receives federal appropriations for operating expenses. A new master plan for the park was introduced in 2008 to upgrade the park&#x27;s exhibits and layout.

The National Zoo is open every day of the year except for December 25 (Christmas Day), though it was closed for a long period during the COVID-19 pandemic. The zoo reopened following this on May 21, 2021.

== History ==

The zoo first started as the National Museum&#x27;s Department of Living Animals in 1886. By an act of Congress on March 2, 1889, for &quot;the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people&quot;, the National Zoo was created. In 1890, it became a part of the Smithsonian Institution. Three well-known individuals drew up plans for the zoo: Samuel Langley, third Secretary of the Smithsonian; William Temple Hornaday, noted conservationist and head of the Smithsonian&#x27;s vertebrate division; and Frederick Law Olmsted, the premier landscape architect of his day. William T. Hornaday was the park&#x27;s first director and curator of all 185 animals when the park was first opened and took office on May 6, 1889. Together, they designed a new zoo to exhibit animals for the public and to serve as a refuge for wildlife, such as bison and beaver, which were rapidly vanishing from North America. For the first several decades, however, the zoo was managed closely by anthropologist Dr. Frank Baker, who navigated the zoo through many challenges and enlisted the zoo in many cultural projects. For a thorough history of the zoo from the 1880s to 1920s, see Daniel Vandersommers&#x27;s 2023 book &quot;Entangled Encounters at the National Zoo.&quot;
For the first 50 years, the National Zoo, like most zoos around the world, focused on exhibiting one or two representative exotic animal species. The number of many species in the wild began to decline drastically because of human activities. In 1899, the Kansas frontiersman Charles &quot;Buffalo&quot; Jones captured a bighorn sheep for the zoo. The fate of animals and plants became a pressing concern. Many of these species were favorite zoo animals, such as elephants and tigers; hence the staff began to concentrate on the long-term management and conservation of entire species.

Several exotic animals were donated by former US presidents; often they were acquired as gifts from foreign dignitaries. Notable among them are Billy the pygmy hippopotamus who is the common ancestor to almost all pygmy hippos in American zoos and Rebecca the raccoon, one of many exotic presidential pets of Calvin Coolidge and First Lady Grace.

In the mid-1950s, the zoo hired its first full-time permanent veterinarian, reflecting a priority placed on professional health care for the animals. In 1958, Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ) was founded. The citizen group&#x27;s first accomplishment was to persuade Congress to fund the zoo&#x27;s budget entirely through the Smithsonian; previously, the zoo&#x27;s budget was divided between appropriations for the Smithsonian and the District of Columbia. Congressional funding placed the zoo on a firmer financial base, allowing for a period of growth and improvement. In 2006, Congress approved an additional $14.6 million for renovations in both facilities. FONZ incorporated as a nonprofit organization and turned its attention to developing education and volunteer programs, supporting these efforts from its operation of concessions at the zoo, and expanding community support for the zoo through a growing membership which annually raises between $4 million and $8 million for the zoo.

In the early 1960s, the zoo turned its attention to breeding and studying threatened and endangered species. Although some zoo animals had been breeding and raising young, it was not understood why some species did so successfully while others did not. In 1965, the zoo created the zoological research division to study the reproduction, behavior, and ecology of zoo species, and to learn how best to meet the needs of the animals. 

The Ivy A. Pelzman Memorial Glockenspiel, constructed by the Petit &amp; Fritsen bell foundry, is a 38-foot-tall clock tower standing at the zoo&#x27;s southeastern entrance consisting of a carillon of 35 bells, four moving figurines of animals, and a 4-faced clock that was dedicated on May 16, 1976. It was designed and donated by the late Dr. Ivy A. Pelzman (1890-1970) as a memorial in honor of his wife Katherine. The glockenspiel&#x27;s steam-engine powered rotating display of animals malfunctioned a few years after the glockenspiel&#x27;s installation due to the steam engine becoming Inoperable. A few years later, the glockenspiel was relocated on the zoo grounds from Connecticut Avenue entrance to the southeastern entrance. The glockenspiel&#x27;s bells became inoperable in 2003 due to a mechanical malfunction with the carillon keyboard console. The Smithsonian lists the glockenspiel as an &quot;attractive, but dysfunctional gift,&quot; and it requires expensive funds for restoration and maintenance.
In 1975, the zoo established the Conservation and Research Center (CRC). In 2010, the complex was renamed the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), a title also used as an umbrella term for the scientific endeavors that take place on both campuses. On in the Virginia countryside, rare species, such as Mongolian wild horses, scimitar-horned oryx, maned wolves, cranes, and others live and breed in spacious surroundings. SCBI&#x27;s modern efforts emphasize reproductive physiology, analysis of habitat and species relationships, genetics, husbandry and the training of conservation scientists.

In September 2006, the zoo&#x27;s last giraffe, Randale, was transferred to the Lowry Park Zoo and in September 2009, the zoo&#x27;s last hippopotamus, Happy, was transferred to the Milwaukee County Zoo to make space for Elephant Trails.

During the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020–21, the zoo was closed for several months as a precautionary effort.

==Modern status==
Expanding knowledge about the needs of zoo animals and commitment to their well-being has changed the look of the National Zoo. Today, animals live in natural groupings rather than individually. Rare and endangered species, such as golden lion tamarins, Sumatran tigers, and sarus cranes, breed and raise their young – showing the success of the zoo&#x27;s conservation and research programs. The zoo&#x27;s research team studies animals both in the wild and at the zoo. Its research encompasses reproductive biology, conservation biology, biodiversity monitoring, veterinary medicine, nutrition, behavior, ecology, and bird migration.

The National Zoo has developed public-education programs to help students, teachers and families explore the intricacies of the animal world. The zoo also designed specialized programs to train wildlife professionals from around the world and to form a network to provide crucial support for international conservation. The National Zoo is at the forefront of the use of web technology and programming to expand its programs to an international virtual audience.

Plans for the future include modernizing the zoo&#x27;s aging facilities and expanding its education, research and conservation efforts in Washington, Virginia and in the wild. As part of a 10-year renewal program, Asia Trail – a series of habitats for seven Asian species including sloth bears, red pandas, and clouded leopards – was created. Kids&#x27; Farm exhibit, opened in 2004, was slated for closure in 2011 but is to remain open for another 10 years following a donation to the exhibit. Elephant Trails, opened in 2013, provides a new home for the zoo&#x27;s Asian elephants.

The zoo, which is supported by tax revenues and open to everyone, attracts 2 million visitors per year, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2005.

The National Zoo has a Federal Law Enforcement Agency deployed on its grounds: the National Zoological Park Police (NZPP), which consists of full-time Law Enforcement Officers. The NZPP is an agency that has been recognized by the United States Congress and is one of five original police agencies within the District of Columbia with full police powers. They work very closely with the Metropolitan Police Department, the United States Park Police, Department of State, Capital Police, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. The agency is considered the first line of defense in the event of any crisis.

Dennis W. Kelly was named director of the zoo on February 15, 2010, overseeing both campuses. Kelly succeeded John Berry, who was the National Zoo director for three years until February 2009, when he resigned to become the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under the Obama Administration. Steven Monfort, the zoo&#x27;s associate director for conservation and science, served as the acting director between February 2009 and February 2010. Kelly retired as the zoo&#x27;s director in November 2017, and Steven Monfort was named acting director. In November, 2021, Brandie Smith was appointed director. Smith is the second woman to serve as director in the zoo&#x27;s 132-year history.

===National Zoological Park Police===

US National Zoological Park Police officers are specifically assigned to the National Zoo and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia. The National Zoological Park Police is one of the oldest police forces in the District of Columbia. According to the official National Zoo Website, the Zoological Police was one of the original five police agencies in D.C. created in 1889. The National Zoo is a Smithsonian facility in the District of Columbia and is staffed 24 hours a day by full-time US National Zoological Park police officers.

The National Zoo also maintains a 3,200-acre Research facility (Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute; SCBI) in Front Royal, Virginia; which is staffed by members of the National Zoological Park Police. NZPP officers are Federal law enforcement officers and carry full law enforcement jurisdiction within the District of Columbia and Virginia that work closely with the Metropolitan Police Department and the US Park Police, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies to include Virginia law enforcement authorities.

== Exhibits ==
=== David M. Rubenstein Giant Panda Habitat ===
The zoo&#x27;s state-of-the-art giant panda habitat features three outdoor areas with animal enrichment, an indoor area with a rocky outcrop, a waterfall, and viewing areas. The exhibit is designed to replicate the rocky, lush terrain of the pandas&#x27; natural habitat.

The habitat&#x27;s current residents are a pair of giant pandas named Bao Li and Qing Bao. The pandas arrived at the zoo on October 15, 2024, and after several months acclimating to their new environment, made their public debut on January 24, 2025. They are the newest residents at the habitat after an almost year long gap since the habitat&#x27;s previous pandas, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji, left the zoo for China in November 2023. The pandas are the focus of a research, conservation, and breeding program which aims to preserve their species. 

Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who were on loan from the China Wildlife Conservation Association, had four surviving cubs together, all by artificial insemination. The first was a male cub, named Tai Shan in 2005. On September 16, 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub, but the cub died six days after its birth. On August 23, 2013, Mei Xiang gave birth to two cubs; one, a female cub, later named Bao Bao, while the other was stillborn. Mei Xiang delivered two cubs in August 2015, but only one survived, as the other one died a few days later. The surviving male was given the name Bei Bei on September 25, 2015, and was on public exhibit in January 2016 until November 2019. On August 21, 2020, Mei Xiang gave birth to a single male cub, Xiao Qi Ji, becoming the oldest giant panda to give birth in the US at 22 years old.

=== Asia Trail ===
A group of Asia-themed exhibits opened in October 2006. Aside from displaying giant pandas, the area displays sloth bears, fishing cats, red pandas, clouded leopards and Asian small-clawed otters. Many species on the Asia Trail are listed as endangered. 

=== Elephant Trails ===
In spring 2008, the National Zoo began construction on Elephant Trails, a new home for its Asian elephants. The first part of the $52 million project opened in September 2010, expanding the zoo&#x27;s former elephant area with a barn, two new yards (one with a pool), and a quarter-mile (400 m) walkway through woods, a total of of outdoor space, bringing the total size of Elephant Trails to 2 acres (0.81 ha). Elephant Trails: A Campaign to Save Asian Elephants is a comprehensive breeding, education, and scientific research program. It is designed to help scientists care for elephants in zoos and in the wild. The Elephant House (built in 1937) was closed to the public from September 14, 2009, until late March 2013 for construction of the second phase of Elephant Trails. This includes the Elephant Community Center, an indoor exhibit with many interpretive signs and graphics. The six Asian elephants that live in Elephant Trails are one bull named Spike and five cows named Bozie, Swarna, Maharani, Trong Nhi, and Nhi Linh. The National Zoo will acquire a greater one-horned rhino in 2025, and it will be in the Elephant Trails exhibit.

=== Lemur Island ===

Lemur Island is a moated island that is home to a bachelor group of ring-tailed lemurs and black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The island, formerly Monkey Island, use to held Barbary macaques when it opened in 1983.

Near the island is &quot;Uncle Beazley&quot;, a fiberglass &quot;Triceratops&quot; that Louis Paul Jonas created for the DinoLand pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The life-size statue, which had been located on the National Mall near the National Museum of Natural History until 1994, is named for a dinosaur in the 1956 children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Enormous Egg&quot;, by Oliver Butterworth and in the book&#x27;s 1968 television movie adaptation, in which the statue appeared.

=== The Small Mammal House ===

The majority of the zoo&#x27;s smaller mammal species live in the Small Mammal House. The species on display include golden lion tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, emperor tamarins, Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets, red ruffed lemurs, lesser hedgehog tenrecs, southern lesser galagos, black-footed ferrets, dwarf mongooses, long-tailed chinchillas, prehensile-tailed porcupines, two-toed sloths, red-rumped agoutis, brush-tailed bettongs, northern treeshrews, La Plata three-banded armadillos, screaming hairy armadillos, sand cats, fennec foxes, meerkats, naked mole-rats, rock hyraxes, striped skunks and several others.

A sister pair of white-nosed coatis are found behind the building.

Despite not being mammal, a green aracari can be found in the building.

=== American Trail ===
The American Trail exhibit houses a variety of species found in North America. These include California sea lions, grey seals, North American beavers, North American river otters, red wolves, bald eagles, common ravens and eastern screech owls.

The exhibit also features a cafe called Seal Rock Cafe, which offers dishes crafted from local, seasonal, and sustainable ingredients. Menu items include Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) certified shrimp and Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fish.

=== Great Ape House ===

The Great Ape House opened in 1981 and is separated into two sets of enclosures. One houses six western lowland gorillas (two males named Baraka Ya Mwelu and Moke; three females named Calaya, Mandara and Kibibi; and a female infant named Zahra, born in 2023). The other houses six orangutans (two males named Kiko and Redd; and four females named Batang, Lucy, Iris and Bonnie). The orangutans are allowed access to the Think Tank (see below) by traveling along the &quot;O-Line&quot;, a series of high cables supported by metal towers that enable the orangutans to move between the two buildings. Batang and Redd are Bornean orangutans while Kiko, Lucy, Iris and Bonnie are all hybrid orangutans.

=== Think Tank ===
The Think Tank is an area designed to educate visitors about how animals think and learn about their surroundings. Think Tank opened in 1995 and features several interactive displays that teach visitors how zoologists conduct their studies. The zoo&#x27;s orangutans (which are sometimes used in keeper demonstrations) are allowed to move from the Great Ape House to Think Tank, and the building includes suitable enclosures for the apes should they choose to stay there. Other animals kept and studied in the Think Tank include land hermit crabs, brown rats, and Allen&#x27;s swamp monkeys.

=== Gibbon Ridge ===
Gibbon Ridge is an enclosure housing four siamangs (two males named Bradley and Guntur and two females named Ronnie and Adinda).

=== Great Cats ===

The Great Cats exhibit opened in the mid 1970s and is separated into three enclosures with a moat. The zoo rotates three lions (two males named Shaka and Jumbe as well as a lionesses named Shera) and three tigers (a Sumatran tigress named Damai and two Siberian tigers, a male named Metis and a female named Nikita) between the three exhibits.

=== Africa Trail ===

Formerly called the Cheetah Conservation Station, this outdoor exhibit is designed to mimic the African savanna, to educate visitors about cheetahs, and what is being done to preserve them in the wild. The area is currently closed for a multi-year renovation process, with a scheduled completion by the end of 2026. Other animals on display in the area prior to the renovations include a Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra, addaxes, an ostrich, Grévy&#x27;s zebras, maned wolves, Rüppell’s griffon vultures, sitatungas, scimitar-horned oryx, dama gazelles, red river hogs, Abyssinian ground hornbills and lesser kudu.

=== Amazonia ===
Opened in 1992, this South America-themed walk-through exhibit contains animal and plant species native to the Amazon basin. Animals on display include multiple species of freshwater stingrays, silver arowanas, yellow-spotted river turtles, red-footed tortoises, arapaimas, black pacus, a two-toed sloth, green aracaris, roseate spoonbills, hawk-headed parrots, guinea pigs and many more.

The Amazonia Science Gallery is located on the lower level. Here visitors can learn about the zoo&#x27;s efforts to protect species around the globe. Some of the species on display include Panamanian golden frogs, smooth-sided toads, lemur leaf frogs, African clawed frogs, aquatic caecilians, barred tiger salamanders and many species of poison dart frogs. Located within the science gallery is the Coral Lab. Many corals are on display along with clownfish, sea anemones and other species.

The Electric Fishes Demonstration Lab features a five-foot-long electric eel. Bluntnose knifefish, elephantnose knifefish and black ghost knifefish are also featured.

=== The Reptile Discovery Center ===
The zoo&#x27;s reptile house opened in 1931 and exhibits seventy species of reptiles and amphibians. These include Aldabra tortoises, radiated tortoises, spider tortoises, Home&#x27;s hinge-back tortoises, Cuban crocodiles, a false gharial, Japanese giant salamanders, eastern indigo snakes, Gila monsters, blue iguanas, Iranian fat-tailed geckos, a green anaconda, green tree pythons, Timor pythons, king cobras, northern copperheads, banded rock rattlesnakes, hellbenders, eastern red-backed salamanders, long-tailed salamanders, alligator snapping turtles and many more.

Behind the building are exhibits for the Komodo dragon, and Chinese alligators. In the front of the building is an exhibit for an American alligator named Wally.

=== The Bird House ===

Opened in 1928, the zoo&#x27;s Bird House focuses on the biological phenomenon of migration in the eastern hemisphere and features three distinct aviaries, each focusing on a different habitat that is crucial to the bird&#x27;s annual migrations. The habitats include: Delaware Bay, a marsh environment that displays shorebirds including red knots and semipalmated plovers, as well as cold-blooded species such as horseshoe crabs and native fish, Prairie Pothole, a wetlands environment that displays waterfowl including canvasbacks, redheads and American avocets, and Costa Rican Coffee Farm, a two-story tropical environment that displays migratory songbirds such as Baltimore orioles, indigo buntings and wood thrushes as well as barred parakeets. Exhibits surrounding the exterior of the Bird House hold kori bustards, sandhill cranes, whooping cranes, greater rheas, barred owls, bronze turkeys, southern cassowaries, American flamingos and other larger birds.

=== Claws &amp; Paws Pathway ===
The Claws &amp; Paws Pathway exhibit is the most recent exhibit added in the zoo. It is a small circular path that includes exhibits for binturongs, bobcats, Pallas&#x27;s cats and a North American porcupine.

=== The Kids&#x27; Farm ===
The Kids&#x27; Farm opened in 2004 and is aimed primarily at children and housing domesticated livestock. Animals kept in the Kids&#x27; Farm include alpacas, hens, miniature Mediterranean donkeys, Hereford and Holstein cows, Kunekune pigs and Nigerian Dwarf goats. The exhibit also has a small pond containing koi and channel catfish. In 2011, the zoo announced plans to close The Kids&#x27; Farm due to budgetary constraints. However, a $1.4 million donation from State Farm Insurance allowed the exhibit to remain open.

=== American Bison Exhibit ===
The zoo opened a new American bison exhibit on August 30, 2014, as part of their 125th-anniversary celebration. The exhibit features two female bison, named Lucy and Gally, that were transported to the zoo in 2020 from the American Prairie in northeastern Montana.

=== Other animals ===
Other animals in the zoo&#x27;s collection include spectacled bears (near the Amazonia exhibit), black-tailed prairie dogs (near the Claws and Paws Pathway exhibit), Przewalski&#x27;s horses (near the Small Mammal House), Patagonian maras (near the American Trail), and Bennett&#x27;s wallabies (also near the Small Mammal House).

== Gallery ==
== Notable animals ==
=== Smokey Bear ===

One of the most famous animals to have spent much of his life at the zoo was Smokey Bear, the &quot;living symbol&quot; of the cartoon icon created as part of a campaign to prevent forest fires. A black bear cub rescued from a fire, he lived at the zoo from 1950 until his death in 1976. During his time at the zoo, he had millions of visitors and an abundance of personal mail addressed to him – up to 13,000 letters a week – such that the U.S. Post Office designated a special zip code for correspondence addressed to him.

During his time at the zoo, he was &quot;married&quot; to Goldie Bear, with the hope that one of his offspring would continue to hold the title of Smokey Bear. When the pair produced no offspring, an orphaned bear cub was added to their cage. It was named &quot;Little Smokey&quot;, with the announcement that the bear couple had &quot;adopted&quot; the new cub. In 1975, an official ceremony was held to recognize the retirement of Smokey Bear and the new title of &quot;Smokey Bear II&quot; for Little Smokey. Upon the death of the original Smokey Bear, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; printed an obituary, recognizing him as a &quot;New Mexico native&quot; who had resided in Washington, D.C., for many years, working for the government.

=== Ham ===

Ham was the first great ape ever launched into space in 1961. The chimpanzee would later retire to the National Zoo in 1963, residing for 17 years as a lone chimp until he was transferred to the North Carolina Zoo, where he lived among other chimpanzees for the remaining years of his life, passing in 1983. 

=== Giant pandas ===
During President Richard Nixon&#x27;s historic 1972 visit to China, the Chinese government donated two giant pandas, Ling-Ling (female) and Hsing-Hsing (male), to the official United States delegation. First Lady Pat Nixon donated the pandas to the zoo, where she welcomed them in an April 1972 ceremony. The first giant pandas in America, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were among the most popular animals at the zoo. Ling-Ling died in 1992 and Hsing-Hsing in 1999. Although Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing had five cubs between 1983 and 1989, all died as infants.

A new pair of pandas, female Mei Xiang (&quot;Beautiful Fragrance&quot;) and male Tian Tian (&quot;More and More&quot;), arrived on loan from the Chinese government in late 2000. The zoo paid an estimated 10 million dollars for the 10-year loan. On July 9, 2005, a male panda cub was born at the zoo. It was the first surviving panda birth at the zoo and the product of artificial insemination by the zoo&#x27;s reproductive research team. The cub was named Tai Shan (&quot;Peaceful Mountain&quot;) on October 17, 100 days after his birth; the panda went without a name for its first hundred days, in observance of a Chinese custom. Tai Shan is property of the Chinese government and was scheduled to be sent to China after his second birthday, although that deadline was extended in 2007 by two years. Tai Shan left Washington, D.C., on February 4, 2010, and was taken to the Ya&#x27;an Bifengxia Panda Base, part of the Wolong nature reserve&#x27;s panda conservation center.

On September 16, 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub, believed by zoo officials to have been a female, which died after about a week. Initial results from a necropsy (animal autopsy) revealed the abnormal presence of fluid in the abdomen and also discoloration of the liver (hepatic) tissue of unknown etiology; the cub had managed to nurse before death because milk was found in its system. Zoo officials said that, while upsetting, they (and, by extension, the public) can hope to learn more about giant panda breeding, reproduction, and health as a result, and will work closely and cooperatively with their Chinese colleagues during the inquiry.

In January 2011, Dennis Kelly, director of the National Zoo, and Zang Chunlin, secretary general of the China Wildlife Conservation Association, signed a new Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement, extending the zoo&#x27;s giant panda program for five more years, further cementing the two countries&#x27; commitment to the conservation of the species. The agreement, effective through December 5, 2015, stipulates that the zoo will conduct research in the areas of breeding and cub behavior. A new agreement was put in place December 7, 2015, and was in effect until December 7, 2020. In December 2020, the deal got extended until 2023.

Mei Xiang gave birth in August 2015 to two live cubs; the smaller one died a few days later (keepers had to care for it after Mei decided to focus on the larger cub). Sperm from both Tian Tian and another male giant panda based in a China preserve was used. It was determined on August 28, 2015, that both cubs were male and sired by Tian Tian. The larger, surviving cub was named Bei Bei (&quot;precious treasure&quot;) on September 25, 2015. In celebration of a state visit, the name was selected by First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, and First Lady of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Peng Liyuan.

Bao Bao was healthy at that time, eating bamboo and special fruitsicle treats, having been separated from Mei at 18 months of age. She celebrated her second birthday in August 2015, shortly after the cubs were born. Her contract extended to August 2017. Bao Bao left the National Zoo on February 22, 2017, for the Dujiangyan base of the China Panda Conservation and Research Center.

In March 2020 shortly after the National Zoo closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated using only frozen sperm to avoid too much close contact. In August 2020, the National Zoo announced that Mei Xiang was pregnant. A few days after announcing that they had detected fetal tissue, the zoo tweeted a short video of an ultrasound showing a panda fetus. On August 21, Mei Xiang gave birth to a live male cub named Xiao Qi Ji, making her the oldest panda in the United States to give birth, at 22 years old. This meant the first success for this type of procedure.

On November 8, 2023, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and Xiao Qi Ji left the zoo and were transported in a Boeing 777F aircraft to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China, ending their 23 year era at the zoo.

On May 29, 2024, the zoo announced the acquirement of male Bao Li and female Qing Bao from the Shenshuping Base and Dujiangyan Base in China respectively. The pair arrived at the zoo on October 15, 2024 following a 19-hour flight from China. The Giant Pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao will make their public debut on January 24th, 2025, and zoo members can see Bao Li and Qing Bao early from January 10th, 2025 - January 19th, 2025. To feed the two pandas, the Zoo uses a &quot;farm-to-table approach&quot;. Throughout the week, Zoo staff harvest bamboo from &quot;undisclosed locations&quot; in the Washington, D.C. area by hand, transport it to the Zoo, rinse and maintain its freshness with automatic water misters, and leave the bamboo at the pandas&#x27; preferred resting locations. The pandas sometimes prefer certain types of bamboo over others, so the staff always pick multiple species. Leftover bamboo is used to feed other herbivores at the Zoo. The pandas also receive &quot;panda bread&quot;, a steamed mixture of &quot;soybean, rice, and corn flours&quot; developed in China. 

== Special programs and events ==
The zoo holds annual fund raisers (ZooFari, Guppy Gala, and Boo at the Zoo) and free events (Sunset Serenades, Fiesta Musical). Proceeds support animal care, conservation science, education and sustainability at the National Zoo.

== Friends of the National Zoo ==
Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ) was a non-profit organization working in partnership with the National Zoological Park providing support to wildlife conservation programs at the zoo and around the world since 1958. Starting with Park Operations (guest services, retail and more), Education/Volunteer Services, as well as Membership Services, every area of FONZ works to raise money for the zoo, with $5 Zoo Guidebooks, rentals, souvenir purchases and memberships, with each being a tax write off. FONZ memberships offer free parking, discounts at the zoo&#x27;s stores and restaurants, ride tickets, and a subscription to the &quot;Wild.Life.&quot;, a magazine with the latest zoo news, research and photos.

FONZ has 60,000 members including about 30,000 families, largely in the Washington metropolitan area, and more than 1,000 volunteers. FONZ also offers weekend birthdays to members and seasonal day-camps through Education/Volunteer services, and a residential nature camp is offered at SCBI in Front Royal.

On February 4, 2021, the National Zoo announced that it was ending its 63-year partnership with FONZ. After the partnership ended, FONZ was relaunched as Conservation Nation, which is smaller and remotely-operated. 

== Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute ==
The Smithsonian established its Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in 2010 to serve as an umbrella for its global effort to conserve species and train future generations of conservationists. Headquartered in Front Royal, Virginia, the facility was previously known as the National Zoo&#x27;s Conservation and Research Center.

The SCBI facilitates and promotes research programs based at Front Royal, at the National Zoo in Washington and at field research and training sites around the world. Its efforts support one of the four main goals of the Smithsonian&#x27;s new strategic plan, which advances &quot;understanding and sustaining a biodiverse planet.&quot;

Conservation biology is a field of science based on the premise that the conservation of biological diversity is important and benefits current and future human societies.

The Institute consists of six centers:

* Conservation Ecology Center (CEC): focuses on recovering and sustaining at-risk wildlife species and their supporting ecosystems in key marine and terrestrial regions throughout the globe.
* Migratory Bird Center: studies neotropical songbirds and wetland birds, the role of disease in bird population declines, and the environmental challenges facing urban and suburban birds. They also train professionals in environmental coffee certification throughout Latin America.
* Center for Species Survival (CSS): researches issues in reproductive physiology, endocrinology, cryobiology, embryo biology, animal behavior, wildlife toxicology and assisted reproduction. They strive to create knowledge that ensures self-sustaining populations in zoos and in the wild.
* Center for Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics (CCEG): works to understand and conserve biodiversity through genetic research, specializing in the genetic management of wild and captive animal populations, non-invasive and ancient DNA analyses, systematics, disease diagnosis and dynamics, genetic services to the zoo community, and application of genetic methods to animal behavior and ecology.
* Center for Conservation Education and Sustainability (CBES): teaches conservation principles and practices, finding ways to help scientists, managers, companies and industries become more environmentally responsible.
* Center for Wildlife Health and Husbandry Sciences: provides for the mental and physical well-being of every animal at the zoo through the complex endeavor of animal care.

== Incidents ==
* In March 1995, a homeless and mentally ill mother of three, Margaret Davis King, climbed into the lion&#x27;s protected habitat and was discovered mauled to death early one Saturday morning.
*In 2002, the zoo&#x27;s head veterinarian at the time, Dr. Suzan Murray, was accused of altering medical records. Murray responded that the software used &quot;was not designed as a legal document, but rather as a user-friendly way of maintaining and sharing important information.&quot; The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) specifically states &quot;Without the express permission of the practice owner, it is unethical for a veterinarian to remove, copy, or use the medical records or any part of any record.&quot;
* In January 2003, red pandas died after eating rat poison that had been buried in their yard by a pest control contractor. The incident led the city of Washington, D.C., to seek to fine the zoo over its claim of federally granted immunity.
* In July 2003, a predator entered an exhibit and killed a bald eagle. Zoo officials later stated that the animal was likely killed by a red fox.
* In 2005, a three-year-old Sulawesi macaque named Ripley died in the Think Tank exhibit when two keepers closed a hydraulic door without realizing the monkey was in the doorway.
* In January 2005, the National Academy of Sciences released its final report on a two-year investigation into animal care and management at the National Zoo. The committee found that most animals were well cared-for, and there was little to question regarding large mammal deaths from 1999 to 2003. Their evaluation suggested &quot;that the publicized animal deaths were not indicative of a wider, undiscovered problem with animal care&quot;. The problems at the zoo, which culminated with Director Lucy Spelman&#x27;s resignation, included facility and budget shortcomings, although the animal care problems were prominently highlighted. The zoo added a new head pathologist and other veterinarians.
* In January 2006, the National Zoo euthanized an Asian elephant named Toni. The elephant had been suffering from arthritis and poor body conditions. Animal rights groups alleged that inadequate care led to her death.
* In December 2006, a clouded leopard escaped from its exhibit at the Asia Trail due to faulty fencing. It was recaptured.
* During the night of May 3, 2022, a wild red fox from Rock Creek Park entered an enclosure through a baseball-sized hole and killed 25 flamingos and a Northern pintail duck, and injured 3 other flamingos.

<doc id="221801" wikidata="Q7659800" url="?curid=221801" title="Sydnam Poyntz">
<text>Colonel General Sydnam Poyntz, also Sydenham Poynts, (bap. 3 November 1607) was an English soldier who served in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the English Civil War.

After continental military service, he returned to England in 1644 and became an officer in the Parliamentary army. He became commander-in-chief of Parliament&#x27;s Northern Association and governor of York. He commanded the victorious Parliamentary force in the battle of Rowton Heath on 24 September 1645. The Presbyterians Parliamentary party thought him to be likely to oppose the New Model Army, but in 1647 he was sent by his soldiers a prisoner to Thomas Fairfax. He fought for London against the New Model Army in 1647, and on the collapse of his cause he fled to Holland. He accompanied Lord Willoughby to the West Indies in 1650, and probably settled in Virginia.

==Work as a mercenary==
Poyntz was the fourth son of John Poyntz of Reigate, Surrey, and Anne Skinner. He was baptised on 3 November 1607. Poyntz was originally apprenticed to a London tradesman, but, being ill-treated by his master, he took service as a mercenary soldier in Holland, and in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Poyntz wrote a memoir called &quot;Relation&quot; on his military service abroad between 1625 and 1636, and it gives some idea of what he did although D.N. Farr his biographer in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; warns that it is &quot;fitfully accurate&quot;. and relates that he:

In 1631 Poyntz fought for John George of Saxony at the Battle of Breitenfeld. He changed sides and fought as a captain in Wallenstein&#x27;s army in the service of Emperor Ferdinand II at the Battle of Lützen in 1632. He remained in the Imperial army and the following year he campaigned in Silesia and was present at the Battle of Nordlingen in 1634. He left the army and Germany after the Peace of Prague in 1636. His time in Germany was lucrative and he bought an estate probably in the vicinity of Schorndorf. He returned to England that year and wrote his &quot;Relation&quot;, but when he failed to find employment as a soldier in England, it is likely that he returned to the continent to find further employment in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He may have risen to the rank of sergeant-major, and may have been knighted on the battle-field.

==Service in the English Civil War==

Poyntz returned to England no later than 1644, and on 27 May 1645 was ordered by the House of Commons to have the command of a regiment of horse and a regiment of foot in the army raised by the seven associated northern counties. He was also appointed commander-in-chief of the forces of the northern association, with the title of colonel-general, and, on 19 August, governor of York. On taking command, Poyntz found his troops mutinous for want of pay, and at the siege of Skipton was more in danger from his own men than from the enemy. He was ordered after Battle of Naseby (14 June 1645) to follow the movements of King Charles I, and succeeded in forcing him to an engagement at Rowton Heath, near Chester, on 24 September. Charles lost about eight hundred men killed and wounded and fifteen hundred prisoners. The House of Commons voted Poyntz a reward of £500. He next captured Shelford House and Wiverton Hall in Nottinghamshire, and then laid siege to Newark. He was still besieging Newark when Charles I took refuge in the camp of the Scottish army there, of which Poyntz at once informed the Speaker William Lenthall. At the request of Charles I the commander of the Newark garrison Lord Belasyse agreed terms and surrendered Newark on 8 May to Poyntz.

In February 1646 Poyntz published a vindication of himself, in which he included an account of his earlier life as well as of his recent services (&quot;The Vindication of Colonel-General Poyntz against the false and malicious slanders secretly cast forth against him&quot;, 1645–1646, 4to). Parliament, however, was so satisfied with his conduct that he was voted £300 a year, and it was decided that his regiment of horse should be one of four to be retained at the general disbanding of the army. The Presbyterian leaders relied upon Poyntz and his troops to oppose the Independents of the New Model Army, but the soldiers of the northern association entered into communication with those of Lord General Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s New Model Army, and, in spite of the orders of their commander, held meetings and elected agitators. Poyntz was seized by the agitators on 8 July 1647 and sent a prisoner to Fairfax&#x27;s headquarters, charged with endeavouring to embroil the kingdom in a new war. He was released by Fairfax on parole; but the latter, who now became commander-in-chief of all the land forces in the service of Parliament, appointed Colonel John Lambert to take command in the north.

At the end of July 1647 an open breach took place between the Parliament in London and the New Model Army. The common council chose Major-general Edward Massey to command the forces of the city, and Poyntz, who was also given a command, actively assisted in enlisting &quot;reformadoes&quot;. On 2 August Poyntz and other officers dispersed a body of citizens who brought to the common council a petition &quot;praying that some means might be used for a composure&quot;. According to the newspapers, they hacked and hewed many of the petitioners with their swords and &quot;mortally wounded divers&quot;.

On the collapse of the resistance of London, Poyntz fled to Holland, publishing, in conjunction with Massey, a declaration &quot;showing the true grounds and reasons that induced them to depart from the city, and for a while from the kingdom&quot;. &quot;Finding&quot;, said they, &quot;all things so uncertain, and nothing answering to what was promised or expected, we held it safer wisdom to withdraw to our own friends&quot;.

On 14 May 1648 Poyntz wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons from Amsterdam, begging that he might at least receive the two months&#x27; pay voted to his forces when they were disbanded. &quot;When I peruse the letters which I have formerly received from both houses of parliament, with all their great promises and engagements to me, never to forget the great services which I have done them … it would almost make a man desperate to see how I am deserted and slighted in place of the great rewards which the honourable houses were pleased to promise me&quot;.

==Settling in the West Indies==

Receiving no answer to this or previous appeals, Poyntz in 1650 accompanied Lord Willoughby to the West Indies, and there became governor of the Leeward Islands, establishing himself on Saint Kitts. When Willoughby surrendered Barbados to the Parliamentary fleet under Sir George Ayscue, Poyntz found Saint Kitts untenable, and retired to Virginia. The articles between Willoughby and Ayscue contain a clause permitting Poyntz to go to Antigua along with other gentlemen having estates there. Some authorities have stated that in 1661 he was again appointed governor of Antigua, and held the post until superseded by Lord Willoughby in 1663, but no trace of his tenure of office appears among the colonial state papers. It is added that he then retired to Virginia, but this is not known for sure, and he may have remained in Virginia, dying there at some unknown date.

==Works==
Poyntz was the author of the following pamphlets:
* The &quot;Vindication&quot; (1645/6).
* &quot;The Vindication of Colonel-general Poyntz against the Slanders cast forth against him by the Army; with the barbarous manner of the Adjutator&#x27;s surprisal of him at York&quot;, 4to, 1648 [no place].

The British Museum Catalogue also gives a list of letters by Poyntz, which were printed in pamphlet form between 1645 and 1647. Some unprinted letters by Poyntz are to be found among the Tanner MSS. in the Bodleian Library, and among the manuscripts of the Duke of Portland.

==Family==

In about 1633 Poyntz married firstly a rich German merchant&#x27;s daughter who died in childbirth before 1635.
In 1635 Poyntz married another German, Anne Eleanora de Court Stephanus de Cary in Würtemberg. Anne and their child was killed by French troops returning from Italy probably while passing through his estate near Schorndorf.
It is possible that he married his third wife while living abroad because in a letter to Speaker of the House of Commons, William Lenthall, in 1647 she mentions that &quot;stranger in your kingdom&quot; and signed her name as Elisabeth.

<doc id="221812" wikidata="Q193020" url="?curid=221812" title="Tim Duncan">
<text>Timothy Theodore Duncan (born April 25, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. He spent his entire 19-year career with the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed &quot;the Big Fundamental&quot;, he is widely considered the greatest power forward of all time and one of the greatest players in NBA history, and was a central contributor to the franchise&#x27;s success during the 2000s and 2010s. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

Born and raised on Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Duncan initially aspired to be a competitive swimmer, but took up basketball at 14 after Hurricane Hugo destroyed the island&#x27;s only Olympic-sized pool. In high school, he played basketball for St. Dunstan&#x27;s Episcopal. In college, Duncan played for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, and in his senior year, he received the John Wooden Award and was named the Naismith College Player of the Year and the USBWA College Player of the Year.

After graduating from college, Duncan was the NBA Rookie of the Year after being selected by San Antonio with the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft. He primarily played the power forward position and also played center throughout his career. He is a five-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA MVP, a three-time NBA Finals MVP, a 15-time NBA All-Star, and the only player to be selected to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive Teams for 13 consecutive seasons.

==Early life==
Duncan was born and raised in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. He is the son of immigrants from Anguilla: Ione, a professional midwife, and William Duncan, a mason. He has two older sisters, Cheryl and Tricia, and an older brother, Scott, who became a film director and cinematographer. Cheryl was a champion swimmer before she became a nurse, and Tricia swam for the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

In school, Duncan was a bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like Tricia. His parents were very supportive, and Duncan excelled at swimming, becoming a teenage standout in the 50-, 100-, and 400-meter freestyle and aiming to go to the 1992 Olympic Games as a member of the United States Team.

In 1989, after Hurricane Hugo destroyed the island&#x27;s only Olympic-sized swimming pool, Duncan was forced to swim in the ocean instead, and his fear of sharks ruined his enthusiasm for the sport. He was dealt another emotional blow when his mother died of breast cancer on April 24, 1990, the day before his 14th birthday. On her deathbed, she made Duncan and his sisters promise that they would graduate from college, going a long way in explaining Duncan&#x27;s later refusal to leave college early for the NBA.

Duncan never swam competitively again, but his brother-in-law inspired him to turn to basketball. Initially, Duncan had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. St. Croix Country Day School athletic director Nancy Pomroy has said, &quot;[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time.&quot; He overcame his awkwardness to become a standout for the St. Dunstan&#x27;s Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities. Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom, in particular, grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game. Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket. Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation. But after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan&#x27;s demeanor and discovered that he was not only a talented athlete but also a quick learner. Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware, and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom&#x27;s Wake Forest Demon Deacons.

==College career==
In the year before Duncan&#x27;s arrival at Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons had reached the Sweet 16, but then lost leading scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft. In the 1993–94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was considering redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N&#x27;Diaye violated NCAA rules and eventually transferred to Michigan. Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20–11 win–loss record. Duncan&#x27;s style of play was simple yet effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots, and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games. Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature. Despite his heavy focus on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best said, &quot;Tim ... was one of my more intellectual students. ... Other than his height, I couldn&#x27;t tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.&quot; Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as &quot;Mr. Spock&quot;, the prototype of a logical, detached character from &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In the 1994–95 NCAA season, the sophomore was soon called one of the best prospects among those eligible for the NBA, along with peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace, and Jerry Stackhouse. Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early; however, Duncan said that he had no intention of going pro before graduation, despite the NBA&#x27;s plan to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. Though it meant passing up a large amount of money, Duncan was loath to deviate from his determination to stay in school. In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against the Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels. During that game, Duncan neutralized Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime. In the NCAA tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16. Playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but Wake Forest still lost, 71–66. Duncan ended the season averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year, and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in his two remaining years at Wake Forest.

During the 1995–96 NCAA season, Wake Forest lost Childress, who had graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. In Childress&#x27;s absence, Duncan led the team to a 12–4 ACC record, and a 26–6 record overall. The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four. His season averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game led to another ACC Defensive Player of the Year award and his first ACC Player of the Year award. Although the Wake Forest star was now rumored to be entering the 1996 NBA draft, he stayed in college.

In the 1996–97 NCAA season, new Demon Deacon and future NBA player Loren Woods eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The 1996–97 team won their first 13 games, but then came a slump, and they failed to win a third ACC title. On January 12, 1997, Duncan scored 26 points and 14 rebounds in an 81–69 win against Duke. On January 24, 1997, Duncan scored 16 points, 15 rebounds and 5 blocks in a 65–62 victory over Clemson. Later, during the NCAA tournament, Stanford University, led by future NBA point guard Brevin Knight, eliminated Wake Forest with a 72–66 win. Duncan finished his senior season with career high averages of 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game while shooting .606 from the field and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-team All-American honors for the second time and was a unanimous pick for both the Oscar Robertson Trophy and Naismith College Player of the Year. Duncan was first in the 1996–97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, tenth in blocked shots (3.3 bpg), and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg). He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and, based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters, won the 1997 John Wooden Award as the NCAA&#x27;s best overall male player.

In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, Tracy McGrady, and Kobe Bryant, Duncan stayed in college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997 and the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997. In 1996, he led the ACC in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage, and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories. That same year, he was also named Most Valuable Player of the ACC Tournament. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the all-time leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (a mark later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). Duncan left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate&#x27;s Adonal Foyle—and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.

In college, Duncan co-authored a chapter in the social psychology book &quot;Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors&quot; with Mark Leary. After earning his college degree in psychology, Duncan entered the 1997 NBA draft. In 2009, Duncan was inducted into the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==

===San Antonio Spurs (1997–2016)===

====&quot;Twin Towers&quot; (1997–2003)====

In the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Duncan with the first draft pick. The Spurs were coming off an injury-riddled 1996–97 season; their best player, David Robinson—himself a number one draft pick in 1987—was sidelined for most of the year, and they finished with a 20–62 win–loss record. In the 1997–98 season, Duncan and Robinson became known as the &quot;Twin Towers&quot;. The duo earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket. From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: In his second road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against Chicago Bulls Hall-of-Fame power forward Dennis Rodman, a multiple rebounding champion and NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Duncan was voted to the 1998 NBA All-Star Game by coaches. Later, when Duncan played against Houston Rockets Hall-of-Fame power forward Charles Barkley, Barkley was so impressed he said, &quot;I have seen the future and he wears number 21.&quot; In his rookie season, Duncan lived up to expectations of being the first draft pick, starting in all 82 regular season games, averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, and earning All-NBA First Team honors. His defensive contributions ensured that he was chosen for the NBA All-Defensive Second Team and was also named NBA Rookie of the Year, having won the NBA Rookie of the Month award every single month that season. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich lauded Duncan&#x27;s mental toughness, stating his rookie&#x27;s &quot;demeanor was singularly remarkable&quot;, Duncan always &quot;put things into perspective&quot; and never got &quot;too upbeat or too depressed.&quot; Center Robinson was equally impressed with Duncan: &quot;He&#x27;s the real thing. I&#x27;m proud of his attitude and effort. He gives all the extra effort and work and wants to become a better player.&quot;

The Spurs qualified for the 1998 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds and replicating the performance in Game 2, contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns. However, the Spurs lost in the second round to the eventual Western Conference champions, Utah Jazz.
During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs started with a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach and finished the season with a 31–5 run. The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams. In the 1999 NBA playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals. In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero, and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the &quot;Twin Towers&quot; outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks. After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win, and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks&#x27; possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot, and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point, 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: &quot;Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [in Game 5].&quot; And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: &quot;I&#x27;ve got Tim and you don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the difference.&quot;

In the 1999–2000 season, Duncan further cemented his reputation. He averaged 23.2 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.2 blocks per game, earning another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team nods. However, the Spurs had a disappointing postseason. Duncan injured his meniscus shortly before the end of the regular season and was unable to play in even one postseason game. Consequently, the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the 2000 NBA playoffs, losing 3–1 to the Phoenix Suns.

In the next season, Duncan averaged 22.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.3 blocks per game. He was again named to the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams. In the 2001 NBA playoffs, the Spurs eliminated the Timberwolves 3–1, defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4–1, but then bowed out against the Lakers (led by superstars Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant) in four straight games. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; described the series as a &quot;[m]erciless mismatch&quot;, and Duncan was criticized as &quot;silent when the Spurs need him most&quot;.

On the back of two consecutive playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1,042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team nods, he was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as one of only two Spurs players in history to have earned the honor. On the other hand, Duncan&#x27;s team struggled with the fact that the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often. In the 2002 NBA playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O&#x27;Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions. Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: &quot;I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that&#x27;s just the way the ball rolls sometimes.&quot; Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as &quot;phenomenal&quot; and criticized his supporting cast.
In the 2002–03 season, the Spurs began play at the SBC Center on November 1 by defeating the Toronto Raptors 91–72. In that game, Duncan recorded 22 points, 15 rebounds and 3 blocks for the Spurs. He averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and earned All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team recognition, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award. At age 37, Robinson had announced that the season would be his last; his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs. The Spurs qualified easily for the playoffs, concluding the regular season as the Western Conference&#x27;s number one seed with a 60–22 record. In the Western Conference Semifinals against the Lakers, Duncan dominated forward Robert Horry and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds. The Spurs made it to the finals, and defeated the New Jersey Nets 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship. Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a quadruple double in the final game, and was named the NBA Finals MVP. Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s 2003 &quot;Sportsmen of the Year&quot;.

====Leader of the Spurs (2003–2007)====

On July 16, 2003, Duncan signed a seven-year, $122 million contract with the Spurs. Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs lost their perennial captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterović, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Manu Ginóbili and young French point guard Tony Parker. Coming off the bench were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant to step into the void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater, giving his team the win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as one of the reasons for the loss.

Duncan and his Spurs looked to re-assert themselves in the next 2004–05 season. Despite their new captain&#x27;s slight statistical slump (20.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.6 blocks per game), the Spurs won the second seed for the 2005 NBA playoffs by winning 59 games. In the first round, the Spurs eliminated the Denver Nuggets four games to one, and met the Seattle SuperSonics in the semi-finals. After splitting the first four games, Duncan led his team to two decisive victories, setting up a meeting with the Phoenix Suns, known for their up-tempo basketball. The Spurs managed to beat the Suns at their own game, defeating them 4–1 and earning a spot in the 2005 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons. In the Finals, Duncan was pitted against Detroit&#x27;s defensively strong frontcourt anchored by multiple NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. After two convincing Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons double teamed Duncan and forced him to play further from the basket. Detroit won the next two games and the series was eventually tied at 3–3, but Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Spurs defeated the Pistons. NBA.com reported that &quot;with his unique multidimensional talent, Duncan depleted and dissected the Pistons... He was the fulcrum of virtually every key play down the stretch&quot;, and coach Popovich added: &quot;[Duncan&#x27;s] complete game is so sound, so fundamental, so unnoticed at times, because if he didn&#x27;t score, people think, &#x27;Well, he didn&#x27;t do anything&#x27;. But he was incredible and he was the force that got it done for us.&quot; Pistons center Ben Wallace remarked: &quot;He put his team on his shoulders and carried them to a championship. That&#x27;s what the great players do.&quot; Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining Michael Jordan, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to win it three times.
During the 2005–06 season, Duncan suffered from plantar fasciitis for most of the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.

The following season, however, was another championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per game in the regular season, and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the event. In the playoffs, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up a meeting with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio&#x27;s fourth ever championship. Duncan proclaimed that that championship was &quot;the best&quot; of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played &quot;sub-par&quot; and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten. His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the &quot;Tim Duncan era&quot;, and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: &quot;Tim is the common denominator. He&#x27;s [had] a different cast around him [in] &#x27;99, &#x27;03 and &#x27;05. He&#x27;s welcomed them all. ... But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in.&quot; Then-NBA commissioner David Stern added: &quot;[Duncan] is a player for the ages. I&#x27;m a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. OK, he wasn&#x27;t Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He just happens to be one of the greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them.&quot;

====Playoff disappointments (2007–2013)====
During the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Duncan was a member of the San Antonio team that won the Shooting Stars Competition. For the season, he played 78 games and posted his typical 20/10 numbers, San Antonio concluded the 2007–08 regular season with a 56–26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and New Orleans Hornets in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns—defeated by the Spurs in three of the past four seasons of playoffs—were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare three-pointer that sent the game into double overtime. The trio of Duncan, Ginóbili and Parker continued playing to form for the remainder of the series, and the Spurs eliminated the Suns in five games. In the first game of the next round against the Chris Paul-led Hornets, San Antonio was badly defeated 101–82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds. The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan putting up a team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series. Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6, and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7. However, arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.
Duncan started the 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his performance declined and he was subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis. Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili for most of the season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record. Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000.

With the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the 2009–10 season, they acquired Richard Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair, and Keith Bogans. The team got off to a 5–6 start, but a series of double-double performances by Duncan gave them a 9–6 record by the end of November. Duncan was subsequently named the Western Conference Player of the Week for the last week of November. Even at 34 years of age, he remained a constant 20–10 threat, being only one of three players in the league at the mid-season to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 21, 2010, Duncan was named as the starting forward for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. After securing yet another 50-win season, the Spurs qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, and defeated Dallas 4–2 in the first round, only to lose 4–0 to Phoenix in the next round.

Eleven games into the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs&#x27; all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the Spurs compiled a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, in a game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.
The Spurs again finished the 2011–12 season as the number one seed in the West—it was a lockout-shortened 66-game season—tying with the Chicago Bulls for a league-best 50–16 record. Prior to a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 24, 2012, head coach Gregg Popovich decided to give Duncan a night off by listing him on the official scorecard as &quot;DNP-OLD&quot;, poking fun at his 36-year-old body. Overall, Duncan&#x27;s numbers remained at par with the previous season. The triumvirate of Duncan-Parker-Ginóbili entered the 2012 NBA playoffs well-rested and healthy, and the Spurs swept the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers 4–0 in the first two rounds. On May 31, 2012, in the third game of the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Duncan set the record for most career blocks in playoffs history, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Spurs&#x27; playoff run came to an end when the Thunder defeated them 4–2.

On July 11, 2012, Duncan agreed to re-sign with the Spurs. Helped by a supporting cast comprising Danny Green, Tiago Splitter, Gary Neal and Kawhi Leonard that had been maturing steadily over the last two seasons, Duncan and the Spurs would again make the playoffs with a 58–24 regular season record. Duncan also returned to the All-Star line-up and was named to the All-NBA First Team. He finished the regular season with 23,785 career points, which broke George Gervin&#x27;s record for most points in a Spurs uniform (23,602). In the playoffs, the Spurs swept the Los Angeles Lakers, beat Golden State in six games and defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in a 4–0 sweep to reach the NBA Finals. In Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Duncan recorded his 500th playoff block, becoming the first player in NBA history to reach that milestone, although the NBA did not track blocks prior to the 1973–74 season. The Spurs met defending NBA champions Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in a tightly contested series. Miami had home court advantage, but San Antonio took the first game and headed into game 6 with a 3–2 lead. In that game, Duncan scored 25 points in the first half, his biggest haul in a half of an NBA Finals game. However, the Spurs lost the game in overtime, and then lost the deciding seventh game.

====Fifth championship (2013–2014)====
On December 2, 2013, Duncan became the oldest player to record a 20–20 game in NBA history, finishing with 23 points, 21 rebounds, and the game-winning jump shot against the Atlanta Hawks. The Spurs went on to conclude the 2013–14 regular season with a league-best 62 wins. The Spurs defeated Dallas in seven games in the first round of the playoffs, Portland in five games in the conference semifinals, and Oklahoma City in six games, where game 6 went into overtime, as the Spurs won, 112–107. They set up a Finals rematch against the Miami Heat, which they won, 4–1, setting a record margin for a win in the NBA Finals, for games 3 and 4. Along the way, the Duncan-Ginóbili-Parker trio broke the record for most wins in NBA playoffs history. After winning the Finals in five games, Duncan joined John Salley as the only players to win a championship in three different decades.

====Late career (2014–2016)====
On June 23, 2014, Duncan exercised his $10.3 million player option for the 2014–15 season. On November 14, 2014, Duncan scored his 25,000th point in the first half of the Spurs&#x27; 93–80 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the 19th player in NBA history to reach the milestone. On February 19, 2015, he passed Alex English to move into 16th place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list with 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers. On March 4, he recorded six rebounds against the Sacramento Kings, breaking his tie with Nate Thurmond for ninth in career rebounding. Two days later, he recorded three blocks against the Denver Nuggets to surpass Patrick Ewing for sixth overall in career blocks. On April 12, he played his 1,330th career game against the Phoenix Suns, which passed Moses Malone for 11th all-time. He also scored 22 points and passed Kevin Garnett to move into 14th place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list. The Spurs finished sixth in the Western Conference after 82 games and faced the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. Their quest for back-to-back championships was ended May 2 as they lost to the Clippers in seven games. Duncan was later named to the All-Defensive second team on May 20 for the seventh time in his career.

On July 9, 2015, Duncan re-signed with the Spurs to a two-year deal. On November 2, 2015, in a win over the New York Knicks, Duncan recorded 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in his NBA-record 954th victory with one team, surpassing John Stockton&#x27;s 953 wins with the Utah Jazz. On November 11, he pulled down the 14,716th rebound of his career against the Portland Trail Blazers to pass Robert Parish for seventh place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time rebounding list. On November 14, in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers, Duncan had five blocked shots to become the Spurs&#x27; franchise leader with 2,955 blocks, surpassing former teammate David Robinson&#x27;s career total of 2,954. Duncan also moved into fifth all-time on the NBA&#x27;s blocks list. After missing the Spurs&#x27; last three games of December due to rest and right knee soreness, Duncan returned to action on January 2, 2016, against the Houston Rockets. In his return game, Duncan was held scoreless for the first time in his 19-year career; giving him the most consecutive games with at least one point, at 1,359. Four days later, Duncan scored a then-season high 18 points in a 123–98 win over the Utah Jazz, helping the Spurs extend its franchise-record home winning streak to 30 straight regular season games dating to 2014–15. On February 10, he returned to the starting lineup after missing eight games with a sore knee. On February 27, in a win over the Houston Rockets, he became the fifth player in NBA history to reach 3,000 blocks. In addition, with six rebounds in the game, Duncan reached 14,971 for his career, surpassing Karl Malone (14,968) for sixth place in league history. On March 10, Duncan became the sixth player in league history with 15,000 rebounds, completing the feat midway through the first quarter of the Spurs&#x27; 109–101 win over the Chicago Bulls. On March 19, he came off the bench for only the third time in his career to counter the smaller lineup of the Golden State Warriors. With a win over the Warriors, the Spurs recorded their 35th straight home win of the season and their 44th straight at home dating to 2014–15, tied for the second-longest streak in NBA history with the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls. On April 5, in a win over the Utah Jazz, he became the third player with 1,000 victories in the regular season, following Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish. Duncan extended his mark as the NBA&#x27;s career leader in victories with one team. On April 8, he scored a season-high 21 points in a losing effort to the Denver Nuggets. Having already locked up second seed in the West with a franchise-best record (65–13 prior to Nuggets game), all four of Duncan&#x27;s starting teammates were rested. The Spurs went on to lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs.
On June 28, 2016, Duncan opted into his $5.6 million contract for the 2016–17 season. However, on July 11, 2016, he announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons with San Antonio. In September 2016, coach Gregg Popovich indicated that Duncan would have a coaching role with the team in the 2016–17 season.

On December 18, 2016, the Spurs retired Duncan&#x27;s No. 21 jersey in a postgame ceremony, making him the eighth Spur in franchise history to have his jersey retired.

==National team career==
In 1998, Duncan was selected as one of the last two players for the United States national team for the World Basketball Championship. However, this team was later replaced with CBA and college players because of the NBA lockout. Duncan&#x27;s first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but a knee injury forced him to stay out of the Olympic Games themselves.

In 2003, Duncan was also a member of the USA team that recorded ten wins and qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics. He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field. At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal. The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA players became eligible that the U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team lost a game in international competition and returned home without gold medals. After the tournament, Duncan was disappointed with team&#x27;s unpreparedness for the tournament and commented, &quot;I am about 95 percent sure my FIBA career is over. I&#x27;ll try not to share my experiences with anyone.&quot; In total, Duncan was a member of five USA Basketball teams and played in 40 games.

==Player profile==

Standing at and weighing , Duncan was a power forward who could also play center. With a double-double career average in points and rebounds, he was considered one of the most consistent players in the NBA throughout his career. Regarded as one of the league&#x27;s best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently as one of the top scorers, rebounders and shot-blockers in the league. At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players, while he led the charts in postseason point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his free throw shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.

Apart from these statistics, Duncan has gained a reputation as a clutch player, as evidenced by his three NBA Finals MVP awards and his playoff career averages being higher than his regular season statistics. Eleven-time NBA champion Bill Russell further complimented Duncan on his passing ability, and rated him as one of the most efficient players of his generation, a view shared by 19-time NBA All-Star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Because of his versatility and success, basketball experts widely consider Duncan to be the greatest power forward in NBA history, while coach Popovich and teammates Parker and Ginóbili have also credited much of San Antonio&#x27;s success to him. Duncan&#x27;s detractors, however, label him as &quot;boring&quot; because of his simple but effective style of play (thus earning him the nickname &quot;The Big Fundamental&quot;). Following his first championship ring in 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; described him as a &quot;quiet, boring MVP&quot;, a characterization which persists today.

Duncan himself commented on his &quot;boring&quot; image, stating, &quot;If you show excitement, then you also may show disappointment or frustration. If your opponent picks up on this frustration, you are at a disadvantage.&quot; Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented on his ability to relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but out-psychs his opponents. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal had high praise for Duncan&#x27;s on-court demeanor. &quot;The Spurs won because of Tim Duncan, a guy I could never break,&quot; O&#x27;Neal wrote in his autobiography. &quot;I could talk trash to Patrick Ewing, get in David Robinson&#x27;s face, get a rise out of Alonzo Mourning, but when I went at Tim he&#x27;d look at me like he was bored.&quot;

Duncan has stated that he especially likes his bank shot, saying: &quot;It is just easy for me. It just feels good.&quot; Additionally, Duncan&#x27;s close and longstanding relationship with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has been described as &quot;the greatest love story in sports&quot;.

===Honors===
During his basketball career, Duncan received a number of individual and team honors, including being a two-time MVP (2002, 2003), five-time NBA champion (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014), and three-time NBA Finals MVP (1999, 2003, 2005). As a college player, he was honored by the House of Representatives, named the ACC Male Athlete of the Year, won the John R. Wooden Award and Adolph Rupp Trophy, and was selected as the Naismith College Player of the Year in addition to player of the year honors from the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and &quot;Sporting News&quot; (all 1997). In 2002, Duncan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history. In his debut year in the NBA (1998), he was voted Rookie of the Year and elected into the All-Rookie Team. He has been named to 15 NBA All-Star teams (1997–98; 1999–2000 to 2010–11; 2012–13 and 2014–15), 15 All-NBA Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10, 2012–13, 2014–15; ten First Team nominations), and 15 All-Defensive Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10; 2012–13, 2014–15; eight First Team nominations). With these impressive performances, Duncan is one of only four players to receive All-NBA First Team honors in each of his first eight seasons (1998–2005), along with Hall-of-Famers Bob Pettit (ten seasons), Larry Bird (nine seasons), and Oscar Robertson (nine seasons), and is the only player in NBA history to receive All-NBA and All-Defensive honors in his first 13 seasons (1997–98 to 2009–10).

Duncan was also named by the Association for Professional Basketball Research as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Professional Basketball Players of the 20th Century&quot;, and is the youngest player on that list. In the 2001–02 season, he won the IBM Player Award and the &quot;Sporting News&quot; (TSN) MVP Award, becoming the third player to ever win the NBA MVP, IBM Player and TSN Player Awards in the same season. On February 18, 2006, he was named one of the &quot;Next 10 Greatest Players&quot; on the tenth anniversary of the release of the NBA&#x27;s 50th Anniversary All-Time Team by the TNT broadcasting crew. In 2009, Duncan was ranked 8th by &quot;Slam&quot; magazine in their list of the top 50 NBA players of all time, while &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named him its NBA Player of the Decade. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Duncan as the ninth greatest player in NBA history, the highest ranked power forward on the list.

On April 4, 2020, it was announced that Duncan would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 29. He was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

==Coaching career==
On July 22, 2019, the San Antonio Spurs announced that Duncan was named an assistant coach. He made his debut as acting head coach on March 3, 2020, leading the Spurs to a 104–103 comeback win over the Charlotte Hornets, which Popovich missed for personal reasons.

On November 12, 2020, Duncan stepped down as assistant coach of the Spurs.

==Personal life==

Duncan married Amy Sherrill in July 2001, and had two children before their divorce in August 2013. In 2017, Duncan and his girlfriend welcomed their first child.

In 2001, Duncan established the Tim Duncan Foundation to fund programs involving health awareness and research, education, and youth sports and recreation in San Antonio, Winston-Salem, and the United States Virgin Islands. The foundation&#x27;s major events have included the Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic. Between 2001 and 2002, the foundation raised more than $350,000 for breast and prostate cancer research. In those two years, Duncan was named by &quot;Sporting News&quot; as one of the &quot;Good Guys&quot; in sports. Duncan has also supported the Children&#x27;s Bereavement Center, the Children&#x27;s Center of San Antonio and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center. In August 2017, BlackJack Speed Shop, in partnership with The Tim Duncan Foundation, organized urgently needed supplies for victims of Hurricane Harvey.

Duncan cites his late mother as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme &quot;Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest/Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best&quot;, which he adopted as his personal motto. On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie. He chose No. 21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law&#x27;s college number, since he was Duncan&#x27;s main basketball inspiration. Duncan also cites Hall-of-Fame Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson as his childhood idol.

Duncan was honored with the Virgin Islands Medal of Honor, the highest award bestowed by the Virgin Islands territorial government, and has been celebrated in several &quot;Tim Duncan Day&quot; ceremonies. In 2000, Legislature of the Virgin Islands President Vargrave Richards said, &quot;He is a quiet giant. His laid-back attitude is the embodiment of the people of St. Croix, doing things without fanfare and hoopla.&quot;

Duncan enjoys Renaissance fairs and the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

In 2015, Duncan sued his former investment adviser Charles Banks, claiming over $20 million in losses. In September 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Banks on two counts of wire fraud related to the case. In April 2017, Banks pled guilty to wire fraud in the case; in June 2018, Duncan reached a settlement with Banks and received $7.5 million.

In March 2020, Duncan offered to pay for airline tickets for college students in the U.S. Virgin Islands to travel home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="221824" wikidata="Q3242854" url="?curid=221824" title="List of rock albums">
<text>This is a list of rock albums that are particularly notable or influential. It has been derived by compiling lists published by professional sources. Each album has appeared in at least two notable lists describing the most influential rock and roll albums. The numbers following each entry describe the sources, which are listed at the article&#x27;s key, which assigns each source a number. All the lists are self-described as &quot;rock and roll&quot; (or &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;rock music&quot; or other variants, though not more specific substyles like hard rock), though some artists would more commonly be described as reggae, blues, calypso, jazz, soul, country, funk, heavy metal or hip hop. Many of the lists are ranked, but this is not taken into account—all albums on a list are included with the same cross-reference number, whether they are ranked #1 or #100 on that particular list.

<text>In English civil litigation, costs are the lawyers&#x27; fees and disbursements of the parties.

In the absence of any order or directive regarding costs, each party is liable to pay their own solicitors&#x27; costs and disbursements such as a barrister&#x27;s fees; in case of dispute, the court has jurisdiction to assess and determine the proper amount. In legal aid cases, a similar assessment will determine the costs which the solicitors will be paid from the Legal Aid Fund.

In most courts and tribunals, generally after a final judgment has been given, and possibly after any interim application, the judge has the power to order any party (and in exceptional cases even a third party, or any of the lawyers personally) to pay some or all of other parties&#x27; costs. The law of costs defines how such allocation is to take place. Even when a successful party obtains an order for costs against an opponent, it is usual that he may nevertheless still have to pay his solicitors a balance between the costs recoverable from the opponent and the total chargeable by his solicitor; and if the loser is unable to pay, then the order for costs may be worthless, and the successful party will remain fully liable to their own solicitors.

==Costs &quot;follow the event&quot;==
The law of costs in England and Wales is typical of common law jurisdictions, save that of the United States.

In the small fraction of cases that do not settle and instead proceed to a judgment, generally costs &quot;follow the event&quot; so that the successful party is entitled to seek an order that the unsuccessful party pay his or her costs. Should a case settle, then the parties can seek to agree costs, with the general rule that the losing party pays costs. This is the general rule as set out in CPR 44.2(2)(a).

===Costs orders===
The order that a judge gives as to costs determines who will be the paying and who the receiving party. The amount of costs remains to be determined by assessment if not agreed. Common costs orders, other than on the Small Claims Track, include the following:

====Interim costs====
As a general rule, after judgment has been handed down, the court &quot;will&quot; order one party to make an advance payment towards the other side&#x27;s costs. This will be done even before the costs claim has been finalised.

The amount that will be ordered is based upon the parties&#x27; disclosed costs estimates, and will take into account the percentage of costs that have been ordered to be paid; any order for Indemnity Basis costs, if relevant, and any costs that are due to the paying party.

===Wasted costs===
These are defined as &quot;costs incurred by a party—

:(a) as a result of any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or omission on the part of any legal or other representative or any employee of such a representative; or

:(b) which, in the light of any such act or omission occurring after they were incurred, the court considers it is unreasonable to expect that party to pay&quot;

These costs will include the situation in which a party has incurred unnecessarily due to the other side&#x27;s conduct. For example, if a court hearing is postponed due to one party not turning up at court. As a result, the other party had to pay a brief fee for a barrister, for a hearing that ultimately did not take place. Other instances includes failure to follow practice directions, and in some cases, acting in an unnecessarily belligerent manner.

In Hong Kong (and many other Common Law jurisdiction), during the pre-Civil Justice Reforms era, &#x27;macho&#x27;, &#x27;tough&#x27; and &#x27;aggressive&#x27; litigators may be prized by lay-clients. However, with the implementation of the Civil Justice Reforms (CJR), &#x27;macho&#x27;, &#x27;tough&#x27; and &#x27;aggressive&#x27; litigators may end up causing more harm to their clients. Willingness to reconcile and compromise is, therefore, the new king in Hong Kong&#x27;s new litigation landscape where the laws requires legal practitioners to advice their clients the importance of settlement negotiations. This was illustrated by the Patrick Wang Ho Yin cost order.

===Security for costs===

Security for costs is a common law legal concept of application only in costs jurisdictions, and is an order sought from a court in litigation. These are now governed by Part 25 of the Civil Procedure Rules.

The general rule in costs jurisdiction is that &quot;costs follow the event&quot;. In other words, the loser in legal proceedings must pay the legal costs of the successful party. Where a defendant has a reasonable apprehension that its legal costs will not be paid for by the claimant if the defendant is successful, the defendant can apply to the court for an order that the claimant provide security for costs. Furthermore, the amount that is ordered by the judge is in direct correlation to the strength or weakness of the claimant&#x27;s case brought herewith. The weaker the probability of the claimant prevailing, the higher the security order.

Typically a claimant will be outside the jurisdiction of the court: the law of security for costs recognises that orders of the court relating to payment of a party&#x27;s legal costs can be very difficult to enforce in non-common law jurisdictions, and so will order security to be provided. Security can also be ordered where a claimant is insolvent, or prone to vexatious litigation.

Security is usually provided in the form of a bank cheque paid into the court, or held in a trust account operated jointly by both the claimant&#x27;s and defendant&#x27;s lawyers. If the defendant is successful, the money can be applied against the costs order. If the claimant is successful, the security is returned to the claimant.

===Comparison with other countries===
The law of costs is often known as the English rule and is contrasted with the American rule—the general rule in the United States that legal fees may be sought only if the parties agree by contract before the litigation, or if some special act or statute allows the successful party to seek such fees. Federal district court and Court of Appeals judges award costs to the prevailing party under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Generally, U.S. state court judges have no common law right to award such fees against the losing party. It has been suggested that the American rule contributes to making the U.S. a litigious society. Individuals have little to lose beyond filing fees and a retainer to start a lawsuit, and they are not at risk of having to pay their opponent&#x27;s fees if they lose.

Conversely, the English rule has been criticised. Critics point out that it potentially hinders access to justice by increasing the risks of litigation—both by setting up the risk of having to pay both parties&#x27; full costs in the event of losing, and by creating incentives for parties to sink increasing resources into their cases to win the action and avoid paying fees, thereby increasing the overall cost-risk of litigation. This strategy cannot succeed under the American rule.

The German costs rule, which allows for fixed recoverable costs, avoids this unfortunate consequence of full-fees recovery.

The difference between the English and American rules has been the subject of considerable academic discussion, including attempts to try and build economic models to determine the effect of the rules on claimant behaviour.

Hong Kong generally follows the English Rule.

===What can be claimed?===
Recoverable costs are limited to:
*Fees and charges of the solicitor (attorney), which may be hourly, daily or an agreed sum;
*Disbursements, including barristers&#x27;/counsels&#x27; fees;
*Witness allowances (conduct money), including fees paid to expert witnesses;
*Some professional fees for non-witnesses; 
*VAT (where chargeable);
*Lawyers&#x27; &quot;success fees&quot; allowable by the court under a valid conditional fee agreement (CFA); and
*After-the-event insurance premium.

===The indemnity principle===
In English costs law the indemnity principle is the concept that a receiving party is unable to recover more than the costs for which they are liable to pay themselves, in costs of the litigation. It is unrelated the indemnity basis, being one of the bases on which the court may award costs (below). 

The principle was originally explained in &quot;Harold v Smith&quot; (1860) 5 Hurlestone &amp; Norman 381:&quot;“Costs as between party and party are given by the law as an indemnity to the person entitled to: they are not imposed as a punishment on the party who pays them, nor given as a bonus to the party who receives them.”&quot;In other words, a recovery of costs is viewed not as a reward or bonus, but as an award of indemnity to the party that has incurred the costs.

The &#x27;limit&#x27; as to what a receiving party may recover is determined by what they are &quot;liable&quot; to pay, as opposed to what they may have actually paid in legal fees. As long as there is liability for the receiving party to pay some amount (for example, pursuant to a retainer with their solicitor), a receiving party can seek to recover costs up to such amount—it is irrelevant whether the liability is enforced.

====Exceptions====
The principle causes anomalies for &quot;pro bono&quot; representation where, because the lawyers have agreed to represent the party for no cost, they cannot subsequently ask the court for a costs award when they win. However, since 2008 &quot;s. 194 Legal Services Act 2007&quot; allows the court to order a party who loses against &quot;pro bono&quot; representation to make an appropriate charitable donation &quot;in lieu&quot; of costs.

There are also specific exceptions to the principle for:
*In-house lawyers;
*Conditional fee agreements;
*Legal aid; and
*Litigants in person.
===Exceptions===
The rule that &quot;costs follow the event&quot; is observed on the Multi- and Fast Tracks.

However, the judge has considerable discretion to apply or disapply these rules if the result would otherwise be unjust. The paying party can appeal against the costs order by the usual routes of appeal.

====Small claims track====
If a case is allocated to the Small Claims Track, only specific limited costs such as fixed court fees are usually awarded.

====Fast-track trials====
On the Fast Track, the actual costs of the trial, as opposed to preparatory work, are fixed.

====Fixed costs and fees====
There are also fixed costs for road traffic accident (RTA) claims that settle before they are issued; and in certain cases brought by HM Revenue &amp; Customs.

In addition, where both the current &quot;CPR 48&quot; and old &quot;CPR 45&quot; apply, there are fixed success fees in personal injury claims arising from RTAs; injuries at work; and industrial disease claims. These range from 12.5% in RTAs to 100%, in each type of case, if a trial occurs.

====Costs limits====
In certain Fast-Track or Multi-Track cases, a successful party&#x27;s costs claim will be limited.

These include cases that are conducted in the Patents County Court or in claims under the Aarhus Convention.

====Formal offers to settle====
The court will take account of the conduct of the parties and may vary the usual costs order in the event of misguided or dishonest behaviour. In particular, the claimant is expected to give the defendant an opportunity to settle, and the parties are expected to exchange essential information and details before starting a claim. The court will especially be aware of any formal offers to settle made under Part 36 of the Civil Procedure Rules. Such offers are withheld from the judge during the trial but, during assessment of costs, the judge will compare them with the final damages awarded.

=====Acceptance of offers=====

If a Part 36 offer is accepted, or if the claimant discontinues, the unsuccessful party is usually liable for both parties&#x27; costs to that date.

=====Rejection of offers=====

If offers are rejected, and the case goes to trial, then one of the following situations can apply.

:If the defendant rejected the claimant&#x27;s Part 36 offer to settle, then:
:* If the claimant is awarded a sum that is &quot;at least as advantageous&quot; as that offer, then the claimant is entitled to each of the following:
:::Indemnity Basis costs (defined in a separate section further below) from the date the offer expires;
:::Punitive interest, up to 10% above base rate, on the whole or part of any sum awarded, for some or all of the time at issue; and
:::An &quot;additional amount&quot; of up to £75,000 (only if the Part 36 offer dates from 1 April 2013).
:* If there is a judgment for the claimant that is less than the offer, then the general rules apply: the claimant is entitled to standard-basis costs plus interest.
:* If there is a judgment for the defendant that is less than the offer, then the general rules apply: the defendant is entitled to standard-basis costs plus interest.

:If the Claimant rejected the defendant&#x27;s offer to settle, then:
:* If the Claimant failed &#x27;to obtain a judgment that is more advantageous&#x27; than that offer at trial, then the defendant is entitled to, from the date that the offer expired:
:::Standard Basis costs;
:::Interest on the costs.
:* If there is a judgment for the claimant that exceeds the offer, then the general rules apply: the claimant is entitled to Standard Basis costs plus interest.

The unsuccessful party is generally also liable for both parties&#x27; costs up to the date that the Part 36 offer expires, on the Standard Basis, plus interest.

=====Discontinued claims=====
If the claimant discontinues, they are usually liable for both parties&#x27; costs to the date of discontinuance, on the Standard Basis.

====Qualified one-way costs-shifting====
In personal injury or fatal accident cases since 1 April 2013, there is a further exception to the costs-shifting rules known as &quot;Qualified One-Way Costs-Shifting&quot;.

If this applies then orders for costs against the claimant can normally only be enforced by a defendant if the total doesn&#x27;t exceed the amount of damages and costs which a Defendant has to pay out.

However, it can be enforced in full without the court&#x27;s permission if the claim was struck-out because: 
:(a) the claimant has disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the proceedings;
:(b) the proceedings are an abuse of the court’s process; or
:(c) the conduct of –
::(i) the claimant; or
::(ii) a person acting on the claimant’s behalf and with the claimant’s knowledge of such conduct,
:is likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings.

The court&#x27;s permission to enforce in full is required if the claim was found at trial to be &quot;fundamentally dishonest&quot;. If the claim was discontinued, the court can order a hearing to determine whether it was &quot;fundamentally dishonest&quot; to bring it.

====Other situations====
Other exceptions to the general rules include:
*Applications to extend time limits, usually paid by the applicant;
*Amendments to statements of case, usually paid by the amending party, including the costs of the other side&#x27;s resulting amendments; and
*Failure to respond to a notice to admit where the receiving party will usually pay the costs of proving the facts alleged.

===Who can claim costs?===
As a general rule, the losing party pays the costs of the winning party, but the court can order otherwise.

====In-house lawyers====
The rule also covers in-house corporate legal teams that conduct litigation and have rights of audience. They can claim the remuneration and expenses of the lawyers involved at the rates that external solicitors could claim, even though their fees would be paid as part of the company&#x27;s overheads.

====Litigants in person====
Litigants in person will be awarded a fixed hourly rate of £19 per hour, unless they can prove that they have incurred a financial loss in conducting the action. Practitioners (when suing or sued) have sometimes been observed to abuse existing rules where they would purport to have had their own firm act for them (even though the arrangement is essentially the same as an act in person). The problem being of course is that they can essentially profit when conducting their own litigation. This has resulted in solicitor-litigants being observed to lack sincerity when negotiating for a settlement (hoping that the litigation will continue on for longer and thus resulting in more fees for themselves) as illustrated in the case of Patrick Wang Ho Yin. In that case, Mr. Justice Andrew Li observed&quot;...&quot;I agree that there was &quot;some&quot; evidence to suggest that P [Patrick Wang Ho Yin], in his capacity as the handling solicitor, might not have been very sincere or genuine in his attempts to negotiate for the settlement... I find, P, by issuing the Summons even before proper negotiations with D1 had taken place, had conducted the matter in an oppressive manner. For example, before the parties even concluded their first round of negotiations on some matters which could only be described as &quot;a trivial&quot; in late June 2017, P in his email dated 26 June 2017 to D1&#x27;s former solicitors, stated that &quot;our client’s sincerity for amicable solutions between the parties has already been exhausted ... we hereby reserve out client’s rights to apply for the direction of the court and commence civil proceedings for contempt of court, if any&quot; (emphasis added).&quot;&quot;The costs awarded to a litigant in person cannot exceed two-thirds of what could be claimed by a professional lawyer.

==Assessment of costs==

===Reasonableness===
All claims for costs must be &quot;reasonably incurred&quot; or &quot;reasonable in amount&quot;. if costs are specified as being paid as part of a contract, they are presumed to be reasonable, unless the contract says otherwise. Reasonableness is assessed against &quot;all the circumstances&quot; and in particular the &quot;seven pillars of wisdom&quot;:
*Conduct of the parties:
**Before as well as during proceedings;
**Efforts made to resolve the dispute;
*Value of the property at issue;
*Importance of the matter to the parties;
*Complexity, difficulty or novelty of the case;
*Skill, effort, specialised knowledge or responsibility required;
*Time spent on the case;
*Geographical location where the work was done.

===Basis of costs assessment===

There are two basic ways in which the court will assess a claim for costs: the Standard Basis and the Indemnity Basis. However, in each situation, the claim must be reasonable.

The manner in that they are assessed goes a long way in determining the overall percentage that will be allowed.

====Standard Basis====

Costs awarded on the Standard Basis must be &quot;proportionate to the matters in issue&quot;. Any doubt as to the costs is resolved in favour of the paying party.

====Indemnity Basis====

Costs awarded on the Indemnity Basis need not be &quot;proportionate&quot;. Any doubt as to the costs is resolved in favour of the receiving party.

As a whole, an award for costs on the Indemnity Basis is much more favourable to the receiving party than an award of the Standard Basis.

For example, in the case of Patrick Wang Ho Yin, Mr. Wang was ordered to pay $375,000 for a half-day hearing after the Court has found it reasonable to impose liability on an indemnity basis. In this case, the Court has found that Mr. Wang&#x27;s belligerent conduct has caused the parties to have incurred costs of which could have been avoidable.

===Proportionality===
In considering whether or not a party&#x27;s claim for costs is &quot;proportionate&quot;, the court has to apply one of two different tests.

====The old test====
This applies where work is done before 1 April 2013, or to the whole of the costs in &quot;cases commenced&quot;, i.e. if proceedings are issued, before 1 April 2013.

In these situations, the court should have regard to the seven pillars of wisdom. The court should adopt a two-stage approach:
# Compare the total costs claimed against the total benefits gained by the successful party:
#If the total costs are proportionate to the total benefits:
:a) Perform an item by item test of reasonableness;
— if they are not proportionate:
:b) Perform an item by item test of necessity.

====The new test====
If the work was done since 1 April 2013, and relates to a case that either does not involve court proceedings, or was issued since 1 April 2013, then a different test applies.

In these situations, the court will hold that costs &quot;are proportionate if they bear a reasonable relationship to –
:(a) the sums in issue in the proceedings;
:(b) the value of any non-monetary relief in issue in the proceedings;
:(c) the complexity of the litigation;
:(d) any additional work generated by the conduct of the paying party; and
:(e) any wider factors involved in the proceedings, such as reputation or public importance&quot;.

In addition, the &quot;necessity&quot; of the costs is not relevant.

===Costs estimates===
In cases issued before 1 April 2013, parties have to give estimates of their likely costs should the case reach a trial. They are used to give each side and the Court an idea of what the likely costs burden would be.

These are submitted at the allocation and listing stage, and at any time that the Court orders them.

A party that has costs awarded in their favour will not be limited to their estimate, but if the costs claimed exceed the estimate by 20% they will need to provide reasons. If the paying party has shown that they relied on the estimated, the Court can use the estimate as evidence that the claim is disproportionate.

===Costs budgets===
If a case is issued since 1 April 2013, and is allocated to the Multi-track, the parties can be forced to submit a budget for their costs, which the court can then approve. They do not apply to proceedings in the Admiralty; Chancery Division; or Commercial Court; or to cases in the Mercantile Court or Technology &amp; Construction Court where damages exceed £10 million.

====Impact and effect====

The rules relating to costs budgets are more stringent than those relating to estimates.

All parties must file a budget, unless they are a litigant in person. If a party does not file a budget, it &quot;will be treated&quot; as only budgeting for the costs of any appropriate court fees. The costs of preparing a budget can be claimed, up to a maximum of £1,000 or 1% of the budget&#x27;s total, whichever is greater.

If the Court approves or the parties agree a Costs Budget a Costs Management Order is usually made. Where the parties become aware that their costs are likely to exceed the amount of the Costs Management Order they should apply to the court to vary where &quot;significant developments&quot; warrant that application. 

Should a party exceed its budget, their costs will be limited to their last approved budget on assessment unless there is a &quot;good reason&quot;. It has been held that &quot;good reasons&quot; include the fact that the costs were otherwise &quot;reasonable and proportionate&quot;; and where there was a simple &quot;tick-box&quot; error. Costs exceeding the budget have been disallowed where a party has not applied to have its budget increased during the proceedings.

If the court has not been able to approve a party&#x27;s budget, for example, due to the case settling before it was able to do so, then different rules apply. However, these rules are similar to those relating to estimates: if a party&#x27;s costs claim exceeds its budget by 20%, then the difference must be explained. The paying party must also show how they have relied on the estimate. If the court agrees with the paying party, it can limit the costs to the budget; and if it disagrees with the receiving party it can use the difference as evidence the costs are &quot;unreasonable or disproportionate&quot;.

However, should a party ultimately be awarded costs on the Indemnity Basis, then the budget is not relevant in relation to those costs.

The rules relating to costs budgets will be amended as of 1 October 2020 so that, in addition to the test of significant developments, the court may vary the budget if one party is acting oppressively by causing the other party to incur costs. Those same changes introduce a new form Precedent T which must be served and filed to explain the significant developments in the case.

===&quot;Inter partes&quot; costs===
Where a party is awarded costs against another they are known as inter partes costs or between party costs.

Such costs are usually assessed on the standard basis. The successful party may not be awarded the entirety of their legal costs, as the costs incurred will be assessed by an officer of the court. This can be done in one of two ways.

====Summary assessment====
The simplified procedure is known as summary assessment under which the court will consider a schedule of the costs incurred which will usually be no more than two pages long and is often only a single page. This is the usual method on the Fast Track, for hearings lasting no longer than a single day, for certain appeal hearings and for the costs of the paying party in detailed assessment hearings.

However, summary assessment is not permitted for claims:
*On behalf of children or mental patients; or
*Funded by the Legal Services Commission;
— or where:
*Paying party can raise substantial grounds; or
*Costs have been agreed by the parties.

====Detailed assessment====

For more complex cases a process, formerly called a taxation of costs, now known as detailed assessment, is used. It is unrelated to &quot;tax&quot; in the sense of a method of raising government revenue. The successful party must file with the court (unless the other party fails to respond to the notice of assessment) a detailed breakdown of the costs and disbursements incurred, known as a bill of costs which sets out the successful party&#x27;s claim. The bill is usually prepared by a law costs draftsman, whose skill is often as essential to the successful recovery of costs as the skill of a solicitor or barrister is essential to success on the principal issues of the litigation. An officer of the court, costs judge or district judge will then assess the reasonableness of the costs (unless the potential paying party failed to respond to the notice of assessment) with reference to a statutory schedule of limits of entitlements of costs, together with legal precedents, unless the costs can be agreed between the parties. The level of reduction can mean that the bill is reduced in some instances substantially, but in most cases at least 80% of the costs originally sought will be allowed. A court order for costs is enforceable as a debt against the unsuccessful party.

The detailed assessment process itself involved the Receiving Party serving the itemised Bill of Costs on the Paying Party, together with a Notice of Commencement (also known as an N252). Within 21 days of service (unless an extension is agreed), the Paying Party will need to submit their written legal submissions by way of Points of Dispute, to which the Receiving Party can respond with Points of Reply. Negotiations can take place at any time during the detailed assessment process however, if agreement cannot be reached, then the Receiving Party will need to apply for assessment (either provisional on the papers, or an attended oral hearing) for the Court to determine the costs payable.

Either party can appeal against a detailed assessment, to a costs judge or district judge of the High Court if the assessment was made by a court officer, or by the usual routes of appeal if the assessment was made by a judge.

=====Provisional assessment=====
If a bill of costs of under £75,000 is sent for a detailed assessment since 1 April 2013, it will at first be assessed via provisional assessment procedure. (unless the potential paying party failed to respond to the notice of assessment).

This involves an assessment by the Judge on paper, without the parties being present, and the costs of it are limited to £1,500.

If either party disagrees with the outcome they can apply for an oral hearing, but unless they beat the provisional figure by 20%, they will be liable for the costs of the hearing.

===Solicitor/own client costs===
The other type of costs, aside from inter partes costs, is called solicitor-client costs and are usually assessed on the indemnity basis. However, costs are presumed to be reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount if the client gave their express or implied approval, but are presumed to be unreasonably incurred if the client was not told they would be recovered from the other side and if they are unusual.

Unless instructed under a damages-based agreement, lawyers in England and Wales are not permitted to work for a share of damages awarded as this would amount to champerty. A client who is unhappy with a lawyer&#x27;s invoice for services can apply to the court for an order or invoke a statutory procedure whereby the costs are assessed for their reasonableness by an officer of the court, for example a judge. This is also a &quot;detailed assessment&quot;. If the client does not pay the lawyer, the lawyer has a cause of action if the client does not elect to arbitrate the bill.

There is a statutory time limit on applying for such a procedure, of a year. The frequent result is that the lawyer&#x27;s invoice is decreased. If the bill is reduced by one fifth or more the solicitor will pay for the process of assessment, but otherwise the client will pay. The client can alternatively apply to the Law Society for a remuneration certificate in respect of costs arising from other than litigation.

==Specific types of funding==
Any case can be funded by a standard retainer agreement, i.e. where the solicitor agrees to act and the client pays as the case carries on.

There are also other ways in which a case can be funded, as long as certain requirements are met.

===Conditional fee agreements (CFAs)===
These are commonly referred to as &quot;no win, no fee&quot; agreements. Under this type of agreement, the solicitor and/or barrister agrees not to charge the client unless the case succeeds.

If the client does win their case, then the solicitor and/or barrister is entitled to claim a percentage bonus (a &quot;success fee&quot;) on top of their usual fees.

To be valid, the CFA agreement must comply with certain requirements. All CFAs must:
* Be in writing
* Not relate to proceedings that cannot be the subject of an enforceable conditional fee agreement
* Comply with any requirements prescribed by the Lord Chancellor

However, what can be claimed under it, and other additional requirements that may have to be met for the CFA to be valid, depend upon the date of the CFA.

====CFAs dated from 1 April 2000 to 31 October 2005====
If the CFA was entered into between these dates, the &quot;Conditional Fee Agreements Regulations 2000&quot; must also be complied with.

The main requirement is that before entering into the CFA the solicitor must advise the client, amongst other things, as to its effect; of alternative funding methods; and whether he has any interest in nay particular insurance policy.

If these regulations are not complied with, the CFA will not be valid.

If they are complied with, it will be valid and a success fee can be claimed from the other side, as long as they are informed of its existence.

====CFAs dated from 1 November 2005 to 31 March 2013====
Only the requirements of &quot;s. 58 Courts and Legal Services Act 1990&quot; need to be complied with.

If so, then it will be valid and a success fee can be claimed from the other side, as long as they are informed of its existence.

====CFAs dated from 1 April 2013====

If a CFA is entered into from this date then, unless the claim is for defamation; breach of privacy; diffuse mesothelioma, or is in a set of insolvency proceedings, a success fee cannot be claimed from the other side.

It can still be claimed from the client, but in personal injury claims is subject to a 25% limit of the client&#x27;s damages.

The solicitors&#x27; or barrister&#x27;s normal fees can still be claimed from the other side.

===Collective conditional fee agreements (CCFAs)===
A CCFA is CFA that covers numerous people, for example, members of a trade union, in relation to different claims, which could occur at different times.

The rules relating to CFAs generally apply to CCFAs, but, in relation to success fees, the following rules apply to CCFAs:

:If the CCFA dates from 1 April 2013, then a success fee cannot be recovered from the other side;
:If the CCFA pre-dates 1 April 2013, then a success fee can only be recovered from the other side if work was done before 1 April 2013

===Insurance policies===
Most litigants will have the benefit of some form of insurance will cover both their legal costs, and those of the other side.

However, both types will be subject to an upper limit on the amount of costs covered.

====Before-the-event (BTE) policies====
This kind of insurance policy before-the-event (BTE) against paying the other party&#x27;s legal costs as part of their domestic or automobile insurance policies (although many are unaware of it).

The premium for this type of policy cannot be claimed from the other side.

====After-the-event (ATE) policies====
If a litigation does not have a BTE policy, they can purchase after-the-event (ATE) legal expenses insurance at the start of litigation.

If the policy was taken out before 1 April 2013, the premium can be claimed from the other side as part of a normal claim for costs.

However, if it was taken out since 1 April 2013, it can only be recovered if it was taken out to cover the costs of an expert&#x27;s report in a claim for clinical negligence.

===Damages-based agreements (DBAs)===
These are a type of contingency fee, i.e. the solicitor and barrister agree to take a percentage of the client&#x27;s damages if the claim succeeds.

They generally have to comply with the &quot;Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013&quot;, and there is a maximum percentage that can be claimed varies depending on the type of claim and the level of court that the DBA relates to. The solicitors&#x27; disbursements can also be claimed.

====Employment claims====
If a DBA pre-dates 1 April 2013, then the &quot;Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2010&quot; apply. If not, then the 2013 Regulations apply.

However, there is no significant difference between the two sets, because in both situations, the solicitors and barristers&#x27; fees are limited to 35% of the client&#x27;s damages.

In addition, before entering into the DBA, the client must be given information relating to funding, mediation, and when the fee becomes payable.

====Non-employment claims====
Different rules apply to non-employment cases funded by a DBA: specifically, the client does not have to be provided the information needed in employment cases, and the percentage fee varies.

=====First-instance cases=====
If the DBA is entered into in a personal injury claim, then up to 25% of the client&#x27;s damages plus Counsel&#x27;s fees can be claimed.

In other cases, up to 50% of the client&#x27;s damages, including Counsel&#x27;s fees can be claimed.

=====Appeals=====
If the DBA relates to an appeal, then up to 100% of the client&#x27;s damages can be charged as the fee.

==Costs against other parties==

===Costs in third-party claims===
Sometimes a defendant brings a claim, for a contribution or an indemnity towards damages, against a third party. For example, a diner claims against a restaurant for a dose of food poisoning and the restaurant claims against their supplier of shellfish. Again, &quot;costs follow the event&quot;. If the restaurant successfully defends the claim, they pay the supplier&#x27;s costs and recover the same amount from the unsuccessful claimant. This can cause injustice when the unsuccessful claimant is insolvent and the successful defendant is still liable for third-party costs. The courts will only rarely allow a &quot;cut through&quot; of the third-party&#x27;s costs to the claimant but the interests of justice prevail.

===Costs against non-parties===
The courts have a wide discretion in awarding costs, and non-parties are not immune, unless they are a BTE insurer.

This is particularly relevant in cases of champerty and maintenance.

==Criminal proceedings==
If a defendant is found to be innocent of a crime, then they are also entitled to claim their incurred legal costs, but the costs are payable out of money raised through taxes.

A bill of costs is submitted in the normal way, but the costs are assessed by the National Taxing Team in a manner similar to a claim for costs in a civil case.

Costs assessed in this way do not require a formal detailed assessment, but any amount awarded can be appealed in the usual way.

===Proceedings commenced before October 2012===
If a prosecution started before October 2012, then the costs will be assessed with no general restrictions on what can be claimed.

===Proceedings commenced since October 2012===
If a prosecution has started since 1 October 2012, then the amount that can be claimed is much lower. Effectively, the costs are limited to legal aid rates.

<doc id="221839" wikidata="Q181312" url="?curid=221839" title="Stalagmite">
<text>A stalagmite (, ; ; )
is a type of rock formation that rises from the floor of a cave due to the accumulation of material deposited on the floor from ceiling drippings. Stalagmites are typically composed of calcium carbonate, but may consist of lava, mud, peat, pitch, sand, sinter, and amberat (crystallized urine of pack rats).

The corresponding formation hanging down from the ceiling of a cave is a stalactite.

==Formation and type==
===Limestone stalagmites===
The most common stalagmites are speleothems, which usually form in limestone caves. Stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the cavern. They form through deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions. Limestone is the chief form of calcium carbonate rock, which is dissolved by water that contains carbon dioxide, forming a calcium bicarbonate solution in caverns. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the water must be greater than the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the cave chamber for conventional stalagmite growth.

If stalactites – the ceiling formations – grow long enough to connect with stalagmites on the floor, they form a column.

To preserve Stalagmites, it should normally not be touched, since the rock buildup is formed by minerals precipitating out of the water solution onto the existing surface; skin oils can alter the surface tension where the mineral water clings or flows, thus affecting the growth of the formation. Oils and dirt (mud, clay) from human contact can also stain the formation and change its color permanently.

===Lava stalagmites===
Another type of stalagmite is formed in lava tubes while molten and fluid lava is still active inside. Their mineralogical composition, close to that of siliceous minerals commonly found in basalt (for example, obsidian), the main constituent of volcanic glass, is different. Their mechanism of formation/crystallization is also notably different from that of limestone stalagmites () but the common point is that it remains driven by gravity. Drops of molten lava (siliceous material, ) solidify onto the floor of the already emptied lava tube, when the lava temperature sufficiently decreases after the passage and the complete purge of the main lava flow. Essentially, it is still the gravity deposition of material onto the floor of a cave (or a void).

However the difference from calcareous stalagmites is that the transport of siliceous material occurs in the molten state and not dissolved in aqueous solution; degassing does not play any significant role. With lava stalagmites, their formation also happens very quickly in only a matter of hours, days, or weeks, whereas limestone stalagmites may take up to thousands or hundred thousands of years. A key difference with lava stalagmites is that once the molten lava has ceased flowing, so too will the stalagmites cease to grow. This means that if the lava stalagmites were to be broken, they would never grow back. Stalagmites in lava tubes are rarer than their stalactite counterparts because during their formation, the dripping molten material most often falls onto still-moving lava flow which absorbs or carries the material away.

The generic term &quot;lavacicle&quot; has been applied to lava stalactites and stalagmites indiscriminately, and evolved from the word &quot;icicle&quot;.

===Ice stalagmites===
A common stalagmite found seasonally or year round in many caves is the ice stalagmite, commonly referred to as icicles, especially in above-ground contexts. Water seepage from the surface will penetrate into a cave and if temperatures are below freezing temperature, the water will collect on the floor into stalagmites. Deposition may also occur directly from the freezing of water vapor. Similar to lava stalagmites, ice stalagmites form very quickly within hours or days. Unlike lava stalagmites however, they may grow back as long as water and temperatures are suitable. Ice stalagmites are more common than their stalactite counterparts because warmer air rises to the ceilings of caves and may raise temperatures to above freezing.

Ice stalactites may also form corresponding stalagmites below them, and given time, may grow together to form an ice column.

===Concrete derived stalagmites===

Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors, although they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment.

The secondary deposits derived from concrete are the result of concrete degradation, where calcium ions are leached out of the concrete in solution and redeposited on the underside of a concrete structure to form stalactites and stalagmites. Calcium carbonate deposition as a stalagmite occurs when the solution carries the calcium laden leachate solution to the ground under the concrete structure. Carbon dioxide is absorbed into the alkaline leachate solution, which facilitates the chemical reactions to deposit calcium carbonate as a stalagmite. These stalagmites rarely grow taller than a few centimetres.

Secondary deposits, which create stalagmites, stalactites, flowstone etc., outside the natural cave environment, are referred to as &quot;calthemites&quot;. These concrete derived secondary deposits cannot be referred to as &quot;speleothems&quot; due to the definition of the word.

==Records==
The largest known stalagmite in the world exceeds in height and is in Sơn Đoòng Cave, Vietnam.

In the Zagros Mountains of south Iran, approximately from the ancient city of Bishapur, in the Shapur cave on the fourth of five terraces stands the 3rd-century colossal statue of Shapur I, second ruler of the Sassanid Empire. The statue, carved from one stalagmite, is nearly high.

<doc id="221840" wikidata="Q465492" url="?curid=221840" title="Crooked House">
<text>Crooked House is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in March 1949 and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 23 May of the same year.

The action takes place in and near London in the autumn of 1947. Christie said the titles of this novel and &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot; were her favourites amongst her own works.

==Title meaning==
The title refers to a nursery rhyme (&quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot;), a common theme of the author. Narrator Charles&#x27;s fiancée Sophia says it refers not to dishonesty, but rather &quot;we hadn&#x27;t been able to grow up independent... twisted and twining&quot;, meaning unhealthily interdependent on the intensely strong personality of the family patriarch, Aristide Leonides.

==Plot introduction==
Three generations of the Leonides family live together under wealthy patriarch Aristide. His first wife Marcia died; her sister Edith has cared for the household since then. His second wife is the indolent Brenda, decades his junior, suspected of having a clandestine love affair with Laurence, the grandchildren&#x27;s tutor. After Aristide is poisoned by his own eye medicine (eserine), his granddaughter Sophia tells narrator and fiancé Charles Hayward that they cannot marry until the killer is apprehended. Charles&#x27;s father, &quot;The Old Man&quot;, is Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard, so Charles investigates from the inside along with assigned detective Chief Inspector Taverner.

==Plot summary==
Towards the end of the Second World War, Charles Hayward is in Cairo and falls in love with Sophia Leonides, a smart, successful Englishwoman who works for the Foreign Office. They put off getting engaged until the end of the war when they will be reunited in England.

Hayward returns home and reads a death notice in &quot;The Times&quot;: Sophia&#x27;s grandfather, the wealthy entrepreneur Aristide Leonides, has died, aged 87. Due to the war, the whole family has been living with him in a sumptuous but ill-proportioned house called &quot;Three Gables&quot;, the crooked house of the title. The autopsy reveals that Leonides was poisoned with his own eserine-based eye medicine via an insulin injection. Sophia tells Charles that she can&#x27;t marry him until the matter is cleared up.

The obvious suspects are Brenda Leonides, Aristide&#x27;s much younger second wife, and Laurence Brown, a conscientious objector who has been living in the house as private tutor to Sophia&#x27;s younger brother and sister, Eustace and Josephine. They are rumoured to have been carrying on an illicit love affair under old Leonides&#x27;s nose. The family members hope these two prove to be the murderers because they despise Brenda as a gold digger and also hope to escape the scandal that a different outcome would bring. Charles agrees to help his father, an assistant commissioner of Scotland Yard, to investigate the crime. He becomes a house guest at Three Gables, hoping that someone might reveal a clue at an unguarded moment.

All the family members had motive and opportunity, none has an alibi; and each of them knew that Aristide&#x27;s eye medicine was poisonous as he had told all the family after being asked by Josephine. According to the will, they all stand to gain a healthy bequest from the old man&#x27;s estate. The servants do not get bequests but would lose their (increasing) annual wages or bonuses, so are not suspects. Aside from this, the family members have little in common. Edith de Haviland, Aristide&#x27;s unmarried sister-in-law, is a brusque woman in her 70s who came to stay with him after his first wife&#x27;s death to supervise his children&#x27;s upbringing. Roger, the eldest son and Aristide&#x27;s favourite, is a failure as a businessman. He has steered the catering business bestowed to him by his father to the brink of bankruptcy and he longs to live a simple life somewhere far away. Roger&#x27;s wife Clemency, a scientist with austere and unsentimental tastes, has never been able to enjoy the wealth offered by her husband&#x27;s family. Roger&#x27;s younger brother, Philip, has suffered under his father&#x27;s preference for Roger, and retreated into a distant world of books and bygone historical epochs, spending all his waking hours in the library. Philip&#x27;s wife Magda is an only moderately successful actress to whom everything, even a family murder, is a stage show in which she wants to play a leading part. Sixteen-year-old Eustace has polio. He is handsome and intelligent, yet embittered by his disability. His twelve-year-old sister Josephine, on the other hand, is ugly, precociously intelligent, and obsessed with detective stories. She spies continually on the rest of the household, letting everyone know that she is writing down her observations in a secret notebook.

Leonides had secretly personally rewritten (to the surprise of his lawyer Mr Gaitskill) his will to leave everything to Philip&#x27;s daughter Sophia. He believed that she alone had the strength of character to assume his place as the head of the family. Josephine, who had been bragging that she knows the killer&#x27;s identity, is found lying unconscious in the yard from a blow to the head from a marble doorstop. Charles discovers a cache of incriminating love letters from Brenda to Laurence, and the two are arrested. While they are in custody, the children&#x27;s nanny dies after drinking a digitalis-laced cup of cocoa that had apparently been intended for Josephine. The family realises that the killer is still among them.

Charles, afraid for Josephine&#x27;s life, tries in vain to induce her to disclose the murderer&#x27;s name. Edith de Haviland invites Josephine to come out with her in the car for an ice cream soda. The car drives over a cliff and both are killed. Back at Three Gables, Charles finds two letters from Miss de Haviland. One is a suicide note for Chief Inspector Taverner taking responsibility, although not explicitly confessing, to the murders of Aristide and Nanny. The second letter, intended for Sophia and Charles only, reveals the truth of the matter: Josephine was the murderer. As proof, de Haviland has enclosed the child&#x27;s secret notebook, the first line of which reads &quot;Today I killed grandfather.&quot;

Josephine killed her grandfather because he wouldn&#x27;t pay for her ballet lessons; she then revelled in all the attention she received afterwards and planned her own assault with the marble doorstop as a way of diverting attention. She poisoned Nanny for encouraging Magda to send her to Switzerland, and also because Nanny called her a &quot;silly little girl&quot;. She also included threats against Magda if her mother seriously considered sending her away. Miss de Haviland had discovered Josephine&#x27;s notebook hidden in a dog kennel, and committed the murder-suicide car crash as she did not want Josephine to suffer in a prison or asylum if and when the police learned she was the murderer.

==Reception==
Maurice Richardson, in the 29 May 1949 issue of &quot;The Observer&quot;, gave a positive review in comparison to his opinion of &quot;Taken at the Flood&quot; the previous year: &quot;Her forty-ninth book and one of her best seven. Poisoning of aged iniquitous anglicised Levantine millionaire. Nicely characterised family of suspects. Delicious red herrings. Infinite suspense and shocking surprise finish make up for slight looseness of texture.&quot;

An unnamed reviewer in the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; of 12 March 1949 wrote: &quot;Chief Inspector Taverner of Scotland Yard was as brilliant as usual but barking up the wrong tree – as Agatha Christie demonstrates in a surprise ending which introduces a novel idea in murder mystery.&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;&#x27;Pure pleasure&#x27; was how the author described the writing of this, which was long planned, and remained one of her favourites. As the title implies, this is a family murder – and a very odd family indeed. The solution, one of the classic ones, was anticipated (but much less effectively) in Margery Allingham&#x27;s &#x27;prentice work &quot;The White Cottage Mystery&quot;.&quot;

In the &quot;Binge!&quot; article of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the writers picked &quot;Crooked House&quot; as an &quot;EW favorite&quot; on the list of the &quot;Nine Great Christie Novels&quot;.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
The novel was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in four weekly 30-minute episodes which began broadcasting on 29 February 2008. It starred Rory Kinnear (Charles Hayward), Anna Maxwell Martin (Sophia Leonides), and Phil Davis (Chief Insp. Taverner). The radio play was dramatised by Joy Wilkinson and directed by Sam Hoyle. It was subsequently issued on CD. This version removed the character of Eustace.

In 2011, US filmmaker Neil La Bute announced that he would be directing a feature film version, for 2012, of the novel with a script by Julian Fellowes. On 15 May 2011, Gemma Arterton, Matthew Goode, Gabriel Byrne and Dame Julie Andrews were announced to lead the cast. In a report issued on 10 June 2012, Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions acquired all rights in the US, Canada and internationally for the film, which could help secure it a lucrative release, though the cast and creative team had changed.

The film, directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner and starring Christina Hendricks, Gillian Anderson, Max Irons, Glenn Close, Julian Sands, Terence Stamp, Stefanie Martini and Christian McKay, was released digitally on 21 November 2017 and first broadcast on Channel 5 on 17 December 2017. On 22 December 2017, it received a modest (16 theatres) theatrical release in the U.S. via Vertical Entertainment.

<doc id="221841" wikidata="Q15165" url="?curid=221841" title="Hong Kong Basic Law">
<text>The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is a national law of China that serves as the organic law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Comprising nine chapters, 160 articles and three annexes, the Basic Law was composed to implement Annex I of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.

The Basic Law was enacted under the Constitution of China when it was adopted by the National People&#x27;s Congress on 4 April 1990 and came into effect on 1 July 1997 after the handover of Hong Kong. It replaced Hong Kong&#x27;s colonial constitution of the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions.

Drafted on the basis of the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law lays out the basic policies of China on Hong Kong, including the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle, such that the socialist governance and economic system then practised in mainland China would not be extended to Hong Kong. Instead, Hong Kong would continue its capitalist system and way of life until 2047. The Basic Law also sets out the sources of law, the relationship between Hong Kong and the Central Government (State Council), the fundamental rights and duties of Hong Kong residents and the branches of local government.

==History==
Shortly after the Sino–British Joint Declaration was signed, the National People&#x27;s Congress set up the Basic Law Drafting Committee (BLDC) in 1985, setting the basis of the transfer of sovereignty in Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China. The committee was responsible for writing the draft Basic Law. In June 1985, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) approved the membership of the BLDC, which consisted of 36 members from China and 23 members from Hong Kong, chaired by Chinese diplomat Ji Pengfei. Twelve of the 23 members from Hong Kong were connected to the city&#x27;s business and industrial sectors.

A Basic Law Consultative Committee (BLCC) consisting of Hong Kong community leaders was also established in 1985 to collect views in Hong Kong on the draft law. Similar to the BLDC, the BLCC was also dominated by business and professional elites.

The first draft was published in April 1988 followed by a five-month public consultation. The second draft was published in February 1989, and the subsequent consultation period ended in October 1989. The Basic Law was promulgated on 4 April 1990 by the National People&#x27;s Congress, together with the designs for the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem of the HKSAR.

On 4 June 1989, the BLDC&#x27;s only two members representing the nascent pro-democracy camp, Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, declared that they would suspend their participation after the military crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. In September 1989, Lee announced that he would return to the BLDC after being urged to do so by many in Hong Kong. However, in October, Beijing expelled Lee and Szeto from the BLDC as &quot;subversives&quot;. Lee and Szeto had voiced support for student activists in Beijing and had led the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, an organisation instrumental in assisting political dissidents leave China after the military crackdown on 4 June.

== Basic principles ==
The basic principles of Hong Kong&#x27;s governance under Chinese sovereignty mirror those in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and most of them are set out in the first chapter of the Basic Law. The NPCSC has identified Articles 1 and 12 as the fundamental provisions of the Basic Law.

Article 1 declares Hong Kong as a part of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but it maintains legal and political systems distinct from those in mainland China until 2047. Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own executive, legislative and judicial branches. Judicial power includes the power of final adjudication, which replaces the colonial judicial recourse of appealing to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom with appeals to the Court of Final Appeal. The Hong Kong national security law incorporated into Annex III of the Basic Law overrides incompatible local ordinances and allows mainland Chinese courts to preside over cases that involve certain national security crimes.

Article 5 requires that the socialist system and policies to not be practised in Hong Kong and the capitalist system and way of life before the handover remain for 50 years after the handover, or 2047. The common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subsidiary legislation and customary law that govern certain land rights in the New Territories that were in force before the handover are maintained, except for any that contravene the Basic Law and subject to any amendment by the legislature.

Article 12 declares that Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy and comes directly under the Central People&#x27;s Government.

Private ownership of property is also a right protected in Hong Kong.

Although the Basic Law was drafted to give effect to &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot;, on 10 June 2014, Beijing released a policy report asserting its authority over Hong Kong that started a conflict between &quot;one country&quot; and &quot;two systems&quot; by stating that the interests of China (&quot;one country&quot;) should prevail over Hong Kong&#x27;s constitutional autonomy (&quot;two systems&quot;). This ignited criticism from many people in Hong Kong, who said that the Communist leadership was undermining the Basic Law Article 8, in that it was reneging on its pledges to abide by the policy that allows for a democratic, autonomous Hong Kong under Beijing&#x27;s rule.

== Autonomy under Chinese sovereignty ==
The Basic Law guarantees Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under Chinese rule, with the exception of foreign affairs and defence which remains the purview of the Central People&#x27;s Government. 

=== Central government agencies in Hong Kong ===
Four agencies of the central government operate in Hong Kong. The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established under Article 13 of the Basic Law and began operating after the handover. The Liaison Office of the Central People&#x27;s Government replaced in 2000 the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, which served as the &quot;de facto&quot; diplomatic mission of China to Hong Kong since 1947. The Hong Kong Garrison of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army began operating after the handover. The Office for Safeguarding National Security was established in June 2020 under the Hong Kong National Security Law.

Article 22 states that &quot;no department of the Central People&#x27;s Government and no province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region administers on its own in accordance with this Law&quot;.

In April 2020, the provision sparked a debate after the Liaison Office and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office criticised pro-democratic legislators for delaying the election of the chairperson of the Legislative Council House Committee. Pro-democratic legislators said the offices violated Article 22 by commenting on the election of a chairperson in the local legislature. In response, the Liaison Office said both itself and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office are not subject to Article 22 because they were authorised by central authorities to specialize in handling Hong Kong affairs and not what are commonly meant by &quot;departments under the Central People’s Government&quot;. On the website of the State Council of China, a.k.a. the Central People&#x27;s Government, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (国务院港澳事务办公室) and Xinhua News Agency (新华通讯社), whose Hong Kong branch was predecessor to the Liaison Office, are listed among institutions separate from the constituent departments of the State Council (国务院组成部门).

Zhang Xiaoming has also said the Office of the National Security Commissioner is not subject to the restrictions in Article 22.

=== Effect of national laws ===
Except the Basic Law and the Constitution, national laws are not enforced in Hong Kong unless they are listed in Annex III and applied by local promulgation or legislation. When national laws are enacted locally by the Legislative Council, the local version adapts to the context of Hong Kong for the national law to have full effect. The NPCSC has the power to amend legislation included in Annex III after consulting its Basic Law committee and the Hong Kong government. Laws in Annex III must be those related to foreign affairs, national defence or matters not within Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy.

As of June 2020, Annex III includes laws on the designation of capital, national flag and anthem, territorial claims, nationality, diplomatic privileges and immunity, garrisoning of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and crimes involving national security. In May 2020, the National People&#x27;s Congress announced that the NPCSC would enact a national security law tailored for Hong Kong in response to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. The law was added to Annex III and promulgated without being passed in the Legislative Council.

National laws can be applied if they only affect an area in Hong Kong. In 2018, the Hong Kong West Kowloon station of the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link was completed to include a section where mainland Chinese officials are allowed to exercise Chinese laws, an arrangement that intended to reduce the time needed for immigration. The effectiveness of Chinese law inside Hong Kong territory was challenged in the same year in the Court of First Instance. The court ruled that the Basic Law is a flexible constitution and as such can be interpreted for the needs of economic integration; the arrangement of having mainland Chinese laws in Hong Kong for the purposes of customs, immigration and quarantine does not contravene the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle.

=== National security law ===
Article 23 requires Hong Kong to enact local national security laws that prohibit treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the central government, theft of state secrets and foreign organisations from conducting political activities in Hong Kong. In 2003, the Hong Kong government tabled the National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003, which triggered widespread protest. The proposed legislation gave more power to the police, such as not requiring a search warrant to search the home of a suspected terrorist. After the demonstrations and the withdrawal by the Liberal Party of their support for the bill, the government shelved the bill indefinitely.

== Fundamental rights and duties ==
The rights of Hong Kong residents are guaranteed by chapter 3 of the Basic Law. Article 39 also applies provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and international labour conventions that was in force in Hong Kong before the handover. While the most parts of the ICCPR is ratified as the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance in largely identical language, no equivalent legislation was made to implement the ICESCR.

=== Civil rights ===
Hong Kong residents are equal before the law. Hong Kong residents have, among other things, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and of publication; freedom of association, freedom of assembly, freedom of procession, of demonstration, of communication, of movement, of conscience, of religious belief, and of marriage; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike. The freedom of the person of Hong Kong residents shall be inviolable. No Hong Kong resident can be arbitrarily or unlawfully arrested, detained or imprisoned. Arbitrary or unlawful search of the body of any resident, deprivation or restriction of the freedom of the person are also prohibited. Torture of any resident and arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of the life of any resident shall be prohibited.

In late 2015, five staff members of a bookshop selling books and magazines banned in mainland China disappeared (see Causeway Bay Books disappearances). At least two of them disappeared while in mainland China, one while in Thailand. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, eventually reappearing in Shenzhen, across the Chinese border, without the necessary travel documents. While reaction to the October disappearances was muted, as unexplained disappearances and lengthy extrajudicial detentions are known to occur in mainland China, the unprecedented disappearance of a person from Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the possible abduction of Hong Kong citizens by Chinese public security bureau officials and their likely rendition, in violation of several articles of the Basic Law and the one country, two systems principle. The widespread suspicion that they were under detention in mainland China was later confirmed with apparently scripted video &quot;confessions&quot; and assurances by the men that they were remaining in China of their own accord. In June 2016, one of the five, Lam Wing-kee, revealed in a dramatic press conference that he and the others had been held without due process and that Lee Po had indeed been illegally abducted from Hong Kong, all by a shadowy &#x27;Central Investigation Team&#x27; (&quot;中央專案組&quot; or &quot;中央調查組&quot;).

Article 95 provides for mutual judicial assistance between Hong Kong and the PRC; however, serious stumbling blocks, such as capital punishment stand in the way of a formal understanding of extradition. Additionally, HKSAR authorities have ruled that Articles 6 and 7 of the PRC Criminal Code does not give Hong Kong sole jurisdiction in criminal matters, particularly when a crime is committed across provincial or SAR borders. The current status quo is that Hong Kong will ask for the return of Hong Kong residents who have committed crimes in Hong Kong and are arrested in the mainland. A mainlander who commits a crime in Hong Kong and flees back to the mainland, however, will be tried in the mainland. In cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the Central Government has demanded that the trial be held in the mainland. Prominent authorities, such as Albert Chen, a professor, and Gladys Li, chairman of justice of the Hong Kong section of the International Commission of Jurists, feel that this situation has serious ramifications for judicial independence in Hong Kong.

=== Political rights ===
Permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have the right to vote and stand for election in accordance with the Basic Law. Provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as applied to Hong Kong when the Basic Law came into effect were allowed to remain in force.

Article 45 stipulates that the Chief Executive shall be selected by election or through local consultations and be appointed by the Central People&#x27;s Government, with the ultimate aim of selection by universal suffrage upon nomination by a representative committee under democratic procedures.&quot; However, Hong Kong has yet to implement universal suffrage for the elections, because the Basic Law states that the electoral method are subject to the &quot;actual situation&quot; of Hong Kong and &quot;the principle of gradual and orderly progress&quot;.

Whether the 2007 chief executive election and the 2008 Legislative Council elections could be performed by universal suffrage was determined on 26 April 2004, when the NPCSC ruled out the possibility as it deemed Hong Kong not mature enough for such elections.

In 2014, the 31 August Decision by the NPCSC stated that starting from 2017, the selection of the Chief Executive may be implemented by universal suffrage upon nomination of candidates by a broadly representative committee and subject to appointment by the Central People&#x27;s Government. It went on to state that such a person must love the country and love Hong Kong and that safeguards for this purpose should be provided for by the specific method of universal suffrage, without specifying what the safeguards were to be. The reform proposal encompassing this and other changes was rejected by the Legislative Council on June 18, 2015, after an ill-timed walk-out by many pro-establishment legislators.

== Political structure ==
The courts of Hong Kong are given the power to review acts of the executive or legislature and declare them invalid if they are inconsistent with the Basic Law.

The Chief Executive of Hong Kong can be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the Central People&#x27;s Government.

The term of the chief executive after their predecessor resigns was a question that emerged after Tung Chee-hwa resigned on 10 March 2005. The legal community and the pro-democracy camp said the term of the new chief executive should be five years, according to Article 46. However, the Hong Kong government, some Beijing figures and the pro-Beijing camp said that it should be the remaining term of the original Chief Executive, by a technicality in the Chinese version of the Basic Law, introducing the remaining term concept. The Hong Kong government sought an interpretation from the NPCSC on 6 April 2005. The NPCSC ruled on 27 April 2005 that the Annex I of the Basic Law requires that if any Chief Executive should resign on or before 2007, the new Chief Executive should serve out the remainder of his predecessor&#x27;s term. Hong Kong residents who favour autonomy view the &quot;interpretation&quot; from the Standing Committee as an intrusion into the Hong Kong legal system by the central government in violation of the spirit of the One Country, Two Systems policy, compromising the rule of law.

The Basic Law also guarantees the welfare and benefits of civil servants. According to the Article 100 of the Basic Law, the civil servants may remain in employment with pay, allowances, benefits and conditions of service no less favourable than before the handover. Article 107 stated the SAR Government should follow the principle of keeping the expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its budget. Whether pay-cuts for civil servants and having a deficit budget are allowed under the Basic Law had been raised. During the economic downturn after 1997, there was a growing fiscal deficit (and, in 2007/08 a record surplus). The government imposed a pay-cut on the Civil Service during the economic downturn, and then sharply increased salaries during the recovery.

== External affairs ==
The Basic Law provides the Hong Kong government limited power to engage in international affairs. Under the name &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot;, the Hong Kong government can enter into bilateral agreements with non-Chinese regions and international organisations related to certain fields, including commerce, trade, communications, culture, tourism and sports. As members of a Chinese delegation, government representatives can also engage in diplomatic negotiations and participate in international organisations and conferences that directly affect Hong Kong.

== Interpretation ==
The Basic Law can be interpreted by Hong Kong courts in the course of adjudication and by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC). As of 7 November 2016, the NPCSC has interpreted the Basic Law on five occasions:
*Interpretation regarding Articles 22(4) and 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law, adopted on 26 June 1999 with relations to the right of abode;
*Interpretation regarding Annex I(7) and Annex II(III) to the Basic Law, adopted on April 6, 2004, over the procedure of amending the electoral methods of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council;
*Interpretation regarding the Second Paragraph in Article 53, adopted on April 27, 2005, regarding the term of office of a new Chief Executive succeeding a resigned predecessor;
* Interpretation regarding the First Paragraph of Article 13 and Article 19 of the Basic Law, adopted on August 26, 2011, before the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal hands down its judgment on &quot;Democratic Republic of Congo v FG Hemisphere Associates LLC&quot; ; and
* Interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law, adopted on 7 November 2016), regarding the requirements of lawful oaths and affirmations surrounding the oath-taking controversy over newly elected LegCo members.

Of the five interpretations to date, only one interpretation was sought by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (CFA). The interpretation was requested in the 2011 case of &quot;Democratic Republic of Congo v FG Hemisphere Associates LLC&quot; and it concerned the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts over acts of state, among other matters. The Government of Hong Kong sought two NPCSC interpretations on Basic Law provisions regarding the right of abode and the term of office of a new Chief Executive after his predecessor has resigned before the end of his term, in 1999 and 2005 respectively. The NPCSC had also interpreted the Basic Law twice on its own initiative, without being requested by any branch of government in Hong Kong. The first of the two occurred in 2004, and concerned the amendment of the chief executive and the Legislative Council election methods for 2007 and 2008 respectively. The second was issued in November 2016 on the substantive requirements of lawful oaths and affirmations as stipulated in Article 104 of the Basic Law.
As interpretations by the NPCSC are not retroactive, an interpretation on the Basic Law does not affect cases that have already been adjudicated.

=== Legal principles ===
The basic principles for interpreting the Basic Law are described in Article 158 and case law. According to Article 158(1), the NPCSC has the power of final interpretation. This is consistent with the NPCSC&#x27;s general power to interpret Chinese national laws as provided by Article 67(4) of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. As a national law, the Basic Law was drafted in Chinese, and its Chinese version takes precedence over the official English version when discrepancies arise. Before interpreting the Basic Law, the NPCSC must consult its subcommittee, the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

Hong Kong courts may also interpret the Basic Law when adjudicating cases, when the provisions addressed are within Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy. Hong Kong courts can also interpret provisions on matters the Central People&#x27;s Government is responsible for or those related to the relationship between the Central government and Hong Kong, provided that the case is being heard by the CFA, that the interpretation will affect the judgments of the case, and that the CFA has sought a binding NPCSC interpretation on the matter.

To decide whether an NPCSC interpretation should be sought, the CFA applies a two-stage approach based on Article 158(3) formulated in &quot;Ng Ka Ling v Director of Immigration&quot;. The first stage concerns the &quot;classification condition&quot;, which is satisfied if the provision to be interpreted concerns either affairs within the responsibility of the Central People&#x27;s Government or the relationship between the Central Authorities and Hong Kong. Provisions satisfying the classification condition are &quot;excluded provisions&quot;, suggesting that they cannot be interpreted by the CFA. When the court needs to refer to an excluded provision to construe a non-excluded provision, the CFA is not required to request an NPCSC interpretation on the excluded provision. Instead, the CFA applies the &quot;predominant test&quot;, in which the court asks which provision is predominantly the one needed to be interpreted in the present adjudication. The second test concerns whether the &quot;necessity condition&quot; is satisfied. The condition is satisfied when the court needs the excluded provision to be interpreted and that the interpretation will affect the judgment on the case.

Hong Kong courts use the purposive approach to interpret the Basic Law. Since Hong Kong&#x27;s legal system is separate from that of mainland China, its courts are bound to adopt the common law approach to interpretation. The courts construe the Basic Law&#x27;s language to consider the provisions&#x27; context and purpose by finding its legislative intent; the legislator&#x27;s intent alone is not considered the legislative intent. Ambiguities are resolved by accounting for the principles and purposes stated in the Chinese Constitution and other materials. Yet, the courts treat the Basic Law as a &quot;living instrument&quot; that adapts to changing needs and circumstances. While Hong Kong courts account for the historical context of the Basic Law, they also consider &quot;new social, political and historical realities&quot;.

=== Disputes from interpretation ===
The interpretation of the Basic Law by the Hong Kong courts and the NPCSC is politically contentious. Albert Chen has described NPCSC interpretations as the &quot;major cause of constitutional controversies&quot; since the handover.

The constitutional powers of the Hong Kong judiciary was first contested in &quot;HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan&quot;, which was decided by the Court of Appeal 28 days after the handover. The applicants argued the Provisional Legislative Council established unilaterally before the handover was unlawful, and the laws it enacted were void. The court dismissed this argument. Among other reasons, the court held that as a local court it had no power to review an act of a sovereign authority. The court reasoned that since Article 19 of the Basic Law did not expand its judicial powers and it had no power to review the validity of a sovereign act under colonial rule, it did not hold such power after the handover. While Justice Gerald Nazareth agreed with the majority decision, he questioned whether the constitutional order of China and that of the United Kingdom were analogous. He also noted the Chinese constitution was not reviewed in detail during the trial. Johannes Chan commented that the lack of judicial review power to review acts of Parliament reflected parliamentary supremacy, a doctrine borne out of unwritten constitutional systems. Since China has a written constitution and the Basic Law describes the relationship between Hong Kong and the central government unlike the colonial Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, Chan questioned whether parliamentary supremacy fully applies in Hong Kong after 1997.

In the &quot;Ng Ka Ling&quot; case, the CFA tried to assert it has powers to review acts of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) or the NPCSC to determine whether they are consistent with the Basic Law.

The Hong Kong government later sought an interpretation of Articles 22 and 24 from the NPCSC to avoid a potential influx of over a million mainland Chinese migrants (according to government estimates) into Hong Kong. This has triggered a debate on judicial independence in Hong Kong.

== Amendment ==
Article 159 sets out the amendment process, and gives the National People&#x27;s Congress the sole power to amend it. Amendments can be proposed by either the NPCSC, the State Council, or Hong Kong. For Hong Kong to propose amendments, the amendments first need the support of two-thirds of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, two-thirds of the deputies representing Hong Kong in the National People&#x27;s Congress, and the approval of Hong Kong&#x27;s Chief Executive. All proposals needs to be reviewed by the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and no amendments can &quot;contravene the established basic policies of the People&#x27;s Republic of China regarding Hong Kong&quot;.

It might be argued that interpretations of the Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress are effectively “amendments” to the Basic Law. The Hong Kong Court has nonetheless found NPCSC interpretations to have &quot;supplementary” legislative effects in a manner consistent with Chinese jurisprudence. Similarly, the NPCSC&#x27;s interpretive power could be used to modify a nearly unrestricted range of local laws without recourse by either the HKSAR courts or Government.

===Annexes I and II===
According to Annexes I and II of the Basic Law adopted in April 1990, amendments could be made to the methods for selecting the chief executive and forming the Legislative Council for the terms subsequent to the year 2007 with the endorsement of a two-thirds majority of all the members of the Legislative Council and the consent of the Chief Executive. Amendments should then be reported to the NPCSC for approval or for the record.

In the NPCSC interpretation to the Basic Law adopted on April 6, 2004, the NPCSC stipulated the “five steps” of initiating political reform under Annexes I and II of the Basic Law:
* the Chief Executive submit a report on whether there is a need to amend the methods for selecting the CE for forming LegCo the Chairman of NPCSC;
* the NPCSC make a decision approving or vetoing amendments to electoral methods of the CE or LegCo;
* the HKSAR Government submit a motion concerning amendments of Annexes I and II to LegCo;
* LegCo approve of the motion concerning amendments with a two-thirds majority of all the members, and the CE give formal assent; and
* the NPCSC approve and file for record amendments to Annexes I and II.

Under the NPCSC&#x27;s 2021 amendment of Annexes I and II, the NPCSC now exercises the power to amend Annexes I and II of the Basic Law. The “five steps” of initiating political reform by the HKSAR were no longer in force.

<text>The Kingdom of Sedang (; Vietnamese: &quot;Vương quốc Xơ Đăng&quot;) was an ephemeral political entity established in the latter part of the 19th century by a French adventurer, Charles-Marie David de Mayréna, in part of what is present-day Vietnam.
==History==
Mayréna, a former French government official with a dubious history that allegedly involved embezzlement, was in 1888 the owner of a plantation in French Indochina. When the King of Siam began claiming territories near those held by the French, Mayréna convinced the nervous colonial administrator to have him lead an expedition into the interior in order to negotiate treaties with local tribes.

However, upon his arrival, he instead convinced the tribesmen to form a local kingdom under his rule. To justify this, he argued that the tribes involved were not subjects or vassals of the emperor of Annam (modern Vietnam), and hence had a right to independent statehood. The Kingdom of Sedang, as he named it, incorporated the Bahnar, Rengao, and Sedang ethnics. Mayréna was elected King by the chiefs of these tribes, established his capital at the village of Kon Gung (also called &quot;Pelei Agna&quot;, &quot;Great City&quot;, now in Đắk Mar commune), and assumed the regnal name of &quot;Marie the First, King of the Sedang&quot;, on 3 June 1888.

He subsequently offered to cede his kingdom to the French Third Republic in exchange for monopoly trade rights and hinted that the Prussians were interested if the French were not. When the French government failed to respond positively, Mayréna approached the British in Hong Kong. When he was rebuffed there he traveled to Belgium, where in 1889 a financier offered to provide him with arms and money in exchange for the kingdom&#x27;s mineral rights. Mayréna&#x27;s return to Sedang was thwarted by the French Navy, who blockaded Vietnamese ports and seized his arms as contraband at Singapore.

During his travels to Southeast Asia and Europe, Mayréna awarded dozens of noble titles, orders of chivalry, and assorted medals and paraphernalia to his supporters. He also created a series of postage stamps that are the main tangible legacy of the kingdom.

Mayréna (who had earlier converted to Islam and married several local women) died under mysterious circumstances (various reports claim by poisoning, snakebite or losing a duel) on 11 November 1890 at Tioman, Malaya.

<doc id="221847" wikidata="Q118959217" url="?curid=221847" title="Kinglet">
<text>A kinglet is a small bird in the family Regulidae. Species in this family were formerly classified with the Old World warblers. &quot;Regulidae&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;regulus&quot; for &quot;petty king&quot; or prince, and refers to the coloured crowns of adult birds. This family has representatives in North America and Eurasia. There are six species in this family; one, the Madeira firecrest, &quot;Regulus madeirensis&quot;, was only recently split from common firecrest as a separate species. One species, the ruby-crowned kinglet, differs sufficiently in its voice and plumage to be afforded its own genus, &quot;Corthylio&quot;.

==Description==
Kinglets are among the smallest of all passerines, ranging in size from and weighing ; the sexes are the same size. They have medium-length wings and tails, and small needle-like bills. The plumage is overall grey-green, offset by pale wingbars, and the tail tip is . Five species have a single stiff feather covering the nostrils, but in the ruby-crowned kinglet this is replaced by several short, stiff bristles. Most kinglets have distinctive head markings, and the males possess a colourful crown patch. In the females, the crown is duller and yellower. The long feathers forming the central crown stripe can be erected; they are inconspicuous most of the time, but are used in courtship and territorial displays when the raised crest is very striking.

There are two species of different genera in North America with largely overlapping distributions, and two in Eurasia that also have a considerable shared range. In each continent, one species (goldcrest in Eurasia and golden-crowned kinglet in North America) is a conifer specialist; these have deeply grooved pads on their feet for perching on conifer twigs and a long hind toe and claw for clinging vertically. The two generalists, ruby-crowned kinglet and common firecrest, hunt more in flight and have smoother soles, shorter hind claws and a longer tail.

==Taxonomy==
The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the Old World warblers but frequently given family status, especially as recent research showed that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are phylogenetically remote from the warblers. The name of the family derives from the Latin &quot;regulus&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;rex&quot;, &quot;a king&quot;, and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets (aside from the red crest of &quot;Corthylio&quot;). The kinglets were allocated to the warbler genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; by English naturalist John Latham in 1790, but moved to their current genus by French zoologist Georges Cuvier in 1800.

Most members of the genus &quot;Regulus&quot; are similar in size and colour pattern. The exception is the ruby-crowned kinglet, the largest species, which has a strongly red crest and no black crown stripes. It has distinctive vocalisations, and is different enough from the Old World kinglets and the other American species, the golden-crowned kinglet, to be assigned to a separate genus, &quot;Corthylio&quot;.

===Species in taxonomic order===

* Genus Corthylio:
** Ruby-crowned kinglet (&quot;C. calendula&quot;)
* Genus &quot;Regulus&quot;:
** Common firecrest (&quot;R. ignicapilla&quot;)
** Madeira firecrest (&quot;R. madeirensis&quot;)
** Golden-crowned kinglet (&quot;R. satrapa&quot;)
** Flamecrest (&quot;R. goodfellowi&quot;)
** Goldcrest (&quot;R. regulus&quot;)

== Distribution and habitat ==
Kinglets are birds of the Nearctic and Palearctic realms, with representatives in temperate North America, Europe and Asia, northernmost Africa, Macaronesia and the Himalayas. They are adapted to conifer forests, although there is a certain amount of adaptability and most species will use other habitats, particularly during migration. In Macaronesia, they are adapted to laurisilva and tree heaths.

==Behaviour==

===Diet and feeding===
The tiny size and rapid metabolism of kinglets means that they must constantly forage in order to provide their energy needs. They will continue feeding even when nest building. Kinglets prevented from feeding may lose a third of their body weight in twenty minutes and may starve to death in an hour. Kinglets are insectivores, preferentially feeding on prey such as aphids and springtails that have soft cuticles. Prey is generally gleaned from the branches and leaves of trees, although in some circumstances prey may be taken on the wing or from the leaf litter on the ground.

===Life cycle===
Kinglet nests are small, very neat cups, almost spherical in shape, made of moss and lichen held together with spiderwebs and hung from twigs near the end of a high branch of a conifer. They are lined with hair and feathers, and a few feathers are placed over the opening. These characteristics provide good insulation against the cold environment. The female lays 7 to 12 eggs, which are white or pale buff, some having fine dark brown spots. Because the nest is small, they are stacked in layers. The female incubates; she pushes her legs (which are well supplied with blood vessels, hence warm) down among the eggs. A unique feature of kinglets is the &quot;size hierarchy&quot; among eggs, with early-laid eggs being smaller than later ones.

Eggs hatch asynchronously after 15 to 17 days. The young stay in the nest for 19 to 24 days. After being fed, nestlings make their way down to the bottom of the nest, pushing their still-hungry siblings up to be fed in their turn (but also to be cold).

Kinglets are the most fecund and shortest-living of all altricial birds, and probably the shortest-lived apart from a few smaller galliform species. Adult mortality for the goldcrest is estimated at over 80 percent per year and the maximum lifespan is only six years.

<text>José Luis Tejada Sorzano (12 January 1882 – 4 October 1938) was a Bolivian economist, lawyer, and politician who served as the 34th president of Bolivia from 1934 to 1936. A member of the Liberal Party, he served as the 23rd vice president from 1931 to 1934 and was minister of finance in 1919.

==Early life==
José Luis Tejada Sorzano was born on 12 January 1882 in La Paz to Napoleón Tejada Guzman and Josefa Ruiz de Sorzano Mendoza. He completed primary studies at the San Calixto Jesuit School.

=== Football career ===
An avid athlete, in late 1901 Tejada Sorzano was among a group of students who launched an initiative which led to the formation of the Bolivian Rangers Club of La Paz football team. The initial team roster was composed entirely of local members and consisted of fifteen players: Humberto Cuenca, Manuel Estrada, Lizandro Villanueva, David Medeiros, Carlos Farfán, Víctor de la Peña, José Luis Tejada Sorzano, Miguel Larrabure, Carlos Bustillos, Max de la Vega, Óscar Núñez del Prado, Miguel Solares, Augusto Cusicanqui, Luis Maidana and Julio Zuazo Cuenca. On 20 December 1903, Tejada Sorzano as President of the Bolivian Rangers participated in a match against La Paz FBC. The Rangers won 2–0 for which they were awarded a diploma by &quot;El Comercio de Bolivia&quot; newspaper.

A few years later, he and some of his former team members participated in another student initiative which formed the historical Thunder Football Club in La Paz. In September 1905, the Thunders were chosen by the La Paz prefecture to represent the department in the first interdepartmental football match in Bolivian history against Oruro Royal. The game served to commemorate the inauguration and construction of the Oruro-Viacha railway.

Tejada Sorzano studied law at the Higher University of San Andrés, graduating in 1904. As a university student, he became a member of the &quot;Palabras Libres&quot; (Free Words) literary cenacle. The group, which included Alcides Arguedas, Armando Chirveches, Abel Alarcón, Fabián Vaca Chávez, Benigno Lara, Roberto Zapata, Walter Méndez, and Rosendo Echazú, was established in May 1905 in La Paz where it published a triweekly column of stories, essays, poems, and political analysis in the newspaper &quot;El Diario&quot;. Along with Lara and Zapata, Tejada Sorzano focused his writings on such social concerns of the time as women&#x27;s rights, alcoholism, and &quot;pongueaje&quot;, the forced labor practiced on the indigenous peoples. The group ended its publication in March 1906, largely as a result of the dispersal of its members due to crack downs by the reigning Liberal government.
===Political career===
Despite the repression of &quot;Palabras Libres&quot; by the government, Tejada Sorzano was nevertheless a lifelong member of the Liberal Party and worked to modernize liberal ideas and criticized the excesses of the mining oligarchy at the expense of civilian sectors. A lawyer by profession, he was active in politics from a very young age, and was elected as a deputy to the National Congress in 1914. On 21 March 1919, President José Gutiérrez Guerra appointed him Minister of Finance, a position he served in until October of that year.

==== 1931 general election ====

In 1931, the military called for new elections following the resignation of Hernando Siles Reyes. The Liberal and Genuine Republican parties which represented the opposition agreed to form a unified coalition, presenting Daniel Salamanca as the Genuine Republican presidential candidate and José Luis Tejada Sorzano as his Liberal running mate. The pair won 100% of the vote in an uncontested election and took office on 5 March 1931.

== Vice president (1931–1934) ==
By Supreme Decree of 17 June 1932, President Salamanca established the Bolivian Olympic Committee. Vice President Tejada Sorzano was appointed as the entity&#x27;s first president though the outbreak of the Chaco War postponed the new institution&#x27;s activities.

A relatively hands-off vice president, the portly Tejada deferred to Salamanca in all matters, and distinguished himself very little in his own right during his term as vice president. He seems to have been &quot;second-fiddle&quot; even on intra-party matters, as the true leader of the Liberals was the septuagenarian, twice-elected former President Ismael Montes (who died only in 1933). Things changed considerably, however, when President Salamanca was suddenly deposed by the Bolivian military on 27 November 1934, as a result of long-festering differences with the High Command regarding the conduct of the war. For a variety of reasons, the army decided to maintain democratic appearances and deferred taking power itself, at least for the time being, and Tejada became president after Salamanca was forced to resign.

It can safely be argued that the military acquiesced to the assumption of Tejada to the presidency with the understanding that the latter would be far more malleable and agreeable to the wishes of the High Command than Salamanca had been. This indeed proved to be the case.

== President (1934–1936) ==
With Tejada&#x27;s assumption of the presidency, the Liberals returned to power for the first time in 14 years. Almost immediately, Tejada engineered in the Congress the extension of his term by one year in order to see through the end of the war, whose cause had been rather disastrous to Bolivia. A spate of relatively small successes (mostly of a defensive nature) toward the end of the conflict did not prevent Paraguay from maintaining control of much of the disputed region at the time that agreement on a ceasefire was finally reached in June 1935. However, the Bolivian military and most political leaders concluded that no better terms could be achieved given the circumstances or in the conceivable future. Eventually, a final peace treaty would grant most of the Chaco to Paraguay, reducing Bolivia&#x27;s territory considerably.

Despite his best intentions, Tejada seems to have been disdained by the Bolivian military leaders from the very beginning. He was considered part of the political elites that, as they saw it, got Bolivia into the war with their irresponsible demagoguery (for example, Salamanca&#x27;s insistence that Bolivia &quot;stand firm in the Chaco&quot; and his orders to build more forts in the disputed region, in direct competition with Paraguay) and then refused to provide the needed material support to win the conflict. They apparently had no explanation as to why Paraguay, which was even poorer and smaller than Bolivia and thus supplied even less adequately, still managed to prevail in the field of battle simply with better tactics and superior leadership. In any case, at this point two competing myths emerged as to why Bolivia had lost: one, advocated by important civilian political elites (but not President Tejada), placed all the blame on the personalistic, undisciplined Bolivian commanders, ever-eager to increase their own individual ambitions and even willing to overthrow the President of the Republic (as indeed happened in 1934) rather to expend all its energy in the conduct of the war. The alternative myth, emanating from the defeated armed forces themselves (who had to explain the debacle somehow), held that it was the politicians who had &quot;sold out&quot; the simple, honor-bound soldiers by leading them precipitously to war and then not suitably equipping them to win it. Of the two, the latter myth seemed more acceptable to the populace, and generalized anger began to be displaced toward Tejada.

At the same time, Tejada was still confronting crippling economic difficulties which had been made even worse by the long war. Furthermore, he was facing a looming crisis over the controversial role of the U.S.-based Standard Oil Corporation during the conflict. At the very least, Standard had refused to help Bolivia in its direst hour during the war, and at worst it was guilty of illegal activities contrary to the wishes and interests of the Bolivian government. Unable to make headway on either problem, Tejada provided the malcontent younger officers of the Bolivian military just the excuse they needed to overthrow the Constitutional order and install themselves in power. This would also allow them to continue to &quot;cleanse&quot; the image of the Bolivian armed forces and further propagate the myth that the war had been lost by politicians rather than by the men in uniform. It was thus that Tejada was finally removed from office in a coup d&#x27;état which was led by Major Germán Busch and which installed as &quot;de facto&quot; President of Bolivia Colonel David Toro on 22 May 1936.

==Death==
Forced into exile, Tejada died in Arica, Chile, only 2 years later, on 4 October 1938.

<text>Pilatus, also often referred to as Mount Pilatus, is a mountain massif overlooking Lucerne in Central Switzerland. It is composed of several peaks, of which the highest () is named &quot;Tomlishorn&quot;.

== Geography and transport==
The whole mountain range stretches at least from the Lopper just opposite from Stansstad to the east as far as at least to the Mittaggüpfi () and the &quot;Risetestock&quot; () to the west on the border between LU and OW.

The highest peak, Tomlishorn (), and the other peaks, such as &quot;Widderfeld&quot; () even further west than the Tomlishorn on the border between LU and OW, &quot;Matthorn&quot; () to the south, the &quot;Klimsenhorn&quot; () to the north (NW), and &quot;Rosegg&quot; () and &quot;Windegg&quot; () to the east, both on the border of NW and OW, should only be approached with appropriate Alpine hiking equipment.

Jurisdiction over the massif is divided between the cantons of Obwalden (OW), Nidwalden (NW), and Lucerne (LU). The main peaks are right on the border between Obwalden and Nidwalden.

The top can be reached with the Pilatus Railway, the world&#x27;s steepest cogwheel railway, from Alpnachstad, operating from May to November (depending on snow conditions) and the whole year with the aerial panorama gondolas and aerial cableways from Kriens. &quot;Tomlishorn&quot; is located about to the southeast of the top cable car and cog railway station. Two other peaks, closer to the stations are called &quot;Esel&quot; (&quot;Donkey&quot;, ), which lies just east over the railway station, the one on the west side is called &quot;Oberhaupt&quot; (&quot;Head-Leader&quot;, ).

During the summer, the &quot;Golden Round Trip&quot; — a popular route for tourists — involves taking a boat from Lucerne across Lake Lucerne to Alpnachstad, going up on the cogwheel railway, coming down on the aerial cableways and panorama gondolas, and taking a trolleybus back to Lucerne.

==History==
A few different local legends about the origin of the name exist. One claims that Pilatus was named so because Pontius Pilate was buried there. However, a similar legend is told of Monte Vettore in Italy. Another is that the mountain looks like the belly of a large man, Pilate, lying on his back and was thus named for him. The name may also be derived from &quot;pileatus&quot;, meaning &quot;cloud-topped.&quot;

Numbered amongst those who have reached its summit are Conrad Gessner, Theodore Roosevelt, Arthur Schopenhauer (1804), Queen Victoria and Julia Ward Howe (1867).

The cog railway opened in 1889. That same year, Leonardo Torres Quevedo presented his innovative cable car project for public transport, but it was dismissed by the country&#x27;s authorities.

The mountain has fortified radar (part of the Swiss FLORAKO system) and weather stations on the Oberhaupt summit, not open to the public view and used all year round.

==Climate==
==In literature==
In &quot;The Chalet School Does It Again&quot;. (1955) Elinor Brent-Dyer retells the Pilate burial place legend.

Mount Pilatus plays a pivotal role in the conclusion of Brad Thor&#x27;s fiction novel &quot;Lions of Lucerne&quot;.

<doc id="221855" wikidata="Q1439360" url="?curid=221855" title="Richard Cumberland (dramatist)">
<text>Richard Cumberland (19 February 1731/2 – 7 May 1811) was an English dramatist and civil servant. In 1771 his hit play &quot;The West Indian&quot; was first staged. During the American War of Independence he acted as a secret negotiator with Spain in an effort to secure a peace agreement between the two nations. He also edited a short-lived critical journal called &quot;The London Review&quot; (1809). His plays are often remembered for their sympathetic depiction of characters generally considered to be on the margins of society.

==Early life and education==
Richard Cumberland was born in the master&#x27;s lodge of Trinity College, Cambridge on 19 February 1731/2. His father was a clergyman, Doctor Denison Cumberland, who became successively Bishop of Clonfert and Bishop of Kilmore, and through him his great-grandfather was Richard Cumberland, the philosopher and bishop of Peterborough. His mother was Johanna Bentley, youngest daughter of Joanna Bernard and the classical scholar Richard Bentley, longtime master at Trinity College. She was featured as the heroine of John Byrom&#x27;s popular eclogue, &quot;Cohn and Phoebe&quot;. Cumberland&#x27;s youngest sister Mary became recognized later as the poet Mary Alcock. A great-great grandfather was Oliver St John, the statesman.

Cumberland was educated at the grammar school in Bury St Edmunds. He later related how, when the headmaster Arthur Kinsman told Bentley he would make his grandson an equally good scholar, Bentley retorted: &quot;Pshaw, Arthur, how can that be, when I have forgot more than thou ever knewest?&quot; In 1744 Cumberland was moved to the prestigious Westminster School, under Doctor Nicholl as headmaster. Among his contemporaries at Westminster were Warren Hastings, George Colman, Charles Churchill and William Cowper. At the age of fourteen, Cumberland went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1750 he took his degree as tenth wrangler. In his beginning writing, he was influenced by Edmund Spenser; his first dramatic effort was modeled after William Mason&#x27;s &quot;Elfrida&quot; and called &quot;Caractacus&quot;.

==Political and diplomatic career==

He had begun to read for his fellowship at Trinity when the Earl of Halifax who had been made President of the Board of Trade in the Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s government offered him the post of private secretary. Cumberland&#x27;s family persuaded him to accept, and he returned to the post after his election as fellow. It left him time for literary pursuits, which included a poem in blank verse about India.

Cumberland resigned his fellowship when he married his cousin Elizabeth Ridge in 1759, after having been appointed through Lord Halifax as &quot;crown-agent for Nova Scotia.&quot;

In 1761 Cumberland accompanied his patron Lord Halifax to Ireland. Halifax who had been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Cumberland the post as Ulster secretary. He was offered a baronetcy, which he declined. When in 1762 Halifax became Northern Secretary, Cumberland applied for the post of under-secretary, but could only obtain the less prestigious clerkship of reports at the Board of Trade under Lord Hillsborough.

When Lord George Germain in 1775 acceded to office, Cumberland was appointed secretary to the Board of Trade and Plantations, a post he held till Edmund Burke&#x27;s reforms abolished it in 1782.

===Mission to Madrid===
In 1780, he was sent on a confidential mission to Spain to negotiate a separate peace treaty during the American War of Independence in an effort to weaken the anti-British coalition. Although he was well received by King Charles III of Spain and his minister, the Count of Floridablanca, the question of which nation would hold sway over Gibraltar prevented resolution. Recalled by the government in 1781, Cumberland was refused repayment of his expenses although his advance was insufficient. He was £4500 out ofpocket and never recovered his money. Soon afterward, Cumberland lost his office in Burke&#x27;s reforms and retired on an allowance of less than half-pay. In 1785, he wrote a defence of his former superior, &quot;Character of the late Lord Viscount Sackville&quot;.

He took up residence at Tunbridge Wells; but during his last years he mostly lived in London, where he died. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, after a short oration by his friend Dean Vincent.

==Writing career==
Cumberland wrote much but has been remembered most for his plays and memoirs. The existence of his memoirs is largely due to his friend, the critic Richard Sharp, (Conversation Sharp) who together with Samuel Rogers and Sir James Burges (Sir James Lamb, 1st Baronet) gave considerable support to the endeavour. The collection of essays and other pieces entitled &quot;The Observer&quot; (1785), afterwards republished with a translation of &quot;The Clouds&quot;, was included among &quot;The British Essayists&quot;.

He is said to have joined Sir James Bland Burges in an epic, the &quot;Exodiad&quot; (1807), and in a novel, &quot;John de Lancaster&quot;. Besides these he wrote the Letter to the Bishop of Oxford in vindication of his grandfather Bentley (1767); another to Richard Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, on his proposal for equalizing the revenues of the Established Church (1783); a &quot;Character of Lord Sackville&quot; (1785), whom in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; he vindicates from the stigma of cowardice; and an anonymous pamphlet, &quot;Curtius rescued from the Gulf, against the redoubtable Dr Parr&quot;. He was the author of a version of 50 of the Psalms of David; of a tract on the evidences of Christianity; and of other religious pieces in prose and verse, the former including &quot;as many sermons as would make a large volume, some of which have been delivered from the pulpits.&quot; Lastly, he edited a short-lived critical journal called &quot;The London Review&quot; (1809), intended to be a rival to the &quot;Quarterly&quot;, with signed articles.
His plays, published and unpublished, totalled fifty-four. About 35 of these are ordinary plays, to which have been added four operas and a farce; about half are comedies. His favourite mode was the &quot;sentimental comedy,&quot; which combines domestic plots, rhetorical enforcement of moral precepts, and comic humour. He weaves his plays out of &quot;homely stuff, right British drugget,&quot; and eschews &quot;the vile Gallic stage&quot;; he borrowed from the style of sentimental fiction of Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding and Laurence Sterne.

His favourite theme is virtue in distress or danger, but assured of its reward in the fifth act; his most constant characters are men of feeling and young ladies who are either prudes or coquettes. Cumberland&#x27;s comic talents lay in the invention of characters taken from the &quot;outskirts of the empire,&quot; and intended to vindicate the good elements of the Scots, Irish and colonials from English prejudice. The plays are highly patriotic and adhere to conventional morality. If Cumberland&#x27;s dialogue lacks brilliance and his characters reality, the construction of the plots is generally skilful, due to Cumberland&#x27;s insight into the secrets of theatrical effect. Though Cumberland&#x27;s sentimentality is often wearisome, his morality is generally sound; that if he was without the genius requisite for elevating the national drama, he did his best to keep it pure and sweet; and that if he borrowed much, he borrowed only the best aspects of other dramatists&#x27; work.

His first play was a tragedy, &quot;The Banishment of Cicero&quot;, published in 1761 after David Garrick rejected it; this was followed in 1765 by a musical drama, &quot;The Summer&#x27;s Tale&quot;, subsequently compressed into an afterpiece &quot;Amelia&quot; (1768). Cumberland first essayed sentimental comedy in &quot;The Brothers&quot; (1769). This play is inspired by Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot;; its comic characters are the jolly old tar Captain Ironsides, and the henpecked husband Sir Benjamin Dove, whose progress to self-assertion is genuinely comic. Horace Walpole said, that it acted well, but read ill, though he could distinguish in it &quot;strokes of Mr Bentley.&quot;

The epilogue paid a compliment to Garrick, who helped the production of Cumberland&#x27;s second comedy &quot;The West-Indian&quot; (1771). Its hero, who probably owes much to the suggestion of Garrick, is a young scapegrace fresh from the tropics, &quot;with rum and sugar enough belonging to him to make all the water in the Thames into punch,&quot;—a libertine with generous instincts, which prevail in the end. This early example of the modern drama was favourably received; Boden translated it into German, and Goethe acted in it at the Weimar court. &quot;The Fashionable Lover&quot; (1772) is a sentimental comedy, as is &quot;The Choleric Man&quot; (1774), founded on the &quot;Adelphi&quot; of Terence. Cumberland published his memoirs in 1806–07. George Romney, whose talent Cumberland encouraged, painted his portrait, which is in the National Portrait Gallery.

==Works==
Among his later comedies were:
*&quot;Calypso&quot; (1779)

<doc id="221857" wikidata="Q671479" url="?curid=221857" title="Sino-British Joint Declaration">
<text>The Sino-British Joint Declaration was a treaty between the governments of the United Kingdom and People&#x27;s Republic of China signed in 1984 setting the conditions in which Hong Kong was transferred to Chinese control and for the governance of the territory after 1 July 1997.

Hong Kong had been a colony of the British Empire since 1842 after the First Opium War and its territory was expanded on two occasions; first in 1860 with the addition of Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island, and again in 1898 when Britain obtained a 99-year lease for the New Territories. The date of the handover in 1997 marked the end of this lease.

The Chinese government declared in the treaty its basic policies for governing Hong Kong after the transfer. A special administrative region would be established in the territory that would be self-governing with a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign affairs and defence. Hong Kong would maintain its existing governing and economic systems separate from that of mainland China under the principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. This blueprint would be elaborated on in the Hong Kong Basic Law (the post-handover regional constitution) and the central government&#x27;s policies for the territory were to remain unchanged for a period of 50 years after 1997.

China has stated since 2014 that it considers the treaty to be spent with no further legal effect, while the United Kingdom maintains that the document remains binding in operation. Following China&#x27;s 2020 imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong and a 2021 National People&#x27;s Congress decision to approve a rework of local election laws that reduces the number of regional legislature seats elected by the public, the UK has declared China as being in a &quot;state of ongoing non-compliance&quot; with the Joint Declaration.

China deemed the document expired and invalid as of 30 June 1997, while the UK continues to believe that it remains valid and effective.

== Background ==
=== Phases of colonial expansion ===

Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842 after the Qing dynasty&#x27;s defeat in the First Opium War. The territory initially consisted only of Hong Kong Island and was expanded to include Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island in 1860 after another Qing loss in the Second Opium War.

After this addition, the British government resisted calls by colonial officials and merchants for further expansion into China, deciding to cease territorial acquisitions in the area. However, as Germany, Japan, and Russia coerced China into granting concessions in the late 1890s, Britain considered another expansion of Hong Kong to bolster the colony&#x27;s defence against attack from these other great powers. When France obtained a lease for Guangzhouwan, only away from Hong Kong, Britain entered into negotiations with the Qing to acquire the New Territories as a compensatory concession in 1898. The British negotiator considered the 99-year lease term to be sufficiently suggestive that the ceded area would be a permanent cession, which was granted rent-free.

=== Potential lease renegotiations ===
Hong Kong Governor Frederick Lugard first proposed renegotiating the lease as a formal cession in 1909 in return for restoring Weihaiwei to China. Although the Colonial and Foreign Offices considered this, the plan was never brought to the Chinese government before Weihaiwei was transferred to the Republic of China in 1930. Alternate plans that involved offering China a substantial loan and settling land disputes on the Burmese border were suggested, but these ideas similarly did not progress past discussion. The start of the Second World War and ensuing Japanese occupation of Hong Kong stifled further debate on obtaining a cession. The British government initially prepared for the possibility of having to relinquish Hong Kong after the war, but moved towards retaining the colony over the course of the conflict. Hong Kong returned to British control in 1945.

In the immediate post-war period, the Nationalist government continued this dialogue with the British about the future of Hong Kong, which included discussions of a full retrocession and proposals of turning the colony into an international city. However, communist victory in the Chinese Civil War made a transfer of Hong Kong to the Nationalists an increasingly unlikely scenario, and the status quo was maintained.

=== Coexistence with the People&#x27;s Republic ===
Although communist troops marched up to the border with Hong Kong, they did not try to forcefully take the colony. Initial engagement between the colonial and new Chinese authorities were largely friendly and cooperative. While it was clear that the long-term goal of the communists was to absorb the territory, they chose to take no action on the issue in the near-term. The Chinese were content with the political status of the colony for the time being so long as no efforts were made to introduce democratic development in the territory; they were simply hostile to the idea of a potentially independent Hong Kong. In 1972, China successfully petitioned the United Nations to remove Hong Kong from its list of non-self-governing territories, and declared that the colony was a &quot;Chinese territory under British administration&quot;. The United Kingdom did not raise any objections to this and the local population did not think the move was significant, but the implication of this change was that Communist China alone would determine the territory&#x27;s future, excluding the people of Hong Kong.

Post-war Hong Kong experienced rapid economic growth through the 1950s as it industrialised into a manufacturing-based export economy. This development continued through the following decades bolstered by a strong trading network, robust banking and financial systems, and an educated and growing workforce supplemented by continuing immigration from mainland China. As the Cultural Revolution embroiled mainland China beginning in 1966, local communists in Hong Kong started a series of demonstrations against colonial rule that escalated into the 1967 Hong Kong riots. However, the disturbances never gained local support and the subsequent restoration of public order conversely resulted in the colonial government achieving increased popularity among the territory&#x27;s residents. By the late 1970s, Hong Kong had become one of the largest trading ports and financial centres in the world.

=== Approaching deadline ===
Local investors began expressing their concern in the mid-1970s over the long-term viability of continued real estate investment. The colonial government could not legally grant new land leases in the New Territories past 1997 and needed to resolve the uncertainty with the Chinese government. During an official visit to Beijing in March 1979, Governor Murray MacLehose raised the issue with Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. MacLehose suggested setting aside the 1997 date for land leases and replacing those contracts with ones that were valid for as long as British administration continued in the colony. Deng rejected this suggestion, but he informed the governor that while sovereignty over Hong Kong belonged to China, the territory held a special status that would continue to be respected. MacLehose informed the public that further investment would be safe. Market reaction was optimistic; stock valuations rose and further investment in real estate boosted the value of Hong Kong&#x27;s land to the highest in the world.

Just before the start of formal negotiations with China over Hong Kong, Parliament enacted a major reform of British nationality law – the British Nationality Act 1981. Prior to the passage of this Act, all citizens of the British Empire (including Hongkongers) held a common nationality. Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs) previously had the unrestricted right to enter and live in the UK until 1962, although non-white immigration was systemically discouraged. Immigration from the colonies and other Commonwealth countries was gradually restricted by Parliament from 1962 to 1971 amid decolonisation, when British subjects originating from outside of the British Islands first had immigration controls imposed on them when entering the UK. The 1981 Act reclassified CUKCs into different nationality groups based on their ancestry and birthplace, and the vast majority of British subjects in Hong Kong became British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs) with right of abode only in Hong Kong. Only those reclassified as British citizens held an automatic right to live in the United Kingdom.

== Negotiations ==
Formal negotiations began in September 1982 with the arrival of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Hong Kong Governor Edward Youde in Beijing to meet with Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. In the initial phase of negotiations from October 1982 to June 1983, the main point of contention was the issue of sovereignty.

The goals of the Chinese government were made clear from the beginning of the process. China would resume both sovereignty and administration over Hong Kong in 1997. It would do this by force if necessary, but preferred to keep the territory&#x27;s socioeconomic climate stable to maximize the economic benefits it could reap from the transfer. Its proposed plan was to establish a special administrative region in the territory that would be governed by local residents and to maintain the existing structures of government and economy in place for as long as 50 years. Constitutional arrangements had already been made to implement this plan and the Chinese would not accept anything less than a full reversion of Hong Kong.

=== Sovereignty after 1997 ===
During her first visit to Beijing, Thatcher asserted the continuing validity of British treaty rights for the sovereignty of Hong Kong. The British began negotiations believing that they could secure an extension of the New Territories lease while retaining sovereignty of the ceded areas. Although the UK had just successfully defended its hold on the Falkland Islands in a war against Argentina, Hong Kong&#x27;s proximity to mainland China made a military defence of the territory impossible. Thatcher later recounted that Deng had told her directly &quot;I could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon&quot;, to which she replied, &quot;There is nothing I could do to stop you, but the eyes of the world would now know what China is like.&quot;

The Chinese pushed back against the assertion of sovereignty rights and insisted that it was not bound by the 19th-century unequal treaties that ceded Hong Kong to the UK. Even if the two sides had agreed on the binding nature of the Treaty of Nanking and Convention of Peking, the vast majority of the colony&#x27;s land still would have reverted to China at the conclusion of the New Territories lease. Because most of the territory&#x27;s industry was developed there, separating the leased area and returning only that part of the colony to China was economically and logistically infeasible. Negotiations were stalled until Britain conceded that it would relinquish sovereignty over the entire territory.

=== British attempt to extend administration ===
In the second phase of negotiations, the British attempted to negotiate an extension of their administration in Hong Kong past 1997 in exchange for their acknowledgement of Chinese sovereignty. This was again soundly rejected by the Chinese as unacceptable. The continued stalled state of negotiations precipitated a drop in investor confidence, causing a sharp decline in local property values that culminated with the crash of the Hong Kong dollar&#x27;s value on Black Saturday in September 1983.

The talks were entirely conducted without meaningful input from the people of Hong Kong. Early in the process, British officials had used the analogy of a &quot;three-legged stool&quot; to describe a scenario where Hong Kong was party to the negotiations with the United Kingdom and China. The Chinese government dismissed this idea, claiming that it already represented the interests of the people of Hong Kong. Local residents were apprehensive about the prospect of being handed over to Chinese rule and overwhelmingly preferred that Hong Kong remain a British territory; contemporary opinion polls show that 85 per cent of residents favoured this option. The Foreign Office rejected holding a general referendum on the future of the colony due to vehement opposition from the Chinese and because it assumed that educating the public on the complexity of the issue would be too difficult. Although the Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils had repeatedly petitioned the British negotiators to insist on continued administration for as long as possible, they were ultimately unsuccessful. By November 1983, the British accepted that they would have no further authority over Hong Kong after 1997.

=== Nationality and the Joint Liaison Group ===
Negotiations in 1984 centred on nationality and the role of the Joint Liaison Group. British negotiators and Hong Kong Executive Council members wanted to ensure the continued status of Hongkongers as British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs) after the transfer of sovereignty, but the Chinese would not allow this and even demanded that further granting of BDTC status be halted immediately. Although there were debates in the British Parliament on granting all residents British Overseas citizenship that could be transferred to children for up to two generations after 1997, this was not implemented and the Joint Declaration instead provided for a new status to be created. The Chinese initially wanted the Joint Liaison Group to act as an oversight committee during the transition period of administering Hong Kong up to the handover date. At the insistence of Governor Youde and Executive Council members, the group was limited in its scope to be strictly advisory.

A bilateral working group was created in June 1984 to draft the text of the treaty and its annexes. This was completed in three months, and on 26 September 1984, a draft copy of the Joint Declaration was initialed by British Ambassador to China Richard Evans and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Nan. The final version was signed on 19 December 1984 by Prime Minister Thatcher and Premier Zhao in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing; the treaty came into force when instruments of ratification were exchanged on 27 May 1985 and was registered at the United Nations by both governments on 12 June 1985.

== Content ==
The Joint Declaration consists of its main text, Annex I elaborating the Chinese government&#x27;s basic policies for Hong Kong, Annex II concerning plans for the Sino–British Joint Liaison Group, Annex III explaining protections for land leases granted by the colonial government, and two memoranda from each party describing transitional nationality arrangements for local residents.

=== Main text ===
In the main text of the treaty, the Chinese government declared its intention to resume the exercise of its sovereignty over the entire area of Hong Kong (including the ceded areas of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula, as well as the leased New Territories) on 1 July 1997 and the British government agreed to transfer control of the territory on that date. China stated its basic policies for administering the returned area; it would establish a special administrative region that would be autonomous in governing local affairs. The economic, social, governing, and legal systems would remain basically unchanged from as they existed under colonial administration. Hong Kong would remain a separate customs territory with free flow of capital. Civil and property rights would remain protected after the transfer of sovereignty. During the transition period from the date the treaty came into force until 30 June 1997, the United Kingdom would continue to be responsible for administering Hong Kong with the objective of maintaining its economic prosperity and social stability.

=== Annex I: Chinese basic policies for Hong Kong ===
The first annex of the treaty elaborates on the Chinese government&#x27;s basic policies for Hong Kong. There are 14 policies listed in Annex I, providing a framework under which the post-handover government would be established. This part of the Joint Declaration provides for economic and administrative continuity through the transfer of sovereignty. Executive, legislative, and judicial powers would be devolved by the central government to the special administrative region, which is given a &quot;high degree of autonomy&quot; in exercising those powers in all areas except for defence and diplomatic affairs. The region retains the ability to maintain separate economic and cultural relations with foreign nations. Socialism as practised in mainland China would not be extended to Hong Kong and the territory&#x27;s capitalist economy and the civil liberties of its residents (such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion) would be protected and remain unchanged for 50 years.

The territory would be allowed to maintain its separate financial markets; the Hong Kong dollar remains the regional currency. In the areas of civil aviation and maritime shipping, Hong Kong would continue as a separate entity from the mainland. Education and the maintenance of public order would be the regional government&#x27;s responsibility. Right of abode in Hong Kong and immigration matters remain separate from mainland China, and the region could issue its own passports. All of these policies would be further detailed in the Hong Kong Basic Law, which would stipulate the framework in which the new special administrative region would function.

=== Annex II: Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ===
The second annex of the treaty provided for the establishment of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, consisting of diplomats from both governments, to facilitate ongoing dialogue for the implementation of the Joint Declaration and a smooth transfer of government. This group was strictly intended to be a channel of close communication for both parties and did not have authority to supervise or participate in the administration of the territory. The Joint Liaison Group was given two specific objectives during the period between its establishment and the transfer of sovereignty. In the first half of this period, it would consider actions necessary to maintain Hong Kong&#x27;s status as a separate customs territory and ensure continuity of its international rights and obligations. During the second half leading up to the handover, the Liaison Group would consider actions needed to ensure a successful transition in 1997 and assist the incoming regional government in developing relations and agreements with other countries and international organisations for economic and cultural purposes. The mandate for this group ended on 1 January 2000.

=== Annex III: Land leases ===
The third annex of the treaty dealt with the validity of land leases granted by the colonial Hong Kong government. All existing land lease contracts continue to be recognised by the post-handover SAR government. All leases without options of renewal that expired before 30 June 1997 could be extended for periods lasting no later than 30 June 2047. New leases granted by the colonial government after the treaty came into force could last no longer than the 2047 date and were subject to a 50-hectare annual aggregate limit on the total amount of land the government could contract out for purposes other than for housing. A Land Commission consisting of an equal number of representatives from the British and Chinese governments was established to oversee the implementation of this annex until the transfer of sovereignty in 1997.

=== Memoranda on nationality ===
The memoranda attached to the end of the treaty contains transitional nationality arrangements for local residents, which included a stipulation that a new nationality would be created for Hongkongers that did not confer right of abode in the United Kingdom. The Hong Kong Act 1985 created the British National (Overseas) status to fulfil this requirement. All British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs) connected with Hong Kong who did not have a connection with a remaining British Dependent Territory would lose that status on the day of the transfer in 1997. Ethnic Chinese Hongkongers became Chinese nationals and could only retain British nationality if they had registered as BN(O)s before the handover. Although they were permitted to use British passports for international travel after the transfer, ethnic Chinese BN(O)s were explicitly restricted from accessing British consular protection within the Hong Kong SAR or any other part of Chinese territory. Residents who were not ethnically Chinese, had not registered as BN(O)s, and would have been stateless on that date automatically became British Overseas citizens.

== Post-agreement ==
=== Contemporary reactions ===
The signing of the Joint Declaration caused some controversy in the United Kingdom because UK&#x27;s Conservative Party Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was agreeing with China&#x27;s Communist government represented by Deng Xiaoping. In the White Paper that contained the Joint Declaration, it was declared by Her Majesty&#x27;s Government that &quot;the alternative to acceptance of the present agreement is to have no agreement&quot;, a statement meant as a rebuttal to criticisms that the declaration had made too many concessions to China, and hinting at China&#x27;s significant leverage during the negotiations.

Some political analysts thought that there was an urgency to make an agreement because there were fears that without a treaty the economy in Hong Kong would collapse in the 1980s. Concerns about land ownership in the leased New Territories also added to the problem. Although discussions on the future of Hong Kong had started in the late 1970s, the final timing of the Joint Declaration was more affected by property and economic factors rather than geopolitical necessities.

=== Initial period after 1997 transfer ===
In the immediate years following the transfer of sovereignty, Chinese oversight of Hong Kong was considered relatively benign and hands-off. Although the Chinese had reversed the last British democratic reforms for Legislative Council elections, general governance of the region was otherwise virtually unchanged. While most organisations with royal patronage dropped this association prior to the handover, there was no strict requirement for renaming; the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club and Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch maintain the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix in their names. Colonial-era street names and postbox royal cyphers are not actively removed by the government and remain unchanged.

After the Asian financial crisis in 1997 the Hong Kong measures were taken with the full co-operation of the Central Chinese government. This did not mean that the Chinese government dictated what to do and therefore still followed the points of the declaration. 
Despite this autonomy, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region sometimes sought interference from the Central Chinese government. For example, in 1999 the government of the HKSAR asked China&#x27;s State Council to seek an interpretation by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee on a provision in the Basic Law. The original decision reached by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal was seen as problematic by the HKSAR government as it would have allowed up to 1.6 million mainland immigrants to enter Hong Kong. The Chinese authorities obliged and the Hong Kong court&#x27;s judgment was overturned, stopping the potential immigration.

Pressures from the mainland government were also apparent, for example in 2000, after the election of pro-independence candidate Chen Shui-bian as Taiwan&#x27;s president, a senior mainland official in Hong Kong warned journalists not to report the news. Another senior official advised businessmen not to do business with pro-independence Taiwanese.

With this and other changes, ten years after the return, in 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that on the one hand, &quot;nothing has changed since the handover to China 10 years ago&quot;, but this was in comparison to the situation before the last governor Chris Patten had introduced democratic reforms three years before the handover. A chance for democracy had been lost as Hong Kong had just begun to develop three vital elements for a western-style democracy (the rule of law, official accountability and a political class outside the one-party system) but the Sino–British deal had prevented any of these changes to continue according to Jonathan Fenby of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Wu Bangguo, the chairman of the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee stated in a conference in Beijing 2007, that &quot;Hong Kong had considerable autonomy only because the central government had chosen to authorize that autonomy&quot;.

=== Dispute over treaty&#x27;s status ===
The Chinese and Hong Kong governments have stated since 2014 that they consider the Joint Declaration to have ceased any legal effect after the transfer of sovereignty, and that the central government&#x27;s basic policies as elaborated in the document were a unilateral statement not actually binding. These statements are directly contradicted by the 50-year period of unchanged policies in Hong Kong that the central government committed to as part of the Joint Declaration. Chinese government reiterated in 2017 that the Joint Declaration was a &quot;historical document&quot; that no longer had any practical significance. Former LegCo president and Standing Committee member Rita Fan has asserted that United Kingdom supervisory responsibility over the Joint Declaration&#x27;s implementation lapsed when the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group disbanded in 2000.

The United Kingdom, United States, and G7 maintain that the Joint Declaration remains valid and in force. The Foreign Office has labelled the Causeway Bay Books disappearances in 2015, enactment of the Hong Kong national security law in 2020, disqualification of opposition Legislative Council candidates in 2020, and electoral reform in 2021 as serious breaches of the treaty. Since 2021, the UK has considered China to be in a &quot;state of ongoing non-compliance&quot; with the Joint Declaration.

China disregards accusations of Joint Declaration breaches as foreign interference and neocolonist tampering, and considers Hong Kong matters to be part of its internal affairs. Chinese foreign ministry spokespersons have repeatedly stated that the United Kingdom lacks supervisory authority over Hong Kong following the handover in 1997 and that the treaty is a historical document with no extant binding authority. The central government&#x27;s primary regional agency, the Hong Kong Liaison Office, declared in April 2020 that it was exempt from Basic Law restrictions on mainland government interference in local affairs.

Following China&#x27;s imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong in 2020, the UK extended residence rights and created a new path to citizenship for Hong Kong residents with British National (Overseas) status. The Chinese government derided this change as &quot;gross interference&quot; and subsequently withdrew recognition of BN(O) passports as valid travel documents in 2021. The United States enacted the Hong Kong Autonomy Act in response to the national security law, and imposed economic sanctions on 34 individuals that the US State and Treasury Departments determined to have materially contributed to Joint Declaration breaches. The list of sanctioned persons includes Chief Executive Carrie Lam, principal officials of the Hong Kong government, and members of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress.

In March 2024 the pro-Beijing legislature in Hong Kong fast-tracked Article 23, a new security law which introduces harsh new penalties such as life imprisonment for new offences such as external interference and insurrection. Critics claim the law further erodes the civil liberties that were enshrined in the Joint Declaration.

<text>Ashes of Time () is a 1994 Hong Kong film written and directed by Wong Kar-wai, and inspired by characters from Jin Yong&#x27;s novel &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot;. Director Wong Kar Wai regards the film as his most important work.

==Summary==
The film follows the main antagonist Ouyang Feng, from the novel &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot;, when he is a young man crossing paths with other important characters. The movie humanizes Feng and depicts the events that lead to his descent into villainy. It sometimes completely subverts the intended meaning of the novel, as in Feng&#x27;s copulation with his sister-in-law, which is depicted as sinister and taboo in the book but is shown as true love in the film; the longing for her serves as a common theme that echoes throughout the movie.

==Cast==
* Leslie Cheung as Ouyang Feng, the Western Venom
* Tony Leung Ka-fai as Huang Yaoshi, the Eastern Heretic
* Brigitte Lin as Murong Yang / Murong Yin / Dugu Qiubai
* Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Blind Swordsman
* Carina Lau as Peach Blossom, Blind Swordsman&#x27;s wife
* Charlie Yeung as Girl with mule
* Jacky Cheung as Hong Qigong, the Northern Beggar
* Maggie Cheung as Ouyang Feng&#x27;s sister-in-law
* Li Bai as Hong Qigong&#x27;s wife
* Siu Tak-fu
* Collin Chou as Swordsman
* Lau Shun

==Production==
In the 1960s, King Hu&#x27;s &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot; raised the artistic level of wuxia films. Wong grew up immersed in wuxia culture. In 1972, Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; brought jianghu culture to the global stage. In the mid-1990s, wuxia films entered a new stage. Wong selected characters from &quot;new-school&quot; wuxia novelist Jin Yong&#x27;s novel &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; and created an unprecedented wuxia story.

The film&#x27;s story is a prequel to the novel &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; as it imagines the older characters when they were younger. It focuses on the main antagonist (Ouyang Feng) and humanizes him into a protagonist while retaining his despicable qualities. Feng, known as the Western Venom, crosses paths with the other powerful wuxia masters. Their backstories are depicted with great liberty and sometimes completely subvert the intended meaning from the novel.

During the film&#x27;s long-delayed production, Wong produced a parody of the same novel with much of the same cast (in different roles) titled &quot;The Eagle Shooting Heroes&quot;.

Using negatives from around the world, Wong re-edited and re-scored the film in 2008 for future theater, DVD and Blu-ray releases under the title Ashes of Time Redux. The film was reduced from 100 to 93 minutes.

==Soundtrack==
The music was composed by Frankie Chan and Roel A. García, and produced by Rock Records in Hong Kong and Taiwan. It was released in 1994. The redux version features additional cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film opened in Hong Kong it received mixed reviews. Critics found it so elliptical that it was almost impossible to make out any semblance of a plot, Wong Kar Wai made an introspective film that focuses on the main characters’ inner lives rather than their martial arts performances. This decision is very rare in a wuxia film (a genre of fiction about martial artists in ancient China).

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Lawrence Van Gelder also gave &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; a mixed review:

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 78% of critics have given &quot;Ashes of Time Redux&quot; a positive review based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Wong Kar Wai&#x27;s redux, with a few slight changes from his 1994 classic, is a feast for the eyes, if a little difficult to follow.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 20 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<text>Hermann Julius Theodor Hettner (March 12, 1821 – May 29, 1882), was a German literary historian and museum director.

== Biography ==
He was born at Leisersdorf (Uniejowice), near Goldberg (Złotoryja), in Silesia. At the universities of Berlin, Halle and Heidelberg he concentrated on the study of philosophy, but in 1843 turned his attention to aesthetics, art and literature. In order to progress with these studies, he spent three years in Italy, and, on his return, published a &quot;Vorschule zur bildenden Kunst der Alten&quot; (1848) and an essay on &quot;Die neapolitanischen Malerschulen&quot;.

He became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; for aesthetics and the history of art at Heidelberg in 1847 where he associated he became acquainted with the philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach, the Dutch scientist Jacob Moleschott and the Swiss poet Gottfried Keller. While at Heidelberg, Hettner married Marie von Stockmar, daughter of statesman Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar. From this marriage, three children emerged, including the German archaeologist .

After the publication of his volume &quot;Die romantische Schule in ihrem Zusammenhang mit Goethe und Schiller&quot; (1850), Hettner accepted a call as professor to the University of Jena where he lectured on the history of both art and literature. There he produced the book &quot;Das moderne Drama&quot; (1852). This work, which was shaped by correspondence with Keller, was greatly influential on major 19th-century Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen who read it shortly after its publication during a trip to Copenhagen and Dresden. Hettner&#x27;s argument for the psychological treatment of character being most important as a model for contemporary plays was one of the formative experiences in Ibsen&#x27;s career.

In 1855 Hettner was appointed director of the royal collections of antiquities and the museum of plaster casts at Dresden, to which posts were subsequently added that of director of the historical museum and a professorship at the Royal Saxon Polytechnic. He remained there until his death.

Hettner&#x27;s chief work is his &quot;Literaturgeschichte des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts&quot; (&quot;Literary History of the 18th century&quot;), which appeared in three parts, devoted respectively to English, French and German literature, between 1856 and 1870. The series was regarded as &quot;comprehensive and discriminating&quot;, with the third part being republished in multiple editions until 1961. Although to some extent influenced by the political and literary theories of the Hegelian school, which, since Hettner&#x27;s day have fallen into discredit, and at times losing sight of the main issues of literary development over questions of social evolution, this work is one of the most highly regarded histories of 18th century German literature.

Hettner&#x27;s other works include &quot;Griechische Reiseskizzen&quot; (&quot;Greek Travel Sketches&quot;) (1853), &quot;Italienische Studien&quot; (1879) and several works descriptive of the Dresden art collections. His &quot;Kleine Schriften&quot; were collected and published in 1884.

<text>The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU; , UIP) is an international organization of national parliaments. Its primary purpose is to promote democratic governance, accountability, and cooperation among its members; other initiatives include advancing gender parity among legislatures, empowering youth participation in politics, and sustainable development.

The organization was established in 1889 as the Inter-Parliamentary Conference. Its founders were statesmen Frédéric Passy of France and William Randal Cremer of the United Kingdom, who sought to create the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, IPU membership was reserved for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed to include the legislatures of sovereign states. As of 2020, the national parliaments of 180 countries are members of the IPU, while 13 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members.

The IPU facilitates the development of international law and institutions, strengthening the foundations and enhancing the vision for peace and the common good, including the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the League of Nations, and the United Nations. It also sponsors and takes part in international conferences and forums, and has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly. Consequently, eight individuals associated with the organization are Nobel Peace Prize laureates.

==History==

The organisation&#x27;s initial objective was the arbitration of conflicts. The IPU played an important part in setting up the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Over time, its mission has evolved towards the promotion of democracy and inter-parliamentary dialogue. The IPU has worked for establishment of institutions at the inter-governmental level, including the United Nations, an organization with which it cooperates and with which it has permanent observer status.

The headquarters of the union have been moved several times since its inception.
Locations:
*1892–1911: Bern (Switzerland)
*1911–1914: Brussels (Belgium)
*1914–1920: Oslo (Norway)
*1921–present: Geneva (Switzerland)

Eight leading personalities of the IPU have received Nobel Peace Prizes:

*1901: Frédéric Passy (France)
*1902: Charles Albert Gobat (Switzerland)
*1903: Randal Cremer (United Kingdom)
*1908: Fredrik Bajer (Denmark)
*1909: Auguste Marie François Beernaert (Belgium)
*1913: Henri La Fontaine (Belgium)
*1921: Christian Lange (Norway)
*1927: Ferdinand Buisson (France)

== Members and organization ==

===Members===
At its founding on 30 June 1889, the Inter-Parliamentary Conference had eight members: Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Liberia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The United States also attended but did not formally adopt the treaty of arbitration.

The Inter-Parliamentary Union currently has 180 members.

* Regional parliamentary assemblies may be admitted by the Governing Council as Associate Members
* Every Parliament constituted in conformity with the laws of a sovereign State whose population it represents and on whose territory it functions may request affiliation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The decision to admit or readmit a Parliament shall be taken by the Governing Council.

It is the duty of the Members of the IPU to submit the resolutions of the IPU within their respective Parliament, in the most appropriate form; to communicate them to the Government; to stimulate their implementation and to inform the IPU Secretariat, as often and fully as possible, particularly in its annual reports, as to the steps taken and the results obtained.

As it can be seen on the map, mostly all the countries in the world have a parliament member of IPU, with the notable exception of the United States, although the 12th (1904), the 23rd (1925) and the 42nd (1953) conferences were hosted in the US.

;Associate Members
The participating parliamentary assemblies other than national parliaments are the following:
=== Organs ===

The organs of the Inter-Parliamentary Union are:

* Assembly. Meeting biannually, the Assembly is composed of parliamentarians designated as delegates by the Members. The Assembly is assisted in its work by Standing Committees, whose number and terms of reference are determined by the Governing Council; Standing Committees shall normally prepare reports and draft resolutions for the Assembly. No one delegate may record more than ten votes.
* Governing Council. The Governing Council normally holds two sessions a year. The Governing Council is composed of three representatives from each Member. The term of office of a member of the Governing Council lasts from one Assembly to the next and all the members of the Governing Council must be sitting members of Parliament. The Governing Council elects the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union for a period of three years. It also elects the members of the executive committee and appoints the Secretary General of the Union.
* Executive Committee. The executive committee is composed of the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, 15 members belonging to different Parliaments (elected by the Governing Council; not less than 12 are elected from among the members of the Governing Council) and the President of the Coordinating Committee of the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians. The fifteen elected seats are assigned to the geopolitical groups. Only parliamentarians from States where women have both the right to vote and the right to stand for election are eligible to the executive committee. The executive committee is the administrative organ of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The current President is Portuguese MP Mr. Duarte Pacheco, who was elected in November 2020.
* Secretariat. The Secretariat constitutes the totality of the staff of the organisation under the direction of the Secretary General, currently Martin Chungong of Cameroon.

The Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments is a consultative body of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

== Assemblies ==

The Assembly is the IPU&#x27;s main political body through which the IPU&#x27;s Member Parliaments adopt parliamentary resolutions on global issues. It plays a pivotal role in addressing the issues which threaten peace, democracy and sustainable development, including through its four thematic standing committees. IPU Assemblies are held twice a year either in Geneva or hosted by Member Parliaments.
==Presidents==

==Amendments to the Statutes ==
Any proposal to amend the Statutes shall be submitted in writing to the Secretariat of the Union at least three months before the meeting of the Assembly. The Secretariat will immediately communicate all such proposals to the Members of the Union. The consideration of such proposed amendments shall be automatically placed on the agenda of the Assembly.

Any sub-amendments shall be submitted in writing to the Secretariat of the Union at least six weeks before the meeting of the Assembly. The Secretariat will immediately communicate all such sub-amendments to the Members of the Union.

After hearing the opinion of the Governing Council, expressed through a simple majority vote, the Assembly shall decide on such proposals by a two-thirds majority vote.

==The IPU and the United Nations==

The IPU marked the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, in 1995, by holding a special session in the General Assembly Hall before the start of the session, where they planned for closer cooperation with the United Nations. The General Assembly Resolution passed during that session requested the Secretary-General to put this into action. An agreement was signed between the IPU and the Secretary-General on 24 July 1996 and subsequently ratified by a General Assembly Resolution, where the United Nations recognizes IPU as the world organization of parliaments. Pursuant to this resolution, the Secretary-General submitted a report which was noted with appreciation by the General Assembly, who requested further strengthening of cooperation and another report. This report detailed the measures that had been taken, including opening a liaison office in New York, and cooperation on issues such land-mines and the promotion of representative democracy. Following an entire morning of debate the General Assembly passed a resolution which simply stated that it &quot;looks forward to continued close cooperation&quot;.

The following year (1999) the Secretary-General reported on an increased number of areas of cooperation, the issue was debated for an entire afternoon (interrupted by a minute of silence held for tribute to Vazgen Sargsyan, the Prime Minister of Armenia who had just at that time been killed by gunmen), and passed a resolution requesting the IPU be allowed to address the Millennium General Assembly directly.

Following another report, and another half-day debate, the General Assembly welcomed the IPU declaration entitled &quot;The Parliamentary vision for international cooperation at the dawn of the third millennium&quot; and called for the Secretary-General to explore new and further ways in which the relationship could be strengthened.

On 19 November 2002 the IPU was granted observer status to the General Assembly.

In the Resolution &quot;59/19, Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union&quot;, the UN General Assembly takes note of the recommendations in regard to engaging parliamentarians more systematically in the work of
the United Nations.

The final declaration of the Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, hosted at United Nations headquarters, took place in September 2005, was entitled &quot;Bridging the democracy gap in international relations: A stronger role for parliament&quot;.

In the Resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly, &quot;61/6, Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union&quot;, on 27 November 2006, it calls for &quot;the further development of the annual parliamentary hearing at the United Nations and other specialized parliamentary meetings in the context of major United Nations meetings as joint United Nations-Inter-Parliamentary Union events&quot;.

Every year during the fall session of the General Assembly the IPU organises a Parliamentary Hearing. A resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU allowed for circulation of official IPU documents in the General Assembly.

UN and the IPU cooperate closely in various fields, in particular peace and security, economic and social development, international law, human rights, and democracy and gender issues, but IPU has not obtained the status of UN General Assembly subsidiary organ.

=== Fourth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament ===
The fourth world conference on UN 70th anniversary marked by Ban Ki-Moon as &quot;UN70&quot; was organised in September 2015 where Speakers of all IPU (Inter-Parliamentary Union) member parliaments and of non-member parliaments were invited from across the world. The theme was on peace, democracy, and development.

<text>André Ernest Modeste Grétry (; baptised 11 February 1741; died 24 September 1813) was a 
composer from the Prince-Bishopric of Liège (present-day Belgium), who worked from 1767 onwards in France and took French nationality. He is most famous for his &quot;opéras comiques&quot;. His music influenced Mozart and Beethoven both of whom wrote variations on his works.

== Biography ==
He was born at Liège, his father being a poor musician. He was a choirboy at the church of St. Denis (Liège). In 1753 he became a pupil of Jean-Pantaléon Leclerc and later of the organist at St-Pierre de Liège, Nicolas Rennekin, for keyboard and composition and of Henri Moreau, music master at the collegiate church of St. Paul. But of greater importance was the practical tuition he received by attending the performance of an Italian opera company. Here he heard the operas of Baldassarre Galuppi, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, and other masters; and the desire of completing his own studies in Italy was the immediate result. To find the necessary means he composed in 1759 a mass which he dedicated to the canons of the Liège Cathedral, and it was at the expense of Canon Hurley that he went to Italy in March 1759. In Rome he went to the Collège de Liège. Here Grétry resided for five years, studiously employed in completing his musical education under Giovanni Battista Casali. His proficiency in harmony and counterpoint was, however, according to his own confession, at all times very moderate.

His first great success was achieved by &quot;La vendemmiatrice&quot;, an Italian intermezzo or operetta, composed for the Aliberti theatre in Rome and received with universal applause. It is said that the study of the score of one of Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny&#x27;s operas, lent to him by a secretary of the French embassy in Rome, decided Grétry to devote himself to French comic opera. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1767 he accordingly left Rome, and after a short stay at Geneva (where he made the acquaintance of Voltaire, and produced another operetta) went to Paris.

There for two years he had to contend with the difficulties attendant on poverty and obscurity. He was, however, not without friends, and by the intercession of Count Gustaf Philip Creutz, the Swedish ambassador, Grétry obtained a libretto from Jean-François Marmontel, which he set to music in less than six weeks, and which, on its performance in August 1768, met with unparalleled success. The name of the opera was &quot;Le Huron&quot;. Two others, &quot;Lucile&quot; and &quot;Le tableau parlant&quot;, soon followed, and thenceforth Grétry&#x27;s position as the leading composer of comic opera was safely established.

Altogether he composed some fifty operas. His masterpieces are &quot;Zémire et Azor&quot; and &quot;Richard Coeur-de-lion&quot;—the first produced in 1771, the second in 1784. The latter in an indirect way became connected with a great historic event. In it occurs the celebrated romance, &quot;O Richard, O mon Roi, l&#x27;univers t&#x27;abandonne&quot;, which was sung at the banquet – &quot;fatal as that of Thyestes,&quot; remarks Carlyle – given by the bodyguard to the officers of the Versailles garrison on 3 October 1789. La Marseillaise not long afterwards became the reply of the people to the expression of loyalty borrowed from Grétry&#x27;s opera. &quot;Richard Cœur de Lion&quot; was translated and adapted for the English stage by John Burgoyne.

Grétry was the first to write for the &quot;tuba curva&quot;, an instrument that existed from Roman times as the cornu. He used the tuba curva in music that he composed for the funeral of Voltaire. His opera-ballet &quot;La caravane du Caire&quot;, with modest &quot;turquerie&quot; exoticism in harp and triangle accompaniment, is a rescue adventure along the lines of &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;; premiered at Fontainebleau in 1783, it remained in the French repertory for fifty years.

Grétry also made use of the mandolin in his compositions. Philip J. Bone speculated that Grétry was exposed to the instrument while in Italy, and said &quot;he makes use of it upon various occasions, in this instance with a telling and marked impression.&quot; &quot;This instance&quot; was the serenade &quot;While all are sleeping&quot; from Grétry&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;amant jaloux&quot;. Bone called the serenade &quot;a delicate accompaniment for two mandolins&quot;.

The composer himself was influenced by the great events he witnessed, and the titles of some of his operas, such as &quot;La rosière républicaine&quot; and &quot;La fête de la raison&quot;, sufficiently indicate the epoch to which they belong; but they are mere &quot;pièces de circonstance&quot;, and the republican enthusiasm displayed is not genuine. Little more successful was Grétry in his dealings with classical subjects. His genuine power lay in the delineation of character and in the expression of tender and typically French sentiment. The structure of his concerted pieces on the other hand is frequently flimsy, and his instrumentation so feeble that the orchestral parts of some of his works had to be rewritten by other composers, in order to make them acceptable to modern audiences. During the Revolution Grétry lost much of his property, but the successive governments of France vied in favouring the composer, regardless of political differences. From the old court he received distinctions and rewards of all kinds; the republic made him an inspector of the conservatoire; Napoleon granted him the cross of the legion of honour and a pension.

Grétry took students in opera composition, including his daughter Lucile and Caroline Wuiet. He died at the Hermitage in Montmorency, formerly the house of Rousseau. Fifteen years after his death Grétry&#x27;s heart was transferred to his birthplace, permission having been obtained after a protracted lawsuit. In 1842 a large bronze statue of the composer was set up at Liège. His heart remains in it, while his body is buried in Paris at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

During his life, a commemorative statue was made of him by Jean-Baptiste Stouf. It was commissioned in 1804 by Hippolyte, comte de Livry, and placed in the Opéra Comique in 1809. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

Grétry was married to the painter Jeanne-Marie Grandon.

<text>Jean-François Marmontel (; 11 July 1723 – 31 December 1799) was a French historian, writer and a member of the Encyclopédistes movement.

== Biography ==

He was born of poor parents at Bort, Limousin (today in Corrèze). After studying with the Jesuits at Mauriac, Cantal, he taught in their colleges at Clermont-Ferrand and Toulouse; and in 1745, acting on the advice of Voltaire, he set out for Paris to try for literary success.

From 1748 to 1753 he wrote a succession of tragedies: &quot;Denys le Tyran&quot; (1748); &quot;Aristomene&quot; (1749); &quot;Cleopâtre&quot; (1750); &quot;Heraclides&quot; (1752); &quot;Egyptus&quot; (1753). These literary works, though only moderately successful on the stage, secured Marmontel&#x27;s introduction into literary and fashionable circles.

He wrote a series of articles for the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; evincing considerable critical power and insight, which in their collected form, under the title &quot;Eléments de Littérature&quot;, still rank among the French classics. He also wrote several comic operas, the two best of which probably are &quot;Sylvain&quot; (1770) and &quot;Zémire et Azore&quot; (1771). In the Gluck–Piccinni controversy he was an eager partisan of Piccinni with whom he collaborated in Roland (Piccinni) (1778) and Atys (1779), both using Jean Baptiste Lully&#x27;s libretto by Quinault as basis, &quot;Didon&quot; (1783) and &quot;Penelope&quot; (1785).

In 1758 he gained the patronage of Madame de Pompadour, who obtained for him a place as a civil servant, and the management of the official journal &quot;Le Mercure&quot;, in which he had already begun the famous series of &quot;Contes moraux&quot;. The merit of these tales lies partly in the delicate finish of the style, but mainly in the graphic and charming pictures of French society under King Louis XV. The author was elected to the Académie française in 1763. In 1767 he published &quot;Bélisaire&quot;, now remarkable in part because of a chapter on religious toleration which incurred the censure of the Sorbonne and the archbishop of Paris. Marmontel retorted in &quot;Les Incas, ou la destruction de l&#x27;empire du Perou&quot; (1777) by tracing the cruelties in Spanish America to the religious fanaticism of the invaders.

He was appointed historiographer of France (1771), secretary to the Academy (1783), and professor of history in the Lycée (1786). As a historiographer, Marmontel wrote a history of the regency (1788). Reduced to poverty by the French Revolution, Marmontel retired during the Reign of Terror to Evreux, and soon afterwards to a cottage at Abloville (near Saint-Aubin-sur-Gaillon) in the &quot;département&quot; of Eure. There he wrote &quot;Memoires d&#x27;un père&quot; (4 vols., 1804), including a picturesque review of his life, a literary history of two important reigns, a great gallery of portraits extending from the venerable Jean Baptiste Massillon, whom more than half a century previously he had seen at Clermont, to Honoré Mirabeau. The book was nominally written for the instruction of his children. It contains an exquisite picture of his own childhood in the Limousin; its value for the literary historian is great.

Marmontel lived for some time under the roof of Madame Geoffrin, and was present at her famous dinners given to artists; he was welcomed into most of the houses where the encyclopaedists met, and was a contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers&quot;. He thus had at his command the best material for his portraits, and made good use of his opportunities. After a short stay in Paris when elected in 1797 to the &quot;Conseil des Anciens&quot;, he died at Abloville.

He was a member of the Masonic lodge Les Neuf Sœurs.

John Ruskin named him as one of the three people in history who were the most influential for him. In his autobiography, John Stuart Mill credits &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un père&quot; with curing him of depression.

<text>John Hoppner (4 April 175823 January 1810) was an English portrait painter, much influenced by Reynolds, who achieved fame as a colourist.

==Early life==
Hoppner was born in Whitechapel, London, the son of German parents – his mother was one of the German attendants at the royal palace. King George showed a fatherly interest and patronage of the young boy that gave rise to rumours, quite unfounded, that he may have been his illegitimate son.

Hoppner became a chorister at the royal chapel, but, showing strong inclination for art, in 1775 he entered the Royal Academy. In 1778, he took a silver medal for drawing from life, and in 1782 the Academy&#x27;s highest award, the gold medal for historical painting, his subject being King Lear.

==Career==
Hoppner first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. His earliest love was for landscape, but necessity obliged him to turn to the more lucrative business of portrait painting. At once successful, he had throughout life the most fashionable and wealthy sitters, and was the greatest rival to the growing attraction of Thomas Lawrence. He rarely attempted ideal subjects, though a &quot;Sleeping Venus&quot;, &quot;Belisarius&quot;, &quot;Jupiter and Io&quot;, a &quot;Bacchante&quot; and &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; are recorded among his works. The Prince of Wales visited him especially often, and many of his finest portraits were hung in the state apartments at St James&#x27;s Palace, notably those of the prince himself, the Duke and Duchess of York, Lord Rodney and Lord Nelson. His other sitters included Sir Walter Scott, the Duke of Wellington, Henry Bartle Frere and Sir George Beaumont.

According to the 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;:
Competent judges have deemed his most successful works to be his portraits of women and children... He was confessedly an imitator of Reynolds. When first painted, his works were much admired for the brilliancy and harmony of their colouring, but the injury due to destructive mediums and lapse of time which many of them suffered caused a great depreciation in his reputation. The appearance, however, of some of his pictures in good condition has shown that his fame as a brilliant colourist was well-founded. His drawing is faulty, but his touch has qualities of breadth and freedom that give to his paintings a faint reflection of the charm of Reynolds.

In 1803, he published &quot;A Series of Portraits of Ladies&quot;, engraved after his paintings by Charles Wilkin, and in 1805 a volume of translations of Eastern tales into English verse.

Unusually Hoppner painted the background and perhaps more of a full-length portrait of Charlotte, Countess Talbot by Thomas Gainsborough in 1788, the year in which Gainsborough died. It is now in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery.

==Personal life==

He married Phoebe Wright, the daughter of American-born sculptor Patience Wright. They had five children, although little is known about the youngest:
* Catherine Hampden Hoppner (1784–1828), Magistrate, East India Company
* Richard Belgrave Hoppner (1786–1872), British Consul general, Venice, and friend of Byron (ref: Oxford DNB, entry on RBH in entry on John Hoppner) 
* Wilson (sometimes known as William) Lascelles Hoppner (1788-?), artist
* Henry Parkyns Hoppner (1795–1833), officer of the Royal Navy, Arctic explorer, draughtsman/artist
* youngest unknown Hoppner

==Death==
In his later years Hoppner suffered from a chronic disease of the liver. He died on 23 January 1810.

<text>Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target (, 17 December 1733 – 9 September 1806) was a French lawyer and politician.

==Biography==

Born in Paris, Target was the son of a lawyer, and was himself a lawyer to the Parlement of Paris. He acquired a great reputation as a lawyer, less by practice in the courts than in a consultative capacity, and served the ancien régime as member of a committee to revise the civil and criminal laws of the kingdom. He strenuously opposed the &quot;parlement Maupeou&quot;, devised by Chancellor Maupeou to replace the old judiciary bodies in 1771, refusing to plead before it, an act that earned him the sobriquet of the &quot;Virgin of the palace&quot;.

He was counsel for Louis René Edouard, cardinal de Rohan in the &quot;affair of the diamond necklace&quot;.

In 1785, he was elected to the Académie Française.

He contributed to the development of the Edict of Tolerance signed at Versailles by Louis XVI in 1787.

==French Revolution==

In 1789, he was returned as one of the deputies of the Third Estate in Paris to the Estates-General, and he was instrumental in writing up the cahiers de doléances of Paris. He went on to support revolutionary measures such as the union of the orders, the suspensive veto, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the last of which he was one of the principal authors. He was one of many deputies named to the Constitutional Committee in September 1789, to replace those conservative members who resigned. 
He presided over the National Constituent Assembly 18 January – 2 February 1790.

His excessive obesity, which made him the butt of the Royalist jokes, prevented his practising at the bar for some years before 1789. When Louis XVI invited him to undertake his defence, he excused himself on this ground. In 1792, he published some constitutional observations in extenuation of the king&#x27;s actions, which, in the circumstances of the time, would have taken some courage.

==From Thermidor to Empire==

Target took no part in public affairs during the Reign of Terror. Under the Directory he was made a member of the Institut de France in 1796 and of the Court of Cassation in 1798. He lived to collaborate in the earlier stages of the new criminal code.

== Works ==

Among his writings may be mentioned a paper on the grain trade (1776) and a &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;état des Protestants en France&quot; (1787), in which he pleaded for the restoration of civil rights to Protestants.

<doc id="221889" wikidata="Q363636" url="?curid=221889" title="Louis-René de Rohan">
<text>Louis-René-Édouard de Rohan, known as Cardinal de Rohan (25 September 1734 – 16 February 1803), &quot;Prince de Rohan-Guéméné&quot;, was a French bishop of Strasbourg, politician, cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, and cadet of an ancient and powerful House of Rohan (which traced its origin to the Kings of Brittany). His parents were Hercule Mériadec, Prince of Guéméné, and Princess Louise Gabrielle Julie de Rohan-Rohan. He was born in Paris.

Members of the Rohan family had filled the office of bishop of Strasbourg since 1704, which made them princes of the Holy Roman Empire and the compeers rather of the German prince-bishops than of the French ecclesiastics. Louis de Rohan was destined for this high office from birth. Soon after taking orders, in 1760, he was nominated coadjutor to his uncle, Louis Constantin de Rohan-Rochefort, who then held the bishopric, and he was also appointed titular bishop of Canopus, Egypt. But he preferred the elegant life and the gaiety of Paris to his clerical duties, and had also an ambition to make a figure in politics. In 1761 he was elected to seat 36 of the Académie Française.

Louis de Rohan was a member of the palace cabal opposed to the Austrian alliance. This party was headed by the Duc d&#x27;Aiguillon who, in 1771, sent Rohan on a special embassy to find out what was being done in Vienna with regard to the partition of Poland. Rohan arrived at Vienna in January 1772, and made a great spectacle of himself with his lavish entertainments. Empress Maria Theresa was hostile to his intrigues; not only did he attempt to thwart her alliance with France, but as a vicar of the Church, he made little secret of his venal lifestyle.

On the death of Louis XV in 1774, Rohan was recalled from Vienna, and coldly received in Paris; but his family&#x27;s influence was too great for him to be neglected; in 1777 he was made Grand Almoner of France, and in 1778, abbot of St. Vaast. In 1778, he was made a cardinal on the nomination of Stanislaus Poniatowski (the king of Poland). In 1779, Louis de Rohan succeeded his uncle, Constantine de Rohan-Rochefort, as bishop of Strasbourg, though he spent much of his career working in Paris, as he preferred a fashionable life to his clerical duties; also in 1779, he became abbot of Noirmoutiers and Chaise-Dieu. Despite his enhanced status, the Cardinal was poorly received at court, having made himself an enemy of Queen Marie Antoinette, the daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, whose disapproval he had earned in Vienna.

Wishing to redeem himself in the eyes of the Queen, he got involved in the &quot;affair of the diamond necklace&quot; with the Comtesse de la Motte and others, including the notorious Cagliostro. Rohan was led to believe that his attentions to the Queen were welcomed, and that she approved his arrangements for her to purchase the infamous necklace. When the swindle was discovered, the Cardinal was arrested and implicated in the theft, though he was later found to have been an innocent dupe. At the trial in 1786 before the &quot;parlement of Paris&quot; his acquittal was received with popular enthusiasm, and regarded as a victory over the royal court at Versailles and, in particular, the Queen. He was deprived of his office as grand almoner and exiled to his abbey of Chaise-Dieu, where he was accompanied by his secretary, Louis Ramond de Carbonnières. The following year, he traveled to the thermal spas of the Pyrenees, spending the summer and the autumn in Barèges, where Ramond began his geological investigations.

Rohan was soon allowed to return to Strasbourg, and his popularity was shown by his election in 1789 to the Estates-General by the clergy of the bailliages of Haguenau and Wissembourg. He, at first, declined to sit, but when the Estates-General became the National Assembly, it insisted on validating his election. However, in January 1791, as a prince of the church, he refused to take the oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and went to Ettenheim, in the German part of his diocese. In exile, he spent what wealth remained to him in providing for the poor clergy of his diocese who had been obliged to leave France. On 29 November 1801, he resigned his nominal office as Bishop of Strasbourg and went back to Ettenheim, where he died on 17 February 1803.

== Depiction in media ==
His role in the affair of the diamond necklace scandal is depicted in a 2001 American historical drama film, &quot;The Affair of the Necklace&quot;, directed by Charles Shyer, in which he was played by Jonathan Pryce, and in the anime &quot;Rose of Versailles&quot;.

Rohan is portrayed by Barnett Parker in the 1938 film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;. The character plays a key role, particularly in scenes following the entr&#x27;acte (intermission).

<text>Greg Curnoe (19 November 1936 – 14 November 1992) was a Canadian painter known for his role in the Canadian art movement labeled London Regionalism,
 which, beginning in the 1960s, made London, Ontario, an important centre for artistic production in Canada. While his oeuvre chronicled his daily experience in a variety of media, it was grounded in twentieth-century art movements, especially Dada, with its emphasis on nihilism and anarchism, Canadian politics, and popular culture. He is remembered for brightly coloured works that often incorporate text to support his strong Canadian patriotism, sometimes expressed as anti-Americanism, as well as his activism in support of Canadian artists.
== Early life ==
Gregory Richard Curnoe was born on 19 November 1936, at Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario. He grew up with his parents, Nellie Olive (née Porter) and Gordon Charles Curnoe; his brother, Glen (born 1939); and his sister, Lynda (born 1943), in a house built for the family by his grandfather. For most of his life, Curnoe lived within five kilometres of this home in Southwestern Ontario, a peninsula surrounded by water and the United States. Curnoe attended H. B. Beal Secondary School (1954–56) and the Doon School of Art (1956) before attending the Ontario College of Art (1957–60), where he failed his final year.

== Career ==

Returning to London, Ontario, Curnoe began to work in the studio. He found meaning in popular culture and his own cultural roots that addressed the disillusion he felt with established culture after leaving art school. He founded &quot;Region&quot; magazine in 1961 and Region Gallery in 1962. He co-founded the Canadian noise band the Nihilist Spasm Band in 1965.
In 1968, Jack Chambers with the aid of Kim Ondaatje, Tony Urquhart, Curnoe and John Boyle, founded Canadian Artists&#x27; Representation to serve as a union for artists in Canada. Curnoe co-founded the Forest City Gallery, an artist-run centre, in 1973. He represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 1981, which subsequently toured across Canada.

==Death==
While out on a Saturday club ride with the London Centennial Wheelers, Curnoe was killed by a distracted driver in a pickup truck that plowed into the group of seven cyclists on Highway 2, just outside Delaware, Ontario on 14 November 1992. He was killed and six others were seriously injured and taken to hospital. The driver was charged with four-counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, and one-count of dangerous driving causing death. In provincial court, the driver was eventually acquitted of all charges on 13 January 1994.

<text>Thomas Bewick (c. 11 August 1753 – 8 November 1828) was an English wood-engraver and natural history author. Early in his career he took on all kinds of work such as engraving cutlery, making the wood blocks for advertisements, and illustrating children&#x27;s books. He gradually turned to illustrating, writing and publishing his own books, gaining an adult audience for the fine illustrations in &quot;A History of Quadrupeds&quot;.

His career began when he was apprenticed to engraver Ralph Beilby in Newcastle upon Tyne. He became a partner in the business and eventually took it over. Apprentices whom Bewick trained include John Anderson, Luke Clennell, and William Harvey, who in their turn became well known as painters and engravers.

Bewick is best known for his &quot;A History of British Birds&quot;, which is admired today mainly for its wood engravings, especially the small, sharply observed, and often humorous vignettes known as tail-pieces. The book was the forerunner of all modern field guides. He notably illustrated editions of &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; throughout his life.

He is &quot;usually considered the founder of wood-engraving&quot; as &quot;the first to realize its full potentialities&quot;, using metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much more detailed and durable than traditional woodcuts. The result was high-quality illustration at a low price.

== Life ==

Bewick was born at Cherryburn, a house in the village of Mickley, Northumberland, near Newcastle upon Tyne on 10 or 11 August 1753, although his birthday was always celebrated on the 12th. His parents were tenant farmers: his father John had been married before his union with Jane, and was in his forties when Thomas, the eldest of eight, was born. John rented a small colliery at Mickley Bank, which employed perhaps six men. Bewick attended school in the nearby village of Ovingham.

Bewick did not flourish at schoolwork, but at a very early age showed a talent for drawing. He had no lessons in art. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to Ralph Beilby, an engraver in Newcastle, where he learnt how to engrave on wood and metal, for example marking jewellery and cutlery with family names and coats of arms. In Beilby&#x27;s workshop Bewick engraved a series of diagrams on wood for Charles Hutton, illustrating a treatise on measurement. He seems thereafter to have devoted himself entirely to engraving on wood, and in 1775 he received a prize from the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce for a wood engraving of the &quot;Huntsman and the Old Hound&quot; from &quot;Select Fables by the late Mr Gay&quot;, which he was illustrating.

In 1776 Bewick became a partner in Beilby&#x27;s workshop. The joint business prospered, becoming Newcastle&#x27;s leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high-quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking the unfairness of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle as soon as he could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.

In 1786, when he was financially secure, he married Isabella Elliott from Ovingham; she had been a friend when they were children. They had four children, Robert, Jane, Isabella, and Elizabeth; the daughters worked on their father&#x27;s memoir after his death. At that period in his life he was described by the Newcastle artist Thomas Sword Good as &quot;a man of athletic make, nearly 6 feet high and proportionally stout. He possessed great personal courage and in his younger years was not slow to repay an insult with personal chastisement. On one occasion, being assaulted by two pitmen on returning from a visit to Cherryburn, he resolutely turned upon the aggressors, and as he said, &#x27;paid them both well&#x27;.&quot;

Bewick was also noted as having a strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair treatment of animals. He objected to the docking of horses&#x27; tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth&#x27;s attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.

Bewick had at least 30 pupils who worked for him and Beilby as apprentices, the first of which was his younger brother John. Several gained distinction as engravers, including John Anderson, Luke Clennell, Charlton Nesbit, William Harvey, Robert Johnson, and his son and later partner Robert Elliot Bewick.

The partners published their &quot;History of Quadrupeds&quot; in 1790, intended for children but reaching an adult readership, and its success encouraged them to consider a more serious work of natural history. In preparation for this Bewick spent several years engraving the wood blocks for &quot;Land Birds&quot;, the first volume of &quot;A History of British Birds&quot;. Given his detailed knowledge of the birds of Northumberland, Bewick prepared the illustrations, so Beilby was given the task of assembling the text, which he struggled to do. Bewick ended up writing most of the text, which led to a dispute over authorship; Bewick refused to have Beilby named as the author, and in the end only Bewick&#x27;s name appeared on the title-page, along with a paragraph of explanation at the end of the preface.

The book was an immediate success when published—by Beilby and Bewick themselves—in 1797. Before its publication, Bewick illustrated Arnaud Berquin&#x27;s &quot;Looking-Glass for the Mind&quot; in 1792 and J. H. Wynne&#x27;s &quot;Tales for Youth&quot; in 1794 for the printer Elizabeth Newbery and in 1795 a anthology on the study of character in the &quot;Kings and Queens of England&quot;. Given the success of the 1797 publication of his bird illustrations, Bewick started work at once on the second volume, &quot;Water Birds&quot;, but the disagreement over authorship led to a final split with Beilby. Bewick was unable to control his feelings and resolve issues quietly, so the partnership ended, turbulently and expensively, leaving Bewick with his own workshop. Bewick had to pay £20, equivalent to about £20,000 in 2011, in lawyer&#x27;s fees, and more than £21 for Beilby&#x27;s share of the workshop equipment.

With the assistance of his apprentices Bewick brought out the second volume, &quot;Water Birds&quot;, in 1804, as the sole author. He found the task of managing the printers continually troublesome, but the book met with as much success as the first volume.

In April 1827, the American naturalist and bird painter John James Audubon came to Britain to find a suitable printer for his enormous &quot;Birds of America&quot;. Bewick, still lively at age 74, showed him the woodcut he was working on, a dog afraid of tree stumps that seem in the dark to be devilish figures, and gave Audubon a copy of his &quot;Quadrupeds&quot; for his children.

Bewick was fond of the music of Northumberland, and of the Northumbrian smallpipes in particular. He especially wanted to promote the Northumbrian smallpipes, and to support the piper John Peacock, so he encouraged Peacock to teach pupils to become masters of this kind of music. One of these pupils was Thomas&#x27;s son, Robert, whose surviving manuscript tunebooks give a picture of a piper&#x27;s repertoire in the 1820s.

Bewick&#x27;s last wood engraving, &quot;Waiting for Death&quot;, was of an old bony workhorse, standing forlorn by a tree stump, which he had seen and sketched as an apprentice; the work echoes William Hogarth&#x27;s last work, &quot;The Bathos&quot;, which shows the fallen artist by a broken column. He died after a few days&#x27; illness on 8 November 1828, at his home. He was buried in Ovingham churchyard, beside his wife Isabella, who had died two years earlier, and not far from his parents and his brother John.

== Work ==

=== Technique ===

Bewick&#x27;s art is considered the pinnacle of his medium, now called wood engraving. This is due both to his skill and to the method, which unlike the woodcut technique of his predecessors, carves against the grain, in hard box wood, using fine tools normally favoured by metal engravers.

Boxwood cut across the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, allowing greater detail than in normal woodcuts; this has largely replaced the basic woodcut since Bewick&#x27;s time. In addition, since wood engraving is a relief printing technique, inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into the same forme as the letterpress or metal type for the text, allowing both on the same page, and all the printing to be done in a single run. In contrast, copper plate engravings are an intaglio printing technique, inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so a special type of printing press applying much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.

Bewick made use of his close observation of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues to the character of his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. 
This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with just the right amount of ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. This made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick&#x27;s readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick&#x27;s engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his &quot;Fables&quot; and &quot;Quadrupeds&quot; were at the outset intended for children.

Bewick ran his workshop collaboratively, developing the skills of his apprentices, so while he did not complete every task for every illustration himself, he was always closely involved, as John Rayner explains:

==== Major works ====

Works using his wood engraving technique, for which he became well known, include the engravings for Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;Traveller&quot; and &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, for Thomas Parnell&#x27;s &quot;Hermit&quot;, and for William Somervile&#x27;s &quot;Chase&quot;. But &quot;the best known of all Bewick&#x27;s prints&quot; is said by The Bewick Society to be &quot;The Chillingham Bull&quot;, executed by Bewick on an exceptionally large woodblock for Marmaduke Tunstall, a gentleman who owned an estate at Wycliffe in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

==== Tail-pieces ====

The tail- or tale-pieces, a Bewick speciality, are small engravings chosen to fill gaps such as those at the ends of the species articles in &quot;British Birds&quot;, each bird&#x27;s description beginning on a new page. The images are full of life and movement, often with a moral, sometimes with humour, always with sympathy and precise observation, so the images tell a tale as well as being at the tail ends of articles. For example, the runaway cart, at the end of &quot;The Sparrow-Hawk&quot;, fills what would otherwise be a 5 cm (2 in) high gap. Hugh Dixon explains:


==== Bookplates ====

The workshop of Beilby, Bewick, and son produced many ephemeral materials such as letterhead stationery, shop advertisement cards, and other business materials. Of these ephemeral productions, &quot;bookplates have survived the best&quot;. Bewick&#x27;s bookplates were illustrations made from engravings, containing the name or initials of the book&#x27;s owner.

=== &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; ===

The various editions of Aesop&#x27;s Fables illustrated by Bewick span almost his entire creative life. The first was created for the Newcastle bookseller Thomas Saint during his apprentice years, an edition of Robert Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Select Fables&quot; published in 1776. With his brother John he later contributed to a three-volume edition for the same publisher in 1784, reusing some pictures from the 1776 edition.

Bewick went on to produce a third edition of the fables. While convalescing from a dangerous illness in 1812, he turned his attention to a long-cherished venture, a large three-volume edition of &quot;The Fables of Aesop and Others&quot;, eventually published in 1818. The work is divided into three sections: the first has some of Dodsley&#x27;s fables prefaced by a short prose moral; the second has &quot;Fables with Reflections&quot;, in which each story is followed by a prose and a verse moral and then a lengthy prose reflection; the third, &quot;Fables in Verse&quot;, includes fables from other sources in poems by several unnamed authors. Engravings were initially designed on the wood by Bewick and then cut by his apprentices under close supervision, refined where necessary by himself. This edition used a method that Bewick had pioneered, &quot;white-line&quot; engraving, a dark-to-light technique in which the lines to remain white are cut out of the woodblock.&#x27;

=== &quot;A General History of Quadrupeds&quot; ===

&quot;A General History of Quadrupeds&quot; appeared in 1790. It deals with 260 mammals from across the world, including animals from &quot;Adive&quot; to &quot;Zorilla&quot;. It is particularly thorough on some of the domestic animals: the first entry describes the horse. Beilby and Bewick had difficulty deciding what to include, and especially on how to organise the entries. They had hoped to arrange the animals systematically, but they found that the rival systems of Linnaeus, Buffon and John Ray conflicted, and in Linnaeus&#x27;s case at least changed with every edition of his work. They decided to put useful animals first &quot;which so materially contribute to the strength, the wealth, and the happiness of this kingdom&quot;.

The book&#x27;s coverage is erratic, a direct result of the sources that Bewick consulted: his own knowledge of British animals, the available scholarly sources, combined with George Culley&#x27;s 1786 &quot;Observations on Livestock&quot; and the antique John Caius&#x27;s 1576 &quot;On English Dogs&quot;. Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman&#x27;s account of his visit to the Cape of Good Hope on Cook&#x27;s expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew.

=== &quot;A History of British Birds&quot; ===

&quot;A History of British Birds&quot;, Bewick&#x27;s great achievement and with which his name is inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: &quot;History and Description of Land Birds&quot; in 1797 and &quot;History and Description of Water Birds&quot; in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The &quot;Birds&quot; is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, as well as the translation of Buffon&#x27;s &quot;Histoire naturelle&quot;.

Many of the illustrations that have most frequently been reproduced in other books and as decorations are the small tailpieces that Bewick had placed at the bottoms of the pages of the original. The worlds depicted are so small that a magnifying glass is necessary to examine their detail; each scene, as Adrian Searle writes, &quot;is a small and often comic revelation&quot;, each tiny image giving &quot;enormous pleasure&quot;; Bewick &quot;was as inventive as he was observant, as funny and bleak as he was exacting and faithful to the things he saw around him.&quot;

Bewick&#x27;s biographer, Jenny Uglow, writes that

Bewick sometimes used his fingerprint as a form of signature, (accompanied by the words &quot;Thomas Bewick his mark&quot;), as well as engraving it in one of his tail-pieces as if it had clouded the tiny image of a rustic scene with a cottage by mistake. Uglow notes one critic&#x27;s suggestion that Bewick may have meant we are looking at the scene through a playfully smudged window, as well as drawing our attention to Bewick, the maker. Adrian Searle, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, describes the tiny work as &quot;A visual equivalent to the sorts of authorial gags Laurence Sterne played in Tristram Shandy, it is a marvellous, timeless, magical joke.&quot;

== Tributes ==

Poetical tributes came to Bewick even during his lifetime. William Wordsworth began his anecdotal poem &quot;The Two Thieves&quot;, composed in 1798, with the line &quot;O now that the genius of Bewick were mine&quot;, in which case he would give up writing, he declared.

In 1823, Bewick&#x27;s friend the Reverend J. F. M. Dovaston dedicated a sonnet to him with the lines

::Xylographer I name thee, Bewick, taughtBy thy wood-Art, that from rock, flood, and treeHome to our hearths, all lively, light and freeIn suited scene each living thing has broughtAs life elastic, animate with thought.

Four years after his death, his sixteen-year-old admirer Charlotte Brontë wrote a poem of 20 quatrains titled &quot;Lines on the celebrated Bewick&quot; which describe the various scenes she comes across while leafing through the books illustrated by him. Later still, the poet Alfred Tennyson left his own tribute on the flyleaf of a copy of Bewick&#x27;s &quot;History of British Birds&quot; found in Lord Ravenscroft&#x27;s library:
::A gate and field half ploughed, 
::A solitary cow, 
::A child with a broken slate, 
::And a titmarsh in the bough. 
::But where, alack, is Bewick 
::To tell the meaning now?

There are numerous portraits of Bewick. In 1825, the Literary and Philosophical Society commissioned Edward Hodges Baily to sculpt a marble portrait bust of Bewick; there are several copies beside the one still at the Society itself. According to Uglow, when Bewick came to sit for the sculptor, he &quot;stoutly refused to be portrayed in a toga. Instead he wore his ordinary coat and waistcoat with neckcloth and ruffled shirt, and even asked for some of his smallpox scars to be shown.&quot; Baily was so taken with him that he presented Bewick with a plaster model of the finished bust. A bronze copy now rests in a niche of the building that replaced his workshop in the churchyard of Saint Nicholas (see above) and still another is at the British Museum. There is also a full-length statue of him at the top left of the former chemist&#x27;s shop designed by M.V.Treleaven at 45 Northumberland Street in the city.

== Legacy ==

Bewick&#x27;s fame, already nationwide across Britain for his &quot;Birds&quot;, grew during the nineteenth century. In 1830, William Yarrell named Bewick&#x27;s swan in his honour and Bewick&#x27;s son Robert engraved the bird for later editions of &quot;British Birds&quot;.

The critic John Ruskin compared the subtlety of his drawing to that of Holbein, J. M. W. Turner, and Paolo Veronese writing that the way Bewick had engraved the feathers of his birds was &quot;the most masterly thing ever done in woodcutting&quot;. His fame faded as illustration became more widespread and more mechanical, but twentieth-century artists such as Gwen Raverat continued to admire his skill, and work by artists such as Paul Nash and Eric Ravilious has been described as reminiscent of Bewick.

Hugh Dixon, reflecting on Bewick and the landscape of North-East England, wrote that

Thomas Bewick Primary School, in West Denton in Newcastle upon Tyne, is named after him. Bewick&#x27;s works are held in collections including the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Newcastle&#x27;s City Library has a collection of works and associated items based on the Pease Bequest which was made to the city by John William Pease in 1901. Bewick is memorialised around Newcastle and Gateshead with streets named after him, and plaques mark his former homes and workshops.

<text>The ground tit, Tibetan ground-tit or Hume&#x27;s ground-tit (Pseudopodoces humilis) is a bird of the Tibetan plateau north of the Himalayas. The peculiar appearance confused ornithologists in the past who called it as Hume&#x27;s groundpecker and still later as Hume&#x27;s ground jay or Tibetan ground jay assuming that it belonged to the family Corvidae that includes the crows and jays. Although morphologically confusing, the species has since been identified using molecular sequence comparisons as being a member of the tit family (Paridae) and is the only species in the genus Pseudopodoces. It is found in the Tibetan Plateau of China, India, Nepal &amp; Bhutan.

==Description==
&quot;Pseudopodoces&quot; is somewhat similar in appearance to the unrelated ground jays (&quot;Podoces&quot;) but much smaller – about the size of a house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) – and lacks any conspicuous markings. More strongly however, it resembles a wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe&quot;) in habitus, but lacks black feathers and has a strong and slightly downcurved bill resembling that of a chough (&quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;) in shape (though not in colour). Its soft, lax body plumage is extremely cryptic in its natural habitat. The underside is a greyish-fawn in colour, with a tawny hue. The upper parts are mostly a darker fawn-brown, with the central rectrices and the primary remiges a little darker still; the head is colored like the underside, with a darker cap and light nape patch, somewhat reminiscent of some tits and chickadees, especially those from the genera &quot;Parus sensu stricto&quot; and &quot;Periparus&quot;. The bill, legs and feet are black. Males and females look alike.

The voice is described as a plaintive whistling, &quot;cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep&quot; and it also has a two syllable finch-like call.
==Systematics==

The ground tit was traditionally considered a relative of the ground jays (&quot;Podoces&quot;), based on its voice and habits. Its autapomorphies have certainly puzzled 20th century ornithologists, but due to its remote range and nondescript appearance, it was little studied and not suspected to be anything but an aberrant ground jay for more than 100 years after its description by Hume. In 1978 and 1989 however, two studies of its anatomy determined that – although at that time unassignable to any family due to its peculiar adaptations, it appeared that it was not a corvid but a more advanced songbird of the infraorder today known as Passerida.

From 2003 onwards, osteological, mtDNA and nDNA sequence and other biochemical data has firmly allied it with the tits and chickadees (Paridae). In fact, genetic evidence suggests that it is a closer relative of the great tit and its relatives in the genus &quot;Parus sensu stricto&quot; than the chickadees and their relatives of the genus &quot;Poecile&quot;.

==Ecology==
It occurs across the Tibetan Plateau of China and the neighboring areas of western Sichuan and Gansu. The Tibetan ground-tit inhabits open alpine steppe and sometimes more arid regions with small scattered shrubs, rarely if ever occurring lower than 3,000 meters above sea level. It is not found anywhere where dense vegetation (especially trees) predominates. The flight of this bird is not strong and it flies low over the ground preferring to run or jump out of the way if approached which it does very quickly. It moves on the ground in unpredictable hops and bounces which can be quite long – jumps of three times the bird&#x27;s length are achieved without assistance by the wings – rather than striding or running like &quot;Podoces&quot; ground jays. Observers have compared the sight of a Tibetan ground-tit moving along to a small greyish-brown rubber ball.

It obtains food on the ground, eating a wide range of arthropod prey, often obtained by probing yak (&quot;Bos grunniens&quot;) dung and turning it over to flush the prey out. It also peers into rock crevices and into holes in the ground in its search for food. Individuals have been observed to poke mud in and near puddles like hoopoes (&quot;Upupa epops&quot;); in general the bill is extensively used for digging, much like the similarly-shaped one of the red-billed chough (&quot;Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax&quot;). If chased by a bird of prey or other predator, it will bolt straight down the nearest hole like a rodent until the danger has passed. They are frequently found near colonies of pikas (&quot;Ochotona&quot;). Though the birds and the mammals probably benefit from each other&#x27;s vigilance, their association is probably less due to a strong mutualism but rather because both prefer habitat with similar ground cover and soil.

The nest is rather unusual for that of a passerine, being built inside a burrow which the birds excavate themselves. It is usually dug horizontally into a bank or wall of earth, and can reach a depth of 1.8 meters. The nest is placed at the end of this in a small chamber and consists usually just of bit of wool placed onto a grass base. The 4–6 eggs are pure white and the young stay with their parents for some time after fledging; half-grown young are still fed by their parents on occasion as late as August. Cooperative breeding occurs in this species, with monogamous pairs frequently having at least one male helper who are yearlings which remain on the natal territory. This behaviour is thought to occur as a result of there being a shortage of males in the population.

The ground tit is not a migratory bird but may descend to lower altitudes in valleys during the winter. In addition to digging nesting burrows, ground-tits frequently dig roosting burrows to use during the coldest months.

<text>William Somervile or Somerville (2 September 167517 July 1742) was an English poet who wrote in many genres and is especially remembered for &quot;The Chace&quot;, in which he pioneered an early English georgic.

==Life==
Somervile, the eldest son of a long established country family, was born in Staffordshire in 1677. He was a descendant of Roger de Somerville, of an English branch of the Somerville Family. William raised at the family seat of Edstone, near Wootton Wawen in Warwickshire. He was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, and then studied law at the Middle Temple. After his father&#x27;s death in 1705 he lived on his estate and devoted himself to the field sports which were eventually to supply the subjects of his best-known poems. Among his friends and neighbours were the poets William Shenstone, Richard Jago and George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton. Later he was a correspondent of Allan Ramsay and they exchanged poems. But Somervile&#x27;s convivial hospitality strained his small personal income and plunged him into debt. Eventually he took to drinking heavily and died on 17 July 1742 at the age of 66. After his death he was buried in the church at Wootton Wawen and his estate passed to James Lord Somerville under an arrangement in which Lord Somerville had lent him money to pay his debts.

Following Somervile&#x27;s death, William Shenstone paid him a tribute in a letter which hints at the strained relations with his friends in later life:

==Poetry==

Somervile&#x27;s publications were &quot;The Two Springs&quot; (1725), a fable; &quot;Occasional Poems&quot; (1727); &quot;The Chace&quot; (&quot;The Chase&quot;) (1735); &quot;Hobbinol, or the Rural Games&quot; (1740), a burlesque poem describing the Cotswold Games; and &quot;Field Sports&quot; (1742), a poem on hawking. The poems continued to be republished for the best part of a century after they first appeared but, &quot;The Chace&quot; apart, criticism of them was generally guarded. For Samuel Johnson, &quot;Somervile has tried many modes of poetry; and though perhaps he has not in any reached such excellence as to raise much envy, it may commonly be said at least, that &quot;he writes very well for a gentleman&quot;... His subjects are commonly such as require no great depth of thought or energy of expression. His fables are generally stale and therefore excite no curiosity.&quot;

In the eyes of John Aikin, a little later, &quot;He is strictly and almost solely a descriptive poet…Little occurs in his writings that indicates a mind inspired by that exalted enthusiasm which denotes the genius of superior rank. His versification is generally correct and well varied, and evidently flows from a nice and practiced ear… His Chase is probably the best performance upon that topic which any country has produced.&quot; But by the time of &quot;The Cambridge History of English Literature&quot; (1913), the attitude is plainly dismissive: &quot;Much of his verse is poor doggerel in the form of fables and tales, dull and coarse after the usual manner of such productions&quot;. Such a judgment might certainly be applied to a performance like &quot;The Fortune Hunter&quot;, in which La Fontaine&#x27;s fable of The Man who Runs after Fortune (VII.12) is expanded into five cantos that ramble over sixty pages.

Other fables have a more subtle agenda, however. Though they may be Aesopic at base, often the original storyline is modified so as to make a contemporary statement. The situation of the ancient fable of the lion, the boar and the vultures has been given the modern context of bear-baiting in which the dog and bear contestants suddenly gain an insight into how their virtues are being exploited in ways that harm rather than benefit themselves. Again, the story of The Trumpeter Taken Captive takes place against a background of contemporary Anglo-French military rivalry and is directed against those who stir up war, from which they profit without taking part. Both fables were written at a time when Robert Walpole was commanding popular support for a pacific foreign policy and accord with the spirit of the time.

The fashion for fable-writing was at its height when Somervile produced his. Though there is some novelty in his approach, his discursive talent was better suited to &quot;The Chace&quot;, the work for which he is best remembered. That poem was also only the period&#x27;s third georgic poem on an English subject, having been preceded by &quot;Cyder&quot; (1708) by John Philips and &quot;Rural Sports&quot; (1713) by John Gay. It consists of four cantos, the first of which introduces the subject and covers the management of hounds. The second canto deals with hare hunting and the third with fox hunting, while the fourth covers otter hunting and the breeding and care of hounds. The poem passed through many editions, some of the later including the two poems on country pursuits that followed it. Among the illustrators of the poem have been Thomas Bewick (1796); Thomas Stothard (1800); John Scott (engravings based on paintings by John Nott Sartorius, 1804); and Hugh Thomson (1896).

<doc id="221906" wikidata="Q2723596" url="?curid=221906" title="Great Law of Peace">
<text>Among the Haudenosaunee (the &quot;Six Nations,&quot; comprising the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora peoples) the Great Law of Peace (Mohawk: &quot;Kaianere’kó:wa&quot;), also known as Gayanashagowa, is the oral constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy. The law was represented by symbols on wampum belts which functioned as mnemonic devices for storytellers, conceived by Dekanawidah, known as the Great Peacemaker, and his spokesman Hiawatha. The original five member nations ratified this constitution near modern-day Victor, New York, with the sixth nation (the Tuscarora) being added in 1722.

The laws were first recorded and transmitted by means of wampum, shell-bead belts that encoded the message in a sequence of pictograms. In the 19th century it was translated into English and other languages. The Great Law of Peace is presented as part of a narrative noting laws and ceremonies to be performed at prescribed times. The laws, called a constitution, are divided into 117 articles. The united Iroquois nations are symbolized by an eastern white pine tree, called the &quot;Tree of Peace&quot;. Each nation or tribe plays a delineated role in the conduct of government.

The exact date of the events is not known, but it is thought to date back to the late 12th century ().

==Narrative, constitution, and ceremony==
The narratives of the Great Law exist in the languages of the member nations, so spelling and usages vary. William N. Fenton observed that it came to serve a purpose as a social organization inside and among the nations, a constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy or League, ceremonies to be observed, and a binding history of peoples. Fenton also observed some nine common points focusing more simply on the narrative story line, though Christopher Vecsey identified 22 points shared across some two dozen versions of the narrative or parts of the narrative both direct and indirect:
;Narrative:
# The Migration and Separation of the People (pre-history of the area)
# The Birth and Growth of Deganawida
# The Journey to the Mohawks, the Situation, and the Mission Explained
# The Mother of Nations Accepts Deganawida&#x27;s Message
# The Cannibal Converts
# The Prophets Prove Their Power
# Tadadaho the Wizard Prevents Peace
# Hiawatha&#x27;s Relatives Are Killed
# Hiawatha Mourns and Quits Onondaga
# Hiawatha Invents Wampum
# Hiawatha Gives the Mohawks Lessons in Protocol
# Deganawida Consoles Hiawatha
# Scouts Travel to Tadadaho
# Deganawida and Hiawatha Join Oneidas, Cayugas, and Senecas to Mohawks
# The Nations March to Tadadaho, Singing the Peace Hymn
# Deganawida and Hiawatha Transform Tadadaho
;Constitution of the Confederacy and social order of the member peoples:
# Deganawida and Hiawatha Establish Iroquois Unity and Law
# Deganawida and Hiawatha Establish League Chiefs and Council Polity
# The Confederacy Takes Symbolic Images
# The League Declares Its Sovereignty (the Constitutional laws of the Confederacy)
;Ceremony:
# The Condolence Maintains the Confederacy (a sequence of ceremonies for grieving over a deceased chief and appointing a new one)
# Deganawida Departs

Barbara Mann has gathered versions featuring conflicting but harmonized elements (who does what varies, but what happens is more consistent than not), or stories that tell distinct elements not shared in other versions, into a narrative she includes in the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Haudenosaunee&quot; published in 2000.

==Published accounts==

===Cayuga===
An untranslated version has been posted by the Smithsonian Institution. Another is mentioned being presented to Michael Foster.

=== Mohawk ===
There are several Mohawk versions that made it into print and several of those were printed more than once. Horatio Hale published one in 1883 he traced somewhat earlier which was reprinted by William N. Fenton, following Arthur Caswell Parker, in 1968. J. N. B. Hewitt published one in 1928 based on a much earlier fragment. Joseph Brant and John Norton commented on details of the narrative as early as 1801 and published since. Dayodekane, better known as Seth Newhouse, arranged for some versions that were published differently near 1900 - first from 1885 included in a book by Paul A. W. Wallace in 1948, and a second version published in 1910 by Arthur C. Parker. Fenton discusses Newhouse&#x27; contributions in a paper in 1949. Wallace also published a separate book without stating his source in 1946 called &quot;The Iroquois book of Life - White Roots of Peace&quot;, which was later revised and extended with endorsements by Iroqouis chiefs and Iroquoian historian John Mohawk in 1986 and 1994.

===Oneida===
Oneida versions have been noted in various places. One from New York, has been echoed/summarized by the Milwaukee Public Museum. Another has been published by the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin in two sections. Another account is also reported.

===Onondaga===
Parts of Horatio Hale&#x27;s work &quot;The Iroquois Book of Rites&quot; is said to have Onondaga sources. J. N. B. Hewitt recorded Chief John Buck and included his presentation in 1892. John Arthur Gibson shared several versions that have gathered notable awareness among scholars like Fenton and others. His first version was in 1899. Gibson then participated in a collective version with many Chiefs from the Six Nations of the Grand River Reserve in 1900 which was reprinted a number of times: first in 1910/1, and then included in another work. A final version was offered to Alexander Goldenweiser but wasn&#x27;t finished translated and published until 1992 by Hanni Woodbury.

===Seneca===
Newspaper editor William Walker Canfield published a book &quot;The Legends of the Iroquois&quot; in 1902 based on found notes he was given purporting to be written from comments of Cornplanter reportedly to an employee of the surveyor company Holland Land Company, perhaps John Adlum, known friend of Cornplanter. It is the primary source of the mention of a solar eclipse. Another Seneca version was given by Deloe B. Kittle to Parker and was published in 1923.

===Tuscarora===
The Tuscarora joined the Iroquois Confederacy in 1722. There is a version of the Great Law of Peace attributed by Wallace &quot;Mad Bear&quot; Anderson of the Tuscarora published in 1987. However, there is a claim this was borrowed.

== Influence on the United States Constitution ==
Americana and Native American Studies Professor Donald Grinde claims that the democratic ideals of the &quot;Kaianere’kó:wa&quot; provided a significant inspiration to Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and other framers of the U.S. Constitution. He contends that the federal structure of the U.S. Constitution was influenced by the living example of the Iroquois Confederation, as were notions of individual liberty and the separation of powers. Grinde, working with Bruce Johansen, also identifies Native American symbols and imagery that were adopted by the nascent United States, including the American bald eagle and a bundle of arrows. However, eagles and bundles of arrows are common imagery in European heraldry, which is the more likely influence. Their thesis argues the U.S. constitution was the synthesis of various forms of political organization familiar to the founders, including the Iroquois Confederation. Their thesis led to the U.S. Congress passing Concurrent Resolution 331 to recognize the influence of the Iroquois Constitution upon the American Constitution and Bill of Rights in 1988. John Rutledge of South Carolina, delegate to the Constitutional Convention, read excerpts of various Iroquois Treaties to the drafting committee. 

The influence of Six Nations law on the U.S. Constitution is disputed by scholars. Haudenosaunee historian Elisabeth J. Tooker has pointed to several differences between the two forms of government, notably that all decisions were made by a consensus of male chiefs who gained their position through a combination of blood descent and selection by female relatives, that representation was on the basis of the number of clans in the group rather than the size or population of the clans, and that the topics discussed were decided by a single tribe. Tooker concluded there is little resemblance between the two documents or reason to believe the Six Nations had a meaningful influence on the American Constitution and that it is unclear how much impact Canassatego&#x27;s statement at Lancaster actually had on the representatives of the colonies. Stanford University historian Jack N. Rakove argued against any Six Nations influence, pointing to lack of evidence in U.S. constitutional debate records and examples of European antecedents for democratic institutions.

Journalist Charles C. Mann has noted other differences between The Great Law of Peace and the original U.S. Constitution, including the original Constitution&#x27;s allowing denial of suffrage to women and majority rule rather than consensus. Mann argues that the early colonists&#x27; interaction with Native Americans and their understanding of Iroquois government did influence the development of colonial society and culture and the Suffragette movement but stated that &quot;the Constitution as originally enacted was not at all like the Great Law.&quot;

Other critics of the Iroquois-influence theory include Samuel Payne, who considered the Iroquois division of powers as seen by Adams as being unlike those in the U.S. Constitution; William Starna and George Hamell, who described errors in Grinde&#x27;s and Johansen&#x27;s scholarship, particularly on Canassatego and the Lancaster Treaty; and Philip Levy, who also wrote that Grinde and Johansen had misused Adams&#x27;s material, stating that he was not describing the Iroquois Confederacy government separation of powers and model of government but that he was instead describing England&#x27;s structure.

==Example articles==

The people who wish to convey messages to the chiefs of the League shall do so through the war chief of their nation. It shall always be his duty to lay the cases, questions, and propositions of the people before the council of the League.

: §58: Any Chief or other person who submits to Laws of a foreign people is alienated and forfeits all claim in the Five Nations.

==Senior command==
United States Army North is the senior command and responsible for all Army activities on Fort Sam Houston, but not for the post itself. Commanded by Maj. Gen. Scott M. Sherman, Army North&#x27;s primary missions are land-based Homeland Defense, Defense Support of Civil Authorities and Theater Security Cooperation with the Bahamas, Canada and Mexico. Because Fort Sam Houston is part of Joint Base San Antonio, the installation commander is the commander of the 502d Air Base Wing.

==History==

Construction at Fort Sam Houston began in the mid-1870s under the supervision of the military commander of the Department of Texas, Major General Edward Ord, a West Point-trained army engineer. Today, as one of the Army&#x27;s oldest installations, and with more than 900 buildings in its historic districts, Fort Sam Houston boasts one of the largest collection of historic military post structures. The significant contributions of Fort Sam Houston to the United States were recognized in 1975 when the post was designated as a National Historic Landmark.

The Sundry Civil Service Bill of 3 March 1873 included a $100,000 allotment for a new army post in San Antonio, on 93 acres of land deeded by the city on Government Hill. Edward Braden Construction Co. won the contract to build the post on 7 June 1876, for $83,900 . Included on the Quadrangle was a combination tall watchtower and water tank designed by General Montgomery C. Meigs, based on one he had seen in Europe, and which he called &quot;his work of art&quot;.

On 19 February 1877, the new train station on Austin Street opened, connecting San Antonio to Galveston. The quartermasters soon moved their depot supplies from the Alamo to the Quadrangle, and the headquarters of the &quot;Post at San Antonio&quot; moved in on 22 December 1879.
In 1880, fifteen officers&#x27; quarters were designed by architect Alfred Giles, west of the Quadrangle, and bordering a parade ground. This included the Commanding General&#x27;s home, constructed in 1881, now known as the Pershing House, and first occupied by Brig. Gen. Christopher Augur. 

Between 1885 and 1893, 60 additional buildings were built on , Upper post or Infantry Post, purchased by the army east of the Quadrangle, including the 1893 Band Barracks overlooking another parade ground. The hospital, now known as Sam Houston House, was built in 1886. The post was formally named Fort Sam Houston on 11 September 1890.

The Fort Sam Houston Quadrangle, built by George Henry Griebel, is the oldest structure at Fort Sam Houston. The quadrangle was originally a supply depot. During that time, it housed the Apache war chief Geronimo and warriors captured with him, while the Federal government decided whether to treat them as prisoners of war (POWs) or common criminals. Legend has it that the deer in the Quadrangle were there because Geronimo refused to eat food he did not hunt. The deer pre-date Geronimo in the Quadrangle. It is unknown why the deer and peacocks were introduced into the confined courtyard of the Quadrangle.

The Quadrangle is now an office complex housing the commanding general and staff of U.S. Army North as well as the Fort Sam Houston Museum. The base has maintained the historical integrity of the post&#x27;s different sections, which represent different eras of construction, and reflect various Army concepts in planning and design. Careful preservation of these areas allows the post to live with its history, surrounded by the traditions established when the first soldier arrived here in 1845.

The Gift Chapel was dedicated by President William Taft on 17–18 October 1909.

During World War II, space at the fort was made available for up to 1,000 German POWs. This took place on 15 September 1942 while POW camps could be built.

==Military medicine==

Fort Sam Houston is known as the &quot;Home of Army Medicine&quot; and &quot;Home of the Combat Medic&quot;. At the end of World War II, the Army decided to make Fort Sam Houston its principal medical training facility. In conjunction with this decision came the determination to develop Brooke General Hospital into one of the Army&#x27;s premier medical centers. This combined the capabilities of Wilford Hall Medical Center located at nearby Lackland Air Force Base to create the largest medical treatment facility and teaching hospital in the Department of Defense. Construction associated with this transition increased the square footage of the hospital by 50%, including a much larger, variable capacity emergency department, additional surgical suites and recovery facilities, as well as teaching facilities and bed space. Despite the installation transitioning to Air Force control, the command and control of the facility will remain with the Army. The command and other key positions will rotate between the Army and Air Force. Staffing consist of members of both services, as well as a large number of civilians.

As of 2011, Fort Sam Houston is the largest and most important military medical training facility in the world. Military medical training is provided by numerous elements, including Military Education and Training Campus (METC), AMEDD Center and School, Brooke Army Medical Center, US Army Institute of Surgical Research, The Center for Battlefield Health and Trauma, Defense Medical Readiness Training Institute, as well as many smaller organizations.

Known as the brain trust for the AMEDD, the Army Medical Department Center and School annually trains more than 25,000 students attending 170 officer, NCO and enlisted courses in 14 medical specialties. The command maintains several academic affiliations for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs with major universities such as Baylor University, University of Texas Health Science Centers at Houston and San Antonio, and University of Nebraska.

As a result of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) 2005 recommendations, all military medical training has been consolidated at Fort Sam Houston. This consolidation concluded with the opening of the METC in 2011. The Navy moved its medical training from San Diego, California; Great Lakes, Illinois; and Portsmouth, Virginia. The Air Force moved its medical training from Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas. This increased the average student load and required additional support staff. The expansion in training has required construction approaching one billion dollars, a windfall of federal investment in Texas.

==Community connections==

Throughout its existence, a close and harmonious relationship has prevailed between Fort Sam Houston and the City of San Antonio. The two have grown and matured together. The city often has been called the &quot;mother-in-law of the Army&quot; because so many soldiers, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, met their future spouses there. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, in 2003 the Army decided to close New Braunfels Avenue to through traffic. Until this closure, New Braunfels Avenue had been a major north–south thoroughfare used by soldiers and San Antonio citizens alike; this had the result of closing many businesses near the north and south entrances from New Braunfels Avenue.

More than 27,000 military and civilian personnel work at the post, with an annual payroll and operating budget of $1.9 billion. Local purchases made by installation activities total almost $105 million annually. Funding for construction projects on post average $30 million annually. Fort Sam Houston has also initiated public–private partnerships to renovate and adaptively reuse significant historic buildings.

In June 2006, the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; reported that Fort Sam Houston received utility disconnection notices due to budget constraints.

Fort Sam Houston is one of three military facilities in Texas (all in the San Antonio area) to have its own school district, the Fort Sam Houston Independent School District.

The United States Postal Service operates the Fort Sam Houston Post Office at 1804 Stanley Road.

==Notable postings==
Several notable figures have served at the fort, including Arthur MacArthur Jr., Leonard Wood, Benjamin Foulois, Frederick Funston, and John J. Pershing. Maj. Gen. John Wilson Ruckman, Commander of the Southern Department, was based at Fort Sam Houston just after the Houston Riot of 1917. Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell was posted there after being demoted to colonel for disobeying orders. Dwight D. Eisenhower was posted to Fort Sam Houston twice during his career, as was Walter Krueger. During Eisenhower&#x27;s first posting from 1915 to 1917, he met and married Mamie Doud. He was posted at the fort when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred in 1941. Their first home is one of the buildings preserved as an historic monument. Gen. Wainwright took command of the Fourth United States Army here in 1946.

<doc id="221908" wikidata="Q1575559" url="?curid=221908" title="Tritheism">
<text>Tritheism (from Greek τριθεΐα, &quot;three divinity&quot;) is a polytheistic nontrinitarian Christian conception of God in which the unity of the Trinity and, by extension, monotheism are denied. It asserts that, rather than being single God of three eternally consubstantial &quot;Persons&quot;, the Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit are three ontologically separate Gods. It represents more of a &quot;&quot;possible&quot; deviation&quot; than any actual school of thought positing three separate deities. It was usually &quot;little more than a hostile label&quot; applied to those who emphasized the individuality of each &quot;hypostasis&quot; or divine person—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—over the unity of the Trinity as a whole. The accusation was especially popular between the 3rd and 7th centuries AD.

In the history of Christianity, various theologians have been accused of lapsing into tritheism. Among the earliest were the monophysites John Philoponos (died c. 570) and his followers, such as Eugenios and Konon of Tarsos. They taught that the common nature of the Trinity is an abstraction; so that, while the three persons are &quot;consubstantial&quot;, they are distinct in their &quot;properties&quot;. Their view was an attempt to reconcile Aristotle with Christianity. This view, which was defended by Patriarch Peter III of Antioch, was condemned as tritheism at a synod in Alexandria in 616. It was again condemned as tritheism at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680–81.

In Late Antiquity, several heretical movements criticized Orthodoxy as equivalent to tritheism. The Sabellians, Monarchians and Pneumatomachoi labelled their opponents tritheists. Jews and Muslims frequently criticized Trinitarianism as merely dressed-up tritheism (see Islamic view of the Trinity). Groups accused by the orthodox of tritheism include the Anomoeans and Nestorians.

In the Middle Ages, the scholastic Roscelin was accused of tritheism. He was an extreme nominalist who saw the three divine persons as separately existing. He was condemned as a tritheist at the synod of Soissons in roughly 1092. The realist scholastic Gilbert de la Porrée erred in the opposite direction by distinguishing between three divine beings and the essence of God (making a &quot;quaternity&quot; rather than a trinity), and was accused of tritheism. He was condemned at the council of Reims in 1148. Gilbert&#x27;s ideas influenced Joachim of Fiore, and the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) tried to clarify the issue by confirming the numerical unity of the Trinity.

In modern times, the Austrian Catholic Anton Günther, in an effort to refute Hegelian pantheism, declared three divine persons to be three absolute and distinct realities bound together only by their shared origin.

==List of Christians accused of tritheism==
The following tritheistic tendencies have been condemned as heretical by mainstream theology. 
# Those who are usually meant by the name were a section of the Monophysites, who had great influence in the second half of the sixth century, but have left no traces save a few scanty notices in John of Ephesus, Photius, Leontius etc. Their founder is said to be a certain John Ascunages, head of a Sophist school at Antioch. The principal writer was John Philoponus, the great Aristotelian commentator; the leaders were two bishops, Conon of Tarsus and Eugenius of Seleucia in Isauria, who were deposed by their comprovincials and took refuge at Constantinople where they found a powerful convert and protector in Athanasius the Monk, a grandson of the Empress Theodora. Philoponus dedicated to him a book on the Trinity. The old philosopher pleaded his infirmities when he was summoned by the Emperor Justinian to the Court to give an account of his teaching. But Conon and Eugenius had to dispute in the reign of Justin II (565-78) in the presence of the Catholic patriarch John Scholasticus (565-77), with two champions of the moderate Monophysite party, Stephen and Paul, the latter afterward Patriarch of Antioch. The Tritheist bishops refused to anathematize Philoponus, and brought proofs that he agreed with Severus and Theodosius. They were banished to Palestine, and Philoponus wrote a book against John Scholasticus, who had given his verdict in favour of his adversaries. But he developed a theory of his own as to the Resurrection (see Eutychianism) on account of which Conon and Eugenius wrote a treatise against him in collaboration with Themistus, the founder of the Agnoctae, in which they declared his views to be altogether unchristian. These two bishops and a deprived bishop named Theonas proceeded to consecrate bishops for their sect, which they established in Corinth and Athens, Rome, Northern Africa and the Western Patriarchate, while in the east agents traveled through Syria and Cilicia, Isauria and Cappadocia, converting whole districts and ordaining priests and deacons in cities villages and monasteries. Eugenius died in Pamphylia; Conon returned to Constantinople. Leontius assures that the Aristotelianism of Philoponus made him teach that there are in the Holy Trinity three partial substances (&quot;merikai ousiai, ikikai theotetes, idiai physeis&quot;) and one common. The genesis of the doctrine has been explained (for the first time) under MONOPHYSITES, where an account of Philoponus&#x27;s writings and those of Stephen Gobarus, another member of the sect, will be found.
#John Philoponus, an Aristotelian and monophysite in Alexandria about the middle of the sixth century, was charged with tritheism because he saw in the Trinity as separated three natures, substances and deities, according to the number of divine persons. He sought to justify this view by the Aristotelian categories of &quot;genus&quot;, &quot;species&quot; and &quot;individuum&quot;.
# In the Middle Ages, Roscellin of Compiegne, the founder of Nominalism, argued like Philoponus that unless the Three Persons are &quot;tres res&quot; (3 objects), the whole Trinity must have been incarnate. He was condemned of the heresy of tritheism at the 1092-1093 Council of Soissons presided over by Renaud du Bellay, archbishop of Rheims. Attempting to appeal to the authority of Lanfranc and Anselm, Roscellin prompted Anselm to write &quot;Cur Deus Homo&quot; and other treatments of the divine nature refuting his treatment. Roscellin publicly recanted and, after exile in England and Italy, reconciled himself to the church, but returned to a form of his earlier reasoning.
# Among Catholic writers, Pierre Faydit, who was expelled from the Oratory at Paris in 1671 for disobedience and died in 1709, practiced a form of tritheism in his &quot;Eclaireissements sur la doctrine et Phistoire ecclésiastiqes des deux premiers siecles&quot; (Paris, 1696), in which he tried to make out that the earliest Fathers were Tritheists. He was replied to by the Premonstratensian Abbot Louis-Charles Hugo (&quot;Apologie du système des Saints Pères sur la Trinité&quot;, Luxemburg, 1699).
# A prominent ideologue of Russian Old Believers and a writer, Avvakum (died 1682) was accused by official Orthodox Church and by fellow Old Believers of tritheism, based on some passages in his letters.
# A Catholic canon of Trier named Oembs, influenced by the doctrines of the &quot;Enlightenment&quot;, similarly attributed to the Fathers his own view of three similar natures in the Trinity, calling the numerical unity of God an invention of the Scholastics. His book &quot;Opuscula de Deo Uno et Trino&quot; (Mainz, 1789), was condemned by Pius VII in a Brief of 14 July 1804.
# The Bohemian Jesuit philosopher Anton Günther was also accused of tritheism, leading to his work ending up on the Index librorum. 
# Among Protestants, Heinrich Nicolai (d. 1660), a professor at Danzig and at Elbing (not to be confounded with the founder of Familia Caritatis), is cited.
# The best known in the Anglican Church is William Sherlock, Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, whose &quot;Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and ever Blessed Trinity&quot; (London, 1690) against the Socinians, maintaining that with the exception of a mutual consciousness of each other, which no created spirits can have, the three divine persons are &quot;three distinct infinite minds&quot; or &quot;three intelligent beings.&quot;, was attacked by Robert South in &quot;Animadversions on Dr. Sherlock&#x27;s Vindication&quot; (1693). Sherlock&#x27;s work is said to have made William Manning a Socinian and Thomas Emlyn an Arian, and the dispute was ridiculed in a skit entitled &quot;The Battle Royal&quot;, attributed to William Pittis (1694?), which was translated into Latin at Cambridge.
# Joseph Bingham, author of the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, preached at Oxford in 1695 a sermon which was considered to represent the Fathers as tritheists, and it was condemned by the Hebdomadal Council as &quot;falsa, impia et haeretica&quot;, the scholar being driven from Oxford.
# Though members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would probably not self-identify as tritheist, some critics of Mormonism say that it is tritheistic or polytheistic because it teaches that the Godhead is a council of three distinct deities perfectly &quot;one in purpose, unity and mission&quot;, but nevertheless separate and distinct beings.
# Some have suggested that the Seventh-day Adventist Church has embraced a tritheistic view of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as it does not see their singularity as a Godhead consisting in one being but rather as three separate beings in a single group.

<doc id="221909" wikidata="Q212611" url="?curid=221909" title="COBRA (art movement)">
<text>COBRA or Cobra, often stylized as CoBrA, was a European avant-garde art group active from 1948 to 1951. The name was coined in 1948 by Christian Dotremont from the initials of the members&#x27; home countries&#x27; capital cities: Copenhagen (Co), Brussels (Br), Amsterdam (A).

==History==
During the time of occupation of World War II, the Netherlands had been disconnected from the art world beyond its borders. CoBrA was formed shortly thereafter. This international movement of artists who worked experimentally evolved from the criticisms of Western society and a common desire to break away from existing art movements, including &quot;detested&quot; naturalism and &quot;sterile&quot; abstraction. Experimentation was the symbol of an unfettered freedom, which, according to Constant, was ultimately embodied by children and the expressions of children. CoBrA was formed by Karel Appel, Constant, Corneille, Christian Dotremont, Asger Jorn, and Joseph Noiret on 8 November 1948 in the Café Notre-Dame, Paris, with the signing of a manifesto, &quot;La cause était entendue&quot; (&quot;The Case Was Settled&quot;), drawn up by Dotremont. Formed with a unifying doctrine of complete freedom of colour and form, as well as antipathy towards Surrealism, the artists also shared an interest in Marxism as well as modernism.
Their working method was based on spontaneity and experiment, and they drew their inspiration in particular from children&#x27;s drawings, from primitive art forms and from the work of Paul Klee and Joan Miró.

Coming together as an amalgamation of the Dutch group Reflex, the Danish group Høst and the Belgian Revolutionary Surrealist Group, the group only lasted a few years but managed to achieve a number of objectives in that time: the periodical &quot;Cobra&quot;, a series of collaborations between various members called &quot;Peintures-Mot&quot; and two large-scale exhibitions. The first of these was held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, November 1949, the other at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Liège in 1951.

The group is notable for having a Black artist member, Ernest Mancoba, who was married to Sonja Ferlov Mancoba, a Danish sculptor who was one of a few active women in the movement.

In November 1949 the group officially changed its name to Internationale des Artistes Expérimentaux with membership having spread across Europe and the United States, although this name has never stuck. The movement was officially disbanded in 1951, but many of its members remained close, with Dotremont in particular continuing collaborations with many of the leading members of the group. The primary focus of the group consisted of semi-abstract paintings with brilliant color, violent brushwork, and distorted human figures inspired by primitive and folk art and similar to American action painting. CoBrA was a milestone in the development of Tachisme and European abstract expressionism.

CoBrA was perhaps the last avant-garde movement of the twentieth century. According to Nathalie Aubert the group only lasted officially for three years (1948 to 1951). After that period each artist
in the group developed their own individual paths.

=== Manifesto ===

The manifesto, entitled, &quot;La cause était entendue&quot; (The Case Was Settled) was written by CoBrA member Christian Dotremont and signed by all founding members in Paris in 1948. It was directly speaking to their experience attending the Centre International de Documentation sur l&#x27;Art d&#x27;Avant-garde in which they felt the atmosphere was sterile and authoritarian. It was a statement of working collaboratively in an organic mode of experimentation in order to develop their work separate from the current place of the avant-garde movement. The name of the manifesto was also a play on words from an earlier document signed by Belgian and French Revolutionary Surrealists in July 1947, entitled &quot;La cause est entendue&quot; (The Case Is Settled).

== Method ==

The European artists were different from their American counterparts (the Abstract expressionists) for they preferred the process over the product and introduced primitive, mythical, and folkloric elements along with a decorative input from their children and graffiti. One of the new approaches that united the CoBrA artists was their unrestrained use of strong colors, along with violent handwritings and figuration which can be either frightening or humorous. Their art was alive with subhuman figures in order to mirror the terror and weakness of our time unlike the dehumanized art of Abstraction. This spontaneous method was a rejection of Renaissance art, specialization, and &#x27;civilized art&#x27;, they preferred &#x27;uncivilized&#x27; forms of expression which created an interplay between the conscious and the unconscious instead of the Surrealist interest in the unconscious alone. The childlike in their method meant a pleasure in painting, in the materials, forms, and finally the picture itself; this aesthetic notion was called &#x27;desire unbound&#x27;. The Dutch Artists in particular within CoBrA (Corneille, Appel, Constant) were interested in Children&#x27;s art.&quot;We Wanted to start again like a child&quot; Karel Appel insisted. As part of the Western Left, they were built upon the fusion of Art and Life through experiment in order to unite form and expression.

== CoBrA exhibitions ==
They exhibited mainly in Holland, but also Paris and other countries in Europe.

===Stedelijk Museum exhibition===

The first major exhibition was held at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam in November 1949 under the title &quot;International Experimental Art&quot;. Else Alfelt, one of a few women involved in the movement, participated in this first exhibition.

The museum&#x27;s director and curator Willem Sandberg was interested in bringing experimentalism and abstraction to The Netherlands, and had also been an active member of the Dutch Resistance during the war. He was deeply involved with the CoBrA group and maintained direct contacts between the artists and the Stedelijk Museum.

The architect Aldo van Eyck, who would later become known for his architecture of playgrounds as cultural critique, was asked to do the interior design of the exhibition. The close relationship between Van Eyck and the artists from the CoBrA, who also drew their inspiration in particular from children&#x27;s drawings, makes it probable that much of Eyck&#x27;s early inspiration for the playgrounds may have derived from CoBrA.

The Stedelijk Museum exhibition gave rise to furious criticism from press and the public. A critic from &quot;Het Vrije Volk&quot; (Free People) wrote, &quot;Geklad, geklets en geklodder in het Stedelijk Museum&quot; (&quot;Smirch, twaddle and mess in the SMA&quot;). The CoBrA artists are considered scribblers and con artists. Newspapers spoke of offensive art and provocation on the part of the artists, and one evening for experimental poetry at the Stedelijk was the occasion for a public brawl.

=== Exhibition in Liège ===
The last CoBrA exhibit was located in Liège, Belgium, in 1951. Shortly after this exhibit, the group dissolved. The show was organised by Pierre Alechinsky, an artist from Belgium. The Dutch architect, Van Eyck designed the exhibition layout, just as he had for the 1949 CoBrA exhibition in Stedelijk. The innovations of this exhibit were that the composition for the wall was in a grid formation. In addition, the sculptures, which were featured in this show were on coal beds from the Liège area itself.

This show was not specific to only CoBrA artists, and also, major artists of the CoBrA movement were not in this exhibit due to the existing conflict within the group that eventually led to the collapse of CoBrA shortly after in the same year.

=== Criticism ===
* Alison M. Gingeras praises CoBrA as being a &quot;...wonderfully messy, cacophonous, and multi-tentacled,&quot; entity.
* Ernest Mancoba (1904–2002), of South Africa, claimed to be one of the only black artists of CoBrA. In his own words, Mancoba, a clear supporter of the CoBrA movement, criticizes the views of his fellow artists regarding himself: &quot;The embarrassment that my presence caused to the point of making me, in their eyes, some sort of &#x27;Invisible Man&#x27; or merely the consort of a European woman artist—was understandable, as before me there had never been to my knowledge any black man taking part in the visual arts &#x27;avant garde&#x27; of the Western World.&quot;

==Legacy==
There is a Cobra Museum in Amstelveen, Netherlands, displaying works by Karel Appel and other international avant-garde artists.

The NSU Art Museum in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is known for its large assemblage of works of CoBrA art. The museum displays works by Karel Appel, Pierre Alechinsky, and Asger Jorn, the movement&#x27;s leading exponents.

Auctioneers Bruun Rasmussen held an auction of CoBrA artists on April 3, 2006 in Copenhagen. It set records for the highest price for an Asger Jorn painting (6.4 million DKK for &quot;Tristesse Blanche&quot;) and for the highest amount raised in a single auction in Denmark (30 million DKK in total).
