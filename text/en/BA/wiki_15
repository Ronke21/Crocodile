<text>Newsweek is an American weekly news magazine. Founded as a weekly print magazine in 1933, &quot;Newsweek&quot; was widely distributed during the 20th century and had many notable editors-in-chief. It is currently co-owned by Dev Pragad, the president and chief executive officer (CEO), and Johnathan Davis, who sits on the board; each owning 50% of the company.

In August 2010, revenue decline prompted the Washington Post Company to sell the publication to the audio pioneer Sidney Harman for one US dollar and an assumption of the magazine&#x27;s liabilities. Later that year, &quot;Newsweek&quot; merged with the news and opinion website &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, forming The Newsweek Daily Beast Company, later called &quot;NewsBeast&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; was jointly owned by the estate of Harman and the diversified American media and Internet company IAC. &quot;Newsweek&quot; continued to experience financial difficulties leading to the suspension of print publication at the end of 2012.

In 2013, IBT Media acquired &quot;Newsweek&quot; from IAC; the acquisition included the &quot;Newsweek&quot; brand and its online publication but did not include &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. IBT Media, which also owns the &quot;International Business Times&quot;, rebranded itself as Newsweek Media Group and in 2014 relaunched &quot;Newsweek&quot; in both print and digital form. In 2018, IBT Media split into two companies, Newsweek Publishing and IBT Media. The split was accomplished one day before the district attorney of Manhattan indicted Etienne Uzac, the co-owner of IBT Media, on fraud charges.

Under &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s current co-owner and CEO Dev Pragad, the business is profitable, growing 20–30% per year; according to Comscore, its monthly unique visitors rose from about 30 million to 48 million between May 2019 and May 2022. Since Pragad became CEO in 2016, readership has grown to 100-million readers per month, the highest in its 90-year history. The Harvard Business School published a case study of the company in 2021.

==History==


===Founding and early years (1933–1961)===

&quot;News-Week&quot; was launched in 1933 by Thomas J. C. Martyn, a former foreign news editor for &quot;Time&quot;. He obtained financial backing from a group of U.S. stockholders &quot;which included Ward Cheney, of the Cheney silk family, John Hay Whitney, and Paul Mellon, son of Andrew W. Mellon&quot;. Paul Mellon&#x27;s ownership in &quot;News-Week&quot; marked &quot;the first attempt of the Mellon family to function journalistically on a national scale&quot;. The group of original owners invested around million (equivalent to $million in ). Other large stockholders prior to 1946 were public utilities investment banker Stanley Childs and Wall Street corporate lawyer Wilton Lloyd-Smith.

Journalist Samuel T. Williamson served as the first editor-in-chief of &quot;News-Week&quot;. The first issue of the magazine was dated February 17, 1933. Seven photographs from the week&#x27;s news were printed on the first issue&#x27;s cover. In 1937, &quot;News-Week&quot; merged with the weekly journal &quot;Today&quot;, which had been founded in 1932 by future New York Governor and diplomat W. Averell Harriman and Vincent Astor of the prominent Astor family. As a result of the deal, Harriman and Astor provided $600,000 () in venture capital funds and Vincent Astor became both the chairman of the board and its principal stockholder between 1937 and his death in 1959.

In 1937 Malcolm Muir took over as president and editor-in-chief. He changed the name to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, emphasized interpretive stories, introduced signed columns, and launched international editions.

===Under &quot;Post&quot; ownership (1961–2010)===
The magazine was purchased by The Washington Post Company in 1961. Osborn Elliott was named editor of &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 1961 and became the editor-in-chief in 1969.
In 1970, Eleanor Holmes Norton represented sixty female employees of &quot;Newsweek&quot; who had filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that &quot;Newsweek&quot; had a policy of allowing only men to be reporters. The women won the suit with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and &quot;Newsweek&quot; agreed to allow women to be reporters. The day the claim was filed, &quot;Newsweek&quot; cover article was &quot;Women in Revolt&quot;, covering the feminist movement; the article was written by a woman who had been hired on a freelance basis since there were no female reporters at the magazine.

Edward Kosner became editor from 1975 to 1979 after directing the magazine&#x27;s extensive coverage of the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Richard M. Smith became chairman in 1998. Also in 1998, the magazine inaugurated its &quot;Best High Schools in America&quot; list, a ranking of public secondary schools based on the Challenge Index, which measures the ratio of Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exams taken by students to the number of graduating students that year, regardless of the scores earned by students or the difficulty in graduating. Schools with average SAT scores above 1300 or average ACT scores above 27 are excluded from the list; these are categorized instead as &quot;Public Elite&quot; High Schools. In 2008, there were 17 Public Elites.

Smith resigned as board chairman in December 2007.

====Restructuring and new owner (2008–2010)====

During 2008–2009, &quot;Newsweek&quot; undertook a dramatic business restructuring. Citing difficulties in competing with online news sources to provide unique news in a weekly publication, the magazine refocused its content on opinion and commentary beginning with its May 24, 2009, issue. Its subscriber base shrank from 3.1million to 2.6million in early 2008, to 1.9million in July 2009 and then to 1.5million in January 2010a decline of 50% in one year. Jon Meacham, editor-in-chief from 2006 to 2010, described his strategy as &quot;counterintuitive&quot; as it involved discouraging subscription renewals and nearly doubling subscription prices as it sought a more affluent subscriber base for its advertisers. During this period, the magazine also laid off staff. While advertising revenues were down almost 50% compared to the prior year, expenses were also diminished, whereby the publishers hoped &quot;Newsweek&quot; would return to profitability.

The financial results for 2009 as reported by The Washington Post Company showed that advertising revenue for &quot;Newsweek&quot; was down 37% in 2009 and the magazine division reported an operating loss for 2009 of million (equivalent to $ million in ) compared to a loss of million in 2008 (equivalent to $ million in ). During the first quarter of 2010, the magazine lost nearly million (equivalent to $ million in ).

By May 2010, &quot;Newsweek&quot; had been losing money for the past two years and was put up for sale. The sale attracted international bidders. One bidder was Syrian entrepreneur Abdulsalam Haykal, CEO of Syrian publishing company Haykal Media, who brought together a coalition of Middle Eastern investors with his company. Haykal later claimed his bid was ignored by &quot;Newsweek&quot; bankers, Allen &amp; Co.

The magazine was sold to audio pioneer Sidney Harman on August 2, 2010, for in exchange for assuming the magazine&#x27;s financial liabilities. Harman&#x27;s bid was accepted over three competitors. Jon Meacham left the magazine upon completion of the sale. Sidney Harman was the husband of Jane Harman, at that time a member of Congress from California.

===Merger with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; (2010–2013)===

At the end of 2010, &quot;Newsweek&quot; merged with the online publication &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, following extensive negotiations between the respective proprietors. Tina Brown, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; editor-in-chief, became editor of both publications. The new entity, The Newsweek Daily Beast Company, was 50% owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp and 50% by Harman.

====Redesign (2011)====
&quot;Newsweek&quot; was redesigned in March 2011. The new &quot;Newsweek&quot; moved the &quot;Perspectives&quot; section to the front of the magazine, where it served as a summary of the past week&#x27;s news reported on by &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. More room was made available in the front of the magazine for columnists, editors, and special guests. A new &quot;News Gallery&quot; section featured two-page spreads of photographs from the week with a brief article accompanying each one. The &quot;NewsBeast&quot; section featured short articles, a brief interview with a newsmaker, and several graphs and charts for quick reading in the style of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. This is where the &quot;Newsweek&quot; staple &quot;Conventional Wisdom&quot; was located. Brown retained &quot;Newsweek&quot; focus on in-depth, analytical features and original reporting on politics and world affairs, as well as a new focus on longer fashion and pop culture features. A larger culture section named &quot;Omnivore&quot; featured art, music, books, film, theater, food, travel, and television, including a weekly &quot;Books&quot; and &quot;Want&quot; section. The back page was reserved for a &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; column written by celebrity guest columnists about a mistake they made that helped shape who they are.

====Cessation of print format (2012)====

On July 25, 2012, the company operating &quot;Newsweek&quot; indicated the publication was likely to go digital to cover its losses and could undergo other changes by the next year. Barry Diller, chairman of the conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp, said his firm was looking at options since its partner in the &quot;Newsweek&quot;/&quot;Daily Beast&quot; operation had pulled out.

At the end of 2012, the company discontinued the American print edition after 80 years of publication, citing the increasing difficulty of maintaining a paper weekly magazine in the face of declining advertising and subscription revenues and increasing costs for print production and distribution. The online edition was renamed &quot;Newsweek Global&quot;.

===Spin-off to IBT Media, return to print (2013–2018)===
In April 2013, IAC chairman and founder Barry Diller said at the Milken Global Conference that he &quot;wished he hadn&#x27;t bought&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; because his company had lost money on the magazine and called the purchase a &quot;mistake&quot; and a &quot;fool&#x27;s errand&quot;.

On August 3, 2013, IBT Media acquired &quot;Newsweek&quot; from IAC on terms that were not disclosed; the acquisition included the &quot;Newsweek&quot; brand and its online publication, but did not include &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. On March 7, 2014, IBT Media relaunched a print edition of &quot;Newsweek&quot; with a cover story on the alleged creator of Bitcoin that was criticized for lacking substantive evidence. The magazine stood by its story.

IBT Media announced that the publication returned to profitability on October 8, 2014. In February 2017, IBT Media appointed Matt McAllester, then editor of &quot;Newsweek International&quot;, as global editor-in-chief of &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

In January 2018, &quot;Newsweek&quot; offices were raided by the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s office as part of an investigation into co-owner and founder, Etienne Uzac. &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; noted the probe &quot;focused on loans the company took out to purchase the computer equipment&quot;, and several &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporters were fired after reporting on the issue. Uzac pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering in 2020.

===Newsweek Publishing LLC (2018–present)===

In September 2018, after completing the strategic structural changes introduced in March of the same year, IBT Media spun off &quot;Newsweek&quot; into its own entity, Newsweek Publishing LLC, with co-ownership to Dev Pragad and Johnathan Davis of IBT Media.

In 2020, &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s website hit 100 million unique monthly readers, up from seven million at the start of 2017. In 2021, its revenues doubled to $75 million and traffic increased to 48 million monthly unique visitors in May 2022 from about 30 million in May 2019 according to Comscore. The &quot;rebirth&quot; of &quot;Newsweek&quot; was the subject of a study by Harvard Business School.

In September 2023, &quot;Newsweek&quot; announced it would be making use of generative AI in its operations. Its AI policy states that generative AI can be used in &quot;writing, research, editing, and other core journalism functions&quot; as long as journalists are involved throughout the process. In 2024, it rolled out an AI video production tool and started hiring an AI-focused breaking news team.

==Circulation and branches==
In 2003, worldwide circulation was more than 4 million, including 2.7 million in the U.S; by 2010 it reduced to 1.5 million (with newsstand sales declining to just over 40,000 copies per week). &quot;Newsweek&quot; publishes editions in Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Rioplatense Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Serbian, as well as an English-language &quot;Newsweek International&quot;. &quot;Russian Newsweek&quot;, published since 2004, was shuttered in October 2010. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; (an Australian weekly until 2008) incorporated an international news section from &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

Based in New York City, the magazine claimed 22 bureaus in 2011: nine in the U.S.: New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago/Detroit, Dallas, Miami, Washington, D.C., Boston and San Francisco, and others overseas in London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Jerusalem, Baghdad, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, South Asia, Cape Town, Mexico City and Buenos Aires.

According to a 2015 column in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, after returning to print publication, &quot;Newsweek&quot; was selling c. 100,000 copies per month, with staff at that time numbering &quot;about 60 editorial staffers&quot;, up from a low of &quot;less than 30 editorial staffers&quot; in 2013, but with plans then to grow the number to &quot;close to 100 in the next year&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Allegations of sexism===
In 1970, Eleanor Holmes Norton represented sixty female employees of &quot;Newsweek&quot; who had filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that &quot;Newsweek&quot; had a policy of allowing only men to be reporters. The women won, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; agreed to allow women to be reporters. The day the claim was filed, &quot;Newsweek&quot; cover article was &quot;Women in Revolt&quot;, covering the feminist movement. The article was written by Helen Dudar, a freelancer, in the belief that there were no female writers at the magazine capable of handling the assignment. Those passed over included Elizabeth Peer, who had spent five years in Paris as a foreign correspondent.

The 1986 cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; featured an article that said &quot;women who weren&#x27;t married by 40 had a better chance of being killed by a terrorist than of finding a husband&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; eventually apologized for the story and in 2010 launched a study that discovered 2 in 3 women who were 40 and single in 1986 had married since. The story caused a &quot;wave of anxiety&quot; and some &quot;skepticism&quot; amongst professional and highly educated women in the United States. The article was cited several times in the 1993 Hollywood film &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Comparisons have been made with this article and the current rising issues surrounding the social stigma of unwed women in Asia called &quot;sheng nu&quot;.

Former Alaska Governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was featured on the cover of the November 23, 2009, issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, with the caption &quot;How do you Solve a Problem Like Sarah?&quot; featuring an image of Palin in athletic attire and posing. Palin herself, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and other commentators accused &quot;Newsweek&quot; of sexism for their choice of cover in the November 23, 2009 issue discussing Palin&#x27;s book, &quot;Going Rogue: An American Life&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s sexist as hell&quot;, wrote Lisa Richardson for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Taylor Marsh of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called it &quot;the worst case of pictorial sexism aimed at political character assassination ever done by a traditional media outlet&quot;. David Brody of CBN News stated: &quot;This cover should be insulting to women politicians.&quot; The cover includes a photo of Palin used in the August 2009 issue of &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot;. The photographer may have breached his contract with &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; when he permitted its use in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, as &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; maintained certain rights to the photo until August 2010. It is uncertain, however, whether this particular use of the photo was prohibited.

Minnesota Republican Congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann was featured on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine in August 2011, dubbed &quot;the Queen of Rage&quot;. The photo of her was perceived as unflattering, as it portrayed her with a wide-eyed expression some said made her look &quot;crazy&quot;. Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin called the depiction &quot;sexist&quot;, and Sarah Palin denounced the publication. &quot;Newsweek&quot; defended the cover&#x27;s depiction of her, saying its other photos of Bachmann showed similar intensity.

In June 2024, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published an opinion piece with the title &quot;Taylor Swift Is Not a Good Role Model&quot;, which claimed that American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift was a bad role model for young girls due to being unmarried, childless and having been in multiple relationships. The article was condemned as sexist, including by tennis player Martina Navratilova.

=== Factual errors ===
Unlike most large American magazines, &quot;Newsweek&quot; has not used fact-checkers since 1996. In 1997, the magazine was forced to recall several hundred thousand copies of a special issue called &quot;Your Child&quot;, which advised that infants as young as five months old could safely feed themselves zwieback toasts and chunks of raw carrot (to the contrary, both represent a choking hazard in children this young). The error was later attributed to a copy editor who was working on two stories at the same time.

In 2017, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published a story claiming that the First Lady of Poland refused to shake U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s hand; fact-checking website &quot;Snopes&quot; described the assertion as &quot;false&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; corrected its story.

In 2018, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ran a story alleging that President Trump had colored the American flag incorrectly while visiting a classroom; &quot;Snopes&quot; was unable to corroborate the photographic evidence.

In August 2018, &quot;Newsweek&quot; incorrectly reported that the Sweden Democrats, a far-right party, could win a majority in the 2018 Swedish parliamentary elections. Polls showed that the party was far away from winning a majority. By September 2018, &quot;Newsweek&quot; article was still up.

In November 2022, during the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran, &quot;Newsweek&quot; incorrectly reported that Iran had ordered the execution of over 15,000 protesters. The claim was widely shared on social media, including by actresses Trudie Styler, Sophie Turner and Viola Davis, and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. The number was actually derived from estimates from a United Nations human rights rapporteur and other human rights organizations of how many people were detained in Iran in connection with the protests, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; later retracted the underlying claim leading to the inference that the people faced a death sentence.

In October 2023, &quot;Newsweek&quot; incorrectly reported that a viral video of U.S. senator Tommy Tuberville falling down a flight of stairs while exiting an airplane had been recorded that month. The reporting by &quot;Newsweek&quot; drew comparisons to Tuberville&#x27;s criticism of President Joe Biden similarly tripping on stairways. In reality, the video highlighted by &quot;Newsweek&quot; was filmed in 2014, nine years prior, before Tuberville&#x27;s tenure as senator.

=== 2018 investigation and firings ===
The Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s office raided &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s headquarters in Lower Manhattan on January 18, 2018, and seized 18 computer servers as part of an investigation related to the company&#x27;s finances. IBT, which owned &quot;Newsweek&quot; at the time, had been under scrutiny for its ties to David Jang, a South Korean pastor and the leader of a Christian sect called &quot;the Community&quot;. In February 2018, under IBT ownership, several &quot;Newsweek&quot; staff were fired and some resigned stating that management had tried to interfere in articles about the investigations.

===Other===
Fareed Zakaria, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist and editor of &quot;Newsweek International&quot;, attended a secret meeting on November 29, 2001, with a dozen policy makers, Middle East experts and members of influential policy research organizations that produced a report for President George W. Bush and his cabinet outlining a strategy for dealing with Afghanistan and the Middle East in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. The meeting was held at the request of Paul D. Wolfowitz, then the Deputy Secretary of Defense. The unusual presence of journalists, who also included Robert D. Kaplan of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, at such a strategy meeting was revealed in Bob Woodward&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III&quot;. Woodward reported in his book that, according to Kaplan, everyone at the meeting signed confidentiality agreements not to discuss what happened. Zakaria told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he attended the meeting for several hours but did not recall being told that a report for the president would be produced. On October 21, 2006, after verification, the &quot;Times&quot; published a correction that stated:
An article in Business Day on October 9 about journalists who attended a secret meeting in November 2001 called by Paul D. Wolfowitz, then Deputy Secretary of Defense, incorrectly referenced Fareed Zakaria, editor of &quot;Newsweek International&quot; and a &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist, regarding his participation. Mr. Zakaria was not told that the meeting would produce a report for the Bush administration, nor did his name appear on the report.

The cover story of the January 15, 2015, issue, titled &quot;What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women&quot; caused controversy, due to both its illustration, described as &quot;the cartoon of a faceless female in spiky red heels, having her dress lifted up by a cursor arrow&quot;, and its content, described as &quot;a 5,000-word article on the creepy, sexist culture of the tech industry&quot;. Among those offended by the cover were &quot;Today Show&quot; co-host Tamron Hall, who commented &quot;I think it&#x27;s obscene and just despicable, honestly.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; editor-in-chief James Impoco explained &quot;We came up with an image that we felt represented what that story said about Silicon Valley ... If people get angry, they should be angry.&quot; The article&#x27;s author, Nina Burleigh, asked, &quot;Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?&quot;

In January 1998, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter Michael Isikoff was the first reporter to investigate allegations of a sexual relationship between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, but the editors spiked the story. The story soon surfaced online in the Drudge Report.

In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the John McCain campaign wrote a lengthy letter to the editor criticizing a cover story in May 2008.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; journalists have expressed criticism of the editorial quality of its reporting since its change in ownership in 2013. In 2018, former &quot;Newsweek&quot; journalist Jonathan Alter wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that since being sold to the &quot;International Business Times&quot; in 2013 the magazine had &quot;produced some strong journalism and plenty of clickbait before becoming a painful embarrassment to anyone who toiled there in its golden age&quot;. Former &quot;Newsweek&quot; writer Matthew Cooper criticized &quot;Newsweek&quot; for running multiple inaccurate stories in 2018.

In December 2019, journalist Tareq Haddad said he resigned from &quot;Newsweek&quot; when it refused to publish his story about documents published by WikiLeaks concerning the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons&#x27; report into the 2018 Douma chemical attack. Haddad said his information was inconvenient to the U.S. government which had retaliated after the chemical attack. A &quot;Newsweek&quot; spokesperson responded that Haddad &quot;pitched a conspiracy theory rather than an idea for objective reporting. &quot;Newsweek&quot; editors rejected the pitch.&quot;

In August 2020, Chapman University professor John C. Eastman wrote a &quot;Newsweek&quot; op-ed asking if Kamala Harris&#x27;s parents were U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents at the time of her birth or if they were temporary visitors. He then stated that if they were temporary visitors, then &quot;under the 14th Amendment as originally understood&quot;, she would not be considered a U.S. citizen and would not be eligible for her then-current position in the Senate. The op-ed resulted in the spread of &#x27;birther-ism&#x27; conspiracy theories surrounding Kamala Harris. &quot;Newsweek&quot; later apologized for the op-ed, saying they had &quot;entirely failed to anticipate the ways in which the essay would be interpreted, distorted and weaponized&quot; and that their publication of it &quot;was intended to explore a minority legal argument about the definition of who is a &#x27;natural-born citizen&#x27; in the United States.&quot;

In December 2021, comedian Jon Stewart criticized Newsweek, declaring in a podcast titled &quot;Clickbait is Arson,&quot; that its &quot;business model is ... arson&quot;, after the magazine reported that he accused Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling of antisemitism.

In September 2022, &quot;Recorder&quot; published an investigation on press financing in Romania by the political parties in government. In the investigation, it accused &quot;Newsweek Romania&quot; of being paid €8,000 per month (€3,000 by Payment Services directive (PSD) and €5,000 by PNL) to publish positive articles about the government. After the publication of the investigation, &quot;Newsweek Romania&quot; published an investigation about &quot;Recorder&quot;″s owner who is the son of a former communist ambassador and also a nephew of a former KGB general. In response, &quot;Recorder&quot;&#x27;s journalists accused &quot;Newsweek Romania&quot; of denigrating them.

In November 2022, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that &quot;Newsweek&quot; had &quot;taken a marked radical right turn by buoying extremists and promoting authoritarian leaders&quot; since it hired conservative political activist Josh Hammer as editor-at-large. It noted the magazine&#x27;s elevation of conspiracy theorists, publication of conspiracy theories about COVID-19, views such as support for a ban on all legal immigration to the United States and denying adults access to trans-affirming medical care, and failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest in the content published on Hammer&#x27;s opinion section and podcast.

<text>Macworld is a digital magazine and website dedicated to products and software of Apple Inc., published by Foundry, a subsidiary of IDG.

==History==

&quot;Macworld&quot; was founded by David Bunnell and Cheryl Woodard (publishers) and Andrew Fluegelman (editor). It began as a print magazine in 1984, with its first issue distributed at the launch of the Macintosh computer. As a print magazine, it had the largest audited circulation (both total and newsstand) of Macintosh-focused magazines in North America, more than double its nearest competitor, &quot;MacLife&quot;. 

In 1997, the Ziff-Davis-owned &quot;MacUser&quot; magazine was consolidated into &quot;Macworld&quot; within the new Mac Publishing joint venture between IDG and Ziff-Davis. In 1999, the combined company also purchased the online publication MacCentral Online, because &quot;Macworld&quot; did not have a powerful online news component at the time. In late 2001 IDG bought out Ziff-Davis&#x27; share of Mac Publishing, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDG. 

In 2003, &quot;Macworld&quot; began publishing as a digital version in addition to the print edition. On September 10, 2014, IDG announced it was discontinuing the print edition and laid off most of the staff, while continuing the digital version.

At one time, the magazine&#x27;s publisher licensed its name to another IDG subsidiary, IDG World Expo, for the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo (later Macworld/iWorld), which took place every January at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco.

==Game Hall of Fame==
&quot;Macworld&quot; published an annual Game Hall of Fame feature from 1986 until 2009. The Game Hall of Fame recognized the best Macintosh games of the year in various categories. The Hall of Fame was founded in 1986 by Steven Levy, who wrote or co-wrote the feature until 1998. Peter Cohen wrote the feature from 2001 until its conclusion in 2009. From 1998, the Game Hall of Fame began regularly inducting gaming accessories and hardware, and for its final two installments in 2008 and 2009, it further expanded its scope to include the best iPhone games.

==International editions==

The magazine was published in many countries, either by other IDG subsidiaries or by outside publishers who have licensed the brand name and its content. These editions included Australia, Germany (1990–2015 &quot;Macwelt&quot;), Italy, Spain, Sweden (&quot;MacWorld&quot;), Turkey, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Indonesia. Its content was also incorporated into a number of other IDG publications. In France, IDG bought &quot;Golden&quot; magazine, released in 1991, renamed it into &quot;Macworld France&quot; in 1996. Two years later, it has been merged with &quot;Univers Mac&quot; and renamed &quot;Univers Macworld&quot;. Publication ended probably in 2004.

&quot;Macworld&quot; has also published in Indonesia by Megindo Tunggal Sejahtera, between 2008 until December 2011.

==Podcast==
The Macworld Podcast is a weekly podcast published by &quot;Macworld&quot;. The Macworld Podcast began life on April 26, 2005 as the &quot;Geek Factor Podcast,&quot; hosted by Cyrus Farivar, but was upgraded into the official &quot;Macworld Podcast&quot; with its fifth installment in August 2005. It was hosted at various times by Chris Breen, Philip Michaels, Serenity Caldwell, Glenn Fleishman, and Susie Ochs. Following a hiatus in 2017, today the Macworld Podcast is manned by Michael Simon, Roman Loyola and Jason Cross.

<doc id="214172" wikidata="Q379587" url="?curid=214172" title="Patriarch Nikon of Moscow">
<text>Nikon (, ), born Nikita Minin (; 7 May 1605 – 17 August 1681) was the seventh Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; of the Russian Orthodox Church, serving officially from 1652 to 1666. He was renowned for his eloquence, energy, piety and close ties to Tsar Alexis of Russia. Nikon introduced many reforms, including liturgical reforms that were unpopular among conservatives. These divisions eventually led to a lasting schism known as &quot;Raskol&quot; (schism) in the Russian Orthodox Church. For many years, he was a dominant political figure, often equaling or even overshadowing the Tsar. In December 1667, Nikon was tried by a synod of church officials, deprived of all his sacerdotal functions, and reduced to the status of a simple monk.

==Early life==
Son of a Mordvin peasant farmer named Mina, he was born on 7 May 1605 in the village of , 90 versts (96 km or 60 miles) from Nizhny Novgorod. His mother died soon after he was born, and his father remarried. His stepmother mistreated him. He learned reading and writing with the parish priest. At the age of 12 he ran away from home to Makaryev Monastery where he remained until 1624 as a novice.

Then he returned home due to his parents&#x27; insistence, married, and became a parish priest in a nearby village.

His eloquence attracted the attention of some Moscow merchants who were coming to the area because of a famous trade fair held on Makaryev Monastery grounds. Through their efforts he was invited to serve as a priest at a populous parish in the capital.

He served there about ten years. Meanwhile, by 1635, his three little children died. He saw that as a providential sign and decided to become a monk. First he persuaded his wife to take the veil and then withdrew himself to a desolate hermitage on the isle of Anzersky on the White Sea. On becoming a monk he took the name Nikon.

In 1639, he had a quarrel with the father superior, and fled the monastery by boat; a tempest broke out and his boat was cast ashore on Kiy Island, where he would later establish a great monastery. He eventually reached the Kozheozersky Monastery, in the diocese of Novgorod, of which he became abbot in 1643.

==Meeting with the Tsar==
In his official capacity, he visited Moscow in 1646, and paid homage to the young Tsar Alexei I, as was the custom at the time. Alexei, who was rather pious, was quite impressed with Nikon, and appointed him archimandrite, or prior, of the important Novospassky monastery in Moscow. This monastery was especially associated with the House of Romanovs.

==Zealots of Piety==
While serving at Novospassky Monastery, Nikon became a member of the circle of the &quot;Zealots of Piety&quot;. This was a group of ecclesiastical and secular individuals that started in the late 1630s, gathering around Stefan Vonifatiyev, the confessor of tsar Alexei.

In the wake of the Time of Troubles, the members believed the problems of the time were the manifestation of a wrathful God, angry with the Russian people&#x27;s lack of religiosity. The group called for the rebirth of the Russian Orthodox faith, and a renewal of the religious piety of the masses. This group included Fyodor Rtishchev, Abbot Ivan Neronov of the Kazan Cathedral, Protopope Avvakum, and others.

In 1649, Nikon became metropolitan of Great Novgorod. He was given some special privileges there. During his tenure, a riot started in the city, and Nikon was severely beaten by the mobs. Nevertheless, he managed to resolve the matters peacefully, by leading a religious procession against the rioters.

==Elected as patriarch (1652)==

On 1 August 1652 he was elected patriarch of Moscow. Nikon knew that he was rather unpopular with the nobility, and declined the offer several times.

It was only with the utmost difficulty that Nikon could be persuaded to become the arch-pastor of the Russian Church. He gave in after the Tsar himself and the boyars fell on their knees, begging him to accept. He only yielded after imposing upon the whole assembly a solemn oath of obedience to him in everything concerning the dogmas, canons and observances of the Orthodox Church.

==Nikon&#x27;s reforms==
When Nikon was appointed, ecclesiastical reform was already in the air. A number of ecclesiastical dignitaries, known as the party of the protopopes (deans), had accepted the responsibility for the revision of the church service-books inaugurated by the late Patriarch Joasaph, and a few other minor rectifications of certain ancient observances. But they were far too timid to attempt anything really effectual.

Nikon launched bold reforms. He consulted the most learned of the Greek prelates abroad, invited them to a consultation at Moscow, and finally the scholars of Constantinople and Kiev convinced Nikon that the Muscovite service-books were heterodox, and that the icons actually in use had very widely departed from the ancient Constantinopolitan models, being for the most part imbued with the Frankish and Polish (West European) baroque influences.

Nikon criticized severely the use of such new-fangled icons; he ordered a house-to-house search for them to be made. His soldiers and servants were charged first to gouge out the eyes of these heretical counterfeits and then carry them through the town in derision. He also issued an ukase threatening with the severest penalties all who dared to make or use such icons in future.

Later research was to determine that Muscovite service-books did belong to a different recension from that which was used by the Greeks at the time of Nikon, and the unrevised Muscovite books were actually older and more venerable than the Greek books, which had undergone several revisions over the centuries, were newer, and contained innovations.

In 1654, Nikon summoned a synod to re-examine the service-books revised by the Patriarch Joasaf, and the majority of the synod decided that &quot;the Greeks should be followed rather than our own ancients.&quot; A second council, held at Moscow in 1656, sanctioned the revision of the service-books as suggested by the first council, and anathematized the dissenting minority, which included the party of the protopopes and Paul, bishop of Kolomna. The reforms coincided with a great plague in 1654.

Construction of tent-like churches (of which Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral is a prime example) was strictly forbidden, and many old uncanonical churches were demolished to make way for new ones, designed in the &quot;Old Byzantine&quot; style. This ruthlessness goes far to explain the unappeasable hatred with which the Old Believers, as they now began to be called, ever afterwards regarded Nikon and all his works.

==His building program==
He enriched the numerous and splendid monasteries which he built with valuable libraries. His emissaries scoured Muscovy and the Orient for precious Greek and Slavonic manuscripts, both sacred and profane.

Among the great monasteries he founded were Valday Iversky Monastery, the New Jerusalem Monastery, and Kiy Island Monastery.

==Political power==
From 1652 to 1658, Nikon was not so much the minister as the colleague of the Tsar. Both in public documents and in private letters he was permitted to use the sovereign title. This was especially the case during the wars with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1654–1667, when the tsar was away from Moscow with his armies. In 1654, while starting on his great military campaign, the tsar left Nikon at home as the chief ruler. Needless to say, this created some considerable resentment among the high level boyars.

Nikon made it his mission to remove the Church from secular authority, and permanently separate the Church from the state. He believed that the Church and state should work in harmony, while remaining separate from each other. He stated that &quot;There are two swords of authority, that is, the spiritual and the secular&quot; and that &quot;the supreme Bishop is higher than the Tsar&quot;. He also sought to organize the Church with a hierarchy similar to the state&#x27;s – with the Patriarch in complete control.. On a personal note, Nikon and Aleksei officialized their bond as the Tsar made the Patriarch godfather of all his children.

Nikon especially protested Sobornoye Ulozheniye (Russian Legal Code) of 1649, which reduced the status of the clergy, and made the Church in effect subservient to the state. Also, according to this Code, the taxation of monastery lands was used for the benefit of the state.

But his actions raised up a whole host of enemies against him, and by the summer of 1658 they had convinced Alexius that the sovereign patriarch was eclipsing the sovereign tsar. Alexius suddenly grew cold towards his own &quot;bosom friend,&quot; as he called him.

==Nikon leaves Moscow (1658)==
Almost as a test of wills and, perhaps, hoping to dramatize his own importance and indispensability, Nikon publicly stripped himself of his patriarchal vestments in 1658, and went to live at the New Jerusalem Monastery, that he, himself, founded in the town of Istra, 40 kilometers west of Moscow. But he actually did not officially resign from his position.

For nearly two years Tsar Alexius and Nikon remained estranged and their conflict unresolved. In February 1660 a synod was held at Moscow to elect a new Patriarch to the throne, vacant now for nearly two years. The synod decided not only that a new patriarch should be appointed, but that Nikon had forfeited both his archiepiscopal rank and his priests orders.

Against the second part of the synod&#x27;s decision, however, the great ecclesiastical expert Epiphanius Slavinetsky protested energetically, and ultimately the whole inquiry collapsed. The tsar was unwilling to enforce the decrees of the synod being unsure of its ecclesiastical validity.

For six years longer the Russian Orthodoxy remained without a patriarch. Every year the question of Nikon&#x27;s deposition became more complicated and confusing. Almost every contemporary Eastern Orthodox scholar was consulted on the subject, and no two authorities agreed. At last the matter was submitted to a pan-Orthodox synod.

==Condemned by synod (1667)==

In December 1667, Nikon was tried by a synod of church officials, known as the Great Moscow Synod. It was presided over by &quot;two foreign Patriarchs ... [and consisting of] thirteen metropolitans, nine archbishops, five bishops and thirty-two archmandrites.&quot; The two patriarchs at the synod were Paisius of Alexandria, and Macarius III of Antioch. Symeon of Polotsk was one of the key theologians preparing the documents of the synod.

According to Robert Massie, during the proceedings, Nikon staunchly defended his belief that the church&#x27;s authority and power were, and ought to be, supreme; however, Nikon was rather insisting that the church&#x27;s authority and power ought to be supreme only in ecclesiastical matters.

On 12 December 1667, the synod pronounced Nikon guilty of reviling the tsar and the whole Muscovite Church, of deposing Paul, Bishop of Kolomna, contrary to the canons, and of beating and torturing his dependents. His sentence was deprivation of all his sacerdotal functions; henceforth, he was to be known simply as the monk Nikon. The same day he was put into a sledge and sent as a prisoner to the far northern Ferapontov monastery. However, the very council which had deposed him confirmed all his reforms, and anathematized all who refused to accept them, like protopope Avvakum.

Nikon survived Tsar Alexis, with whom something of the old intimacy had been resumed in 1671. In 1681, the new tsar Fedor (Alexius&#x27;s son), on hearing that Nikon was dying, allowed him to return to Moscow and, under a partial pardon, take up residence in his former Moscow home, the New Jerusalem Monastery. At Yaroslavl on his way there, after crossing the Kotorosl River, he died in Tropino on 17 August 1681. The monastery remained unfinished, however, but the royal family paid particular attention to ensuring its completion. Nikon&#x27;s cleric later recorded that, for the church&#x27;s consecration in 1685, Tserevna Tatyana prepared gold and silver, arranged for icons to be made, and personally embroidered veils to cover paraphernalia for the eucharist.

<doc id="214175" wikidata="Q373085" url="?curid=214175" title="Chancellor">
<text>Chancellor () is a title of various official positions in the governments of many countries. The original chancellors were the of Roman courts of justice—ushers, who sat at the (lattice work screens) of a basilica (court hall), which separated the judge and counsel from the audience. A chancellor&#x27;s office is called a chancellery or chancery. The word is now used in the titles of many various officers in various settings (government, education, religion). Nowadays the term is most often used to describe:
*The head of the government
*A person in charge of foreign affairs
*A person with duties related to justice
*A person in charge of financial and economic issues
*The head of a university

==Governmental positions==
===Head of government===
====Austria====
The Chancellor of Austria (&quot;&quot;), is the head of the Government of Austria. Since 2021, the Chancellor of Austria is Karl Nehammer.

====Germany====

The Chancellor of Germany (&#x27;) is the head of government in Germany. In German politics, the &#x27; is equivalent to a prime minister and is elected by the &#x27; (&quot;Federal Diet&quot;, the directly elected federal parliament) every four years on the beginning of the electoral period after general elections. Between general elections, the Chancellor (together with the whole cabinet) can only be removed from office by a &#x27; (constructive vote of no confidence), which consists of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; electing a successor.

Since 2021, the Chancellor of Germany is Olaf Scholz of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD)

The former German Empire, the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany had the equivalent position of &#x27; as the head of the executive. Between 1871 and 1918, the Chancellor was appointed by the German Emperor. During the Weimar Republic (1919-1933), the Chancellor was chosen by the President and stood under his authority. This continued (formally) during the first year of the Nazi regime until the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in 1934. Between 1934 and 1945, Adolf Hitler combined the roles of head of state, head of government and leader of the ruling party, being officially titled &quot;&#x27;&quot; (literally &quot;Leader and Chancellor&quot;).

====Switzerland====
=====Swiss Confederation=====
In Switzerland, the Chancellor (, , ) is not the political head of government, but rather its chief administrator as the Chief of Staff of the Swiss Federal Government. He is elected by the Swiss Federal Assembly (, , ) to head the Federal Chancellery () — the general staff of the seven-member executive Federal Council, the Swiss federal government. The Chancellor participates in the meetings of the seven Federal Councilors with a consultative vote and prepares the reports on policy and activities of the council to parliament (assembly). The chancellery is responsible for the publication of all federal laws.

=====Swiss cantons=====
In most Swiss cantons there is a State Chancellor who heads the central administrative unit of the cantonal government. In the Canton of Geneva, the first documents attesting to the existence of a Chancellor go back to the 12th century. In the 16th century the Chancery is officially described as the permanent secretariat of the executive and legislature. The first of these functions still constitutes an important part of its activities in Geneva and other cantons. In the canton of Bern, the Chancellor is elected by the Grand Council (i.e. Parliament) and has the task of supporting the Grand Council and the Executive Council in carrying out their tasks. The Chancellor directs the staff of the Executive Council, supports the President of the Government and the Executive Council in the performance of their duties, and usually participates as an advisor to the President of the Grand Council in Grand Council sessions.

===Foreign minister and diplomatic official===
In most countries of Latin America, the equivalents to &quot;chancellor&quot; (&quot;Canciller&quot; in Spanish and &quot;Chanceler&quot; in Portuguese) are commonly used to refer to the post of foreign minister. It is often used as a synonym to the full titles of the ministers of foreign affairs. Likewise, the ministry of foreign affairs in Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas is referred to as the &quot;Cancillería&quot; or in Portuguese-speaking Brazil as &quot;Chancelaria&quot;. However, in Spain the term &quot;canciller&quot; refers to a civil servant in the Spanish diplomatic service responsible for technical issues relating to foreign affairs. As to the German foreign service, the term &quot;Kanzler&quot; (chancellor) refers to the administrative head of a diplomatic mission.

===Functions related to justice and the law===
====Finland====
In Finland the Chancellor of Justice (&#x27;, &#x27;) supervises the legality of actions taken by the government and monitors the implementation of basic civil liberties. In this special function the chancellor also sits in the Finnish Cabinet, the Finnish Council of State.

====Sweden====
In Sweden the Chancellor of Justice or &#x27; acts as the Solicitor General for the Swedish Government. The office was introduced by Charles XII of Sweden in 1713. Historically there was also a Lord High Chancellor or &#x27; as the most senior member of the Privy Council of Sweden. There is in addition to this a University Chancellor or &quot;&quot;, who leads the National Agency for Higher Education.

====United Kingdom====
In the legal system of the United Kingdom, the term can refer to these officials:

*Chancellor of the Exchequer, the finance minister. As one of the Great Officers of State, the Chancellor is generally seen as second only to the Prime Minister in political potency. The title dates back to the Kingdom of England. When the term &quot;chancellor&quot; is used in British politics, it almost always refers to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. As &quot;Second Lord of the Treasury&quot;, the Chancellor has an official residence at 11 Downing Street, next door to the &quot;First Lord of the Treasury&quot;, the Prime Minister, at 10 Downing Street, in London.

*The Lord Chancellor (&quot;Lord High Chancellor&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Chancellor&quot;) is one of the oldest offices of state, dating back to the Kingdom of England, and older than Parliament itself. Theoretically, the Lord Chancellor is the &quot;Chancellor of Great Britain.&quot; A former office of &quot;Chancellor of Ireland&quot; was abolished in 1922, when all but Northern Ireland left the United Kingdom. The Lord Chancellor is the ceremonially second-highest-ranking non-royal subject in precedence (after the Archbishop of Canterbury). In addition to the now primarily ceremonial duties as Chancellor, the office is now invariably held by the Secretary of State for Justice, who is the political head of the Ministry of Justice. Previously, the Chancellor also held the roles of:
**Head of the English, but not Scottish, judiciary. In previous centuries, the Lord Chancellor was the sole judge in the Court of Chancery; when, in 1873, that court was combined with others to form the High Court, the Lord Chancellor became the nominal head of the Chancery Division. The Lord Chancellor was permitted to participate in judicial sittings of the House of Lords; he also chose the committees that heard appeals in the Lords. The &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Chancery Division was the Vice-Chancellor, and the role of choosing appellate committees was in practice fulfilled by the Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.
**Speaker of the House of Lords. These duties are now undertaken by the Lord Speaker. Jack Straw was the first Lord Chancellor to be a member of the House of Commons, rather than the House of Lords or its predecessor, the Curia Regis, since Sir Christopher Hatton in 1578.
*The Chancellor of the High Court is the head of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. Before 2005, the judge occupying this position was known as the Vice-Chancellor, the Lord Chancellor being the nominal head of the Division.

* In a county palatine or liberty, where a local lord exercised personal jurisdiction that elsewhere was reserved to the Crown, the head of the lord&#x27;s administration was often titled &quot;chancellor&quot;. Where the lord was a bishop (as with the Bishop of Ely in Isle of Ely or the Archbishop of York in Hexhamshire) then this officer was called the temporal chancellor to distinguish him from the bishop&#x27;s ecclesiastical chancellor. While palatine and liberty jurisdictions are practically obsolete, the ceremonial title chancellor remains in use:
**Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: in effect, as the sinecure position of a minister without portfolio, often given to senior politicians so they have a seat in the cabinet.
**Chancellor of Cornwall, Keeper of the Great Seal, second only to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries within the Duchy of Cornwall.

====Some states in the United States====
Some U.S. states, like Delaware, Tennessee, and Mississippi, still maintain a separate Court of Chancery with jurisdiction over equity cases. Judges who sit on those courts are called chancellors.
===Other governmental positions===
====Denmark====
In Denmark, the office of chancellor (or royal chancellor) seems to have appeared in the 12th century, and until 1660 it was the title of the leader of the state administration (a kind of a &quot;Home Office&quot; but often with foreign political duties). Often he appeared to be the real leader of the government. From 1660 until 1848, the title continued as &quot;Grand Chancellor&quot; or &quot;President of the Danish Chancellery&quot;, and was replaced in 1730 by the title &quot;Minister of Domestic Affairs&quot;.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, a Chancellor (&#x27;) directs the work of a ministry and coordinates institutions subject to the ministry, comparably to a Permanent Secretary in Great Britain. A ministry can also have one or several Vice-Chancellors (&quot;Asekantsler&quot;), who fulfill the duties of the Chancellor, when they are absent. The Chancellor of Justice (&#x27;, currently Ülle Madise) supervises the legality of actions taken by the government and monitors the implementation of basic civil liberties.

====United States====
In the United States, the only &quot;chancellor&quot; established by the federal government is the Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution, a largely ceremonial office held by the Chief Justice of the United States. As the Smithsonian is a research and museum system, its use of the title is perhaps best thought of as akin to a university&#x27;s chancellor.

==Ecclesiastical position==

The chancellor is the principal record-keeper of a diocese or eparchy, or their equivalent. The chancellor is a notary, so that he may certify official documents, and often has other duties at the discretion of the bishop of the diocese: he may be in charge of some aspect of finances or of managing the personnel connected with diocesan offices, although his delegated authority cannot extend to vicars of the diocesan bishop, such as vicars general, episcopal vicars or judicial vicars. His office is within the &quot;chancery&quot;. Vice-chancellors may be appointed to assist the chancellor in busy chanceries. Normally, the chancellor is a priest or deacon, although in some circumstances a layperson may be appointed to the post. In the eparchial curia a chancellor is to be appointed who is to be a presbyter (priest) or deacon and whose principal obligation, unless otherwise established by the particular law, is to see that the acts of the curia are gathered and arranged as well as preserved in the archives of the eparchial curia.

In England, the Consistory courts of the Church of England are each presided over by a Chancellor of the Diocese.

In the United Methodist Church, each Annual Conference has a Conference Chancellor, who is the Annual Conference&#x27;s legal adviser and representative. While the Annual Conference usually hires outside professional counsel in matters that require legal representation, that hiring and representation is done under the supervision, and with the consent, of the Conference Chancellor.

==Educational position==

A chancellor is the leader, either ceremonial or executive, of many public and private universities and related institutions.

The heads of the New York City Department of Education and the District of Columbia Public Schools, who run the municipally-operated public schools in those jurisdictions, carry the title of Chancellor. New York State also has a Chancellor of the University of the State of New York, the body that licenses and regulates all educational and research institutions in the state and many professions (not to be confused with the State University of New York, an actual institution of higher learning).

In a few instances, the term chancellor applies to a student or faculty member in a high school or an institution of higher learning who is either appointed or elected as chancellor to preside on the highest ranking judicial board or tribunal. They handle non-academic matters such as violations of behavior.

In Germany many heads of university administration carry the title &#x27; (Chancellor) while the academical heads carry the title &#x27; (Rector). In order to avoid any misunderstanding, the head of the German Federal Government is therefore usually called by the official title &#x27; (Federal Chancellor).

==Historical uses==
*Chancellor or Grand Chancellor is the common translation of the Chinese title &quot;zǎixiàng&quot; (Chinese: ), or &quot;chéngxiàng&quot; (), which in imperial China was the highest-ranking executive official serving under the emperor. See also: Chancellor of the Tang dynasty.
*The was the head of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; (Great Council of State) during and after the Nara period and briefly under the Meiji Constitution.
*The chancellor in the government of the Holy Roman Empire.
*There are two ancient Egyptian titles sometimes translated as chancellor. 
**The &quot;royal sealer&quot; (xtmtj-bity or xtmw-bity), a title which conveyed a certain rank at the royal court, attested since the First Dynasty (about 3000 BC). People holding the post include Imhotep and Hemaka.
**The &quot;Keeper of the Royal Seal&quot; (or &quot;overseer of the seal&quot; or &quot;treasurer&quot;—imy-r xtmt) was responsible for the state&#x27;s income. This position appears around 2000 BC. Officials holding the post include Bay or Irsu, Khety Meketre, and Nakhti.
*For centuries, the King of France appointed the Chancellor of France (), a Great Officer of the Crown, as an office associated with that of keeper of the seals. The &quot;chancelier&quot; was responsible for some judicial proceedings. During the reigns of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Louis Philippe, the Chancellor of France presided over the Chamber of Peers, the upper house of the royal French parliament.
*In the Kingdom of Poland from the 14th century, there was a royal chancellor (&quot;&quot;). In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), the four chancellors were among the ten highest officials of the state. Poland and Lithuania each had a Grand Chancellor and a Deputy Chancellor, each entitled to a senatorial seat, responsible for the affairs of the whole Kingdom, each with his own chancery. See Offices in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
*The chancellor was the highest non-hereditary rank in the government of the Duchy of Burgundy.
*In the Russian Empire, the chancellor was the highest rank of civil service as defined by the Table of Ranks and on the same grade as field marshal and General Admiral. Only the most distinguished government officials were promoted to this grade, such as foreign ministers Alexander Gorchakov and Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin.
*In Norway the Chancellor of Norway (modern Norwegian: &quot;Norges rikes kansler&quot;, &quot;Chancellor of Norway&#x27;s Realm&quot;) was the most important aide of the King of Norway during the Middle Ages. He issued laws and regulations, and was responsible for day-to-day administration of the kingdom. From 1270, the Chancellor resided in Bergen. Haakon V of Norway moved the Chancellor&#x27;s residence to Oslo; on 31 August 1314 the provost of St Mary&#x27;s Church became Chancellor on a permanent basis. He was given the Great Seal of the Realm &quot;for eternity.&quot; The Chancellors were originally chosen from the clergy. The position lost its importance after Jens Bjelke&#x27;s tenure, and was abolished in 1679.
* The Lord Chancellor of Scotland. 
*The &quot;canghellor&quot; of medieval Wales administered the peasantry of the king&#x27;s demesne and was charged with holding the king&#x27;s pleas and &quot;waste&quot;.
* A &quot;State Chancellor&quot; (German: Staatskanzler) was head of government in German-Austria after World War I and again after World War II in post-war Austria. Both times the State Chancellor was Karl Renner.

<text>was a monthly released microcomputer magazine in Japan, published by ASCII Corporation from 1977. It targeted business users who used a personal computer in their home and office, but it sometimes introduced computer games and computer music. It was also known as the written along with the title from Vol. 2 No. 4, and distinguish with the founded in 1997. The ASCII was rebranded as the in 2008, and ceased in 2010. Its news website and the Weekly ASCII are continuing as in 2016.

The , a computer game magazine, was first published as an extra issue of the ASCII in 1982, and the was branched from the LOGiN.

== Foundation ==

In 1976, NEC released the TK-80, a single-board computer kit, and it became popular among hobbyists in Japan. joined foundation of the first Japanese microcomputer magazine &quot;I/O&quot; (ja) as an editor when he was a student at the Waseda University. The I/O initially served information for assembled microcomputer systems with a few video game columns. Growing the video game market, it was shifted to a video game magazine. Against it, Nishi considered that personal computers must have far more potential than video games.

In April 1977, Nishi left the company, borrowed money from his grandmother and visited the West Coast Computer Faire held in San Francisco. Then, he realized the difference between Japan and the United States. &quot;In Japan, the TK-80 just caused a microcomputer craze. While in the United States, it seems the beginning of the personal computer revolution. Each persons try to face a personal computer, based on their own identity,&quot; he said.

On May 24, 1977, Nishi founded with his friends, and . They published the ASCII as a microcomputer magazine for business, while the I/O was for hobbyists. The first issue was sold 5,000 copies. It became one of the most popular computer magazine in 1980s in Japan. In 1999, the magazine reached its largest circulation of 170,000 copies.

<text>NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. NetBeans allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called &quot;modules&quot;. NetBeans runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris. In addition to Java development, it has extensions for other languages like PHP, C, C++, HTML5, and JavaScript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third party developers.

==History==


NetBeans began in 1996 as Xelfi (word play on &quot;Delphi&quot;), a Java IDE student project under the guidance of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology at Charles University in Prague. In 1997, Roman Staněk formed a company around the project and produced commercial versions of the NetBeans IDE until it was bought by Sun Microsystems in 1999. Sun open-sourced the NetBeans IDE in June of the following year. Since then, the NetBeans community has continued to grow. In 2010, Sun (and thus NetBeans) was acquired by Oracle Corporation. Under Oracle, NetBeans had to find some synergy with JDeveloper, a freeware IDE that has historically been a product of the company, by 2012 both IDEs were rebuilt around a shared codebase - the NetBeans Platform. In September 2016, Oracle submitted a proposal to donate the NetBeans project to The Apache Software Foundation, stating that it was &quot;opening up the NetBeans governance model to give NetBeans constituents a greater voice in the project&#x27;s direction and future success through the upcoming release of Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond&quot;. The move was endorsed by Java creator James Gosling. The project entered the Apache Incubator in October 2016.

==NetBeans IDE==
NetBeans IDE is an open-source integrated development environment. NetBeans IDE supports development of all Java application types (Java SE (including JavaFX), Java ME, web, EJB and mobile applications) out of the box. Among other features are an Ant-based project system, Maven support, refactorings, version control (supporting CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial and Clearcase).

=== Modularity ===
All the functions of the IDE are provided by modules. Each module provides a well-defined function, such as support for the Java language, editing, or support for the CVS versioning system, and SVN. NetBeans contains all the modules needed for Java development in a single download, allowing the user to start working immediately. Modules also allow NetBeans to be extended. New features, such as support for other programming languages, can be added by installing additional modules. For instance, Sun Studio, Sun Java Studio Enterprise, and Sun Java Studio Creator from Sun Microsystems are all based on the NetBeans IDE.

=== License ===
NetBeans IDE is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Previously, from July 2006 through 2007, it was licensed under Sun&#x27;s Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), a license based on the Mozilla Public License (MPL). In October 2007, Sun announced that NetBeans would henceforth be offered under a dual license of the CDDL and the GPL version 2 licenses, with the GPL linking exception for GNU Classpath. Oracle has donated NetBeans Platform and IDE to the Apache Foundation where it underwent incubation and graduated as a top level project in April 2019.

==Other products==
In an October 2016 interview with Gabriela Motroc, Oracle Vice President Bill Pataky stated that Oracle has a number of products that depend on NetBeans.
* Oracle Developer Studio, a commercial C, C++, Fortran and Java development environment is 100% based on NetBeans
* Oracle JDeveloper, an end-to-end development for Oracle&#x27;s technology stack takes major subsystems from NetBeans
* Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit, a modular, open source toolkit based on modern JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5 design and development principles uses NetBeans as its preferred IDE

==Integrated modules==
These modules are part of the NetBeans IDE:

The NetBeans Profiler is a tool for the monitoring of Java applications: It helps developers find memory leaks and optimize speed. Formerly downloaded separately, it is integrated into the core IDE since version 6.0.
The Profiler is based on a Sun Laboratories research project that was named JFluid. That research uncovered specific techniques that can be used to lower the overhead of profiling a Java application. One of those techniques is dynamic bytecode instrumentation, which is particularly useful for profiling large Java applications. Using dynamic bytecode instrumentation and additional algorithms, the NetBeans Profiler is able to obtain runtime information on applications that are too large or complex for other profilers. NetBeans also support Profiling Points that let developers profile precise points of execution and measure execution time.

===GUI design tool===

Formerly known as &quot;project Matisse&quot;, the GUI design-tool enables developers to prototype and design Swing GUIs by dragging and positioning GUI components.

The GUI builder has built-in support for JSR 295 (Beans Binding technology), but the support for JSR 296 (Swing Application Framework) was removed in 7.1.

===NetBeans JavaScript editor===
The NetBeans JavaScript editor provides extended support for JavaScript, Ajax, and CSS.

JavaScript editor features comprise syntax highlighting, refactoring, code completion for native objects and functions, generation of JavaScript class skeletons, generation of Ajax callbacks from a template; and automatic browser compatibility checks.

CSS editor features comprise code completion for styles names, quick navigation through the navigator panel, displaying the CSS rule declaration in a List View and file structure in a Tree View, sorting the outline view by name, type or declaration order (List &amp; Tree), creating rule declarations (Tree only), refactoring a part of a rule name (Tree only).

The NetBeans 7.4 and later uses the new Nashorn JavaScript engine developed by Oracle.

<doc id="214179" wikidata="Q425772" url="?curid=214179" title="Ministry (band)">
<text>Ministry is an American industrial metal band founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1981 by producer, singer, and instrumentalist Al Jourgensen. Originally a synth-pop outfit, Ministry evolved into one of the pioneers of industrial rock and industrial metal in the late 1980s. The band&#x27;s lineup has changed frequently, leaving Jourgensen as the sole remaining original member. Musicians who have contributed to the band&#x27;s studio or live activities include vocalists Nivek Ogre, Chris Connelly, Gibby Haynes, Burton C. Bell and Jello Biafra, guitarists Mike Scaccia, Tommy Victor and Cesar Soto, bassists Paul Barker, Paul Raven, Jason Christopher, Tony Campos and Paul D&#x27;Amour, drummers Jimmy DeGrasso, Bill Rieflin, Martin Atkins, Rey Washam, Max Brody, Joey Jordison and Roy Mayorga, keyboardist John Bechdel, and rappers and producers DJ Swamp and Arabian Prince.

Ministry attained commercial success during the late 1980s and early 1990s with three of their studio albums: &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; (1988), &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; (1989) and &quot;Psalm 69&quot; (1992). The first two were certified gold while &quot;Psalm 69&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Psalm 69&quot; was followed by &quot;Filth Pig&quot; (1996), which was a stylistic departure for the band, and earned Ministry its highest chart position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number nineteen, although it was met with mixed reception by critics and marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s commercial decline. The lackluster response to their next album, &quot;Dark Side of the Spoon&quot; (1999), resulted in Warner Bros. dropping Ministry from the label and the group entered an extended hiatus in early 2000s, when Jourgensen entered rehab after years of substance abuse.

Following Jourgensen&#x27;s recovery, Ministry resurfaced in 2003 with &quot;Animositisomina&quot;, which turned out to be their last album with Paul Barker, who would leave the band the same year after nearly two decades as an official member. Ministry returned to the thrash/industrial style of &quot;Psalm 69&quot; and released three albums critical of then-President of the United States, George W. Bush, dubbed the &quot;Bush Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; (2004), &quot;Rio Grande Blood&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Last Sucker&quot; (2007); these albums effectively revitalized the band&#x27;s commercial viability. Although &quot;The Last Sucker&quot; was initially intended to be the band&#x27;s final album, Ministry reformed in 2011 and released &quot;Relapse&quot; in the following year. On December 23, 2012, longtime guitar contributor Mike Scaccia died of a heart attack, and he was posthumously featured in the next Ministry album, &quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot; (2013), which was again supposed to be their last album, as Jourgensen thought his death was the end of the band. Despite this, Ministry has since released three more albums, &quot;AmeriKKKant&quot; (2018), &quot;Moral Hygiene&quot; (2021) and &quot;Hopiumforthemasses&quot; (2024), while tentative talks of a second breakup of the band, after at least one more album, have ensued since 2022.

Ministry has been nominated for six Grammy Awards and has performed at several music festivals, including the second annual Lollapalooza tour in 1992, co-headlining Big Day Out in 1995 and performing at Wacken Open Air thrice (in 2006, 2012 and 2016).

==History==
===Formation and early days (1981–1982)===
Ministry&#x27;s origins date to 1978, when Jourgensen moved from Denver to Chicago to attend the University of Illinois at Chicago. He was introduced to the local underground scene by his then-girlfriend, and in 1979 he replaced Tom Hoffmann on guitars in Special Affect, a post-punk group which featured vocalist Frank Nardiello (Groovie Mann of My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult), drummer Harry Rushakoff (Concrete Blonde) and bassist Marty Sorenson. Following Special Affect&#x27;s split in 1980, Jourgensen formed a short-lived band called the Silly Carmichaels, which featured members of the Imports and played two shows.

In 1981, Jourgensen met Jim Nash and Danny Flesher, co-founders and co-owners of the indie record label and shop Wax Trax! Records who recommended him as a touring guitarist for Divine. After playing a few concerts with the latter, Jourgensen began to write and record songs in his apartment, using a newly bought ARP Omni synthesizer, a drum machine, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder. He presented a demo to Jim Nash, who suggested Jourgensen record a single and form a touring band, which Jourgensen decided to call Ministry.

The first line-up of Ministry consisted of keyboardists Robert Roberts and John Davis, bassist Sorenson, and drummer Stephen George; Jourgensen auditioned several singers, all of whom were unsatisfactory, so he decided to perform vocals himself. Nash purchased recording sessions at Hedden West studios which resulted in a twelve-inch single featuring &quot;I&#x27;m Falling&quot; and instrumental track &quot;Primental&quot; on the A-side, with the song &quot;Cold Life&quot; on the B-side. The record was co-produced by Jay O&#x27;Roarke and Iain Burgess and released in late 1981 on Wax Trax! in the US. In March 1982, the single was licensed by British label Situation Two, with &quot;Cold Life&quot; as the A-side.

Ministry performed their debut concert on January 1, 1982 in the Chicago club Misfits, and, in the spring, commenced a tour of the Northeast and the Midwest, supporting Medium Medium, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, and Depeche Mode. Meanwhile, the &quot;I&#x27;m Falling / Cold Life&quot; single reached No. 45 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Disco chart with approximately 10,000 copies as of September 1982, and thus scoring Wax Trax!&#x27; first hit. The songwriter Aimee Mann played with Ministry in the early 80s.

=== &quot;With Sympathy&quot; and later Wax Trax! singles (1983–1985) ===

The band&#x27;s initial success drew the attention of Arista Records founder and chief executive Clive Davis, who offered them a deal, promising to make them &quot;the next Joy Division&quot;—a promise that Jourgensen later considered to be misleading. Signing a six-figure, two-album deal, the band—with Jourgensen and George comprising the official line-up—moved to record at the Syncro Sound studios in Boston, with producers Vince Ely (former drummer of Psychedelic Furs) and Ian Taylor (former assistant of Roy Thomas Baker), as well as keyboardists Roberts and Davis as session musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard on the W.S. recording/mixing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Jourgensen signed with them, Arista allegedly pressured him to change his image and sound to match that of popular synth-pop acts of the day such as The Human League, Duran Duran, and Depeche Mode. According to Jourgensen, &quot;[t]he label took me to a stylist, cut my hair, picked out my producer. They even wrote lyrics. We opened for Culture Club and the Police. I did it to the best of my ability, but kicking and screaming.&quot;

A 12-inch single containing the song &quot;Same Old Madness&quot; was recorded and planned for release, along with its accompanying music video. However, &quot;Same Old Madness&quot;—both the song and video—did not surface until 2014; instead, &quot;Work for Love&quot; was released in January 1983 and peaked No. 20 on the Hot Dance/Disco chart. Ministry&#x27;s debut album, entitled &quot;With Sympathy&quot; (also known as &quot;Work for Love&quot; in Europe), was finished around this time and issued in May, reaching No. 94 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On release, the album was supported by two more singles—&quot;Revenge&quot; (with a music video partially reworked from &quot;Same Old Madness&quot;) and &quot;I Wanted to Tell Her&quot; (a reworked version of &quot;Primental&quot;), and a supporting concert tour with the Police during the North American leg of their &quot;Synchronicity&quot; tour. During this time, Jourgensen met the members of Seattle-based band the Blackouts—namely bassist Paul Barker and drummer Bill Rieflin, as well their then-manager Patty Marsh, who later became Jourgensen&#x27;s wife from 1984 to 1995.

In spite of &quot;With Sympathy&quot;″s success, Jourgensen&#x27;s relations with Arista were acrimonious. Eventually, Jourgensen sent a demo tape featuring a cover version of Roxy Music&#x27;s song &quot;Same Old Scene&quot; before parting ways with Arista, suing the latter for violating contractual obligations. Since then, Jourgensen has expressed dislike for the &quot;With Sympathy&quot;-era, often providing different (and widely conflicting) explanations for his antipathy. In a 2004 interview, conducted by Mark Prindle, Jourgensen said that after signing with Arista, all artistic control of Ministry was &quot;handed over&quot; to other writers and producers. In his 2013 autobiography, Jourgensen gave a different explanation, saying that he was pressured by Arista management into producing his existing songs in the then-popular synthpop style, as a means of making them more commercially palatable. However, in the 1980s, Jourgensen said that when he discovered hardcore music, his musical direction simply changed; Jourgensen reiterated this point in 2012, and again in 2018. In 2019, he stated that the record was &quot;fine&quot;, only that it could have been a lot better without interference from the record company. In 2021, Jourgensen resurrected the story that Arista took full control of the production and songwriting process, made Jourgensen cut his hair and bought him a wardrobe of sharkskin suits, and this time added the label wanted Ministry to sound like Wham! (a band who were not successful in the US until 1984: one year after &quot;With Sympathy&quot; had been released). Jourgensen assumes a false English accent for all of the album&#x27;s songs, for which he also later expressed great dislike, though Patty Marsh stated in a 2013 interview &quot;...the English accent thing was more an homage to the bands he loved than anything else. He was not trying to come off as British. The Stones used a southern accent and no one crawled up their ass for it.&quot;, an explanation Jourgensen himself had also given in a prior, 1983 interview with Richard Skinner.

Departed from Arista, Jourgensen returned with Ministry on Wax Trax! in mid-1984. While working as a cashier in the Wax Trax! store, he continued to record new material. In autumn 1984, Ministry embarked on a new tour with a renewed line-up, supported by Belgian industrial dance act Front 242. During this tour, Sire Records co-owner Seymour Stein attended several gigs, offering the band a new deal; Jourgensen, recalling his negative experience with Arista, repeatedly declined, but eventually agreed to sign on the condition that Sire would provide resources to support the Wax Trax! imprint; as Jourgensen put it, &quot;it was kind of a personal sacrifice to keep that company rolling and allow them to keep signing bands.&quot; George left Ministry soon after this tour, disagreeing with Jourgensen over increased use of drum machines, and went on to form the short-lived band Colortone, and, much later, to pursue a record engineering career. Ministry released several singles throughout the summer of 1985—&quot;All Day&quot;, &quot;(Every Day Is) Halloween&quot; and &quot;The Nature of Love&quot;, as well as a reissue of &quot;Cold Life&quot;—which were cited as marking Jourgensen&#x27;s first attempt at injecting industrial elements into Ministry&#x27;s sound. Initially the B-side on &quot;All Day&quot; single, &quot;... Halloween&quot; became viewed as a goth anthem similar to Bauhaus (band)&#x27; &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;; &quot;The Nature of Love&quot;, which came out in June 1985, became Ministry&#x27;s final single on Wax Trax!; in July 1985, the band was shown as signed to Sire Records.

Ministry&#x27;s first release with Sire/Warner Bros. was the single &quot;Over the Shoulder&quot; in 1985, preceding the release of the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Twitch&quot;, in March 1986. &quot;Twitch&quot; was recorded and mixed largely at Southern Studios in London and Hansa Tonstudio in West Berlin during 1985, with the On-U Sound Records owner Adrian Sherwood and Jourgensen sharing co-production duties. Despite the contribution of several others (namely Belgian singer Luc van Acker and Sherwood&#x27;s Tackhead bandmate Keith LeBlanc), the album material was mainly performed by Jourgensen, listed as the band&#x27;s sole member. Some material, recorded during the &quot;Twitch&quot; sessions, was later used for LeBlanc&#x27;s and Sherwood&#x27;s other projects, most prominently LeBlanc&#x27;s solo album &quot;Major Malfunction&quot;.

On release, &quot;Twitch&quot; hit No. 194 in &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was supported by a US and Canadian tour. Jourgensen assembled a new touring line-up, featuring Roland Barker on keyboards, Paul Barker on bass and Bill Rieflin on drums. &quot;Twitch&quot; received mixed reviews, with a music critic Robert Christgau stating, &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Anglodisco clones meet Anglodisco renegade Adrian Sherwood and promptly improve themselves by trading in wimpy on arty&quot;; nevertheless, the album came to be viewed as a pivotal point in the band&#x27;s discography, as it signaled ongoing changes in Ministry&#x27;s sound. In later publications, Jourgensen credited Sherwood with giving his music an aggressive edge and providing production advice, but considered the record &quot;so Adrian Sherwood-influenced.&quot;

===Breakthrough success (1988–1993)===
After &quot;Twitch&quot;, Paul Barker became Jourgensen&#x27;s primary collaborator in Ministry; until his departure, he was the only person credited as a member of the band other than Jourgensen. Jourgensen then made another significant change to Ministry&#x27;s sound when he resumed playing electric guitar. With Rieflin on drums, Ministry recorded &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; (1988). The album continued their success in the underground music scene. &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; made use of synthesizers, keyboards, tape loops, jackhammering drum machines, dialogue excerpted from movies, unconventional electronic processing, and, in parts, heavy distorted electric guitar and bass.

The album was supported by a tour in 1988 and the singles and music videos for &quot;Stigmata&quot; and &quot;Flashback&quot;. &quot;Stigmata&quot; was also used in a key scene in Richard Stanley&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Hardware&quot;, although the band shown performing the song was Gwar.

The follow-up album, &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot;, was released in 1989. Due to the complex nature of the album&#x27;s drumming, a second drummer, Martin Atkins (formerly of Public Image Ltd. and Killing Joke), was hired. In addition to Atkins, a ten piece touring line-up was formed, consisting of Chris Connelly (keyboards and vocals), Skinny Puppy vocalist Nivek Ogre (vocals and keyboards), Joe Kelly (vocals and backing vocals) and guitarists Mike Scaccia, Terry Roberts, and William Tucker, with Jourgensen, Paul Barker and Rieflin serving as the group&#x27;s core members. This tour was documented on &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot;. Two opening tracks, &quot;Burning Inside&quot; and &quot;Thieves&quot;, were released as a commercial single; &quot;Burning Inside&quot; was accompanied by a music video.

After completing the Revolting Cocks tour in early 1991, Jourgensen and his bandmates began work on a follow-up to &quot;The Mind ... &quot; at Chicago Trax! studios, amidst problems brought on by growing substance abuse. During these initial sessions, Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers recorded vocals for what became &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot;, which hit No. 19 in the Modern Rock Tracks chart with approximately 128,000 copies as of mid-July 1992; considered Ministry&#x27;s first and biggest commercial hit, it built significant anticipation for their upcoming album, then titled &quot;The Tapes of Wrath&quot;. In an attempt to distance themselves from drugs and find fresh perspective, the band relocated from Chicago to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, to record at Royal Recorders studios for ten weeks. After considering the Wisconsin sessions a &quot;washout&quot;, they returned to Chicago to complete the album – now entitled &quot;Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs&quot;, after a chapter from Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Lies&quot; – by early May 1992, with only nine of about thirty songs written being chosen to feature. The album was influenced by speed and thrash metal, often being described as their fastest record by fans and critics. It was released on July 14, 1992 and peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Soon after, Ministry was invited to headline the second Lollapalooza tour with Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Soundgarden, among others, before commencing a tour of Europe and the US, with Helmet and Sepultura as supporting acts.

===Middle years, turmoil and Jourgensen&#x27;s drug addiction (1994–2001)===
In October 1994, Ministry performed at the eighth Bridge School Benefit charity concert, with sets of cover songs (most prominently Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot;) and one original song, &quot;Paisley&quot;, which was intended to be on their next album. After constructing a studio in Austin, Texas in 1993, the band proceeded to record a new album in July 1994. After refusing to perform drums on &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot;, Rieflin parted ways with Jourgensen midway through the recording process. Along with newly recruited Rey Washam (formerly of Scratch Acid, Didjits, and Rapeman) who performed the rest of the album&#x27;s drum work, Ministry performed as one of the headliners for Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s Big Day Out touring festival in January 1995. In spite of their growing success, Ministry was nearly derailed by drug problems and a series of arrests followed in August 1995. Completed at Chicago Trax Studios, &quot;Filth Pig&quot; was released in 1996. Musically, &quot;Filth Pig&quot; was more heavy metal than industrial, with synthesizers and samples mostly stripped from a mix that focused on conventional hard rock instrumentation.

The album&#x27;s songs were played mostly at slower tempos than those on their previous three LPs, giving it an almost doom metal feel. &quot;Filth Pig&quot; was supported with the singles/videos &quot;Reload&quot;, &quot;The Fall&quot;, &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot; and &quot;Brick Windows&quot; and with a tour in 1996 (the live performances were later anthologized on the &quot;Sphinctour&quot; album and DVD in 2002). Jourgensen has subsequently said that he was severely depressed during this period, that &quot;Filth Pig&quot; reflects this, and that he dislikes performing music from &quot;Filth Pig&quot;.

Ministry recorded their final studio album for Warner Bros. Records, &quot;Dark Side of the Spoon&quot; (1999), which they dedicated to William Tucker, who committed suicide earlier that year. For &quot;Dark Side of the Spoon&quot;, Ministry tried to diversify their sound by adding some melodic and synthetic touches to their usual electro-metal sound, along with some jazz influences, but the album was not well received, critically or commercially. However, the single &quot;Bad Blood&quot; appeared on the soundtrack album of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and was nominated for a 2000 Grammy award. During this period, Jourgensen had an infected toe amputated after accidentally stepping on a discarded hypodermic needle.

In the summer of 2000, Ministry was invited to that year&#x27;s Ozzfest; amidst a management changeover, they were dropped from the bill and replaced by Soulfly.

After Ministry were dropped from Warner Bros. in 2000, the label issued the 2001 collection &quot;Greatest Fits&quot;, which featured a new song, &quot;What About Us?&quot;. Ministry would later perform the song in a cameo appearance in the Steven Spielberg film &quot;&quot;. In 2000–2002, disputes with Warner Bros. Records resulted in the planned live albums &quot;Live Psalm 69&quot;, &quot;Sphinctour&quot; and &quot;ClittourUS&quot; on Ipecac Recordings being canceled. &quot;Sphinctour&quot; was released on Sanctuary Records.

===Jourgensen&#x27;s recovery from drug addiction and comeback (2001–2007)===
Around 2001, Jourgensen almost lost his arm when he was bitten by a venomous spider. By his own admission, Jourgensen was suicidal during this period and decided to call an acquaintance he had met years earlier; the acquaintance, Angelina Lukacin, helped Jourgensen give up his massive substance habit, which included heroin and cocaine &quot;speedballs&quot;, crack, LSD, various pharmaceuticals and as many as two full bottles of Bushmills whiskey per day (Lukacin and Jourgensen married soon after). Jourgensen and Barker, along with Max Brody who had joined as a saxophone player for the 1999 tour, focused on developing songs for a new record during 2001 and 2002, with the band issuing &quot;Animositisomina&quot; on Sanctuary Records in 2003. The sound was strongly heavy metal with voice effects, though it featured an almost-pop cover of Magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Light Pours Out Of Me&quot;. &quot;Animositisomina&quot;, compared to previous releases, sold poorly and singles for &quot;Animosity&quot; and &quot;Piss&quot; were canceled before they could be released.

Barker announced his departure from Ministry in January 2004. He stated that the trigger was his father dying while the band was wrapping up a summer tour in Europe, and also stated that his family life was his main focus at that particular time. Lukacin stated in 2013 that Jourgensen fell out with Barker over the band&#x27;s finances. Jourgensen continued Ministry with Mike Scaccia and various other musicians.
For Ministry&#x27;s next album, Jourgensen released the song &quot;No W&quot;, a song critical of then-U.S. President George W. Bush; an alternate version of the track was placed on the multi-performer compilation &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1&quot;. The follow-up LP, &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot; (2004), contained the most explicitly political lyrics Jourgensen had yet written, with songs played more crudely than on previous recordings, giving the album the most metal-oriented sound of their career. In 2006, the band released &quot;Rio Grande Blood&quot;, an LP on Jourgensen&#x27;s own 13th Planet Records. With Prong&#x27;s Tommy Victor and Killing Joke&#x27;s Paul Raven, the album featured an even heavier thrash metal sound drawing comparison to Slayer. The single &quot;Lieslieslies&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. It, along with another song on the album, &quot;The Great Satan&quot;, is also available as a downloadable content song for the 2008 video game &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;. In July 2007, the band released &quot;Rio Grande Dub&quot;, an album featuring remixes from the band&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Rio Grande Blood&quot; album.

What Jourgensen expected to be Ministry&#x27;s &quot;final&quot; album, &quot;The Last Sucker&quot; was released on September 18, 2007.

Paul Raven died on October 20, 2007, a month and two-days after the release of &quot;The Last Sucker&quot;, suffering an apparent heart attack shortly after arriving in Europe to commence recording for the French industrial band Treponem Pal near the Swiss border.

===Breakup and posthumous releases (2008–2011)===
Jourgensen remixed and co-produced Spyder Baby&#x27;s &quot;Bitter&quot;, which was released by Blind Prophecy Records in early 2008.

A song titled &quot;Keys to the City&quot;, which became the theme song for the Chicago Blackhawks, was released on March 5, 2008. In addition to this single, two albums of covers/remixes, &quot;Cover Up&quot; (April 1, 2008) and &quot;Undercover&quot; (December 6, 2010) were released. All of these releases are credited to Ministry and Co-Conspirators, since they feature collaborations between Jourgensen and other musicians.

Ministry&#x27;s &quot;farewell&quot; tour, the &quot;C-U-LaTour&quot;, started its North American leg on March 26, 2008 with Meshuggah performing as special guests and Hemlock as an opening act. They played their final North American shows in Chicago on May 10 and 12, 2008. The final date on the international leg of the tour was at the Tripod in Dublin, Ireland on July 18, 2008. During the performance, Jourgensen repeatedly reaffirmed it would indeed be the last Ministry show. Due to a large demand for tickets, an extra gig was added at the Tripod on July 19, 2008. The band again played to a full house. Ministry&#x27;s final song at this show (and ostensibly their last live performance) was a rendition of their cover version of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;.

&quot;Adios ... Puta Madres&quot;, a live album featuring material culled from the tour, was released in 2009 on CD and DVD.

A documentary film called &quot;Fix: The Ministry Movie&quot; was planned for release sometime in 2010. However, the release date was pushed back to early 2011. Eventually, it premiered at the Chicago International Movies &amp; Music Festival. Jourgensen sued the filmmaker, Doug Freel, for failing to fulfill a portion of the contract giving Jourgensen approval over the final cut, along with &quot;thousands of dollars&quot;. The lawsuit was dropped in July 2011. On July 21, the film was screened privately at the Music Box Theater in Los Angeles.

===Reunion, &quot;Relapse&quot;, death of Mike Scaccia and &quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot; (2011–2015)===
On August 7, 2011, Ministry announced they would reform and would play at Germany&#x27;s Wacken Open Air festival, set to take place on August 2–4, 2012. The reunion lineup featured Al Jourgensen on vocals, Mike Scaccia and Tommy Victor on guitars, Aaron Rossi on drums, John Bechdel on keyboards, and Tony Campos on bass.

Jourgensen told &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in August 2011 that Ministry was working on a new album called &quot;Relapse&quot;, which they hoped to release by Christmas. Regarding the sound of the new material, he explained, &quot;We&#x27;ve only got five songs to go. I&#x27;ve been listening to it the last couple of weeks and I wasn&#x27;t really in the mood, I was just taking it as a joke. Just to pass the time at first but [Mikey&#x27;s] raving about it. It&#x27;s like, dude c&#x27;mon, this is not about Bush, so ... that part&#x27;s over. The ulcers are gone and Bush is gone so it&#x27;s time for something new. I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I&#x27;ve ever done. Just because we did it as anti-therapy therapy against the country music we would just take days off and thrash faster than I&#x27;ve done in a long time, faster than Mikey&#x27;s done in a long time. He just did a Rigor Mortis tour and said it was easy compared to this Ministry stuff so it&#x27;s gonna be brutal and it&#x27;s gonna freak a lot of people out.&quot;

Ministry announced on their website that they entered the studio on September 1, 2011 with engineer Sammy D&#x27;Ambruoso to begin recording their new album. During the third webisode featuring behind-the-scenes footage from the making of &quot;Relapse&quot;, a release date of March 23, 2012 was announced.

On December 23, 2011, Ministry released &quot;99 Percenters&quot;, the first single from &quot;Relapse&quot;, and began streaming it on their Facebook page two days later. On February 24, 2012, Ministry released a second single, &quot;Double Tap&quot;, which was included in the April 2012 issue of the &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine. On March 23, 2012, &quot;Relapse&quot; was released; it was supported with &quot;Defibrillatour&quot;, a concert tour which lasted from that year&#x27;s June to August.

On December 23, 2012, guitarist Mike Scaccia died following an on-stage heart attack, while playing with his other band, Rigor Mortis. In an interview with &quot;Noisey&quot; in March 2013, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would break up again, explaining that he did not want to carry on without Scaccia. He explained, &quot;Mikey was my best friend in the world and there&#x27;s no Ministry without him. But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can&#x27;t do it without Mikey and I don&#x27;t want to. So yes, this will be Ministry&#x27;s last album.&quot; The album, titled &quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot;, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen stated that Ministry would tour in support of &quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot;, but would not record any more albums.

===&quot;AmeriKKKant&quot; and &quot;Moral Hygiene&quot; (2016–2022)===

In an April 2016 interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot;, Jourgensen stated that Ministry would make a follow-up to &quot;From Beer to Eternity&quot; &quot;if the circumstances are right.&quot; When asked in July about the possibility of a new album, Jourgensen stated, &quot;When I was asked [before], it was after Mikey passed and the entire media immediately starts asking me what is going to happen to Ministry. He wasn&#x27;t even buried yet. I thought, &#x27;Fuck you.&#x27; I was really pissed and really angry. I said, &#x27;Fuck Ministry and fuck you for asking.&#x27; They want to comment on Ministry when my best friend had died. It&#x27;s been more than two years now, and I got more ideas and I have done albums with Mikey and have done them without him. It&#x27;s time to get another record out. I have a bunch of songs written in my head. I wanted to have time to mourn before people start asking me about touring dates. It was sick. I was bombarded and email boxes were overloaded with &#x27;what are you going to do now?&#x27; It was kind of creepy.&quot;

By February 2017, Ministry had begun working on their fourteenth studio album, titled &quot;AmeriKKKant&quot;. The album, released on March 9, 2018, includes guest appearances from Burton C. Bell of Fear Factory, former N.W.A member Arabian Prince, DJ Swamp and Lord of the Cello. During their performance at the Blackest of the Black Fest in Silverado, California in May 2017, Ministry debuted their first song in four years, &quot;Antifa&quot;, which, at the time, was expected to appear on &quot;AmeriKKKant&quot;.

In an October 2018 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Jourgensen revealed that he had begun working on new material for Ministry&#x27;s fifteenth studio album. He explained, &quot;I have to get as many albums as I can done while Trump is still president, and then what am I going to do: write those crappy albums that I write while Democrats are president?&quot; A month later, media reports noted that Jourgensen had reconnected with former member Paul Barker after 15 years, hinting that the two might collaborate once again on the upcoming Ministry album.

In a 2019 interview with &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine, Jourgensen reaffirmed that he had been working on new material since 2018, and revealed that he had hired Paul D&#x27;Amour (formerly of Tool) as the new bassist of Ministry. The band – alongside Primus and Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals – opened for Slayer on the final North American leg of their farewell tour, which took place in November 2019.

In December 2019, the band released a visual history coffee table book, &quot;Ministry: Prescripture&quot;, with author Aaron Tanner.

In January 2020, Ministry announced the &quot;Industrial Strength Tour&quot; would start in 2020, with drummer London May of Samhain, which would feature both KMFDM and Front Line Assembly as guests. The tour was to begin on 1 July and extend until August. In May 2020, the band announced that they postponed all dates on the Industrial Strength Tour until 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 25–date tour, with KMFDM and Front Line Assembly, was scheduled to take place in March and April 2021; the trek was once again postponed to the fall of 2021, this time with Helmet replacing KMFDM, who were unable to partake in the tour because of restrictions caused by the COVID in their native Germany. On September 24, 2021, Ministry announced that The Industrial Strength tour had been postponed once more because of the pandemic, with the tour now scheduled to take place in March and April 2022, and the Melvins and Corrosion of Conformity replacing Front Line Assembly and Helmet as special guests.

On January 17, 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; released an exposé on guitar player Sin Quirin, detailing accounts of Quirin&#x27;s alleged behavior including sexual relationships with underage females while touring in San Antonio, TX, Portland, OR, and Tacoma, WA, in the early 2000s. In May 2021, Quirin announced via Facebook that he was leaving Ministry.

On March 24, 2020, longtime drummer Bill Rieflin died of cancer, which had been kept private. Rieflin had joined King Crimson in 2013, and his death was announced March 25 by Robert Fripp via Facebook.

On April 24, 2020, one month after Rieflin&#x27;s passing, Ministry released their first song in two-and-a-half years, &quot;Alert Level&quot;, which was expected to appear on the band&#x27;s then-upcoming fifteenth studio album.

In May 2021, the band announced that drummer Roy Mayorga has rejoined the band.

On July 8, 2021, Ministry released &quot;Good Trouble&quot; as the first single from their fifteenth studio album &quot;Moral Hygiene&quot;, which was released on October 1.

===&quot;Hopiumforthemasses&quot;, reunion with Paul Barker and upcoming final album (2022–present)===
About two weeks after the release of &quot;Moral Hygiene&quot;, Jourgensen revealed that another Ministry album would &quot;be out in 6-8 months.&quot; In a March 2022 interview with Metal Edge, Jourgensen said that the album would feature an arena rock-styled sound, and he also hinted at one final Ministry album. He reiterated his idea of disbanding Ministry in 2023, expecting the last Ministry material to be a re-recording of their first album &quot;With Sympathy&quot;.

In early 2023, Ministry announced a tour with Gary Numan and Front Line Assembly, which lasted from April 20 to May 13, 2023. The band performed a cover of Ricky&#x27;s Hand by Fad Gadget with Numan, on two nights.

In April 2023, the band played a new song live titled &quot;Goddamn White Trash&quot; from their then-upcoming album &quot;Hopium for the Masses&quot;, which was planned to be released on August 4. However, it was announced that the album (with the new title &quot;Hopiumforthemasses&quot;) would be released on March 1, 2024.

In the fall of 2023, Ministry, along with Filter, opened the Freaks on Parade tour, headlined by Alice Cooper and Rob Zombie. The tour spanned one month, lasting from August 24, 2023 until September 24, 2023, visiting 19 venues across the United States and Canada. After the Freaks on Parade tour ended, Ministry announced that they would be touring with Gary Numan and Front Line Assembly again for the &quot;Hopiumforthemasses&quot; Tour, which began on February 27 and ended on April 5, 2024.

In February 2024, Jourgensen confirmed in an interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot; that Ministry intended to release one final album and then disband, declaring, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a good time to stop.&quot; The band entered the studio in June 2024 to begin work on their seventeenth studio album, and confirmed that same month they were reuniting with multi-instrumentalist Paul Barker 21 years after the latter&#x27;s departure. On October 7, 2024, Ministry announced that they were re-signed to Cleopatra Records for the release of their final studio album.

Ministry&#x27;s next studio project, &quot;The Squirrely Years Revisited&quot;, will be released on March 28, 2025; it is a collection of re-recorded material from the band&#x27;s early days (including re-recorded songs off their first two albums &quot;With Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Twitch&quot;) and &quot;comes ahead of the final new studio album from Ministry in 2026, a record that has Jourgensen teaming up with Paul Barker once again.&quot;

==Artistry==

Ministry&#x27;s experimentation, stylistic variation and changes during its career cross several genres of popular music. The band is most commonly categorized as industrial metal and industrial rock. Other genres include EBM/industrial dance, techno-rock, thrash metal, and electro-industrial. Their early output has been variously described as new wave, synth-pop, dance-pop, electronic dance, and dark wave. In the April 1989 issue of &quot;Spin Magazine&quot;, an author Michael Corcoran labelled the band as &quot;industrial disco&quot;; in 1994, writer Simon Glickman used this term as well. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey states that, previous to Nine Inch Nails&#x27; rise to mainstream popularity, &quot;Ministry did more than any other band to popularize industrial dance music, injecting large doses of punky, over-the-top aggression and roaring heavy metal guitar riffs that helped their music find favor with metal and alternative audiences outside of industrial&#x27;s cult fan base.&quot; Despite frequent descriptions of the band&#x27;s music as industrial, Jourgensen disputed the use of this tag in several publications since the early 1990s, preferring instead to identify his style as &quot;aggro&quot;, and, much later &quot;industrious&quot;.

Despite Jourgensen&#x27;s dislike of touring, Ministry is noted for their live performances, featuring extended versions of songs (as evidenced on &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot;) and disturbing visual imagery. MTV also recognized the band as an influential heavy metal act, highlighting the use of sampling during their heyday. Alternative Press included Ministry in their 1996 list of 100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years, stating that they merged &quot;metal, samples, synths, and the 100-mph sound of urban paranoia, they pretty much created industrial music as we know it.&quot; Jourgensen revealed in 2008 that Ministry music is mostly on drop D and standard E tuning.

==Related projects==
Jourgensen, with former and current bandmates, has been active in a number of musical projects besides Ministry. Foremost of these was the Revolting Cocks, founded by Jourgensen, Richard 23 and Luc van Acker during Ministry and Front 242&#x27;s tour in 1984. Since its formation, the band has released a number of records, and has gone through several line-up changes. 1000 Homo DJs, a project purposed for outtakes from &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; and &quot;The Mind ... &quot;, has recorded a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Supernaut&quot;, featuring Nine Inch Nails frontman and one-time Revolting Cocks touring member Trent Reznor. PTP, a project led by Jourgensen and Barker, included the assistance from Nivek Ogre on one occasion, and Connelly on another, and notably provided the song &quot;Show Me Your Spine&quot; featured in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;RoboCop&quot;. Other notable projects include Pailhead with Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat and Fugazi, Lard with former Dead Kennedys lead singer Jello Biafra, and Acid Horse with Cabaret Voltaire members Richard H. Kirk and Stephen Mallinder. Buck Satan and the 666 Shooters, a country project led by Jourgensen, released the sole album, &quot;Bikers Welcome Ladies Drink Free&quot;, in 2012 through 13th Planet Records. Surgical Meth Machine, a speed metal project originally tributed to guitarist Mike Scaccia

Barker has released several solo recordings under various monikers, including &quot;Age of Reason&quot; and &quot;Chicks &amp; Speed: Futurism&quot; as Lead into Gold in 1990, &quot;The Perfect Pair&quot; as Flowering Blight in 2008, and &quot;Fix This!!!&quot;, an accompanying soundtrack of &quot;Fix: The Ministry Movie&quot;, under his own name in 2012. Through the 2000s, Barker formed Pink Anvil with Max Brody and U.S.S.A. with the Jesus Lizard guitarist Duane Denison. Brody and Scaccia have also released materials as Goobersmoochers via Brody&#x27;s Bandcamp site.

<text>Defense on Aruba is the responsibility of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands Military forces that protect Aruba include the Royal Netherlands Navy, the Netherlands Marine Corps and the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard. There is also a small indigenous militia (ARUMIL, literally &quot;Aruban militia&quot;) of about platoon strength (stationed at the Marine Corps Barracks Savaneta).

==Early history==
Until 1929, there were hardly any military forces present on the Dutch Antilles including Aruba. On 28June 1929 the Venezuelan rebel leader Rafael Simón Urbina attacked Curaçao and took several hostages amongst whom was the governor and the garrison commander Borren. They were all taken to Venezuela where Urbina had hoped to overthrow the government. His attempt failed and Urbina was taken prisoner. All hostages were returned to Curaçao. Three Dutch soldiers were killed in action during this attack. After Urbina&#x27;s attack, the Dutch government decided to station one naval ship (&quot;stationsschip&quot;) in the Antilles permanently. It also decided to raise a volunteer defense corps on both Curaçao and Aruba (Vrijwilligerskorps Curaçao (VKC) and Vrijwilligerskorps Aruba (VKA)). After World War II, the VKC and VKA were redesignated Antiliaanse Militie (ANTMIL) which still exists on Curaçao. When Aruba obtained its independence within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1986, the ANTMIL on Aruba was redesignated Arubaanse Militie or ARUMIL.

==World War II==

For the Kingdom of the Netherlands, World War II started with the invasion of the Netherlands by Germany on May 10, 1940. Because of the Lago oil refinery at San Nicolas, Aruba was deemed strategically important to the allied war effort and that same night 180 French marines arrived on Aruba to assist the local military. On July 6 they were replaced by 120 British soldiers who in turn were replaced by the 4th Battalion Queens Own Cameron Highlanders in September. In December an artillery unit from the Dutch East Indies Army was sent to Aruba to improve the defences. Also in December military service became compulsory and the VKA grew in size. All soldiers were billeted near the oil refinery at Savaneta, the present location of the Marine barracks. Early 1942, the British troops were replaced by over a thousand American soldiers. The Dutch coastal batteries on Aruba and Curaçao engaged U-boats at least three times during World War II, during the attack on Aruba in February 1942 and again during the bombardment of Curaçao. Later a Dutch battery on Curaçao engaged another U-boat when it attacked an oil tanker sailing off the island. None of the batteries hit their targets.

==Present==

The Netherlands Armed Forces deploy both ground and naval units in the Caribbean with some of these forces based on Aruba. These forces include:

* 32 Infantry Company of the Netherlands Marine Corps on Aruba;
* a Fast Raiding Interception and Special Forces Craft (FRISC) troop (fast boats);
* a guardship, normally a , from the Royal Netherlands Navy on station in the Caribbean on a rotational basis plus the support ship operating out of Curaçao;
* ARUMIL militia elements;
* Elements of a Royal Marechaussee brigade of the Armed Forces.

Additionally, the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard, under the direction of the Royal Netherlands Navy commander in the Caribbean, maintains a significant presence.

ARUMIL soldiers are volunteers and are led by their own NCOs and officers. The ARUMIL are trained by Netherlands Marine Corps. When basic training is completed every soldier in the ARUMIL becomes an Aruban Marine. Basic training and selection takes place on Aruba, further training takes place in either the Netherlands or Curaçao. ARUMIL officers have to complete the regular Netherlands Marine Corps Officers training course (Praktische opleiding tot officier der mariniers). The ARUMIL platoon works closely with the Dutch Marines company stationed at Aruba. The 32nd Raiding Squadron also performs training exercises on Aruba, sometimes together with marines of the United States.

An increase of instability in South America, specifically Venezuela, made the Netherlands heighten the security level and increase monitoring of the Dutch island in cooperation with the United States.

<text>Transport in Aruba is facilitated by road, air, and rail. Aruba features a well-established road network, with the majority of the roads being paved. However, as one ventures towards the interior of the island, the prevalence of paved roads decreases, giving way to more rugged terrain. Conversely, coastal areas typically offer-well maintained paved roads. Aruba&#x27;s road network covers a total distance of about , with remaining unpaved. 

== Public transport ==

The department of public transport, also known in as &quot;Departamento di Transporte Publico (DTP)&quot; in Papiamento or &quot;Dienst Openbaar Personen Vervoer (DOPV)&quot; in Dutch, is the government agency overseeing various modes of public transportations, including taxis, buses, tour buses, and rental vehicle, such as cars, scooters, quads, races, and motorcycles). All public transportation services are required to obtain a transportation permit through DOPV.

=== Buses ===
Arubus N.V. is the major public transportation company and is owned by the Government of Aruba. It offers transportation services across large parts of the island, operating a fleet of approximately 29 buses. Mini-buses are also a common sight. There are two primary Arubus station located in Oranjestad and San Nicolas. 

As per the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the number of registered buses has remained relatively stable from 2015 to 2021. In 2015, there were 129 registered buses, and this number increased to 140 by 2021. In contrast to buses, the count of registered tour buses, has experienced a rapid increase, growing from 94 to 312.

Data from the CBS indicates a decline in the total number of bus passengers (excluding school children) from 2010 to 2021. In 2010, a total of 2,719,083 passengers were transported, whereas in 2021, the number decreased to 1,129,944. 

== Air transport ==

Travelers have the option to take short plane flights from Queen Beatrix International Airport. The major local airlines, Divi Divi Air and EZ Air, operate multiple daily flights between Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire. However, flying between the islands can be costly, and there have been persistent challenges. Since the 1970s, at least fifteen airlines, both local and from Europe, have made attempts in this regard. Local airlines, such as Air Aruba, have faced financial issues, leading to bankruptcies over the years.

The &quot;Antilliaanse Luchtvaartmaatschappij (ALM),&quot; or Antillean Airline, held the skies for 37 years, marking its status as the longest-running airline in the region. As a government-owned entity, it enjoyed a monopoly over the islands. ALM&#x27;s reach extended to 26 flight destinations, with the largest portion (five) in Venezuela. In 2001, circumstances compelled it to halt its operations.

Director Edwin Kelly of the &quot;Directie Luchtvaart Aruba&quot;, or Aruba Aviation Directorate, highlights significant challenges: insufficient considerations of market changes. Kelly point out that the Venezuelan market was robust, as was the Cuban market, but liberalization has halted the latter. These markets are temporary and subject to fluctuations. Hence, Kelly emphasizes the need for a long-term strategy, not only for airline establishment but also for long-term viability and sustainability. However, it is crucial for the government to protect the route and maintain the connection between the islands.

Commercial and non-commercial total landings have seen a decline, dropping from 23,765 in 2015 to 11,294 in 2021. Notably, non-commercial landings have experienced the most significant decrease, falling from 6,219 to 986, in contrast to commercial landings, which decreased from 17,546 to 10,308.

== Water transport ==
=== Ports and harbours ===
Aruba has three ports or harbors: Barcadera, Oranjestad, and San Nicolas. The Aruba Ports Authority manages the operations of the ports in Barcadera and Oranjestad. The government has regained control of the former Valero Aruba Refining Company port. Ports in Barcadera and San Nicolas primarily serve industrial and oil-related purposes.

=== Ferries ===
On 15 August 1973, a Venezuelan ferry from La Vela port in Coro made its inaugural journey to Aruba. By April 1975, the ferry has faced challenges in Aruba related to freight transportation and labor union issues. These difficulties have escalated to the extent that the ferry&#x27;s management was contemplating the possibility of excluding Aruba from its sailing schedule. 

In 2017, based on research of ICASUS Caribbean, the possibility of a &quot;fast ferry&quot; between the ABC-islands would be economically viable. However, challenges related to crime and illegal immigration are also recognized. Additionally, finding a suitable ferry represents another obstacle. Notably, there are few fast ferries capable of operating in this region due to the strong ocean currents. 

Currently, there are no ferry services between Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire and Venezuela. The only way to travels between these destinations is by air. 

== Rail transport ==
=== Industrial railways ===
Historically, Aruba had three industrial narrow-gauge railways, although they are no longer in operation. These railways served various industrial purposes. The first railway used for the guano mines of the Aruba Phosphate Company in Seroe Colorado. The other two were primarily associated with for the oil industry. One belonged to the Lago Oil and Transport Company, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, and the other was owned by the Arend Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell.

=== Trams ===
In 2012, a significant development in Aruba&#x27;s transportation infrastructure occurred with the inauguration of a tramway line in Downtown Oranjestad. This addition marked notable expansion of public transportation options in the area and aimed to enhance mobility within the city.

<doc id="214185" wikidata="Q2257060" url="?curid=214185" title="Demographics of Aruba">
<text>This is a demography of the population of Aruba, including population density, ethnicity, nationality language use, education level, age, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Having poor soil and aridity, Aruba was largely detached from plantation economics and the slave trade. In 1515, the Spanish transported the entire population to Hispaniola to work in the copper mines; most were allowed to return when the mines were tapped out. The Dutch, who took control a century later, left the Arawaks to graze livestock, using the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean. Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. 

The population is estimated to be 75% mixed European/Amerindian/African, 15% Black and 10% other ethnicities (Asians, Europeans etc.). Although no full-blooded Aboriginals remain, the features of many islanders clearly indicate their genetic Arawak heritage. The population is descended from the Caquetío Indians, Dutch settlers, Spanish settlers, Afro-Caribbeans and to a lesser extent from the Portuguese, Germans, French, British, Italians, Arabs, Jewish, East-Indians, Chinese, Indonesians, Filipinos and various other diasporas who have settled the island over time. 

Aruba&#x27;s population is very ethnically diverse, multiracial, international and multicultural, descending from a mix of various people groups and being home to over 140+ nationalities. The population of the island has grown significantly in the last 50 years, primarily due to immigration, with an estimated 38.7% of Aruba&#x27;s population being foreign-born (as of 2024). In recent decades, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring South-American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by higher paying jobs, namely in the tourism industry. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced and passed to help control the growth of the population by restricting foreign workers to a maximum of three years residency on the island. 

There is a significant Latin-American population and presence on the island. Many of Aruba&#x27;s families are partially or fully descended from Venezuelan immigrants. Due to Aruba&#x27;s close proximity to Colombia, many Colombians and their descendants live in Aruba as well. Communities of Dominicans, Ecuadorians and Peruvians can also be found on the island. A sizable minority of the population is descended from various Caribbean nations and territories, mainly from the British West-Indies. There has also been recent immigration from Europe and North-America to the island, namely from the Netherlands and to a lesser extent the United States. Many descendants of Asian immigrants and contract workers live in Aruba as well, most notably those of Chinese, Filipino, Indian and Javanese descent. 

Most people on Aruba are multilingual, being able to speak three to four (or more) languages. The two official languages of Aruba are Dutch and the pre-dominant, national language Papiamento. Papiamento is a Portuguese-based creole, formed primarily from 16th century Portuguese with influences from Spanish, Dutch and several other languages. Spanish and English are also widely known and spoken due to proximity to Latin-America and North-American tourism. There are also smaller communities of speakers of other languages on the island, such as Portuguese, French and Chinese.

Children in Aruba are known to start school by the age of four and are commonly known to be multilingual by this time. Although the official languages of Aruba are Papiamento and Dutch, English and Spanish is taught through education when reaching the sixth grade. French is also taught as an optional subject in higher levels of education. 

Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion, practiced by around 75% of the population. Various Protestant denominations are also present on the island. Various other religions and denominations are also practiced on the island by small communities.

==Population==
The estimated population as of is , per . Most of the population is of mixed ancestry, including Europeans, Caquetío Indians and Africans (in some cases, Asians also). Between 1985 and 1987, the population declined due to emigration, but in 1990 this trend was reversed due to the development of the oil and tourism industries.

===Structure of the population===



==Vital statistics==

==Ethnic groups==

The population is estimated to be 75% mixed European/Amerindian/African, 15% Black and 10% other ethnicities and ethnic groups (including Asians and Europeans).

In 2019, recently arrived Venezuelan refugees were estimated to number around 17,000, accounting for some 15% of the island’s population.

<doc id="214186" wikidata="Q1864542" url="?curid=214186" title="Economy of Aruba">
<text>The economy of Aruba is an open system, with tourism currently providing the largest percentage of the country&#x27;s income. Because of tourism&#x27;s rapid growth in the last 80 years, related industries like construction have also flourished in Aruba. Other primary industries include oil refining and storage, as well as offshore banking. Despite the island&#x27;s low rainfall in the past year, the people have proven that Aruba&#x27;s soil is full of nutrients and many crops do amazingly well in the soil. Many more locals have started participating more to horticulture, permaculture and agriculture. Creating a start to an internal economy. Aloe cultivation, livestock, and fishing also contribute to Aruba&#x27;s economy. In addition, the country also exports art and collectibles, machinery, electrical equipment, and transport equipment. Aruba&#x27;s small labor force and low unemployment rate have led to many unfilled job vacancies, despite sharp rises in wage rates in recent years.

With such a large part of its economy dependent on tourism, a few political parties are striving to increase business in other sectors to protect against possible industry slumps to prevent another economic shut-down like what was experienced during 2020. Their current focus is on expanding into the cannabis and hemp industry, transitioning to a circular economy, creating an internal economy in the primary sector, technology, and finance.

== History ==
Unlike many Caribbean islands, a plantation economy never developed on Aruba due to its arid climate. Early Spanish explorers considered the island of little value, partly because the poor soil made growing crops difficult and partly because their attempts to find gold turned up empty-handed. However, long after the Dutch obtained control of Aruba, they found the gold the Spanish had been seeking.

=== Gold ===
With the discovery of gold on Aruba in 1800, mining became the island&#x27;s foremost industry. Aruba&#x27;s economy boomed. However, by 1916 the gold supply had mostly been tapped out, making it impossible for companies to turn a profit. As the gold mining industry waned, so did the economy.

=== Aloe ===
First planted on Aruba in 1850, aloes thrive in its desert conditions. With a healthy demand for aloe products, it became an important part of Aruba&#x27;s economy. In fact, for many years, the country was aloe&#x27;s top exporter. But over the years, many aloe fields were replaced by buildings, diminishing its production and exports declined.

The oldest company on the island, Aruba Aloe, has recently instituted changes in the hopes of becoming Aruba&#x27;s leading product manufacturer. It built a new, modern facility, an aloe museum, and designed new packaging. Although most of their product line sells in the national market, a 2005 exporting deal with a U.S. company and sales through their website have increased their international market.

=== Oil ===
Despite setbacks caused by the troubled gold and aloe industries, Aruba&#x27;s economy didn&#x27;t suffer long. Because of its location near Venezuela, the island became an attractive spot for oil refineries. The Lago Oil and Transport Company, owned by Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon), opened in 1929 near the transshipping port of San Nicolaas. Following in their footsteps, the Eagle Oil refinery opened soon after in Oranjestad. By early 1939, a more consistent supply of crude oil was achieved, allowing the refineries to operate at full capacity. Over the next few decades, the oil industry took over as Aruba&#x27;s primary economic force.

With the United States entry into World War II in 1942 the demand for aviation gasoline further increased and considerable expansion was done at the Lago refinery soon after the United States entered the war. With this expansion, Lago became one of the largest refineries in the world, only bested by Royal Dutch Shell Isla refinery on Curaçao, and a major producer of petroleum products for the Allied war efforts. The importance of the Lago refinery was well known to the German High Command and on February 16, 1942 the Lago refinery was attacked by the . Due to mistakes by the German deck gunner the refinery was not damaged but three of the Lago tankers were torpedoed in San Nicolaas harbour.

The Eagle Oil refinery shut down and was dismantled in the late 1950s. But the Lago refinery kept going until 1985, when the demand for oil fell and Exxon closed it. In 1991, the Coastal Corporation bought it, scaled down operations, and reopened it. Coastal later sold the refinery to Valero Energy Corporation in 2004. Its reopening didn&#x27;t raise Aruba&#x27;s oil industry to its previous heights although it did revive that sector and continued to be a key contributor to the country&#x27;s economy until 2009 when it was closed. In December 2010, Valero Energy announced plans to reopen the refinery.

=== Tourism ===

In 1947, Aruba&#x27;s government founded a tourist board to explore the possibility of developing a tourism industry. Several years later, cruise ships began to dock in Oranjestad, Aruba&#x27;s capital city. The island&#x27;s first luxury hotel was built in 1959, giving the fledgling industry a good start. Over the years, tourism grew and helped create a prosperous economy.

As the oil industry waned, tourism increased in importance. The government offered fiscal incentives to spur growth of hotels and other tourist-oriented businesses. Their efforts resulted in a steady and rapid rise in tourism. When a surplus of these jobs couldn&#x27;t be filled, they placed a one-year moratorium on new hotel construction and new tourist corporations.

Following the September 11 attacks, tourism temporarily declined because of grounded flights and travel fears. Aruba stepped up its visible security force in tourist areas to heighten safety and reassure visitors. After a short time, tourism rebounded strongly.

Another potential threat to the industry occurred in 2005, when the May 30 disappearance of vacationing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway made international news. Claiming that Aruban authorities weren&#x27;t taking the case seriously enough, her mother and the Governor of Alabama called for a nationwide boycott of Aruba. However, the U.S. federal government didn&#x27;t back the proposed boycott. Aruba&#x27;s reputation as one of the safest islands in the Caribbean may have helped it overcome any negative stigma caused by the case. The amount of tourism in June 2005 actually rose by 9% from the previous year.

<doc id="214187" wikidata="Q3117376" url="?curid=214187" title="Geography of Aruba">
<text>The geography of [[Aruba]], located at the juncture of the South American and Caribbean tectonic plates, has been shaped by a complex interplay of geological processes. From its flat expanses to its rugged coastlines, Aruba&#x27;s geography and geology reveal the island&#x27;s geographical diversity and its underlying geological formations, offering a comprehensive understanding of Aruba&#x27;s terrain and environmental dynamics of this Caribbean destination.

== Geography ==
Aruba (the westernmost island among the ABC Islands and of the Leeward Antilles) is situated in a unique geological location, right at the boundary between the South American and Caribbean tectonic plates. It is located north of the Venezuela coast and northwest of Curaçao. Aruba covers a total area of and a coast line of . This region is characterized by a complex fault system where the Caribbean Plate moves westward in relation to South America. Aruba is the westernmost island in the Aruba-La Blanquilla Chain, a series of small islands and atolls located along the Venezuelan continental border.

Aruba, as well as the rest of the ABC islands and also Trinidad and Tobago, lies on the continental shelf of South America, and is thus geologically considered to lie entirely in South America.

=== Landscape ===
The geography of Aruba is characterized by a relatively flat to gently rolling terrain with some low hills. The highest point on the island is Jamanota, reaching almost in elevation. There are three distinct types of landscapes on the island.

In the western part, features a gently sloping plain with shallow dry valleys. This area is flanked by a zone of horizontal bedded to slightly seaward-dipping limestone rocks on its western side. Moving towards the central part of the island, the terrain becomes more rugged. This region developed in the outcrop area of the metamorphosed volcanic rocks of the Aruba Lava Formation (ALF), and it features east-to-west running valleys controlled by faults. The ALF cover an area of approximately . The southeastern part of Aruba is predominantly defined by Neogene and younger limestone formations. Along the eastern coast, near Boca Grandi and Seroe Colorado, well-developed Quaternary terraces can be observed. Forereef deposits line the south and southwestern coast between Ceru Colorado and the urban center of Oranjestad.

The arid landscape in Aruba is not solely a product of its climate but is also a consequence of extensive deforestation and exploitation during the Spanish colonization of the island. Consequently, certain crops, such as aloe vera, thrive in this environment, due to the high calcium-rich soil known as liming. As of 2022, Aruba only has 2.3% of forest-covered land area and only 0.5% of protected natural area. In Aruba forest cover is around 2% of the total land area, equivalent to 420 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, which was unchanged from 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 420 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 0 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 0% of the forest area was found within protected areas.

==== Elevations ====
Aruba is predominantly characterized by its flat terrain. However, there are notable exceptions that add diversity to its landscape. Two well-known rock formations, the Ayo and Casibari Rock Formations.

In contrast, the northern coast of Aruba features a more hilly topography, particularly within the Arikok National Park. The island&#x27;s highest point, Jamanota, stands at a modest elevation of above sea level, while Arikok itself reaches . Another prominent landmark, Hooiberg, rises to . Despite not being the island&#x27;s highest peak, Hooiberg appears as such due to its location in the flat surroundings. It is a recognizable feature that can be observed from nearly every point on the island.

==== Coastal form ====
In stark contrast to the southern shores, Aruba&#x27;s northern sea is typically characterized by rough waters with a deep blue hue, rocky terrain and consists mostly of wave-cut coral limestone terraces interspersed with small sandy coves referred to as &quot;boca&quot; in Papiamento, which translates to &quot;mouth&quot; in English. The marine terraces of Aruba are most prominent on their windward, or northeast, coasts. In these areas, some of the terraces exhibit wide platforms and steep, angular backslopes. Conversely, on the leeward, or southwest, sides of the islands, the terraces tend to have narrower platforms and gentler backslopes. On occasion, particularly on the southwest side of Aruba, the backslopes are less distinct.

The distinctive appearance of the wave-cut terraces is influenced by the islands&#x27; location within the arid region along the southern Caribbean coastline. Limestone, known for its resistance to the effects of arid climate weathering, has contributed to the remarkable preservation of these terraces. Although a light layer of xerophytic vegetation lightly covers their surfaces, the terraces remain excellently preserved.

Aruba has a barrier reef, it generally lies about offshore and extends along the southwest coast between Punta Brabo and Oranjestad. It is composed of coral and is capped by a beach ridge of coral fragments in height. On the seaward side, the reef extends to a depth of at least .
== Geological development ==
The oldest geological unit visible on Aruba is the ALF, which comprises volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of basaltic composition, with a thickness exceeding . These rocks have undergone metamorphism due to the intrusion of the Aruba Batholith. The age of this formation is believed to be Turonian, supported by ammonite imprints found in conglomeratic mudstone.

The Aruba Batholith, which intruded the Aruba Lava Formation, primarily consists of hornblende tonalite. Pendants of quartz-norite to quartz-hornblende gabbro are present in the roof of the tonalite. Both the Aruba Lava Formation and the batholith are intersected by numerous dikes. The batholith&#x27;s intrusion occurred around 85 to 90 million years ago, with subsequent reheating of the rocks between 73 and 67 Myr.

The limestone terraces are categorized based on their elevation, a feature commonly associated with slow uplifting active margins. The lower terrace, situated at an elevation of , has a range age of 30–129 thousand years (Kyr). In contrast, the middle terrace, located at , dates back up to 510 Kyr, indicating a slow (0.05 mm/yr) rate of tectonic uplift of Aruba.

Aruba was above sea level during the Oligocene epoch. However, Aruba later subsided beneath the sea level in the middle Miocene, as documented by the emergence of widespread elevated coastal limestone terraces. This geological history has left a distinct mark on Aruba&#x27;s landscape and formation.

== Biogeography ==

=== Non-native species ===

==== Goats ====

Introduced in the early 16th century, feral goats (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;) and donkeys pose a significant threat to Aruba&#x27;s environments, causing both direct and indirect harm due to excessive grazing. This often leads to ecosystem deterioration and a decline in biodiversity. Despite their impact, these animals remain a local food source, with goat stew and soup being popular dishes in the region. Arikok, spanning 20% of the country, is home to a substantial goat population. Recent research estimates the goat population at approximately 1,465 individuals by counting fresh pellets.

==== Lionfish ====
The lionfish, originally from the Indo-Pacific, were introduced to the Atlantic Ocean in the mid-1980s. Their population has since grown significantly because they lack natural predators in their new environment. This unchecked growth has led to a decline in fish and crustacean populations, and even the health of coral reefs is suffering as herbivorous fish vanish. NOAA researchers confirm that invasive lionfish populations will keep increasing and can&#x27;t be eradicated using conventional methods.

&quot;Aruba LionFish Initiative&quot; (ALFI), a group of divers that regularly hunt invasive species, have taken the initiative to reduce the lionfish population in coastal areas by hunting them for food and crafting jewelry from their fins.

==== Boa constrictor ====
In 1999, the initial boa constrictor was discovered in Aruba. Despite attempts to control their growth, a population covering the entire island had taken hold by 2005. Being an invasive species, their adaptable diet can potentially endanger many native populations. A 2021 study examined the stomach contents of more than 500 captured Aruban boas. The findings revealed over 400 distinct prey types, with an almost equal distribution among mammals, lizards, and birds. Remarkably, aside from the seven known bat species in Aruba, nearly every other type of vertebrate was found in the stomach contents analyzed.

==== Cane toad ====
The Cane toad, also called &quot;Sapo&quot; locally, is an invasive species with a detrimental impact on Aruba&#x27;s fauna, such as the &quot;Dori&quot; (&quot;Pleurodema brachyops&quot;). However, the Aruban Cat-eyed Snake or &quot;Santanero&quot; (&quot;Leptodeira bakeri&quot;) preys on these toads and is considered a natural &quot;pest control&quot;. Toads favor damp environments, including (irrigated) gardens of residential homes and tourist accommodations, such as hotels and resorts. However, toads are true survivors and can easily adapt to drier conditions, as found in the arid climate of the Caribbean islands.

==== Anoles and geckos ====
In 2019, three new non-native reptiles have been discovered on Aruba, including &quot;Anolis gingivinus&quot;, &quot;Anolis cristatellus&quot;, &quot;Hemidactylus frenatus&quot;. Anole and gecko species are often unintentionally introduced to Caribbean islands through the live plant trade, but can also be intentionally introduced as pets. Similar to many non-native lizards in the Caribbean, these species often inhabit human-altered environments (anthropogenic habitats), and their impacts on Aruba&#x27;s native species is not yet fully understood. Aruba has a recorded history of 10 previous introduction of non-native reptiles species, including two anoles, &quot;Anolis sagrei&quot; and &quot;A. porcatus,&quot; and four geckos, &quot;Gonatodes albogularis, G. antilensis, G. vittatus,&quot; and &quot;Hemidactylus mabouia&quot;.

==Climatology==

Aruba features a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) characterized by consistently warm temperatures throughout the year. There have been lasting environmental challenges linked to climate and nature. Sea water temperatures, for example, have gradually risen by at least since the 1950s.

=== Southern Oscillation impact ===
The rainy season typically occurs between September and January. However, it exhibits significant variability due to the strong influence of the Southern Oscillation. During strong El Niño years like 1911/1912, 1930/1931, 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 annual (fiscal year) rainfall can plummet to as little as . In contrast, during La Niña years like 1933/1934, 1970/1971, 1988/1989, 1999/2000 or 2010/2011, rainfall can soar to as much as . The highest monthly totals during these La Niña events can reach between .

== Conservation geography ==
The origins of over-tourism can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s when people first expressed concerns about the possible negative effects on society and the environment due to uncontrolled tourism growth. These concerns also included the long-term economic consequences.

Environmental problems such as beach erosion, reef destruction, pollution, resource depletion, habitat loss, and the loss of natural beauty are significant forms of environmental damage. These issues can severely affect the small island tourism economy (SITES or SIDS). Aruba, recognized worldwide as the &#x27;One Happy Island&#x27; and one of the most tourism-dependent small island economies, it offers valuable insights into the complex and ever-changing aspects of over-tourism, including the rise in economic inequality, environmental decline, social disparities, institutional issues.

An illustration of institutional challenges arises from the scrutiny faced by the Aruban Ministry responsible for environmental affairs. Their involvement in disseminating misleading information about the environmental repercussions of an upcoming hotel project near Baby Beach has come under question. Despite an official press release asserting that the project would have no adverse effects on the environment, both the Environment Minister, , and the head of the development group, Enrique Martinón Garcia, acknowledged potential negative impacts during the hotel&#x27;s groundbreaking event. This incident underscores concerns about the transparency and accuracy of information related to environmental policies and its communication to the public.

=== Designated sites ===
The Arikok National Park Foundation (FPNA) oversees Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA). The KBA encompasses approximately 25% of Aruba&#x27;s total surface area, these include Arikok National Park, &quot;Spaans Lagoen&quot; (Spanish Lagoon), marine park Aruba (MPA), and other designated terrestrial areas.
=== Environmental policies ===

==== Chemical pollution: Oxybenzone in sunscreen ====
The chemical Oxybenzone in sunscreen products is banned due to its harmful effects on marine life and coral reefs when it enters the ocean. This ban is part of the &quot;Choose Zero&quot; concept law aimed at educating the community about the ban. Oxybenzone is commonly used in sunscreen, plastics, cosmetics, hair spray, and nail polish as a UV protector and stabilizer. While it helps protect the skin from UV rays, it also causes severe damage to corals and can lead to hormonal imbalances. The ban includes the import, sale, and distribution of single-use plastic products and Oxybenzone-containing products. Scientific studies have shown that Oxybenzone negatively impacts corals and marine biodiversity, and its presence in concentrated areas irreversibly affects coral conditions. The law&#x27;s main objective is to prevent further damage to nature and the environment, promoting a healthier quality of life without single-use plastics and Oxybenzone-containing products.

Even though regional zoning and marine conservation plans were put in place in 2019, Aruba&#x27;s natural habitats and marine environment have been without protection for over a century. This lack of protection dates back to the days of phosphate (Aruba Phosphate Company), gold (Aruba Gold Concessions), and oil refining industries (Lago Oil and Transport Company and Arend Petroleum Company) in the 1920s, and the subsequent growth of large-scale tourism and urbanization since the late 1970s.

==== Protection of flora and fauna and Sand ordinance ====
Aruba is committed to safeguarding its natural environment through international and local regulations. The international treaty CITES, as well as Aruba&#x27;s National Ordinance for the Protection of Native Flora and Fauna and the Sand Ordinance, strictly prohibit the removal or export of seashells, corals, and beach sand from the island.Recent increases in the confiscation of these items have raised concerns that local residents may be involved in illegal sales to tourists. Instead of collecting these items, it&#x27;s advisable to take a picture as a souvenir, as the removal of seashells can have a significant impact on the environment.
Shells play a critical role in maintaining our ecosystem. They stabilize beaches, provide shelter for creatures like hermit crabs, offer hiding places for small fish, and serve as nesting material for shorebirds. As shells break down, they release essential nutrients for organisms in the sand and those forming their own shells. The ocean supports delicate ecosystems, and any disruption can have devastating consequences. Each shell has a unique ecological role.

=== Ecological stressors ===

==== Light pollution ====
Aruba&#x27;s infrastructure, including the tourism sector, was developed without considering the potential impacts of light pollution on the ecological environment and human experiences.

All sea turtles species are endangered, including Leatherback, Loggerhead, Green and the Hawksbill, which are nocturnal wild life on Aruba. Artificial lighting can deter adult females from nesting or disorient emerging hatchlings, causing them to venture inland where they risk dehydration or harm.

International Dark-Sky Association-Aruba, a non-profit organization, aims to safeguard dark skies from light pollution. Over the past decade, the closure of the San Nicolas refinery has enabled the recovery of flora and fauna, while reducing light pollution, making the night sky brighter. However, the preservation of ecosystems faces increasing challenges with the expansion of the tourism zone and the construction of a new hotel in the southeast part of the island, Seroe Colorado.

==== Over-tourism ====
Over-tourism in Aruba is influenced by several key factors:

# Tourism ecological stress: This factor highlights the environmental impact of tourism. As tourism intensity and density increase, ecological pressure accelerates after crossing a critical threshold.
# Tourism supply chain: It considers the impact of increased airlift, accommodations (lodging), and labor on over-tourism.
# Tourism architectural style: This aspect examines the concentration and design of cruise and accommodation infrastructures in specific geographic areas or coastal zones.
# Tourism export specialization: Involves the export of tourism-related goods and services, including investments, earnings, revenues, and promotional activities.
# International tourism market diversity: A diverse tourism market is inversely related to over-tourism, meaning that greater market diversity is associated with less intense over-tourism.
Implications to reduce over-tourism:
* Aruba&#x27;s economic and environmental policy must consider tourism as an indicator for its Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
* Conserve its scarce and fragile natural resources by limiting over-tourism and accommodation infrastructure (e.g., hotel rooms, timeshare rooms, condominiums, and guest houses).
* Political economy is often marked by social exclusion and extraction rather than social inclusion and regeneration: de-marginalization and safeguarding of community well-being and agency by transitioning towards community-driven policy and development.
* Ecotourism should benefit the environment and the local community. Despite the publicized commitment to becoming a &quot;sustainable&quot; tourism destination, the actual political agendas in place prioritize the &quot;sustaining&quot; of a tourism industry. This emphasis has overshadowed social rights and responsibilities, effectively diminishing the role of government and civic organizations in governing for the overall well-being of society, both in the present and for the future.
* Increase tourism market diversification 
* Focus on long-term sustainable tourism by reducing bias towards short-term tourism promotion, expansion, and growth.
Over-tourism is a complicated issue, but it essentially boils down to a lack of responsible tourism management and policies by both public and private entities. This problem is exacerbated by the exclusion of local communities and civic society from important tourism decisions and developments. As a result, tourism has expanded without proper oversight, leading to various negative consequences.

== Human geography ==

Aruba is a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the largest settlement being Oranjestad, with a population of 28,372 (2020). Starting from the 1960s, Aruba&#x27;s population grew significantly because of two main factors: the arrival of workers for the oil refining industry and later, the tourism industry. It&#x27;s estimated that at least 45% of the population in Aruba was born in another country.

According to the &quot;Geographical Address Classification Aruba&quot; (GAC), developed by the Central Bureau of Statistics Aruba (CBS), this classification system has three levels, region, zone, and street/&quot;bario.&quot; Aruba is divided into eight regions and 55 zones:

# Noord/Tanki Leendert
# Oranjestad West
# Oranjestad East
# Paradera
# Santa Cruz
# Savaneta
# San Nicolas North
# San Nicolas South

=== Cultural geography ===

==== Language distribution ====
According to the 2020 Census, 43.2% of Aruba&#x27;s total population exclusively speaks Papiamento in their households. Among Aruba&#x27;s 8 regions, 5 have over 50% of the population using only Papiamento at home, with Oranjestad East having the highest percentage at 56.6%, and San Nicolas South the lowest at 23.4%. Additionally, the Census indicates that 18.9% of the population reported Papiamento and Spanish as the two primary languages spoken in their households. In the regions Noord/Tanki Leendert and Oranjestad East, one in four persons speaks Papiamento and Spanish in the household, while San Nicolas North has the lowest percentage at 8.9%.

Census data also reveals that 9.4% of the population indicated that Papiamento and English were the two mostly spoken languages in the household. San Nicolas South and San Nicolas North are the 2 regions with the highest percentages of the population that speak Papiamento and English in the household at 28.7% and 12.3%, respectively. Papiamento and English are least spoken in households of persons living in the region of Santa Cruz (4.6%).

Additionally, the Census shows that 6.8% of Aruba&#x27;s population speaks Papiamento and Dutch in their households. In all 8 regions, the percentage of the population that speaks these two languages at home is below 10%, with San Nicolas North having the lowest percentage at 1.5%.

Finally, the results of the 2020 Census revealed that in 18.6% of Aruba&#x27;s households, Papiamento is not one of the two most spoken languages. At a regional level, nearly one third of the population in San Nicolas South (30.6%) indicated that Papiamento is not one of the two most spoken languages in their household. Conversely, in Paradera, the percentage of the population indicating that Papiamento is not one of the two most spoken languages in their household is the lowest at 11.6%. In total, in Paradera, 85.2% of the population speaks Papiamento at home, either exclusively or in combination with another language.
=== Tourism geography ===
Currently, Aruba has a tourism intensity of 17 visitors per capita, marking a 5.6 increase since 1995. The island also experiences high tourism density, with over 10,000 visitors per square kilometer.

Most of Aruba&#x27;s tourism facilities are concentrated along the northwest coastline, with approximately 860 rooms per square kilometer. This represents a significant 103% growth in less than two decades. While Aruba is a small island, there were relatively few large-scale tourism activities and infrastructure developments in other geographical areas from 1995 to 2019.

The designated tourism zone, established in the late 1980s, covers about 16% of the island&#x27;s total land area. Currently, there are around 14,000 accommodation units, including hotels, timeshares, condominiums, villas, guesthouses, and rental apartments. Accommodation growth was primarily driven by hotels and timeshares until the early 2000s. However, in the last decade, the construction of condominiums, guesthouses, and rental apartments has increased by 51%, adding to existing infrastructural pressures and coastal resort density levels.

Locals are concerned about the impact of the growing number of tourism-focused properties and accommodations on Aruba&#x27;s fragile infrastructure and ecological environment. In the bustling Palm Beach on the west coast, there will be 4,000 more accommodations, including a new hotel near the Bubali Plas nature reserve, St. Regis Hotel, Embassy Suites, Hyatt Place Hotel, Radisson Blu Hotel, and boutique hotels in Port City, Oranjestad. Turning to the untouched east coast of the island, plans include the Secrets Aruba all-inclusive hotel with 600 rooms and a second hotel with 300 rooms. Additionally, there are two boutique hotels in the pipeline, each featuring 40 rooms.

<text>Viking Fotballklubb, commonly known as Viking or Viking Stavanger internationally, is a Norwegian professional football club from the city of Stavanger. The club was founded in 1899. It is one of the most successful clubs in Norwegian football, having won 8 Norwegian top division titles, most recently in 1991, and 6 domestic Norwegian Cup titles, most recently in 2019. The club has played more top-flight league games than any other club in Norway. It has played in the top division since the league was established, except for the years 1966–67, 1987–88 and 2018. Notable European successes include knocking English side Chelsea out of the UEFA Cup during the 2002–03 season, knocking out Sporting CP from the same tournament in 1999–2000, and qualifying for the group stages of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup.

==History==
Viking was founded in Stavanger in 1899 and played mainly local games in the early years. From the 1930s, the club established itself at the national level, playing in the 1933 cup final, which it lost to Mjøndalen. During the 1930s the club produced several of its best known players, most prominently Reidar Kvammen, who played in Norway&#x27;s bronze medal winning 1936 Olympic team. His brother Arthur Kvammen was also capped for Norway, while Bernhard Lund later went on to write the club anthem.

After the Second World War, Viking became a dominant side in the 1950s, beating Lillestrøm in the 1953 cup final and Sandefjord in the 1959 final, as well as winning the league title in 1957–58. Long-serving goalkeeper Sverre Andersen was the most prominent player in this generation, while Edgar Falch also earned several caps for Norway. Rolf and Kåre Bjørnsen, Asbjørn Skjærpe and Leif Nicolaysen were other prominent players, while a young Olav Nilsen began his remarkable Viking career in 1959. The club attendance record also stems from the semifinal of the 1959 cup, when 18,892 spectators saw Viking beat Odd 4–0.

While the 1960s was a somewhat quieter decade for Viking, the club returned to dominate Norwegian football in the 1970s. Viking won four straight league titles from 1972 to 1975, as well as the double in 1979. Innovative 1972 manager Kjell Schou-Andreassen has been credited with laying the foundation for the success, with his ideas on cooperative behaviour and his revolutionary use of pacey, attacking full backs Sigbjørn Slinning and Anbjørn Ekeland. However, the team had a new manager every year, with Sverre Andersen, Stuart Williams and Olav Nilsen leading them to the title in the subsequent years, and Tony Knapp managing the 1979 team. Midfielder Olav Nilsen was also a crucial player on the pitch in the first half of the decade, earning the nickname &quot;Olav Viking&quot;, while fellow midfielder Svein Kvia was awarded the Norwegian Player of the Year title on several occasions. Arvid Knutsen, Reidar Goa, Hans Edgar Paulsen, Erik Johannessen, Inge Valen, Johannes Vold, Svein Hammerø, Gunnar Berland and Trygve Johannessen were other key players.

The 1980s started well for the club. Kjell Schou Andreassen returned to guide the club to the league title in 1982. They also finished runners-up in the league in 1981 and 1984, and in the cup in 1984, producing players such as Bjarne Berntsen, Per Henriksen, Erik Thorstvedt, Svein Fjælberg, Nils Ove Hellvik, Tonning Hammer, Isak Arne Refvik, Torbjørn Svendsen, Trygve Johannessen and Gary Goodchild. However, the mid-80s saw the club relegated to the Second Division, and 1987 was the club&#x27;s worst season in recent memory as the club fell to 8th position in the Second Division, while local rivals Bryne won the cup and neighbouring minnows Vidar almost won promotion to the Tippeligaen.

Swedish manager Benny Lennartsson and players Kjell Jonevret and Per Holmberg arrived on large salaries to save the club. The gamble paid off when charismatic striker Alf Kåre Tveit secured a controversial penalty in the 95th minute against Vard in the final league game of the 1988 season. Arild Ravndal converted the spot kick to give Viking the victory and secure promotion, dubbed &quot;the miracle in Haugesund&quot;. This signalled the start of a new era, and the club won the cup in 1989 and the league in 1991. Lars Gaute Bø, Roger Nilsen, Kent Christiansen, Egil Fjetland, Jan Fjetland, Trond Egil Soltvedt, Mike McCabe and Børre Meinseth were other key players in a young Viking team.

However, many of the young players from the 1991 league winning squad did not manage to live up to their expectations, and the club was almost relegated under new manager Arne Larsen Økland in 1992. Bjarne Berntsen took over as manager in mid-season and secured renewed Tippeligaen status. Viking FK almost knocked the world famous side FC Barcelona, the second sports team with 100 million Facebook followers, out of the European Cup. While the club spent most of the 1990s challenging for Premier League medals, it did however never manage to challenge Rosenborg for the league championships. The 1990s was also the era of player exports in Norwegian football, and Viking made substantial earnings from the sales of striker Egil Østenstad to Southampton for £900,000 in 1996 and goalkeeper Thomas Myhre to Everton for £800,000 in 1997, among others. Gunnar Aase, Lars Gaute Bø, Magnus Svensson, Bjarte Aarsheim, Kenneth Storvik, Roger Nilsen and Ingve Bøe were other key players in this generation.

Benny Lennartson returned in 2000 to take over from Dane Poul Erik Andreasen, and this resulted in two bronze medals, a cup title and a memorable European Cup victory over Chelsea. In 2003, Kjell Inge Olsen took over as manager, and the club finished fifth in the league.

At the beginning of the 2004 season, the club moved to its new stadium in Jåttåvågen, named Viking Stadion. At the same time, Englishman Roy Hodgson took over as manager. The club finished ninth in its first season in the new stadium and fifth in the 2005 campaign. Brede Hangeland, Egil Østenstad, Peter Kopteff and Frode Hansen were notable players in this period. At the end of the 2005 season, Roy Hodgson quit his job as Viking coach to take over as Finland manager, and he was replaced by Tom Prahl. 

The 2006 season started poorly for Prahl&#x27;s team and poor soon turned to terrible. With seven matches to go, the once so feared team were situated at the bottom of the table. Former Start coach Tom Nordlie was brought in on a three-month contract to replace Tom Prahl and save Viking from relegation. Under new leadership, Viking won three of the first four games, jumping to tenth place in the standings, but were then defeated consecutively twice to once again fall into the relegation zone. Now lying second from the bottom, it looked like the best the club could hope for was making the play-off spot. The season finale proved to be extraordinary, however, as Viking crushed league runners-up Brann 5–0 at home to pass both HamKam and Odd Grenland in the standings and ultimately retain their spot in the Tippeligaen. Tom Nordlie was considered the favorite for the manager role after the season, but he chose a move to Lillestrøm instead. On 22 November 2006, Viking appointed Uwe Rösler (who was replaced by Tom Nordlie in Lillestrøm just one week earlier) as their new manager.

Under Rösler, Viking returned as a top team, and claimed the 3rd spot on the table in 2007. However, the following seasons were less successful, with Viking ending on 6th place in 2008 and 10th in 2009. They were also surprisingly knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Finnish team FC Honka in 2008, and suffered an embarrassing loss against local rivals Bryne in the domestic cup in 2009. After not living up to the expectations two consecutive seasons, Rösler resigned from his position as manager on 18 November 2009.

In early December 2009, after a period of massive speculation in local newspapers, Viking appointed Åge Hareide, former manager of the Norway national football team, as their new manager. Failing to bring any titles to Stavanger, Hareide was sacked by the club on 9 June 2012.

Kjell Jonevret signed as the club&#x27;s new manager on 19 June 2012. Jonevret had previously had a spell at Viking during his playing career, from 1988 to 1990. Jonevret spent over four years in charge of a team suffering from the club&#x27;s increasing financial difficulties, achieving acceptable results despite the difficult financial premises. In August 2015, he renewed his contract until the end of the 2018 season. However, after the 2016 season the club reached a mutual agreement with Jonevret to terminate his contract.

On 24 November 2016, Englishman Ian Burchnall was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager. Despite Viking signing an inexperienced manager and having financial trouble, Norwegian media predicted Viking to finish mid-table ahead of the 2017 season. However, it proved to be a difficult season for Burchnall, as the team struggled throughout the year, being in the relegation zone from start to finish. Two matches before the end of the 2017 season, Burchnall was fired from the job following the club&#x27;s relegation to the 1. divisjon. Assistant manager Bjarte Lunde Aarsheim took charge as head coach for the last two matches, achieving a win in Viking&#x27;s last match in the league.

On 19 December 2017, Bjarne Berntsen left his role as vice president of the Norwegian FA to take over the manager position at Viking. Berntsen has previously served as player, manager and director at the club.

During the months of December 2017 and January 2018, Viking&#x27;s financial difficulties reached a level where there was a real possibility that the club could go bankrupt. A statement from the club revealed that it would not be able to pay players and staff in February unless a solution was found. The financial situation was eventually resolved in a deal with Stavanger-based bank SR-Bank which allowed the club to refinance its debts. The bank also purchased parts of the stadium and the stadium naming rights. 

On 11 November 2018 Viking secured promotion to Eliteserien by placing 1st in 1. divisjon, in a tight ending of the season where two points were the difference between 1st and 3rd place. Viking defeated Kongsvinger 3–1 in front of a packed Viking Stadion on the last day of the season to secure the 1. divisjon title and put the club back in the Eliteserien after just one season on the second tier of Norwegian football. The victory sparked a pitch invasion by the Viking fans. Pitch invasions are extremely uncommon in Norwegian football.

On 8 December 2019 Viking won the Norwegian Cup after a 1–0 victory over FK Haugesund. Goalscorer was Zlatko Tripić on a penalty kick.

On 26 November 2020, the club surprisingly decided to terminate Bjarne Berntsen&#x27;s contract, even though he had taken the club from the second tier to Eliteserien on first attempt and achieved top half finishes in the following two seasons. Berntsen expressed great disappointment over the decision. The club moved to a dual head coach model, with Morten Jensen and Bjarte Lunde Aarsheim jointly in charge of the team. Despite a lot of initial public scepticism about this decision, the duo coached the club to third position in the 2021 Eliteserien, qualifying for the 2022-23 UEFA Europa Conference League.

==Crest and shirt==
The original kit colours in 1899 were all white. This turned out to be problematic at that time. To avoid colour bleeding from the red and yellow club badge when cleaning the white shirts, the badge had to be removed from each shirt prior to washing and then re-attached afterwards. The club therefore changed to dark blue, and is now nicknamed after the dark blue colour of their shirts.

The club badge is shaped like a flag, and remained relatively unchanged from the club&#x27;s formation in 1899 until 2020. In January 2020, the club introduced a redesigned badge. The flag shape remained, but the font was changed. The oak tree stump graphics were also changed, the year of foundation (1899) was moved and the name of the home city (Stavanger) was made slightly smaller. The traditional red background of the badge was also replaced with a dark blue background matching the colour of the shirts. Two years later, the 2022 edition of the kit reintroduced the red badge background.

From 2011, Diadora is the technical sponsor.
The Norwegian power company Lyse has been the club&#x27;s main shirt sponsor since 1999.

==Stadium==

Since the 2004 season, Viking Stadion has been Viking&#x27;s home stadium. Previously, the club played at Stavanger Stadion, which had a capacity of 17,555. Stavanger Stadion had been the club&#x27;s stadium since the club was founded in 1899.

===Attendances===

The first season with Viking Stadion saw the average attendance increase from 6,712 in 2003 to 12,450 in 2004. The average attendance numbers have been around 10,000 since the stadium was inaugurated. The lowest average attendance came in 2017, when Viking finished in 16th place and were relegated from Eliteserien. In 2007, Viking had an average attendance of 15,842, which is the highest in Viking&#x27;s history. The official supporter club of Viking, is &quot;Vikinghordene&quot; (the Viking hordes). Other supporter groups are &quot;F19 Stavanger&quot;, &quot;Viking Oslo&quot;, &quot;Blå Brigade 99&quot; and &quot;Vecchia Guardia&quot;.

==Rivalries==
Viking&#x27;s biggest rivals both locally and historically are Brann, Bryne, Haugesund, Sandnes Ulf, Start and Rosenborg BK. The rivalries with Brann and Haugesund are often referred to as &quot;Vestlandsderbyet&quot; (the Western Norway derby). The rivalry with Start is commonly known as &quot;Sørvestlandsderbyet&quot; (the Southwestern Norway derby). Bryne, Haugesund and Sandnes Ulf are all located in Rogaland, the same county as Viking. Bryne and Sandnes Ulf are geographically the two closest rivals. Bryne is often considered Viking&#x27;s biggest rival. The 2003 season was the last season Bryne and Viking played against each other in the league, even though the clubs have met in the cup since then.

<doc id="214193" wikidata="Q17169" url="?curid=214193" title="Giovanni Bellini">
<text>Giovanni Bellini (; c. 1430 – 29 November 1516) was an Italian Renaissance painter, probably the best known of the Bellini family of Venetian painters. He was raised in the household of Jacopo Bellini, formerly thought to have been his father, but now that familial generational relationship is questioned. An older brother, Gentile Bellini was more highly regarded than Giovanni during his lifetime, but the reverse is true today. His brother-in-law was Andrea Mantegna.

Giovanni Bellini was considered to have revolutionized Venetian painting, moving it toward a more sensuous and colouristic style. Through the use of clear, slow-drying oil paints, Giovanni created deep, rich tints and detailed shadings. His sumptuous colouring and fluent, atmospheric landscapes had a great effect on the Venetian painting school, especially on his pupils Giorgione and Titian. The Bellini cocktail is named in his honour.

== Life ==
=== Early career ===
Giovanni Bellini was born in Venice. The painter Jacopo Bellini had long been considered Giovanni&#x27;s father, but the art historian Daniel Wallace Maze has advanced the theory that in fact, Jacopo was his much elder brother. Nonetheless, Giovanni was brought up in Jacopo&#x27;s house. He always lived and worked in the closest fraternal relationship with his elder brother, Gentile. His paintings from the early period are all executed in the old tempera method: the scene is softened by a new and beautiful effect of romantic sunrise colour (as, for example, in the &quot;St. Jerome in the Desert&quot;).

In a changed and more personal manner, he drew &quot;Dead Christ&quot; paintings (in these days one of the master&#x27;s most frequent themes e.g. &quot;Dead Christ Supported by the Madonna and St. John&quot;, or &quot;Pietà&quot;), with less harshness of contour, a broader treatment of forms and draperies and less force of religious feeling. Giovanni&#x27;s early works have often been linked both compositionally and stylistically to those of Andrea Mantegna, his brother-in-law.

In 1470 Giovanni received his first appointment to work along with his elder brother, Gentile, and other artists in the Scuola di San Marco, where among other subjects he was commissioned to paint a &quot;Deluge with Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. None of the master&#x27;s works of this kind, whether painted for the various schools or confraternities or for the ducal palace, has survived.

=== Maturity ===
To the decade following 1470 must probably be assigned the &quot;Transfiguration&quot; now in the Capodimonte Museum of Naples, repeating with greatly ripened powers and in a much serener spirit the subject of his early effort at Venice.

Also likely from this period is the great altarpiece of the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; at Pesaro, which would seem to be his earliest effort in a form of art previously almost monopolized in Venice by the rival school of the Vivarini.

As is the case with a number of his brother, Gentile&#x27;s public works of the period, many of Giovanni&#x27;s great public works are now lost. The still more famous altarpiece painted in tempera for a chapel in the church of S. Giovanni e Paolo, where it perished along with Titian&#x27;s &quot;Peter Martyr&quot; and Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in the disastrous fire of 1867.

After 1479–1480 much of Giovanni&#x27;s time and energy must also have been taken up by his duties as conservator of the paintings in the great hall of the Doge&#x27;s Palace. The importance of this commission can be measured by the payment Giovanni received: he was awarded, first the reversion of a broker&#x27;s place in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, and afterwards, as a substitute, a fixed annual pension of eighty ducats. Besides repairing and renewing the works of his predecessors, he was commissioned to paint a number of new subjects, six or seven in all, in further illustration of the part played by Venice in the wars of Frederick Barbarossa and the pope. These works, executed with much interruption and delay, were the object of universal admiration while they lasted, but not a trace of them survived the fire of 1577; neither have any other examples of his historical and processional compositions come down, enabling us to compare his manner in such subjects with that of his brother Gentile.

Of the other, the religious class of his work, including both altarpieces with many figures and simple Madonnas, a considerable number have been preserved. They show him gradually throwing off the last restraints of the Quattrocento manner; gradually acquiring a complete mastery of the new oil medium introduced in Venice by Antonello da Messina about 1473, and mastering with its help all, or nearly all, the secrets of the perfect fusion of colours and atmospheric gradation of tones. The old intensity of pathetic and devout feeling gradually fades away and gives place to a noble, if more worldly, serenity and charm. The enthroned &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; (such as the one at left) become tranquil and commanding in their sweetness; the personages of the attendant saints gain in power, presence and individuality; enchanting groups of singing and viol-playing angels symbolize and complete the harmony of the scene. The full splendour of Venetian colour invests alike the figures, their architectural framework, the landscape and the sky.

=== High Renaissance ===
An interval of some years, no doubt chiefly occupied with work in the Hall of the Great Council, seems to separate the San Giobbe Altarpiece, and that of the church of San Zaccaria at Venice. Formally, the works are very similar, so a comparison between them serves to illustrate the shift in Bellini&#x27;s work over the last decade of the fifteenth century. Both paintings are of the Holy Conversation (sacred conversation between the Madonna and Saints) type. Both show the Madonna seated on a throne (thought to allude to the throne of Solomon), between classicizing columns. Both place the holy figures beneath a golden mosaicked half dome that recalls the Byzantine architecture in the basilica of St. Mark.
In the later work, Bellini depicts the Virgin surrounded by (from left): St. Peter holding his keys and the Book of Wisdom; the virginal St. Catherine and St. Lucy closest to the Virgin, each holding a martyr&#x27;s palm and her implement of torture (Catherine a breaking wheel, and Lucy a dish with her eyes); St. Jerome, with a book symbolizing his work on the Vulgate.

Stylistically, the lighting in the &quot;San Zaccaria&quot; piece has become so soft and diffuse that it makes that in the &quot;San Giobbe&quot; appear almost raking in contrast. Giovanni&#x27;s use of the oil medium had matured, and the holy figures seem to be swathed in a still, rarefied air. The &quot;San Zaccaria&quot; is considered perhaps the most beautiful and imposing of all Giovanni&#x27;s altarpieces, and is dated 1505, the year following that of Giorgione&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of Castelfranco&quot;.

Other late altarpieces with saints include that of the church of San Francesco della Vigna at Venice, 1507; that of La Corona at Vicenza, a &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; in a landscape, 1510; and that of San Giovanni Crisostomo at Venice of 1513.

Of Giovanni&#x27;s activity in the interval between the altarpieces of San Giobbe and San Zaccaria, there are a few minor works left, although the great mass of his output perished with the fire of the Doge&#x27;s Palace in 1577. The last ten or twelve years of the master&#x27;s life saw him besieged with more commissions than he could well complete. Already in the years 1501–1504 the marchioness Isabella Gonzaga of Mantua had experienced great difficulty in obtaining delivery from him of a painting of the Madonna and Saints (now lost) for which part payment had been made in advance.

In 1505 she endeavoured through Cardinal Bembo to obtain from him another painting, this time of a secular or mythological character. What the subject of this piece was, or whether it was delivered, we do not know.

Albrecht Dürer, visiting Venice for a second time in 1506, describes Giovanni Bellini as still the best painter in the city, and as full of all courtesy and generosity toward foreign brethren of the brush.

In 1507 Bellini&#x27;s brother Gentile died, and Giovanni completed the painting of the &quot;Preaching of St. Mark&quot; which his brother had left unfinished; a task on the fulfilment of which the bequest by the elder brother to the younger of Jacopo&#x27;s sketch-book had been made conditional.

In 1513 Giovanni&#x27;s position as sole master (since the death of Gentile and of Alvise Vivarini) in charge of the paintings in the Hall of the Great Council was threatened by one of his former pupils. Young Titian desired a share of the same undertaking, to be paid for on the same terms. Titian&#x27;s application was granted, then after a year rescinded, and then after another year or two granted again; and the aged master must no doubt have undergone some annoyance from his sometime pupil&#x27;s proceedings. In 1514 Giovanni undertook to paint &quot;The Feast of the Gods&quot; for the duke Alfonso I of Ferrara. 

Bellini died on 29 November 1516 (a date is given by Marin Sanudo on his diary). He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.

==Assessment==

Both in the artistic and worldly sense, the career of Bellini was, on the whole, very prosperous. His long career began with Quattrocento styles, but matured into the progressive post-Giorgione Renaissance styles. He lived to see his own school far outshine that of his rivals, the Vivarini of Murano; he embodied, with growing and maturing power, all the devotional gravity and much also of the worldly splendour of the Venice of his time; and he saw his influence propagated by a host of pupils, two of whom at least, Giorgione and Titian, equalled or even surpassed their master. Bellini outlived Giorgione by five years; Titian, as we have seen, challenged him, claiming an equal place beside his teacher. Other pupils of the Bellini studio included Girolamo Galizzi da Santacroce, Vittore Belliniano, Rocco Marconi, Andrea Previtali and possibly Bernardino Licinio.

Bellini was essential to the development of the Italian Renaissance for his incorporation of aesthetics from Northern Europe. Significantly influenced by Antonello da Messina and contemporary trends such as oil painting, Bellini introduced the pala, or single-panel altarpieces, to Venetian society with his work &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;. Certain details in this piece, such as breaks in the modelling of figures and shadows, imply that Bellini was still working to master the use of oil. This painting also differs from previous coronation scenes as it appears as a &quot;window&quot; to a natural scene, and excludes the typical accompanying paradise hosts. The simple scenery allows viewers to relate with more ease to the scene itself than before, reflecting Alberti&#x27;s humanist and inventio concepts. He also used the disguised symbolism integral to the Northern Renaissance. Bellini was able to master the Antonello style of oil painting and surface texture and to use this skill to create a refined and distinctly Venetian approach to painting. He blends this new technique with Venetian and Byzantine traditions (previously influencing art in the city) of iconography and colour to create a spiritual theme not found in Antonello&#x27;s pieces. The realism of oil painting coupled with the religious traditions of Venice were unique elements to Bellini&#x27;s style, which set him apart as one of the most innovative painters in the Venetian Renaissance. As demonstrated in such works as &quot;St. Francis in Ecstasy&quot; (c. 1480) and the &quot;San Giobbe Altarpiece&quot; (c. 1478), Bellini makes use of religious symbolism through natural elements, such as grapevines and rocks. Yet his most important contribution to art lies in his experimentation with the use of colour and atmosphere in oil painting.

In 1822, German artist and composer Therese Emilie Henriette Winkel copied Bellini&#x27;s work &quot;Christ Blessing&quot; for an altarpiece for the Brockwitz church in Dresden, Germany, which is still preserved today.

Spanish Museums own a scarce, but high-quality, presence of his works. The Prado Museum owns a &quot;Virgin and child between two Saints&quot;, with the collaboration of the workshop. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum preserves a &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot;, and The Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando holds a &quot;Saviour&quot;.

<doc id="214195" wikidata="Q290407" url="?curid=214195" title="Gentile Bellini">
<text>Gentile Bellini (c. 1429 – 23 February 1507) was an Italian painter of the school of Venice. He came from Venice&#x27;s leading family of painters, and, at least in the early part of his career, was more highly regarded than his younger brother Giovanni Bellini - a reversal of the situation today. From 1474, he was the official portrait artist for the Doges of Venice. In addition to his portraits, he painted a number of very large works with multitudes of figures, especially for the Scuole Grandi of Venice, wealthy confraternities that were very important in Venetian patrician social life.

In 1479 he was sent to Constantinople by the Venetian government when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II requested an artist; he returned the next year. Thereafter a number of his subjects were set in the East, and he is one of the founders of the Orientalist tradition in Western painting. His portrait of the Sultan was also copied in paintings and prints and became known all over Europe.

==Biography==
Gentile was born into the leading family of painters in Venice. His father Jacopo Bellini, was a Venetian pioneer in the use of oil paint as an artistic medium; his brother was Giovanni Bellini, and his brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna. He was christened Gentile after Jacopo&#x27;s master, Gentile da Fabriano. Gentile was taught painting in the workshop of his father. Although today Gentile is often seen in the shadow of his more famous family members, in his own time he was considered among the greatest living painters in Venice and had no shortage of commissions; his talent as a portraitist revealed itself at an early age.

==Paintings==
Gentile&#x27;s earliest signed work is &quot;The Blessed Lorenzo Giustinian&quot; (1445), one of the oldest surviving oil paintings in Venice (now at the Accademia Museum). During the 1450s, Bellini worked on a commission for the Scuola Grande di San Marco and painted in conjunction with his brother, Giovanni Bellini. From 1454 he was also the official portrait artist for the Doges of Venice, (for example, see image of the Doge Giovanni Mocenigo at right).

Much of Gentile Bellini&#x27;s surviving work consists of very large paintings for public buildings, including those for the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista. Along with Lazzaro Bastiani, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Mansueti, and Benedetto Rusconi, Bellini was one of the artists hired to paint the 10-painting narrative cycle known as &quot;The Miracles of the Relic of the Cross&quot;. The commission was intended to celebrate the relic of the Holy Cross which the confraternity had received in 1369. Gentile&#x27;s contributions include the &quot;Procession of the True Cross in Piazza San Marco&quot;, which dates from 1496, and the &quot;Miracle of the True Cross at the S. Lorenzo Bridge&quot;, dating from 1500 and featuring Gentile&#x27;s self-portrait and that of his brother Giovanni.

== Bellini and the East ==
Venice was, at that time, a very important point in which cultures and trade bordered on the eastern Mediterranean Sea and provided gateways to Asia and Africa. As noted, in his lifetime, Gentile was the most prestigious painter in Venice. Therefore, in 1479, he was chosen by the government of Venice to work for Sultan Mehmed II in Constantinople. However, in addition to his work at the Ottoman Court, Gentile&#x27;s work also responded to other aspects of the East, including the Byzantine Empire.

===Constantinople===
In September 1479 Gentile was sent by the Venetian Senate to the new Ottoman capital Constantinople as part of the peace settlement between Venice and the Turks. His role was not only as a visiting painter but also as a cultural ambassador for Venice. This was important to Mehmed II, as he was particularly interested in the art and culture of Italy, and he attempted on several occasions to have himself portrayed by Italian artists. He finally reached his goal with Gentile, who is believed to have painted the portrait of Mehmed II now in the National Gallery, London, (but largely overpainted).

Subsequently, an Oriental flavour appears in several of his paintings, including the portrait of a Turkish artist and &quot;St. Mark Preaching at Alexandria&quot; (above). The last was completed by his brother, Giovanni Bellini.

According to Carlo Ridolfi (who was born 87 years after Bellini&#x27;s death) in his 1648 history of the Venetian painters:Bellini made a painting of the head of John the Baptist on a charger, the saint being revered by the Turks as a prophet. When the picture was brought before the Sultan, he praised the skill exhibited there, but drew Gentile&#x27;s attention nonetheless to an error, which was that the neck stretched out too far from the head, and as it appeared to him that Gentile appeared unconvinced, to enable him to see the natural effect, he had a slave brought to him and had his head chopped off, demonstrating to him how, once separated from the chest, the neck contracted. Gentile, fearful at such barbarities, immediately tried in every way to be released from his contract in case one day he himself should be the victim of such a joke.This anecdote is likely apocryphal, as a similar story had been told by Seneca of Parrhasius, as well as of Michelangelo via a dubious source.

===Greece===

Gentile responded to other aspects of the East, including the Byzantine Greek Empire, as well as Venice&#x27;s other trading partners in North Africa and Levant. Venice had a long-established relationship with the Eastern Mediterranean. Saint Mark, Venice&#x27;s patron, was from the Egyptian city of Alexandria, and Venice&#x27;s cultural and spiritual centre – the basilica of San Marco – was built in his honor (and as his mausoleum) in the Greek Byzantine style. Although Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, the Greek Byzantine world had a continuing impact upon Venetian art and culture as a number of Greek Christians fled Muslim rule. It was here that Gentile painted the portrait of Queen Caterina Cornaro of Cyprus (at right). This is counted as the second known portrait including the queen, which is now in the collection of the Szepmuveszeti Museum in Budapest.

==Retirement years and legacy==
Bellini&#x27;s most important paintings, the monumental canvases in the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice, were destroyed by fire in 1577. Only a few of his other works remain, namely the large narrative paintings &quot;The Procession in Piazza San Marco&quot; (above left) and &quot;The Preaching of Saint Mark in Alexandria&quot; (above right), produced in his final years. Little remains of Gentile&#x27;s art from the 1470s and 1480s, except for the works made in Constantinople. Moreover, many workshop paintings and drawings have been assigned to Gentile Bellini. This has had the unfortunate consequence of confirming his reputation as an awkward artist, especially in comparison with his beloved brother Giovanni. Gentile&#x27;s fall from popular favor seems to have begun shortly after his death; by 1557 Lodovico Dolce made a rather acerbic comment about him as an early teacher of Titian:

He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.

In recent years, Gentile has once again generated interest, especially in a recent spate of scholarly publications and exhibitions on the subject of cross-cultural exchange between Europe and the Levant.

<text>A secretary, [[administrative assistant]], executive assistant, [[Personal assistant|personal secretary]], or other similar titles is an individual whose work consists of supporting management, including executives, using a variety of project management, program evaluation, communication, and/or organizational skills within the area of administration. There is a diverse array of work experiences attainable within the administrative support field, ranging between internship, entry-level, associate, junior, mid-senior, and senior level pay bands with positions in nearly every industry, especially among white-collar careers. 

The functions of a personal assistant may be entirely carried out to assist one other employee or may be for the benefit of more than one. In other situations, a secretary is an officer of a society or organization who deals with correspondence, admits new members, and organizes official meetings and events. But this role should not be confused with the role of an executive secretary, cabinet secretary such as cabinet members who hold the title of &quot;secretary&quot;, or company secretary, all which differ from an administrative assistant.
==Duties and functions==

A secretary, also known as a &quot;personal assistant&quot; (PA) or &quot;administrative assistant&quot;, can have many administrative duties. The title &quot;secretary,&quot; with its root meaning of &quot;keeper of secrets,&quot; is not used as often as in decades past, and responsibilities have evolved in response to the technological age. The duties may vary according to the nature and size of the company or organization, and might include managing budgets, bookkeeping, attending telephone calls, handling visitors, maintaining websites, travel arrangements, event planning, and preparing expense reports. Secretaries might also manage all the administrative details of running a high-level conference or meeting and be responsible for arranging the catering for a lunch meeting. Often executives will ask their assistant to take the minutes at meetings and prepare meeting documents for review. In addition to the minutes, the secretary may be responsible for keeping all of the official records of a company or organization. A secretary is also regarded as an &quot;office manager&quot;. 

Today, many secretaries also conduct research, briefings, write memoranda, content writing, handle project management, program evaluation, stakeholder management, customer service duties, devise and maintain office systems including data management and filing, carry out background research and present findings, produce documents like white papers and gray literature, carry out specific projects, take on some of the manager&#x27;s responsibilities, get involved in decision-making processes, handle public relations tasks, and/or logistics and procurement along with a wide range of other duties related to their specific industry. 

In a business, many job descriptions overlap. However, while administrative assistant is a generic term, not necessarily implying directly working for a superior, a secretary is usually the key person for all administrative tasks, and often referred to as the &quot;gate keeper&quot;. Other titles describing jobs similar to or overlapping those of the traditional secretary are Office Coordinator, Executive Assistant, Office Manager and Administrative Professional.

*List of job titles synonymous with or similar to secretary: secretary, administrative professional, administrative assistant, executive assistant, administrative officer, administrative support specialist, clerk, military assistant, military aid, management assistant, office secretary, program assistant, project assistant, personal aid, body man/body women, personal secretary, or personal assistant.
*In previous decades, especially in the 20th century and before, at the most basic level a secretary is usually an audio typist with a small number of administrative roles. A good command of the prevailing office language and the ability to type is essential. At higher grades and with more experience they begin to take on additional roles and spend more of their time maintaining physical and electronic files, dealing with the post, photocopying, emailing clients, ordering stationery and answering telephones. 
*A more skilled executive assistant may be required to type at high speeds using technical or foreign languages, organize diaries, itineraries and meetings and carry out administrative duties which may include accountancy or financial accounting. A secretary / executive assistant may also control access to a manager, thus becoming an influential and trusted aide. Executive assistants are available for contact during off hours by new electronic communication methods for consultations. 
*The largest difference between a generalized secretary and skilled executive assistants is that the executive assistant is required to be able to interact extensively with the general public, vendors, customers, and any other person or group that the executive is responsible to interact with. As the level that the executive interacts with increases so does the level of skill required in the executive assistant that works with the executive. Those executive assistants that work with corporate officers must be capable of emulating the style, corporate philosophy, and corporate persona of the executive for which they work. In the modern workplace the advancement of the executive assistants is codependent on the success of the executive and the ability of both to make the job performance of the team seamless whereas the job place evaluation is reflective of each other&#x27;s performance executive secretary for now.

This should be distinguished from the company secretary, a senior role within a company responsible for compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements.

=== Executive assistant ===

==== Civilian ====
The work of an executive assistant (sometimes called a management assistant) differs a great deal from that of an administrative assistant. In many organizations, an executive assistant is a high-ranking position in the administrative hierarchy. Executive assistants work for a company officer or executive (at both private and public company institutions), and possess the authority to make crucial decisions affecting the direction of such organizations. As such, executive assistants play a role in decision-making and policy setting. The executive assistant performs the usual roles of managing correspondence, preparing research, and communication, often with one or more administrative assistants or scheduling assistants who report to him or her. The executive assistant also acts as the &quot;gatekeeper&quot;, understanding in varying degree the requirements of the executive, and with an ability through this understanding to decide which scheduled events, meetings, teleconferences, or e-mails are most appropriate for allocation of the executive&#x27;s time.

An executive assistant may, from time to time, act as proxy for the executives, representing him/her/them in meetings or communications and project managing the production of reports or other deliverables in the absence of the executive. An executive assistant differs from an administrative assistant (a job which is often part of the career path of an executive assistant) in that they are expected to possess a higher degree of business acumen, be able to manage projects, as well as have the ability to influence others on behalf of the executive. In the past, executive assistants were required to have a high school diploma only, but increasingly jobs are requiring a bachelor&#x27;s degree of any field of study or when complying with educational requirements within their given industry, may require specialized knowledge in a specific fields of study through a bachelor&#x27;s degree pertinent to the employer&#x27;s industry or division&#x27;s role within the organization.

==== Military ====

In the U.S. Department of Defense, the title of military assistant (MA) or executive assistant (EA) is typically held by Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps colonels, lieutenant colonels, and senior majors and Navy captains, commanders and senior lieutenant commanders who are in direct support of the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense and other civilian defense officials down to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, as well as general officers or flag officers.

The Secretary of Defense also has a lieutenant general or vice admiral as his/her senior military assistant.

Like their civilian counterparts, EAs are also a resource in decision-making, policy setting, and will have leadership oversight of the entire military and civilian staff supporting the civilian official, general officer, or flag officer. EAs are often interchangeable with other senior military officers of equivalent rank holding the title of chief of staff in other service organizations headed by a flag officer or general officer. In the case of unified combatant commands and service major commands, the Chief of Staff is often a general officer or flag officer himself/herself, typically at the 1-star or 2-star level, but he or she should not be confused with the 4-star officers holding the title of Chief of Staff of the Army or Chief of Staff of the Air Force.

==Education, training, and entering the profession==
In the late 19th century, the invention of the typewriter provided many new job openings in business and government for women and men. At Chicago&#x27;s Metropolitan Business College in the 1892-1893 were female; in the shorthand and typing courses, however, 90 percent of the students were female. For most of the 20th century, women with shorthand or typing skills could get secretarial jobs without further education beyond high school.

==Origin==
The role of secretary emerged from European church and state bureaucracies as aspects of the role of chancellor became distinct, and encompassed managing the work of a number of clerks gathered in the chancery.
From the Renaissance until the late 19th century, men involved in the daily correspondence and the activities of the powerful had assumed the title of secretary. 

With time, like many titles, the term was applied to more and varied functions, leading to compound titles to specify various secretarial work better, like general secretary or financial secretary. Just &quot;secretary&quot; remained in use either as an abbreviation when clear in the context or for relatively modest positions such as administrative assistant of the officer(s) in charge, either individually or as member of a secretariat. As such less influential posts became more feminine and common with the multiplication of bureaucracies in the public and private sectors, new words were also coined to describe them, such as personal assistant.

In the 1840s and 1850s commercial schools were emerging to train male and female students the skills needed to work in a clerical position. In 1870, Sir Isaac Pitman founded a school where students could qualify as shorthand writers to &quot;professional and commercial men&quot;. Originally, this school was only for male students. In 1871, there were more than 150 such schools operating in the United States, a number that grew to as many as 500 by the 1890s. 

In the 1880s, with the invention of the typewriter, more women began to enter the field and during the upcoming years, especially since World War I, the role of secretary has been primarily associated with women. By the 1930s, fewer men were entering the field of secretaries.

In an effort to promote professionalism among United States secretaries, the National Secretaries Association was created in 1942. Today, this organization is known as the International Association of Administrative Professionals (IAAP). The organization developed the first standardized test for office workers called the Certified Professional Secretaries Examination (CPS). It was first administered in 1951. 

By the mid-20th century the need for secretaries was great and offices and organizations featured large secretarial pools. In some cases the demand was great enough to spur secretaries being recruited from overseas; in particular, there was often a steady demand for young British women to come to the U.S. and fill temporary or permanent secretarial positions. Several organizations were created to assist secretaries from foreign lands, including the Society of International Secretaries and the Association of British Secretaries in America.

In 1952 Mary Barrett, president of the National Secretaries Association, C. King Woodbridge, president of Dictaphone Corporation, and American businessman Harry F. Klemfuss created a special Secretary&#x27;s Day holiday, to recognize the hard work of the staff in the office. The holiday caught on, and during the fourth week of April is now celebrated in offices all over the world. It has been renamed &quot;Administrative Professional&#x27;s Week&quot; to highlight the increased responsibility of today&#x27;s secretary and other administrative workers, and to avoid embarrassment to those who believe that &quot;secretary&quot; refers only to women or to unskilled workers.

In the 20th century, with the spread of the typewriter, shorthand saw competition from steno-typing. Typing thus became the prerogative of women, widows or relatively well-educated young girls, originally from the middle class or the petty bourgeoisie, then from working-class backgrounds with the rise of the profession between the two world wars, which saw the women seize these innovations.

Until recent years, the profession of secretary in the original sense was often subject, in the collective imagination, to stereotypes and pejorative connotations. Indeed, secretarial work was easily associated with low-value, thankless, and badly paid tasks, such as serving coffee to superiors, making photocopies or filing menial documents. In addition, the profession was once exercised almost exclusively by women and considered a pink-collar job in previous decades, but in the 21st century many employers began re-classifying many entry-level positions, including white-collar jobs historically held by men in decades past, as secretary, administrative assistant, or program assistant roles.

=== Etymology ===

The term is derived from the Latin word , &quot;to distinguish&quot; or &quot;to set apart&quot;, the passive participle () meaning &quot;having been set apart&quot;, with the eventual connotation of something private or confidential, as with the English word &quot;secret.&quot; A was a person, therefore, overseeing business confidentially, usually for a powerful individual (a king, pope, etc.). As the duties of a modern secretary often still include the handling of confidential information, the literal meaning of their title still holds true.

<doc id="214200" wikidata="Q313310" url="?curid=214200" title="Jacopo Bellini">
<text>Jacopo Bellini (c. 1400 – c. 1470) was one of the founders of the Renaissance style of painting in Venice and northern Italy. His sons Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, and his son-in-law Andrea Mantegna, were also famous painters.

Few of Bellini&#x27;s paintings still exist, but his surviving sketch-books (one in the British Museum and one in the Louvre) show an interest in landscape and elaborate architectural design and are his most important legacy. His surviving works show how he accommodated linear perspective to the decorative patterns and rich colors of Venetian painting.

==Biography==
Born in Venice, Jacopo had probably been a pupil of Gentile da Fabriano, who was then in Venice. In 1411–1412 he was in Foligno, where with Gentile he worked at the Palazzo Trinci frescoes. In 1423 Bellini was in Florence, where he knew the new works by Brunelleschi, Donatello, Masolino da Panicale and Masaccio.
In 1424 he opened a workshop in Venice, which he ran right up until his death, and which trained his sons and other artists.

Many of his greatest works, including the enormous &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in the cathedral of Verona (1436), have disappeared. From c. 1430 is the panel with &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, in the Accademia Carrara, once attributed to Gentile da Fabriano. In 1441, at Ferrara, where he was at the service of Leonello d&#x27;Este together with Leon Battista Alberti, he executed a portrait of that Marquess, now lost. Of this period survives the &quot;Madonna dell&#x27;Umiltà&quot;, probably commissioned by one of the brothers of Leonello.

The influence from Masolino da Panicale towards more modern, early Renaissance themes is visible in the &quot;Madonna with Child&quot; (dated 1448) in the Pinacoteca di Brera: for the first time, perspective is present and the figure are more monumental. Later he contributed with works now lost to the Venetian churches of San Giovanni Evangelista (1452) and St. Mark (1466). From 1459 is a &quot;Madonna with Blessing Child&quot; in the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia.

Later he sojourned in Padua, where he trained a young Andrea Mantegna in perspective and classicist themes and where, in 1460, he finished a portrait of Erasmo Gattamelata, now lost. Of his late phase, a ruined &quot;Crucifix&quot; in the Museum of Verona and an &quot;Annunciation&quot; in the church of Sant&#x27;Alessandro of Brescia remain.

Giovanni Fontana showed Bellini a treatise on perspective.

<doc id="214203" wikidata="Q1971990" url="?curid=214203" title="Stetsasonic">
<text>Stetsasonic is an American hip hop band. Formed in 1981 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, Stetsasonic was one of the first hip hop acts to perform with a full band and use live instrumentation in their recordings, paving the way for future hip hop bands such as The Roots. The band combined beat-boxing, sampling technology, and live band performance, incorporating R&amp;B, jazz, dancehall reggae, and rock into its sound. Stetsasonic is also considered one of the acts that pioneered jazz rap.

Though rumored to have disbanded in 1991, soon after the release of its third album, &quot;Blood, Sweat &amp; No Tears,&quot; Stetsasonic continues to record and perform together, as evidenced by their subsequent release, &quot;People In The Neighborhood&quot;, and their performance at the Urban Matterz Hip Hop Festival in 2019. Individual members branched out to explore solo careers, while still maintaining Stetsasonic. Frukwan and Prince Paul were founding members of the Gravediggaz, while the latter also became a record producer, as did Daddy-O.

==History==
Originally, the band was known as The Stetsasonic 3 MC&#x27;s. The original group consisted of Daddy-O, Delite, and Crown Supreme. Daddy-O and Delite changed the group&#x27;s name and style to Stetsasonic the Hip-Hop Band. Additional members were: Wise The Human Mix Machine; Prince Paul; the Devastating Beat Creator (DBC); drummer Bobby Simmons; and Frukwan, who replaced Crown Supreme. Stetsasonic clinched a deal with Tommy Boy Records when DBC created and played the funky bassline for its debut single &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Say It All Just Say STET&quot;, live for Tom Silverman, owner of Tommy Boy. After a few months of the single being in regular rotation on radio stations, the band released its first album &quot;On Fire&quot; (1986). The album received mixed reviews, though the follow-ups, &quot;In Full Gear&quot; and &quot;Blood, Sweat &amp; No Tears&quot;, were critically acclaimed.

A 1988 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article said that the band mirrored the rise of artistic, profound rap music: &quot;While pop&#x27;s political commentary often seems secondary to catchy melodies and commercial acceptability, rap&#x27;s tough sound sharpens its commentary&quot;. As a &quot;hip hop band&quot;, dependent on instruments as well as turntables, the band was also known for live shows, though sometimes the &quot;rap-show format prevented Stetsasonic from employing the band instrumentation and studio layering that make their records so distinctive.&quot;

Frukwan and Prince Paul were founding members of the Gravediggaz, while the latter also became a record producer. Daddy-O went on to a solo career, while also working as a record producer, working with Freestyle Fellowship, Mary J. Blige, Positive K and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, among others. Prince Paul went on to produce the trio De La Soul. Drummer Bobby Simmons pursued work in public access, forming the show &quot;Flava Videos&quot; in the mid-1990s on Channel 26 (New York). In 2017, Simmons was a contestant on the FOX game show &quot;Beat Shazam&quot; where he was partnered with singer Shannon. MC Delite is currently the President and CEO of Flight Entertainment and a public speaker. DBC proceeded to produce tracks for Third World and the Cookie Crew, among others. In 1995, he became the owner and operator of Raw Beat Productions, a music &amp; video recording studio, located in Philadelphia. In 2016, he invented the MN-1 Advanced Portable Power System, which is a sustainable energy source with a swappable battery compartment and solar-based charging system.

Wise also participated in a few commercials in which he lends his beatbox sounds. One was for Campbell&#x27;s Soup in which a cartoon of a B-boy bear beatboxes. The commercial was broadcast amid Saturday morning cartoons. Wise was also featured in a documentary on the art of the human beatbox, &quot;Breath Control: the History of the Human Beat Box&quot;, which was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival and also featured fellow human percussionists such as Doug E. Fresh, Biz Markie, Ready Rock C, and Emanon.

Stetsasonic released the single &quot;(Now Ya&#x27;ll Givin&#x27; Up) Love&quot; in 2020. They proposed an upcoming album called &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;.

<text>A strategic bomber is a medium- to long-range penetration bomber aircraft designed to drop large amounts of air-to-ground weaponry onto a distant target for the purposes of debilitating the enemy&#x27;s capacity to wage war. Unlike tactical bombers, penetrators, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft, which are used in air interdiction operations to attack enemy combatants and military equipment, strategic bombers are designed to fly into enemy territory to destroy strategic targets (e.g., infrastructure, logistics, military installations, factories, etc.). In addition to strategic bombing, strategic bombers can be used for tactical missions. There are currently only three countries that operate strategic bombers: the United States, Russia and China.

The modern strategic bomber role appeared after strategic bombing was widely employed, and atomic bombs were first used during World War II. Nuclear strike missions (i.e., delivering nuclear-armed missiles or bombs) can potentially be carried out by most modern fighter-bombers and strike fighters, even at intercontinental range, with the use of aerial refueling, so any nation possessing this combination of equipment and techniques theoretically has such capability. Primary delivery aircraft for a modern strategic bombing mission need not always necessarily be a heavy bomber type, and any modern aircraft capable of nuclear strikes at long range is equally able to carry out tactical missions with conventional weapons. An example is France&#x27;s Mirage IV, a small strategic bomber replaced in service by the ASMP-equipped Mirage 2000N fighter-bomber and Rafale multirole fighter.

==History==

===First and Second World Wars===
The first strategic bombing efforts took place during World War I (1914–18), by the Russians with their Sikorsky Ilya Muromets bomber (the first heavy four-engine aircraft), and by the Germans using Zeppelins or long-range multi-engine Gotha aircraft. Zeppelins reached England on bombing raids by 1916, forcing the British to create extensive defense systems including some of the first anti-aircraft guns which were often used with searchlights to highlight the enemy machines overhead. Late in the war, American fliers under the command of Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell were developing multi-aircraft &quot;mass&quot; bombing missions behind German lines, although the Armistice ended full realization of what was being planned.

Study of strategic bombing continued in the interwar years. Many books and articles predicted a fearful prospect for any future war, paced by political fears such as those expressed by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin who told the House of Commons early in the 1930s that &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot; no matter what defensive systems were undertaken. It was widely believed by the late 1930s that strategic &quot;terror&quot; bombing of cities in any war would quickly result in devastating losses and might decide a conflict in a matter of days or weeks. But theory far exceeded what most air forces could actually put into the air. Germany focused on short-range tactical bombers. Britain&#x27;s Royal Air Force began developing four-engine long-range bombers only in the late 1930s. The U.S. Army Air Corps (&quot;Army Air Forces&quot; as of mid-1941) was severely limited by small budgets in the late 1930s, and only barely saved the B-17 bomber that would soon be vital. The equally important B-24 first flew in 1939. Both aircraft would constitute the bulk of the bomber force for USAAF strategic bombing in Europe and Allied day bomber units more generally.

At the start of World War II, so-called &quot;strategic&quot; bombing was initially carried out by medium bomber aircraft which were typically twin-engined, armed with several defensive guns, but only possessed limited bomb-carrying capacity and range. Both Britain and the US were developing larger two- and four-engined designs, which began to replace or supplement the smaller aircraft by 1941–42. After American entry into the war in December 1941, the U.S. 8th Air Force began to develop a daylight bombing capacity using improved B-17 and B-24 four-engine aircraft. In order to assemble the formations to carry out these bombing campaigns, assembly ships were used to quickly form defensive combat boxes. The RAF concentrated its efforts on night bombing. But neither force was able to develop adequate bombsights or tactics to allow for often-bragged &quot;pinpoint&quot; accuracy. The post-war U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey studies supported the overall notion of strategic bombing, but underlined many of its shortcomings as well. Attempts to create pioneering examples of &quot;smart bombs&quot; resulted in the Azon ordnance, deployed in the European Theater and CBI Theater from B-24s.
Following the untimely death of the top German advocate for strategic bombing, &quot;General&quot; Walther Wever in early June 1936, the focus of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe bomber forces, the so-named &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; (bomber wings) became the battlefield support of the German Army as part of the general Blitzkrieg form of warfare, carried out with both medium bombers such as the Heinkel He 111, and &quot;Schnellbombers&quot; such as the Junkers Ju 88A. Support for the Ural bomber project before the start of WW II dwindled after Wever&#x27;s death, with the only aircraft design that could closely match the Allied bomber force&#x27;s aircraft – the Heinkel He 177A, originated in early November 1937, deployed in its initial form in 1941–42, hampered by a RLM requirement for it to also perform medium-angle dive bombing, not rescinded until September 1942 – unable to perform either function properly, with a powerplant selection and particular powerplant installation design features on the 30-meter wingspan &quot;Greif&quot;, that led to endless problems with engine fires. The trans-Atlantic ranged &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot; program started in March 1942 sought to ameliorate the lack of a long-range bomber for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, but led only to three Messerschmitt- and two Junkers-built prototypes ever flying, and no operational &quot;heavy bombers&quot; for strategic use for the Third Reich beyond the roughly one thousand He 177s built.

By the end of the Second World War in 1945, the &quot;heavy&quot; bomber, epitomized by the British Avro Lancaster and American Boeing B-29 Superfortress used in the Pacific Theater, showed what could be accomplished by area bombing of Japan&#x27;s cities and the often small and dispersed factories within them. Under Major General Curtis LeMay, the U.S. 20th Air Force, based in the Mariana Islands, undertook low-level incendiary bombing missions, results of which were soon measured in the number of square miles destroyed. The air raids on Japan had withered the nation&#x27;s ability to continue fighting, although the Japanese government delayed surrender until atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

===The Cold War and its aftermath===
During the Cold War, the United States and United Kingdom on one side and the Soviet Union on the other kept strategic bombers ready to take off on short notice as part of the deterrent strategy of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Most strategic bombers of the two superpowers were designed to deliver nuclear weapons. For a time, some squadrons of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers were kept in the air around the clock, orbiting some distance away from their fail-safe points near the Soviet border.

The British produced three different &quot;V bombers&quot; for the Royal Air Force which were designed and designated to be able to deliver British-made nuclear bombs to targets in European Russia. These bombers would have been able to reach and destroy cities such as Kiev or Moscow before American strategic bombers. While they were never used against the Soviet Union or its allies, two V bomber types, the Avro Vulcan and the Handley Page Victor, were used in the Falklands War towards the end of their operational lives.

The Soviet Union produced hundreds of unlicensed copies of the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which the Soviet Air Forces called the Tupolev Tu-4. The Soviets later developed the jet-powered Tupolev Tu-16 &quot;Badger&quot;.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China produced a version of Tupolev Tu-16 on license from the Soviet Union in the 1960s, which they named the Xian H-6.

During the 1960s France produced its Dassault Mirage IV nuclear-armed bomber for the French Air Force as a part of its independent nuclear strike force, the &quot;Force de Frappe&quot;, using French-made bombers and IRBMs to deliver French-made nuclear weapons. Mirage IVs served until mid-1996 in the bomber role, and to 2005 as reconnaissance aircraft.

The French Republic limited its strategic armaments to a squadron of four nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, with 16 SLBM tubes apiece. France also maintains an active force of supersonic fighter-bombers carrying ASMP stand-off nuclear missiles, with Mach 3 speed and a range of 500 kilometers. These missiles can be delivered by the Dassault Mirage 2000N and Rafale fighter-bombers; the Rafale is also capable of refueling others in flight using a buddy refueling pod.

Newer strategic bombers such as the Rockwell B-1 Lancer, the Tupolev Tu-160, and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit designs incorporate various levels of stealth technology in an effort to avoid detection, especially by radar networks. Despite these advances earlier strategic bombers, for example the B-52 last manufactured in 1962 and the Tupolev Tu-95, remain in service and can also deploy the latest air-launched cruise missiles and other &quot;stand-off&quot; or precision guided weapons such as the JASSM and the JDAM.

The Russian Air Force&#x27;s new Tu-160M2 strategic bombers are expected to be delivered on a regular basis over the course of 10 to 20 years. The Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers will be periodically updated, as was done during the 1990s with the Tu-22M bombers.

Strategic bombers of the Cold War were primarily armed with nuclear weapons. During the post-1940s Indochina Wars, and also since the end of the Cold War, modern bombers originally intended for strategic use have been exclusively employed using non-nuclear, high explosive weapons. During the Vietnam War, Operation Menu, Operation Freedom Deal, Gulf War, military action in Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, American B-52s and B-1s were mostly employed in tactical roles. During the Soviet-Afghan war in 1979–88, Soviet Air Forces Tu-22Ms carried out several mass air raids in various regions of Afghanistan.

==Notable strategic bombers==

===Nomenclature===
Bombers listed below were used in the main or represented a shift in long-range bomber design (Maximum bomb load). In practice, bomb loads carried are dependent on factors such as the distance to target and the individual type, size or weight of bombs used.

Nomenclature for size classification of aircraft types used in strategic bombing varies, particularly since the time of World War II due to sequential technological advancements and changes in aerial warfare strategy and tactics. The B-29, for example was a benchmark aircraft of the heavy bomber type at end of World War II due to its size, range and load carrying ability; as the Cold War began, it became an intercontinental range strategic bomber with the development of new techniques, such as aerial refueling (which also greatly extended the range of other medium- to long-range bombers, fighter-bombers and attack aircraft).

During the 1950s the U.S. Strategic Air Command also briefly brought back the outdated term &quot;medium bomber&quot; to distinguish its Boeing B-47 Stratojets from somewhat larger contemporary Boeing B-52 Stratofortress &quot;heavy bombers&quot; in bombardment wings; older B-29 and B-50 heavy bombers were also redesignated as &quot;medium&quot; during this period. SAC&#x27;s nomenclature here was purely semantic and bureaucratic, however as both the B-47 and B-52 strategic bombers were much larger and had far greater performance and load-carrying ability than any of the World War II-era heavy or medium bombers.

Other aircraft such as the twin-jet US FB-111, Douglas A-3 Skywarrior and France&#x27;s Dassault Mirage IV had nominal warloads of less than , and were significantly smaller in size and gross weight compared with their strategic bomber contemporaries, based on which they might be classified as medium bombers. In the nuclear strike role, France would replace its Mirage IVs beginning in the late 1980s with the even smaller, single-engine Mirage 2000N fighter-bomber, a further example of advancing technologies and changing tactics in military aviation and aircraft design. France&#x27;s newer twin-engine Dassault Rafale multirole fighter also has nuclear strike capability.

<text>Mary Jane Blige ( ; born January 11, 1971) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, actress, and entrepreneur. Often referred to as the &quot;Queen of Hip-Hop Soul&quot; and &quot;Queen of R&amp;B&quot;, her accolades include nine Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, four American Music Awards, twelve NAACP Image Awards, and twelve &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award.

Her career began in 1988 when she was signed to Uptown Records by its founder Andre Harrell. During this time, Blige performed background vocals for other artists on the label. In 1992, Blige released her debut album, &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot;, which is credited for introducing the mix of R&amp;B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture. Its 1993 remix album became the first album by a singer to have a rapper on every song, popularizing rap as a featuring act. Both &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; and her 1994 album &quot;My Life&quot; ranked among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. Throughout her career, Blige went on to release 15 studio albums, four of which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Her biggest hits include &quot;Real Love&quot;, &quot;You Remind Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, &quot;Not Gon&#x27; Cry&quot;, &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;No More Drama&quot;, &quot;Be Without You&quot;, &quot;One&quot; (with U2), &quot;Just Fine&quot; and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single &quot;Family Affair&quot;.

Blige enhanced her popularity with an acting career. She was nominated for two Academy Awards, for her supporting role as Florence Jackson in &quot;Mudbound&quot; (2017) and the film&#x27;s song &quot;Mighty River&quot;, becoming the first person nominated for acting and songwriting in the same year. Her other film roles include &quot;Prison Song&quot; (2001), &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (2012), &quot;Betty and Coretta&quot; (2013), &quot;Black Nativity&quot; (2013), &quot;Trolls World Tour&quot; (2020), &quot;Body Cam&quot; (2020), &quot;The Violent Heart&quot; (2021), &quot;Respect&quot; (2021) and &quot;Rob Peace&quot; (2024). Her television work include the series &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot; (2019) and &quot;Power Book II: Ghost&quot; (2020–2024).

Blige received a Legends Award at the World Music Awards in 2006, the Voice of Music Award from ASCAP in 2007 and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018. In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her as the most successful female R&amp;B/Hip-Hop artist of the past 25 years. In 2017, the magazine named &quot;Be Without You&quot; as the most successful R&amp;B/Hip-Hop song of all time, as it spent a then-record 15 weeks atop the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and over 75 weeks on the chart. Blige was featured in listicles such as VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artist of All Time (2011), &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 most influential people in the world (2022) and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 200 Greatests Singers of All Time (2023). In 2024, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Early life and music career==
===1971–1991: Early life and career beginnings===
Mary Jane Blige was born on January 11, 1971, at Fordham Hospital in the Bronx, New York City, to nurse Cora and jazz musician Thomas Blige. She has an older sister, LaTonya Blige-DaCosta, a younger half-brother, Bruce Miller, and a younger half-sister, Jonquell, both from a relationship Blige&#x27;s mother had with another man after divorcing her first husband.

Blige spent her early childhood in Richmond Hill, Georgia, where she sang in a Pentecostal church. She and her family later moved back to New York and resided in the Schlobohm Housing Projects, located in Yonkers. The family subsisted on her mother&#x27;s earnings as a nurse after her father left the family in the mid-1970s. Her father was a Vietnam War veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism.

At age five, she was molested by a family friend; as a teenager she endured years of sexual harassment from her peers. She would eventually turn to alcohol, drugs and promiscuous sex to try to numb the pain. Blige dropped out of high school in her junior year.

Influenced by the music of Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan and Gladys Knight, she began pursuing a musical career. Blige spent a short time in a Yonkers band named &quot;Pride&quot; with band drummer Eddie D&#x27;Aprile. In early 1988, she recorded an impromptu cover of Anita Baker&#x27;s &quot;Caught Up in the Rapture&quot; at a recording booth in the Galleria Mall in White Plains, New York. Her mother&#x27;s boyfriend at the time later played the cassette for Jeff Redd, a recording artist and A&amp;R runner for Uptown Records. Redd sent it to the president and CEO of the label, Andre Harrell. Harrell met with Blige, and in 1989 at the age of 18, she was signed to the label as a backup vocalist for artists such as Father MC, becoming the company&#x27;s youngest and first female artist.

===1992–1996: &quot;What&#x27;s The 411?&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot;===
After being signed to Uptown, Blige began working with record producer Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy. He became the executive producer and produced a majority of her first album. The title &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; was an indication by Blige of being the &quot;real deal&quot;. &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; established Blige as a dynamic storyteller whose performances of love narrative drew upon both her musical influences and her lived experiences as an icon of the hip-hop-generation. The music was described as &quot;revelatory on a frequent basis&quot;. Blige was noted for having a &quot;tough girl persona and streetwise lyrics&quot;.
On July 28, 1992, Uptown/MCA Records released &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot;, to positive reviews from critics. &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It also peaked at number 53 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified three times Platinum by the RIAA. According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Dave DiMartino, with the record&#x27;s commercial success and Blige&#x27;s &quot;powerful, soulful voice and hip-hop attitude&quot;, she &quot;solidly connected with an audience that has never seen a woman do new jack swing but loves it just the same&quot;. According to Dave McAleer, Blige became the most successful new female R&amp;B artist of 1992 in the United States.

&quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; earned her two Soul Train Music Awards in 1993: Best New R&amp;B Artist and Best R&amp;B Album, Female. It was also voted the year&#x27;s 30th best album in the Pazz &amp; Jop—an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. By August 2010, the album had sold 3,318,000 copies in the US.
&quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; has since been viewed by critics as one of the 1990s&#x27; most important records. Blige&#x27;s combination of vocals over a hip hop beat proved influential in contemporary R&amp;B. With the album, she was dubbed the reigning &quot;Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot;
The album&#x27;s success spun off &quot;What&#x27;s the 411? Remix&quot;, a remix album released in December that was used to extend the life of the &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; singles on the radio into 1994, as Blige recorded her follow-up album.

Following the success of her debut album and a remixed version in 1993, Blige went into the recording studio in the winter of 1993 to record her second album, &quot;My Life&quot;.
The album was a breakthrough for Blige, who at this point was in a clinical depression, battling both drugs and alcohol – as well as being in an abusive relationship with K-Ci Hailey. On November 29, 1994, Uptown/MCA released &quot;My Life&quot; to positive reviews. The album peaked at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one of the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for selling 481,000 copies in its first week and remaining atop the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for an unprecedented eight weeks. It ultimately spent 46 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 84 weeks on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In 2002, &quot;My Life&quot; was ranked number 57 on &quot;Blender&quot;″s list of the 100 greatest American albums of all time. The following year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 279 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and in 2006, the record was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 greatest albums of all-time list.

Blige involved herself in several outside projects, recording a cover of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; for the soundtrack to the FOX series &quot;New York Undercover&quot;, and &quot;Everyday It Rains&quot; (co-written by R&amp;B singer Faith Evans) for the soundtrack to the hip hop documentary, &quot;The Show&quot;. Later in the year, she recorded the Babyface-penned and produced &quot;Not Gon&#x27; Cry&quot;, for the soundtrack to the motion picture &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;. The platinum-selling single rose to number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs in early 1996. Blige gained her first two Grammy nominations and won the 1996 Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for her collaboration with Method Man on &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You/You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;. Shortly after, Blige was featured on Jay-Z&#x27;s breakthrough single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Knock the Hustle&quot;, from his debut &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1996) and with Ghostface Killah on &quot;All That I Got Is You&quot; from his debut, &quot;Ironman&quot;, which was also released that year. In addition, Blige co-wrote four songs, provided background vocals and was featured prominently on two singles with fellow R&amp;B singer Case on his self-titled debut album (1996) including the US top 20 hit, &quot;Touch Me, Tease Me&quot;, which also featured then up-and-coming rapper Foxy Brown.

&quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; highlights the featuring of woman centered narratives although in this album her narratives were regularly policed and told through male emcees. Nonetheless, it marked the start of a transition towards black women centered narratives that focused on the daily experiences and troubles of the black experience through the lens of women rather than necessarily singing about black trauma. Treva B. Lindsey, in her piece &quot;If You Look in My Life: Love, Hip-Hop Soul, and Contemporary African-American Womanhood&quot;, highlights the regulating by men saying, &quot;Although the lyrics on &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; establish an African American woman-centered discourse, male artists&#x27; words of adoration and longing first introduce listeners to Blige as a hip-hop storyteller. &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot;, therefore, functions as an African American woman-centered storytelling space created largely by black men.&quot;

===1997–2000: &quot;Share My World&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot;===

On April 22, 1997, MCA Records (parent company to Uptown Records, which was in the process of being dismantled) released Blige&#x27;s third album, &quot;Share My World&quot;. By then, she and Combs had dissolved their working relationship. In his place were the Trackmasters, who executive-produced the project along with Steve Stoute. Sharing production duties were producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, R. Kelly, Babyface and Rodney Jerkins. The album was made at a time when Blige was trying to &quot;get her life together&quot;, by trying to overcome drugs and alcohol, as well as the ending of her relationship with Hailey. After an encounter with a person who threatened her life the previous year, she tried to quit the unhealthy lifestyle and make more upbeat, happier music. As a result, songs such as &quot;Love Is All We Need&quot; and &quot;Share My World&quot; were made.

&quot;Share My World&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned five hit singles: &quot;Love Is All We Need&quot; (featuring Nas), &quot;I Can Love You&quot; (featuring Lil&#x27; Kim), &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Missing You&quot; (UK only) and &quot;Seven Days&quot; (featuring George Benson). In February 1997, Blige performed her hit at the time, &quot;Not Gon&#x27; Cry&quot;, at the 1997 Grammy Awards, which gained her a third Grammy Award nomination, her first for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, as Blige was recording the follow-up to &quot;My Life&quot;. In early 1998, Blige won an American Music Award for &quot;Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album&quot;. That summer, she embarked on the Share My World Tour, which resulted in a Gold-certified live album released later that year, simply titled &quot;The Tour&quot;. The album spawned one single, &quot;Misty Blue&quot;.

On August 17, 1999, Blige&#x27;s fourth album, titled &quot;Mary&quot; was released. It marked a departure from her more familiar hip hop-oriented sound; this set featured a more earthy, whimsical, and adult contemporary-tinged collection of songs, reminiscent of the 1970s to early 1980s soul. She also appeared on &quot;In Concert: A Benefit for the Crossroads Centre at Antigua&quot; with Eric Clapton in 1999. On December 14, 1999, the album was re-released as a double-disc set. The second disc was enhanced with the music videos for the singles &quot;All That I Can Say&quot; and &quot;Deep Inside&quot; and included two bonus tracks: &quot;Sincerity&quot; (featuring Nas, Andy Hogan and DMX) and &quot;Confrontation&quot; (a collaboration with hip hop duo Funkmaster Flex &amp; Big Kap originally from their 1999 album &quot;The Tunnel&quot;).

The &quot;Mary&quot; album was critically praised, becoming her most nominated release to date, and was certified double platinum. It was not as commercially successful as Blige&#x27;s prior releases, though all of the singles: &quot;All That I Can Say&quot;, &quot;Deep Inside&quot;, &quot;Your Child&quot;, and &quot;Give Me You&quot; performed considerably on the radio. In the meantime, MCA used the album to expand Blige&#x27;s demographic into the nightclub market, as club-friendly dance remixes of the &quot;Mary&quot; singles were released. The club remix of &quot;Your Child&quot; peaked at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart in October 2000. In 2001, a Japan-only compilation, &quot;Ballads&quot;, was released. The album featured covers of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Overjoyed&quot;, and previous recordings of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; and Dorothy Moore&#x27;s &quot;Misty Blue&quot;. In 1999, George Michael and Mary J. Blige covered the song &#x27;As&#x27; written by Stevie Wonder, and worldwide outside of the United States, it was the second single from George Michael&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael&quot;. It became a top ten UK pop hit, reaching number four on the chart. It was not released on the U.S. version of the greatest hits collection or as a single in the U.S. Michael cited Blige&#x27;s record company president for pulling the track in America after Michael&#x27;s arrest for committing a lewd act. In January 2001, Blige performed as a special guest in the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show.

===2001–2004: &quot;No More Drama&quot; and &quot;Love &amp; Life&quot;===
On August 28, 2001, MCA released Blige&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;No More Drama&quot;. The first single in the album, &quot;Family Affair&quot; (produced by Dr. Dre) became her first and only number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it remained for six consecutive weeks. It was followed by two further hit singles, the European-only single &quot;Dance for Me&quot; featuring Common with samples from &quot;The Bed&#x27;s Too Big Without You&quot; by The Police, and the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis-produced title track (originally recorded for the &quot;Mary&quot; album), which sampled &quot;Nadia&#x27;s Theme&quot;, the piano-driven theme song to the daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Though the album sold nearly two million copies in the U.S., MCA was underwhelmed by its sales, and subsequently repackaged and re-released the album on January 29, 2002. The &quot;No More Drama&quot; re-release featured a new album cover and deleted three of the songs from the original track listing, while adding two brand-new songs—one of which was the fourth single and top twenty Hot 100 hit &quot;Rainy Dayz&quot;, (featuring Ja Rule), plus two remixes; one of the title track, serviced by Sean Combs/Puff Daddy and the single version of &quot;Dance for Me&quot; featuring Common. Blige won a Grammy for &#x27;Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance&#x27; for the song &quot;He Think I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. In April 2002, Blige performed with Shakira with the song &quot;Love Is a Battlefield&quot; on VH1 Divas show live in Las Vegas, she also performed &quot;No More Drama&quot; and &quot;Rainy Dayz&quot; as a duet with the returning Whitney Houston.

On July 22, 2002, MCA released &quot;Dance for Me&quot;, a collection of club remixes of some of her past top hits including the Junior Vasquez remix of &quot;Your Child&quot;, and the Thunderpuss mix of &quot;No More Drama&quot;. This album was released in a limited edition double pack 12&quot; vinyl for DJ-friendly play in nightclubs.

On August 26, 2003, Blige&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Love &amp; Life&quot; was released on Geffen Records (which had absorbed MCA Records.) Blige heavily collaborated with her one-time producer Sean Combs for this set. Due to the history between them on &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot;, which is generally regarded as their best work, and Blige having just come off of a successful fifth album, expectations were high for the reunion effort.

Despite the album debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and becoming Blige&#x27;s fourth consecutive UK top ten album, &quot;Love &amp; Life&quot;″s lead-off single, the Diddy-produced &quot;Love @ 1st Sight&quot;, which featured Method Man, barely cracked the top ten on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, while altogether missing the top twenty on the Hot 100 (although peaking inside the UK top twenty). The following singles, &quot;Ooh!&quot;, &quot;Not Today&quot; featuring Eve, &quot;Whenever I Say Your Name&quot; featuring Sting on the international re-release, and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wrap&quot; fared worse. Although the album was certified platinum, it became Blige&#x27;s lowest-selling at the time. Critics and fans alike largely panned the disc, citing a lack of consistency and noticeable ploys to recapture the early Blige/Combs glory. Blige and Combs reportedly struggled and clashed during the making of this album, and again parted ways upon the completion of it.

The album became Blige&#x27;s first album in six years to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 285,298 copies in the first week. &quot;Love &amp; Life&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. &quot;AllMusic&quot; gave it 4 stars and said the album &quot;beamed with joy&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it three stars, saying &quot;You may not always love Blige&#x27;s music, but you will feel her&quot;. The album was eventually certified Platinum by the RIAA for shipping over 1,000,000 copies in the US. The album was nominated for the Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album at the 46th Grammy Awards.

===2005–2006: &quot;The Breakthrough&quot; and &quot;Reflections – A Retrospective&quot;===

Geffen Records released Blige&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Breakthrough&quot; on December 20, 2005. For the album, Blige collaborated with J.U.S.T.I.C.E.

It is her second-longest charting single to date. The album produced three more singles including two more top-five R&amp;B hits—&quot;Enough Cryin&#x27;&quot;, which features Blige&#x27;s alter ego Brook-Lynn (as whom she appeared on the remix to Busta Rhymes&#x27;s &quot;Touch It&quot; in 2006); and &quot;Take Me as I Am&quot; (which samples Lonnie Liston Smith&#x27;s &quot;A Garden of Peace&quot;). Blige&#x27;s duet with U2 on the cover of their 1992 hit, &quot;One&quot; gave Blige her biggest hit to date in the UK, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart eventually being certified one of the forty highest-selling singles of 2006; it was her longest charting UK single.
The success of &quot;The Breakthrough&quot; won Blige nine &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, two American Music Awards, two BET Awards, two NAACP Image Awards, and a Soul Train Award.

The album peaked at number nine in the U.S., selling over 170,000 copies in its first week, while reaching number forty in the UK In 2006, Blige recorded a duet with rapper Ludacris, &quot;Runaway Love&quot;, which is the third single on his fifth album, &quot;Release Therapy&quot;.

Subsequent singles from &quot;Growing Pains&quot; include &quot;Work That&quot;, which accompanied Blige in an iTunes commercial, and &quot;Stay Down&quot;.

Together, they released a song called &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot;. In the same period, cable network BET aired a special on Blige titled &quot;The Evolution of Mary J.

Blige went on the Growing Pains European Tour, her first tour there in two years.

She has also been a spokesperson for Carol&#x27;s Daughter beauty products and Citibank&#x27;s Citi Card program (alongside Nickelback).

In 2004, Blige launched her own record label, Matriarch Records, distributed through Interscope. In 2012, she discovered girl group Just&#x27;Us, making the group the first ladies of the label. At the time, Blige said, &quot;These are my little Mary&#x27;s; they each remind me of myself at different points in my life.&quot; Blige was reportedly working with the group on their debut album, but it never materialized, and Just&#x27;Us has since disbanded.

In 2009, Blige&#x27;s production company, along with William Morris Endeavor, was working on several TV and film projects.

In July 2010, in partnership with the Home Shopping Network (HSN) and Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Blige launched her first perfume, My Life (through Carol&#x27;s Daughter), exclusively on HSN. The fragrance broke HSN sales records in hours, by selling 50,000 bottles during its premiere, and has been awarded two prestigious FIFI awards from the Fragrance Foundation, including the &quot;Fragrance Sales Breakthrough&quot; award. In August 2011, another scent called My Life Blossom was launched exclusively to HSN.

In October 2010, Blige released &quot;Melodies by MJB&quot;, a line of sunglasses. The first Melodies collection featured four styles with a total of 20 color options. Each style represented a specific facet of Blige&#x27;s life. In the spring of 2011, Essence magazine reported that &quot;Melodies by MJB&quot; had extended their collection to offer more styles.

In late 2020, Blige and her close friend, Simone Johnson-Smith, a cancer survivor and wife of rapper LL Cool J, co-founded Sister Love, a jewelry line for women. Blige also announced the 2019 formation of a film and television production label, Blue Butterfly Productions. On December 16, 2022, the label signed a first-look lucrative deal with BET for scripted and non-scripted content; its first under the partnership was Blige&#x27;s talk show, &quot;The Wine Down with Mary J. Blige&quot;, which premiered in early 2023.

She has founded two companies: Mary Jane Productions, which she co-founded with her former manager, Steve Stoute, in 1994, and an independent record label, Beautiful Life Productions, in 2023. She signed Boyz II Men affiliate group, WanMor to the former in August 2023 and New York rapper Vado to the latter in May 2024.

==Legacy==

Called the &quot;Queen of Hip-Hop Soul&quot;, Blige is credited with influencing the musical marriage of hip hop and R&amp;B. Ethan Brown of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; says that albums &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot;, in hindsight, invented &quot;the sample-heavy sound that reinvigorated urban radio and became a blueprint for nineties hip-hop and R&amp;B&quot;. Tom Horan of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; comments that Blige, being an immensely influential figure in popular music, &quot;invented what is now called R&amp;B by successfully combining female vocals with muscular hip hop rhythm tracks. All over the world, that recipe dominates today&#x27;s charts.&quot; Called one of the &quot;most explosive, coming-out displays of pure singing prowess&quot; and &quot;one of the most important albums of the nineties&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; saw Blige pioneer &quot;the movement that would later become neo soul, generating gripping songs that were also massive radio hits&quot;.

African American scholars have noted the implications of Blige&#x27;s presentation and representation of black womanhood and femininity in the typically male-dominated and centric sphere of hip hop. Blending the vocal techniques of rapping in hip hop with aspirational messages in R&amp;B, Blige is credited with articulating black women&#x27;s experiences in a &quot;more factual and objective&quot; manner than typical stereotypes and tropes of black women in the media. Using her personal experiences and struggles with her family as source material for her songs, Blige refutes notions of black female hypersexuality by &quot;imploring women to love and empower themselves through both autonomy and intimacy.&quot; This desire for love does more than connect to her audience members. With particular attention on her single &quot;Real Love&quot;, critics note how the song is &quot;a performative text, declaratively demand[ing] recognition of Blige&#x27;s full humanity and, more broadly, that of hip-hop-generation women.&quot;

Blige has received notable awards and achievements. In 2010, she was ranked 80th on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Artist of All Time. Blige was listed as one of the 50 most influential R&amp;B singers by Essence. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;My Life&quot; at number 279 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included on Time&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest albums of All Time. In 2020, both &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot; were featured in a rebooted list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at 271 and 126 respectively. Alternately called the &quot;Queen of R&amp;B&quot; for her success in the realm of R&amp;B, Blige has amassed ten number one albums on the R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart . Blige is also the only artist to have won Grammys in the R&amp;B, hip-hop, pop, and gospel fields.

Blige and her work have influenced several recording artists, including Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift, Layton Greene, Cheryl, Teyana Taylor, Keke Palmer, Jess Glynne, Sam Smith, Summer Walker, K. Michelle, Rihanna, Keyshia Cole and Alexandra Burke.

As an actress, Blige received the Breakthrough Performance Award at the 2018 Palm Springs International Film Festival for her role in &quot;Mudbound&quot;.

In 2020, Kamala Harris, the first Black and South Asian female Vice President-elect on a major party, walked out to &quot;Work That&quot; at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, campaign events (including her own presidential campaign), and her victory speech.

<doc id="214213" wikidata="Q5681" url="?curid=214213" title="Andrea Mantegna">
<text>Andrea Mantegna (, ; ; September 13, 1506) was an Italian Renaissance painter, a student of Roman archeology, and son-in-law of Jacopo Bellini.

Like other artists of the time, Mantegna experimented with perspective, e.g. by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. His flinty, metallic landscapes, and somewhat stony figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to painting. He also led a workshop that was the leading producer of prints in Venice before 1500.

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Mantegna was born in Isola di Carturo, Venetian Republic close to Padua. He was the second son of a carpenter, Biagio. At the age of 11, he became apprenticed to Paduan painter Francesco Squarcione. Squarcione, whose original profession was tailoring, appears to have had a remarkable enthusiasm for ancient art, and a faculty for acting. Like his famous compatriot Petrarca, Squarcione was an ancient Rome enthusiast: he traveled in Italy, and perhaps also in Greece, collecting antique statues, reliefs, vases, etc., making drawings from them himself, then making available his collection for others to study. All the while, he continued undertaking works on commission, to which his pupils, no less than himself, contributed.

As many as 137 painters and pictorial students passed through Squarcione&#x27;s school, which had been established around 1440 and which became famous all over Italy. Padua attracted artists not only from the Veneto but also from Tuscany, such as Paolo Uccello, Filippo Lippi and Donatello; Mantegna&#x27;s early career was shaped by impressions of Florentine works. At the time, Mantegna was said to be a favorite pupil of Squarcione, who taught him Latin and instructed him to study fragments of Roman sculpture. The master also preferred forced perspective, recollection of which may account for some of Mantegna&#x27;s later innovations. However, at the age of 17, Mantegna left Squarcione&#x27;s workshop. He later claimed that Squarcione had profited from his work without sufficient payment.

Mantegna&#x27;s first work, now lost, was an altarpiece for the church of Santa Sofia in 1448. The same year he was called, together with Nicolò Pizolo, to work with a large group of painters entrusted with the decoration of the Ovetari Chapel in the transept of the Sant&#x27;Agostino degli Eremitani. It is probable, however, that before this time some of the pupils of Squarcione, including Mantegna, had already begun the series of frescoes in the chapel of S. Cristoforo, in the church of the Eremitani, which are today considered a masterpiece. After a series of coincidences, Mantegna finished most of the work alone, though Ansuino, who collaborated with Mantegna in the Ovetari Chapel, brought his style from the Forlì school of painting. The now critical Squarcione carped about the earlier works of this series, illustrating the life of St James; he said the figures were like men made of stone, and should have been painted stone color.

This series was almost entirely lost in the 1944 Allied bombings of Padua. The most dramatic work of the fresco cycle was the work set in the worm&#x27;s-eye view perspective, &quot;St. James Led to His Execution&quot;. Though much less dramatic in its perspective than the &quot;St. James&quot; picture, the &quot;San Zeno&quot; altarpiece was around 1455 not long after the St. James cycle was finished, and uses many of the same techniques, including an architectural structure based on Classical antiquity.

The sketch for the &quot;St. Stephen&quot; fresco survived and is the earliest known preliminary sketch which still survives to compare with the corresponding fresco. The drawing shows proof that nude figures—which were later painted as clothed—were used in the conception of works during the Early Renaissance. In the preliminary sketch, the perspective is less developed and closer to a more average viewpoint however. Despite the authentic Classical look of the monument, it is not a copy of any known Roman structure. Mantegna also adopted the wet drapery patterns of the Romans, who took the form from the Greek invention, for the clothing of his figures, although the tense figures and interactions are derived from Donatello.

Among the other early Mantegna frescoes are the two saints over the entrance porch of the church of Sant&#x27;Antonio in Padua, 1452, and the 1453 &quot;San Luca Altarpiece&quot;, with St. Luke and other saints, for the church of S. Giustina and now in the Brera Gallery in Milan. As the young artist progressed in his work, he came under the influence of Jacopo Bellini, father of the celebrated painters Giovanni Bellini and Gentile Bellini, and met his daughter Nicolosia. In 1453 Jacopo consented to a marriage between Nicolosia and Mantegna.

===Aesthetic===
Mantegna was criticized for his body forms being too statuesque. His art, however, differentiates between ancient classical aesthetics in nude forms and purposeful depictions of sculptural illusion. The age-old criticism stems from Mantegna&#x27;s master teacher Francesco Squarcione of Padua, described in Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s &quot;The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.&quot; Pertaining to the Ovetari Chapel frescoes in the Church of Eremitani, Vasari writes that Squarcione stingingly remarked that &quot;Andrea would have done much better with those figures if he had given them the tint of marble and not all those colours; they would have been nearer to perfection since they had no resemblance to life.&quot; This is ironic since, according to Vasari, it was Squarcione&#x27;s love of ancient Roman art that influenced Mantegna. Mantegna is believed to have studied reproduced castings of these sculptures at Squarcione&#x27;s Studio. He was also influenced by the work of Donatello and models he himself sculpted to capture anatomy. Later in life, he was in Rome from 1488 to 1490 where he also studied sculptural masterpieces.

Andrea seems to have been influenced by his old preceptor&#x27;s strictures, although his later subjects, for example, those from the legend of St. Christopher, combine his sculptural style with a greater sense of naturalism and vivacity. Trained as he had been in the study of marbles and the severity of the antique, Mantegna openly avowed that he considered ancient art superior to nature as being more eclectic in form. As a result, the painter exercised precision in outline, privileging the figure. Overall, Mantegna&#x27;s work thus tended towards rigidity, demonstrating an austere wholeness rather than graceful sensitivity of expression. His draperies are tight and closely folded, being studied (it is said) from models draped in paper and woven fabrics gummed in place. His figures are slim, muscular and bony; the action impetuous but of arrested energy. Finally, tawny landscape, gritty with littering pebbles, marks the athletic hauteur of his style.

Mantegna never changed the manner which he had adopted in Padua, though his coloring—at first neutral and undecided—strengthened and matured. Throughout his works there is more balancing of color than fineness of tone. One of his great aims was optical illusion, carried out by a mastery of perspective which, though not always mathematically correct, attained an astonishing effect for the times.

Successful and admired though he was there, Mantegna left his native Padua at an early age, and never returned there; the hostility of Squarcione has been cited as the cause. He spent the rest of his life in Verona, Mantua and Rome; it has not been confirmed that he also stayed in Venice and Florence. In Verona between 1457 and 1459, he painted a grand &quot;altarpiece&quot; for the church of San Zeno Maggiore, depicting a Madonna and angels, with four saints on each side on the &quot;San Zeno Altarpiece&quot;, central panel, San Zeno, Verona. It was probably the first good example of Renaissance art in Verona, and inspired a similar painting by the Veronese artist Girolamo dai Libri.

===Work in Mantua===
The Marquis Ludovico III Gonzaga of Mantua had for some time been pressing Mantegna to enter his service; and the following year, 1460 Mantegna was appointed court artist. He resided at first from time to time at Goito, but, from December 1466 onwards, he moved with his family to Mantua. His engagement was for a salary of 75 lire a month, a sum so large for that period as to mark conspicuously the high regard in which his art was held. He was in fact the first painter of any eminence to be based in Mantua.

His Mantuan masterpiece was painted for the court of Mantua, in the apartment of the Castle of the city, today known as Camera degli Sposi (literally, &quot;Wedding Chamber&quot;) of Palazzo Ducale, Mantua: a series of full compositions in fresco including various portraits of the Gonzaga family and some figures of genii and others. The innovative spatial construction of the frescoes, particularly the oculus in the ceiling, had a profound effect on Antonio da Correggio.

The Chamber&#x27;s decoration was finished presumably in 1474. The ten years that followed were not happy ones for Mantegna and Mantua: Mantegna grew irritable, his son Bernardino died, as well as the Marchese Ludovico, his wife Barbara and his successor Federico (who had dubbed Mantegna &quot;cavaliere&quot;, &quot;knight&quot; ). Only with the election of Francesco II of the House of Gonzaga did artistic commissions in Mantua recommence. He built a stately house in the area of the church of San Sebastiano, and adorned it with a multitude of paintings. The house can still be seen today, although the pictures no longer survive. In this period he began to collect some ancient Roman busts (which were given to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici when the Florentine leader visited Mantua in 1483), painted some architectonic and decorative fragments, and finished the intense &quot;St. Sebastian&quot; now in the Louvre (&quot;box at top&quot;).

In 1488 Mantegna was called by Pope Innocent VIII to paint frescoes in a chapel Belvedere in the Vatican. This series of frescoes, including a noted &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, was later destroyed by Pius VI in 1780. The pope treated Mantegna with less liberality than he had been used to at the Mantuan court; but all things considered their connection, which ceased in 1500, was not unsatisfactory to either party. Mantegna also met the famous Turkish hostage Jem and carefully studied Rome&#x27;s ancient monuments, but his impression of the city was a disappointing one overall. Returned to Mantua in 1490, he embraced again his more literary and bitter vision of antiquity, and entered in strong connection with the new Marchesa, the cultured and intelligent Isabella d&#x27;Este. However, Isabella was not pleased with his attempt of a portrait of her in 1493. She said that &quot;the painter did it so badly that it has no features like our own&quot;.

In what was now his city he went on with the nine tempera pictures of the &quot;Triumphs of Caesar&quot;, which he had probably begun before his leaving for Rome, and which he finished around 1492. These superbly invented and designed compositions are gorgeous with the splendor of their subject matter, and with the classical learning and enthusiasm of one of the masters of the age. Considered Mantegna&#x27;s finest work, they were sold in 1628 along with the bulk of the Mantuan art treasures to King Charles I of England.

===Later years===
Despite his declining health, Mantegna continued to paint. Other works of this period include the &quot;Madonna of the Caves&quot;, the &quot;St. Sebastian&quot; and the famous &quot;Lamentation over the Dead Christ&quot;, probably painted for his personal funerary chapel. Another work of Mantegna&#x27;s later years was what is known as the &quot;Madonna della Vittoria&quot;, now in the Louvre. It was painted in tempera about 1495, in commemoration of the Battle of Fornovo, whose questionable outcome Francesco Gonzaga was eager to show as an Italian League victory; the church which originally housed the picture was built from Mantegna&#x27;s own design. The Madonna is here depicted with various saints, the archangel Michael and St. Maurice holding her mantle, which is extended over the kneeling Francesco Gonzaga, amid a profusion of rich festooning and other accessories. Though not in all respects of his highest order of execution, this counts among the most obviously beautiful of Mantegna&#x27;s works in which the qualities of beauty and attractiveness are less marked than those other excellences more germane to his severe genius, tense energy passing into haggard passion.

After 1497, Mantegna was commissioned by Isabella d&#x27;Este to translate the mythological themes written by the court poet Paride Ceresara into paintings for her private apartment (&quot;studiolo&quot;) in the Palazzo Ducale. These paintings were dispersed in the following years: one of them, the legend of the God Comus, was left unfinished by Mantegna and completed by his successor as court painter in Mantua, Lorenzo Costa. The other painters commissioned by Isabella for her studiolo were Perugino and Correggio.

After the death of his wife, Mantegna became at an advanced age the father of an illegitimate son, Giovanni Andrea; and, finally, although he continued embarking on various expenses and schemes, he had serious tribulations, such as the banishment from Mantua of his son Francesco, who had incurred the displeasure of the Marchese. The difficult situation of the aged master and connoisseur required the hard necessity of parting with a beloved antique bust of Faustina.

Very soon after this transaction he died in Mantua, on September 13, 1506. In 1516, a handsome monument was set up to him by his sons in the church of Sant&#x27;Andrea, where he had painted the altarpiece of the mortuary chapel. The dome is decorated by Correggio.

==Engravings==
Mantegna was no less eminent as an engraver, though his history in that respect is somewhat obscure, partly because he never signed or dated any of his plates, but for a single disputed instance of 1472. The account which has come down to us from Vasari (who was, as usual, keen to assert that everything flows from Florence) is that Mantegna began engraving in Rome, prompted by the engravings produced by the Florentine Baccio Baldini after Sandro Botticelli. This is now considered most unlikely as it would consign all the numerous and elaborate engravings made by Mantegna to the last sixteen or seventeen years of his life, which seems a brief period for them. Besides, the earlier engravings reflect an earlier period of his artistic style. It is possible that Mantegna may have begun engraving while still in Padua, under the tuition of a distinguished goldsmith, Niccolò. He and his workshop engraved about thirty plates, according to the usual reckoning; large, full of figures, and highly studied. It is now considered either that he only engraved seven himself, or none. Another artist from the workshop who made several plates is usually identified as Giovanni Antonio da Brescia (aka Zoan Andrea).

Among the principal examples are: &quot;Battle of the Sea Monsters&quot;, &quot;Virgin and Child&quot;, a &quot;Bacchanal Festival&quot;, &quot;Hercules and Antaeus&quot;, &quot;Marine Gods&quot;, &quot;Judith with the Head of Holofernes&quot;, the &quot;Deposition from the Cross&quot;, the &quot;Entombment&quot;, the &quot;Resurrection&quot;, the &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot;, the &quot;Virgin in a Grotto&quot;, and several scenes from the &quot;Triumph of Julius Caesar&quot; after his paintings. Several of his engravings are supposed to be executed on some metal less hard than copper. The technique of himself and his followers is characterized by the strongly marked forms of the design, and by the parallel hatching used to produce shadows. The closer the parallel marks, the darker the shadows were. The prints are frequently to be found in two states, or editions. In the first, the prints have been produced using a roller, or even by hand pressing, and they are weak in tint; in the second, a printing press has been used, and the ink is stronger.

Neither Mantegna or his workshop are now believed to have produced the so-called Mantegna Tarocchi cards.

==Assessment and legacy==
Giorgio Vasari Mantegna, although pointing out his character. He had been fond of his fellow pupils in Padua: and with two of them, Dario da Trevigi and Marco Zoppo, he retained steady friendships. Mantegna became very expensive in his habits, fell at times into financial difficulties, and had to press his valid claims for payment upon the attention of the Marchese.

In terms of Classical taste, Mantegna distanced all contemporary competition. Though substantially related to the 15th century, his influence on the style and trends of his age was very marked over Italian art generally. Giovanni Bellini, in his earlier works, obviously followed the lead of his brother-in-law Andrea. Albrecht Dürer was influenced by his style during his two trips in Italy, reproducing several of his engravings. Leonardo da Vinci took from Mantegna the use of decorations with and fruit.

Mantegna&#x27;s main legacy is considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, both in frescoes and in &quot;sacra conversazione&quot; paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries. Starting from the faint cupola of the Camera degli Sposi, Correggio built on the research of his master and collaborator into perspective constructions, eventually producing a masterwork like the dome of Cathedral of Parma.

<text>Route 77 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from an intersection with Route 49 in Bridgeton in Cumberland County north to a junction with Route 45 in Mullica Hill in Gloucester County. It is a mostly two-lane, undivided road traversing through farmland in Cumberland, Salem, and Gloucester Counties. Along the way, Route 77 intersects Route 56 in Upper Deerfield Township and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Upper Pittsgrove Township.

Prior to 1927, the route was a branch of pre-1927 Route 6 that ran from Bridgeton to Mullica Hill. In 1927, it was designated as Route 46, which replaced the Bridgeton-Mullica Hill branch of pre-1927 Route 6. In 1953, it was renumbered to Route 77 to avoid conflicting with US 46 in the northern part of the state.

==Route description==

Route 77 heads north from Route 49 and County Route 609 (CR 609) in Bridgeton, Cumberland County on Pearl Street. In a short distance, the route intersects CR 670 and then crosses CR 552, which ends a block to the west at Laurel Street. It continues north through residential areas of Bridgeton, meeting CR 665 and CR 659. Route 77 heads into a commercial area, passing under a Winchester and Western Railroad line and crossing into Upper Deerfield Township at the junction with Laurel Plaza Drive. The route intersects the western terminus of Route 56 and CR 622, where the route is briefly a four-lane road. Past this junction, Route 77 heads into farmland, where it encounters several county roads including CR 704, CR 617, and CR 658. It heads north into Seabrook, where it meets CR 743 and CR 711. Route 77 intersects CR 612 and CR 630 before crossing CR 540 in Deerfield. Past CR 540, the route has junctions with CR 640 and CR 730. Route 77 then encounters CR 614, the last county route intersection in Cumberland County.
Route 77 crosses into Upper Pittsgrove Township, Salem County, where it becomes Pole Tavern-Bridgeton Road, and crosses CR 611 in Shirley. It continues north through farms to Pole Tavern, where Route 77 meets US 40, CR 604, and CR 635 at Pole Tavern Circle. Past the Pole Tavern Circle, the route becomes Bridgeton Pike and crosses CR 660. Before leaving Salem County, Route 77 intersects two more county routes: CR 619 and CR 666.

Route 77 crosses Oldmans Creek into Elk Township, Gloucester County, meeting CR 641 and CR 616 before crossing CR 538. Past this junction, the route crosses CR 618 and enters Harrison Township. Route 77 continues northwest and enters Mullica Hill, where it intersects the northern terminus of CR 581 and heads north on South Main Street. Route 77 ends at Route 45, where Route 45 continues to the north on South Main Street.

==History==
Sections of today&#x27;s Route 77 appear on the earliest historical maps of southern New Jersey, and it may follow a Lenape trail known to early colonists as Cohawkin Road. Prior to 1927, the route was a branch of pre-1927 Route 6, which had run south from Camden and split into two branches in Mullica Hill that ran to Salem and Bridgeton. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 46 was designated along the former branch of pre-1927 Route 6 that ran from Bridgeton to Mullica Hill. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which stated that no state route and U.S. route could share the same number, Route 46 was changed to Route 77 to avoid a conflict with US 46 in North Jersey.

<text>Route 79 is a state highway located in Monmouth County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from an intersection of US 9 in Freehold Township north to an intersection of Route 34 and Main Street (CR 516 Spur) in Matawan. The route is a mostly two-lane undivided road that passes through a mixture of suburban residential, urban commercial, and open rural areas. The route interchanges with Route 33 in Freehold Township, intersects with Business Route 33 and CR 537 in Freehold, interchanges with Route 18 and intersects with CR 520 in Marlboro, and intersects with CR 516 in Matawan.

In 1927, the current alignment of Route 79 was designated as a part of Route 4, which was to run from Cape May to the George Washington Bridge, and US 9 was additionally designated along the route by the 1940s. After US 9 and Route 4 were moved to a new routing between Freehold and Cheesequake, the former route became Route 4A, a spur of Route 4. In 1953, Route 4A became Route 79 between Freehold and Matawan and an extension of Route 34 between Matawan and Cheesequake.

==Route description==

Route 79 begins at an intersection of US 9 in Freehold Township, heading north on South Street, a two-lane divided highway that soon becomes an undivided road. It interchanges with Route 33 and continues through a mix of residential and commercial areas. The route enters Freehold, where it crosses the intersection of Park Avenue (Business Route 33). Route 79 heads into Downtown Freehold, where it crosses the Freehold Industrial Track railroad line operated by the Delaware and Raritan River Railroad and intersects with West Main Street (CR 537). Here, the route heads northeast on West Main Street to run concurrently with CR 537 for a short distance. It eventually splits from CR 537 by forking to the left to head northeast on Broadway while CR 537 continues east-northeast on East Main Street. The route continues to travels north on Broadway, as it heads past homes and eventually passes by Freehold High School at the intersection of Route 79 and Dutch Lane Road (CR 46). Route 79 crosses back into Freehold Township, where it continues through suburban residential areas, with intermittent farms and woods. It heads into Marlboro. The route passes some businesses before it widens into a four-lane divided highway and comes to an interchange with Route 18.
Past this interchange, Route 79 heads through a mix of homes and businesses, narrowing back into a two-lane undivided road. The route continues as Route 79 at the intersection of School Road. The road passes through residential and commercial areas with some farm fields, along with passing by Marlboro High School, and then intersecting with Newman Springs Road (CR 520). Past this intersection, Route 79 continues north and heads into more suburban areas, with the Henry Hudson Trail parallel to the west of the road before it splits to the west. The road heads through wooded areas with some development, intersects with Tennent Road (CR 3) in Morganville, forming a short concurrency with that route that lasts until CR 3 heads northeast on Lloyd Road. Route 79 continues north through wooded neighborhoods and enters Matawan, where it becomes Main Street. It passes through residential areas and heads across the Henry Hudson Trail before the road crosses the intersection of Broad Street/New Brunswick Avenue (CR 516) in a commercial area. Route 79 continues a short distance north past this intersection to its northern terminus at the intersection of Route 34. At this intersection, unsigned CR 516 Spur continues northeast on Main Street.

==History==

What has become Route 79 is an original road for the area. On June 7, 1701, a patent was granted to John Johnstone for a road from old Oysterbank Landing (Matawan Creek) to Wickatunk. This would have roughly followed that Route 79 path. Almost the entirety of the road was maintained in the late 19th century as part of the Monmouth County Plank Road. Before 1927, what is today Route 79 was an unnumbered road. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the route was legislated as part of Route 4, which was to run from Cape May to the George Washington Bridge. Between 1932 and 1934, the State Highway Department took over this section of the route, and US 9 was realigned to follow this portion of road along with Route 4. Beginning with a bypass of Freehold in 1938, US 9 and Route 4 were moved to a new alignment between Freehold and Cheesequake, and the former alignment between these two points became Route 4A, a spur of Route 4. The realignment was completed by 1941. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 4A became Route 79 between Freehold and Matawan and an extension of Route 34 between Matawan and Cheesequake. On December 15, 2006, a project which rebuilt the intersection between US 9 and Route 79 was completed. This project&#x27;s goals included improved safety and reduced traffic congestion.

<text>The Oblongs is an American adult animated sitcom created by Angus Oblong and Jace Richdale. It was Mohawk Productions&#x27; first venture into animation. The series premiered on April 1, 2001, on The WB, and was cancelled due to low ratings on May 20, leaving the last five episodes unaired. The remaining episodes were later aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s late-night programming block Adult Swim in August 2002, with the series premiering on the network in production order. The series is loosely based on a series of characters introduced in a picture book entitled &quot;Creepy Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children&quot;.

Three networks had a bidding war to win the rights to turn Angus Oblong&#x27;s characters into a series: Fox, the WB, and ABC. Warner Bros. won the bidding to turn Oblong&#x27;s characters into a series; and thus, the series was submitted to the WB. The show was produced by Film Roman, Oblong Productions, Jobsite Productions and Mohawk Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, and the theme song for the series was composed and performed by They Might Be Giants. This was the only animated series to date to have been produced by Bruce Helford under Mohawk.

A total of 13 episodes were produced. All thirteen episodes of &quot;The Oblongs&quot; were released on DVD on October 4, 2005.

==Setting and premise==
The series focuses on the antics of a mutant family who live in a poor valley community. As a result of pollution and radiation exposure, they are all either disabled, deformed, or mutated. The pollution is the direct result of the lavish lifestyle of the rich community known as &quot;The Hills&quot;, whose residents exploit and harm the valley residents with absolutely no regard for their safety or well-being.

Many reviewers and fans see the series as a commentary on social stratification.

==Characters==
===The Oblong family===
* Bob Oblong (voiced by Will Ferrell) – Born with no arms or legs, Bob works at a poison factory called Globocide. Despite his deformities, he is very chipper and has a happy-go-lucky attitude. He is married to Pickles and is the father of Biff, Chip, Milo, and Beth. He mostly uses his mouth for tasking and moving his torso in ways that can help him get around.
* Marie Kay &quot;Pickles&quot; Oblong (voiced by Jean Smart) is a chain smoking alcoholic who was originally a Hill resident but moved to the valley after marrying Bob. Due to the hazardous atmosphere of The Valley, all of her hair has since fallen out (something which is usually hidden by an extremely tall blonde beehive wig), and she is now regarded as an outcast by her former Hill friends. While not bitter about losing her privileged life, she often expresses disdain towards her self-centered former neighbors in the Hills. She is the mother of Biff, Chip, Milo, and Beth, whom she loves dearly as much as she does her husband.
* Biff Oblong and Chip Oblong (voiced by Randy and Jason Sklar respectively) are 15-year-old conjoined twins who are attached at the waist and share a middle leg. Biff is a hard worker obsessed with sports while Chip is more laid back. It is frequently implied that Biff is gay and attracted to their unnamed gym teacher.
* Milo Oblong (voiced by Pamela Adlon) is the youngest son who is afflicted with numerous mental and social disorders. Despite his afflictions, he is a very forthright and benevolent boy, though he envies the Hill lifestyle and wishes to rise above his economic status. He has a single hair sticking up on his head, a squint in one eye, and wears a shirt that says &quot;NO&quot;.
* Beth Oblong (voiced by Jeannie Elias) is the youngest child and only daughter, she has a warty, elongated growth growing out of her head. Despite her appendage, she is shown to be better adjusted than the rest of her family.

===Recurring characters===
* Helga Phugly (voiced by Lea DeLaria) is an overweight, toad-like girl who holds the delusional belief that she is pretty and popular.
* Creepy Susie (voiced by Jeannie Elias) is a melancholic goth girl who speaks with a deadpan French accent and appears to float instead of walk as her legs are never shown.
* Peggy Weggy (voiced by Becky Thyre) is a girl who has one breast and lacks a lower jaw, causing her to spit and talk with a lisp. Despite her deformities, Peggy is cheerful and upbeat.
* Mikey Butts (voiced by Jeannie Elias) is a boy saddled with a dangling, doubled posterior.

==Episodes==

<doc id="214221" wikidata="Q1110560" url="?curid=214221" title="Umm Kulthum">
<text>Umm Kulthum (; 31 December 1898 – 3 February 1975) was an Egyptian singer, songwriter, and film actress active from the 1920s to the 1970s. She was given the honorific title (). Immensely popular throughout the Middle East and beyond, Kulthum is a national icon in her native Egypt; she has been dubbed &quot;The Voice of Egypt&quot; and &quot;Egypt&#x27;s Fourth Pyramid&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Kulthum at number 61 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Her funeral in 1975 drew a crowd of over 4 million people, the largest human gathering in Egypt&#x27;s history, even surpassing that of president Nasser.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Umm Kulthum was born in the village of &quot;Tamay El Zahayra&quot; within the markaz of Senbellawein, Dakahlia Governorate, to a family of a religious background. Her father, Ibrahim El-Sayyid El-Beltagi, was a rural imam, while her mother, Fatmah El-Maleegi, was a housewife. She learned how to sing by listening to her father teach her older brother, Khalid. From a young age, she showed exceptional singing talent. Through her father, she learned to recite the Qur&#x27;an, and she reportedly memorized the entire book. 
Her grandfather was also a well-known reader of the Qur&#x27;an and she remembered how the villagers used to listen to him when he recited the Qur&#x27;an. When she was 12 years old, having noticed her strength in singing, her father asked her to join the family ensemble. She subsequently joined as a supporting voice, initially just repeating what the others sang. On stage, she wore a boy&#x27;s cloak and bedouin head covering in order to alleviate her father&#x27;s anxiety about her reputation and public performance. At the age of 16, she was noticed by Mohamed Abo Al-Ela, a modestly famous singer, who taught her the old classical Arabic repertoire. A few years later, she met the famous composer and oudist Zakariyya Ahmad, who took her to Cairo. Although she made several visits to Cairo in the early 1920s, she waited until 1923 before permanently moving there. She was invited on several occasions to the home of Amin Beh Al Mahdy, who taught her to play the &quot;oud,&quot; a type of lute. She developed a close relationship with Rawheya Al-Mahdi, Amin&#x27;s daughter, and became her closest friend. Umm Kulthum even attended Rawheya&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s wedding, although she usually preferred not to appear in public, outside of her performances.

During the early years of her career, she faced staunch competition from two prominent singers: Mounira El Mahdeya and Fatheya Ahmed, who had voices similar to hers. El Mahdeya&#x27;s friend, who worked as an editor at &quot;Al-Masra&quot;, suggested several times that Umm Kulthum had married one of the guests who frequently visited her household; this affected her conservative father so much that he decided that the whole family should return to their village. He would only change his mind after being persuaded by the arguments of Amin Al Mahdi. Following this incident, Umm Kulthum made a public statement regarding visits in her household in which she announced she would no longer receive visitors. In 1923 she struck a contract with Odeon Records which by 1926 would pay her more than any other Egyptian musical artist per record.

== Professional career ==
Amin El Mahdi invited her into the cultural circles in Cairo. In 1924, she was introduced to the poet Ahmed Rami, who would later on write 137 songs for her, and would also introduce her to French literature and become her head mentor in Arabic literature and literary analysis.

In 1926, she left Odeon Records for His Master&#x27;s Voice who would pay her about double per record and even an additional $10,000 salary. She also maintained a tightly managed public image, which undoubtedly added to her allure. Furthermore, she was introduced to the renowned &quot;oud&quot; virtuoso and composer Mohamed El Qasabgi, who introduced her to the Arabic Theatre Palace, where she would experience her first real public success. Other musicians who influenced her musical performances at the time were Dawwod Hosni and . Al-Ila Muhammad instructed her in voice control, and variants of the Arabic &quot;Muwashshah.&quot;

By 1930, she was so well known to the public that she had become a role model for several young female singers. In 1932, she embarked upon a major tour of the Middle East and North Africa, performing in prominent Arab capital cities such as Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut, Rabat, Tunis, and finally Tripoli.

In 1934, Umm Kulthum sang for the inaugural broadcast of Radio Cairo, the state station. From then on onwards, she performed in a concert on the first Thursday of every month for forty years. Her influence kept growing and expanding beyond the artistic scene: the reigning royal family would request private concerts and even attend her public performances.

In 1944, King Farouk I of Egypt decorated her with the Supreme Class of the (&quot;nishan el kamal&quot;), a decoration reserved exclusively for female royalty and politicians. Despite this recognition, the royal family rigidly opposed her potential marriage to the King&#x27;s uncle, a rejection that deeply wounded her pride. It led her to distance herself from the royal family and embrace grassroots causes, exemplified by her acceptance of the request of the Egyptian legion trapped in the Faluja Pocket during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, who had asked her to sing a particular song. Among the army men trapped were the figures who would lead the 1952 Egyptian revolution, prominently Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Following the revolution, the Egyptian Musicians&#x27; Union of which she became a member (and eventually president), rejected her because she had sung for the then-deposed King Farouk of Egypt. When Nasser discovered that her songs were banned from being aired on the radio, he reportedly said something to the effect of &quot;What are they, crazy? Do you want Egypt to turn against us?&quot; Later, Nasser would schedule his speeches so they would not interfere with the radio performances of Umm Kulthum.

Some claim that Umm Kulthum&#x27;s popularity helped Nasser&#x27;s political agenda. For example, Nasser&#x27;s speeches and other government messages were frequently broadcast immediately after Umm Kulthum&#x27;s monthly radio concerts. She sang many songs in support of Nasser, with whom she developed a close friendship. One of her songs associated with Nasser—&quot;Wallāhi Zamān, Yā Silāḥī&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Been a Long Time, O Weapon of Mine&quot;)—was adopted as the Egyptian national anthem from 1960 to 1979, when President Sadat replaced it by the less militant &quot;Bilady, Bilady, Bilady&quot; following peace negotiations with Israel; it remains the Egyptian anthem to this day.

Umm Kulthum was also known for her continuous contributions to works supporting the Egyptian military efforts. Until 1972, for about half a century she gave at least one monthly concert. Umm Kulthum&#x27;s monthly concerts were renowned for their ability to clear the streets of some of the world&#x27;s most populous cities as people rushed home to tune in.

Her songs deal mostly with the universal themes of love, longing and loss. A typical Umm Kulthum concert consisted of the performance of two or three songs over a period of three to four hours. These performances are in some ways reminiscent of the structure of Western opera, consisting of long vocal passages linked by shorter orchestral interludes. However, Umm Kulthum was not stylistically influenced by opera, and she sang solo for most of her career.

During the 1930s her repertoire took the first of several specific stylistic directions. Her songs were virtuosic, as befitted her newly trained and very capable voice, and romantic and modern in musical style, feeding the prevailing currents in Egyptian popular culture of the time. She worked extensively with texts by romance poet Ahmad Rami and composer Mohammad El-Qasabgi, whose songs incorporated European instruments such as the violoncello and double bass, as well as harmony. In 1936 she made her debut as an actress in the movie &quot;Weddad&quot; by Fritz Kramp. During her career, she would act in five more movies, of which four would be directed by Ahmad Badrakhan while &quot;Sallama&quot; and &quot;Fatma&quot; would be the most acclaimed.

===Golden age===

Umm Kulthum&#x27;s musical directions in the 1940s and early 1950s and her mature performing style led this period to become popularly known as the singer&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot;. Keeping up with changing popular taste as well as her own artistic inclinations, in the early 1940s, she requested songs from composer Zakariya Ahmad and colloquial poet Mahmud Bayram el-Tunsi cast in styles considered to be indigenously Egyptian. This represented a dramatic departure from the modernist romantic songs of the 1930s, mainly led by Mohammad El-Qasabgi. Umm Kulthum had abstained from singing Qasabgi&#x27;s music since the early 1940s. Their last stage song collaboration in 1941 was &quot;Raq el Habib&quot; (&quot;The lover&#x27;s heart softens&quot;), one of her most popular, intricate, and high-calibre songs.

The reason for the separation is not clear. It is speculated that this was due in part to the popular failure of the movie &quot;Aida&quot;, in which Umm Kulthum sings mostly Qasabgi&#x27;s compositions. Qasabgi was experimenting with Arabic music, influenced by classical European music, and had been composing a lot for Asmahan, a singer who immigrated to Egypt from Syria. She was Umm Kulthum&#x27;s only serious competitor before her death in a car accident in 1944.

Simultaneously, Umm Kulthum started to rely heavily on a younger composer who joined her artistic team a few years earlier: Riad Al-Sunbati. While Sonbati was evidently influenced by Qasabgi in those early years, the melodic lines he composed were more lyrical and more acceptable to Umm Kulthum&#x27;s audience. The result of collaborations with Rami/Sonbati and al-Tunisi/Ahmad was a populist and popular repertoire that had lasting appeal for the Egyptian audience.

In 1946, Umm Kulthum defied all odds by presenting a religious poem in classical Arabic: Salou Qalbi [&quot;Ask My Heart&quot;], written by Ahmad Shawqi and composed by Ryad Al Sunbati. The success was immediate and it reconnected Umm Kulthum with her early singing years. Similar poems written by Shawqi were subsequently composed by Sonbati and sung by Umm Kulthum, including Woulida el Houda [&quot;The Prophet is Born&quot;] 1949), in which she surprised royalists by singing a verse that describes Muhammad as &quot;the Imam of Socialists&quot;.
At the peak of her career, in 1950, Umm Kulthum sang Sonbati&#x27;s composition of excerpts of what Ahmad Rami considered the accomplishment of his career: the translation from Persian into classical Arabic of Omar Khayyám&#x27;s quatrains (&quot;Rubayyiat el Khayyam&quot;). The song included quatrains that deal with both epicurianism and redemption. Ibrahim Nagi&#x27;s poem &quot;Al-Atlal&quot; [&quot;The Ruins&quot;], sung by Umm Kalthum in 1966 in a personal version and with a melody composed by Sonbati, is considered one of her signature songs. As Umm Kulthum&#x27;s vocal abilities had regressed considerably by then, the song can be viewed as the last example of genuine Arabic music at a time when even Umm Kulthum had started to compromise by singing Western-influenced pieces composed by her old rival Mohammed Abdel Wahab.
When Umm Kulthum sang live, the duration of each song was not fixed as she would repeat at length verses requested by the audience. Her performances usually lasted for up to five hours, during which three songs were sung. For example, the available live performances (about thirty in number) of Ya Zalemni, one of her most popular songs, varied in length from 45 to 90 minutes. Besides requests, it also depended on her creative mood for improvisations, illustrating the dynamic relationship between the singer and the audience as they fed off each other&#x27;s emotional energy. One of her improvisatory techniques was to repeat a single line or stance over and over, subtly altering the emotive emphasis and intensity and exploring one or various musical modal scales (&quot;maqām&quot;) each time to bring her audiences into a euphoric and ecstatic state known in Arabic as &quot;tarab&quot; طرب. This was typical of old classical Arabic singing, and she executed the technique for as long as she could have; both her regressing vocal abilities with age and the increased Westernization of Arabic music became an impediment to this art. Her concerts used to broadcast from 9:30 PM on Thursday until the early morning hours on Friday.
The spontaneous creativity of Umm Kulthum as a singer is most impressive when, upon listening to these many different renditions of the same song over a period of five years (1954–1959), the listener is offered a completely unique and different experience. This intense, highly personalized relationship was undoubtedly one of the reasons for Umm Kulthum&#x27;s tremendous success as an artist. It is worth noting, though, that the length of a performance did not necessarily reflect either its quality or the improvisatory creativity of Umm Kulthum.

===Later career===

Around 1965, Umm Kulthum started collaborating with composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Her first song composed by Abdel Wahab was &quot;Enta Omri&quot; [&quot;You Are My Life&quot;], and later became one of her iconic songs. In 1969 it was followed by another, Asbaha al-Ana &#x27;indi Bunduqiyyah [&quot;I now have a rifle&quot;]. Her songs took on a more soul-searching quality in 1967 following the defeat of Egypt during the Six-Day War. Hadeeth el Rouh [&quot;sermon of the soul&quot;], which is a translation of the poet Mohammad Iqbal&#x27;s &quot;Shikwa&quot;, set a very reflective tone. Generals in the audience are said to have been left in tears. Following the formation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 1971, she staged several concerts upon the invitation of its first president Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan to celebrate the event. Umm Kulthum also sang for composers Mohammad El Mougi, Sayed Mekawy, and Baligh Hamdi.

=== Death and funeral ===

Umm Kulthum died on 3 February 1975 aged 76, from kidney failure. Her funeral procession was held at the Omar Makram mosque and became a national event, with around 4 million Egyptians lining the streets to catch a glimpse as her cortège passed. Her funeral&#x27;s attendance drew a greater audience than the one of the Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. In the area where the funeral procession took place, traffic was cut off two hours ahead of the procession. The mourners would also wrest the casket from the shoulders of its bearers, force the procession to change its direction and brought her coffin to the prominent Al Azhar mosque. She was buried in a Mausoleum close to the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi&#x27;i in the City of the Dead in Cairo. Her death was a great tragedy for the country and also drew international media attention, as news of her death was reported by the &quot;American Times&quot; magazine and the German &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; magazine.

==Artistic legacy==
Umm Kulthum is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of Egyptian and Arabic music, with significant influence on a number of musicians, both in the MENA and beyond. Jah Wobble has cited her as a significant influence on his work, and Bob Dylan has been quoted praising her as well. Maria Callas, Marie Laforêt, Bono, and Robert Plant, among many other artists, are also known admirers of Kulthum&#x27;s music. Youssou N&#x27;Dour, a fan of hers since childhood, recorded his 2004 album &quot;Egypt&quot; with an Egyptian orchestra in homage to her legacy. One of her best-known songs, &quot;Enta Omri&quot;, has been covered and reinterpreted numerous times. &quot;Alf Leila wa Leila&quot; was translated into jazz on French-Lebanese trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;Kalthoum&quot;.

In Egypt, Umm Kulthum is nicknamed &quot;Elset&quot; (Egyptian Arabic: الست) meaning &quot;The Lady&quot; in Egyptian dialect, the word &quot;Elset&quot; is derived from the Ancient Egyptian name Aset or Eset, the ancient name of the goddess Isis, one of the most important goddesses of ancient Egypt. The nickname is often heard in her live records when ecstatic audience shout &quot;&quot;الله عليكي يا ست&quot; (English: may God bless you, Lady &#x27;Aset&#x27;) or &quot;عظمة علي عظمة يا ست&quot;&quot; (English: &quot;this is greatness upon greatness, Lady &#x27;Aset&#x27;) and that often happen after she ends a song or hit a high note.

She was referred to as &quot;the Lady&quot; by Charles de Gaulle as well and is regarded as the &quot;Incomparable Voice&quot; by Maria Callas. It is difficult to accurately measure her vocal range at its peak, as most of her songs were recorded live. Even today, she has retained a near-mythical status among young Egyptians and the whole of the Arabic World. In 2001, the Egyptian government opened the Kawkab al-Sharq (&quot;Star of the East&quot;) Museum in the singer&#x27;s memory. Housed in a pavilion on the grounds of Cairo&#x27;s Manesterly Palace, the collection includes a range of Umm Kulthum&#x27;s personal possessions, including her trademark sunglasses and scarves, along with photographs, recordings, and other archival material.

Her performances combined raw emotion and political rhetoric; she was greatly influential and spoke about politics through her music. An example of this is seen in her music performed after World War II. The theme at the surface was love, yet a deeper interpretation of the lyrics – for example in the song &quot;Salue Qalbi&quot; – reveals questioning of political motives in times of political tension. Umm Kulthum&#x27;s political rhetoric in her music is still influential today, not only in Egypt, but in many other Middle Eastern countries and even globally. Her entire catalogue was acquired by Mazzika Group in the early 2000s.

Umm Kulthum is also notable in Baghdad due to her two visits to Iraq, the first occurring in November 1932 and the second in 1946 upon the invitation of regent Abd al-Ilah. During those two visits, the Iraqi artistic, social and political circles took an interest in Umm Kulthum, and as a result, a large number of her fans and her voice lovers opened dozens of Baghdadi coffeehouses that bore her name in different places. Today, one of those coffeehouses, named &quot;Star of the East&quot; is preserved on al-Rashid Street and is still associated with her.

=== Voice ===
Umm Kulthum was a contralto. Contralto singers are uncommon and sing in the lowest register of the female voice. According to some, she had the ability to sing as low as the second octave and as high as the eighth octave at her vocal peak.

Her incredible vocal strength, with the ability to produce 14,000 vibrations per second with her vocal cords, required her to stand three feet away from the microphone. She was known to be able to improvise and it was said that she would not sing a line the same way twice. She was a student of Abu al-Ila Muhammad, starting from her arrival in Cairo up until his death in 1927. He taught her to adapt her voice to the meaning and melody of a traditional Arabic aesthetic.

== Remembrance ==
She is referenced at length in the lyrics of the central ballad &quot;Omar Sharif&quot; in the musical &quot;The Band&#x27;s Visit&quot;. A pearl necklace with 1,888 pearls, which she received from Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, is exhibited at the Louvre in Abu Dhabi. Even 40 years after her death, at 10 PM on the first Thursday of each month, Egyptian radio stations broadcast only her music in her memory.

In January 2019, at the Winter in Tantora festival in Al-&#x27;Ula, a live concert was performed for the first time with her &quot;appearing as a hologram with accompaniment by an orchestra and bedecked in flowing, full-length gowns as she had when debuting in the 1920s.&quot; Hologram concerts featuring her have been organized also by the Egyptian Minister of Culture Inas Abde-Dayem in the Cairo Opera and the Dubai Opera. A private museum was established for her in 1998.

<doc id="214223" wikidata="Q7527505" url="?curid=214223" title="James Swinburne">
<text>Sir James Swinburne, 9th Baronet, FRS (28 February 1858 – 30 March 1958) was a British electrical engineer and manufacturer. He was born in Inverness in 1858 into a well-known Northumbrian family. Educated at Clifton College, he went to work at a locomotive works in Manchester and later to a Tyneside firm where he became interested in electrical work. Often called the &quot;Father of British Plastics&quot;, Swinburne revolutionized the plastics industry throughout Europe and his native Britain.

Swinburne was a prominent engineer in the electrical industry. He worked on the first electric lightbulb and coined many new electrical words. Swinburne was a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) for a record-breaking 73 years, serving as president from 1902 to 1903. He was named a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1906. He soon joined the Faraday Society, serving as its president from 1909 to 1911. He briefly explored thermodynamics.

His involvement with plastic began with his introduction to phenol formaldehyde. Swinburne was so impressed with the possibilities of the product that he formed a company called Fireproof Celluloid Syndicate Limited, which was dedicated to research and marketing of the product. Swinburne and Leo Baekeland later founded the Damard Lacquer Company, which eventually became Bakelite Limited, which Swinburne served as chairman and, in 1948, as honorary president.

In 1934, Swinburne succeeded his kinsman as 9th Baronet of Capheaton, Northumberland.

Sir James Swinburne died a month after his 100th birthday.

==Family==
Swinburne had four children, two from his first marriage and two from his second;
*Anthony Swinburne, born 1887
*Spearman Charles Swinburne, born 1893
*Ida Swinburne, born 1899
*Marjorie Swinburne, born 1904
==Writings==
Swinburne authored a number of books, including: 
* &quot;Practical electrical units popularly explained : with numerous illustrations and remarks&quot; (London: E. &amp; F.N. Spon, 1883).
* &quot;Entropy; or, Thermodynamics from an engineer&#x27;s standpoint, and the reversibility of thermodynamics&quot; (Westminster: Constable, 1904).

<text>Route 156 is a long state highway in New Jersey, United States. It is a short connector in Yardville, a census-designated place which is part of Hamilton Township, Mercer County. It is an old two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 130 (US 130) that was bypassed by a new multi-lane highway a short distance to the east in the 1950s, and designated just before the 1953 renumbering of state highways. The route intersects Route 130 at both termini; it carries local traffic to and from US 130 southbound through Yardville. The route has remained mainly intact since 1953.

==Route description==

Route 156 begins at a right-in/right-out intersection with US 130 in Hamilton Township, just north of the Crosswicks Creek and the Bordentown Township, Burlington County border. The route passes a catering business before crossing Doctors Creek and heads northeast into the community of Yardville. In Yardville, the route parallels US 130 and several residential homes before intersecting Church Street (County Route 609 or CR 609) in the southern end of the community. After Church Street, the density of homes decrease and the road heads past a church and some businesses until it reaches a four-way stop intersection with South Broad Street (CR 672). A short distance after, Route 156 intersects CR 524 (Yardville-Allentown Road), which runs as the main thoroughfare in Yardville, at a signalized intersection. After CR 524, the highway continues to the northeast along the Route 130 parallel passing homes and local roads before the route merges back in with the southbound lanes at a different right-in/right out intersection.

There is no access to Route 156 to and from US 130 northbound; access to Route 156 and Yardville is provided through interchanges with each of the three county roads that intersect Route 156. Conversely, the only access to and from US 130 southbound is provided via Route 156.

==History==
Route 156 was originally an alignment of State Highway Route 25 (co-designated US 130) in the 1927 state highway renumbering through Yardville. The route was realigned on a bypass around 1952, a year before the 1953 renumbering, in which Route 25 was decommissioned. Route 130 ran on a four-lane bypass to the east, while the alignment in Yardville became Route 156. Except for the removal of a ramp from the northern terminus of the route to US 130 northbound between 2008 and 2010, the route has remained virtually unchanged since then.

In 2014, Route 156 had the highest number of crashes among New Jersey state highways with 14.09 crashes per million vehicle miles of travel. Steve Carrellas of the New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association stated that the design of undivided roads contributes to a high crash rate and that while major highways have more crashes, the high volume they carry lowers their crash rate.

<doc id="214232" wikidata="Q715191" url="?curid=214232" title="Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua">
<text>Francesco II Gonzaga (10 August 1466 – ) was the ruler of the Italian city of Mantua from 1484 until his death.

==Biography==
Francesco was born in Mantua, the son of Marquis Federico I Gonzaga.

Francesco had a career as a condottiero acting as Venice&#x27;s commander from 1489 to 1498. He was the commander-in-chief of the army of the Italian league in the battle of Fornovo, under the tutorage of his more experienced uncle Ridolfo Gonzaga: even though Francesco was unable to stop Charles VIII and his army from returning to France, he claimed Fornovo as a victory. Francesco was described as &quot;short, pop-eyed, snub-nosed and exceptionally brave, and was regarded as the finest knight in Italy&quot;.

Francesco briefly commanded the Venetian army, but in 1502 he left to pay his respects to Louis XII who was then at Milan. By 29 April, he was with Louis XII when Genoa fell to the French army. Francesco, taking the initiative after the French victory at Agnadello, was occupying lands that he had lost to Venice. He was marching to Legnago with a company of French lances, when he was captured by the Venetians. Francesco only gained his freedom by giving his son Federico II as hostage. Once free, he was placed in command of papal troops, although he was ineffective since he stayed in Mantua. By 17 February 1510, Francesco, no longer involved in the war, allowed a French army under Gaston of Foix to march through his territory to reach Brescia.

During Francesco&#x27;s absences, Mantua was governed by his wife Isabella d&#x27;Este, whom he had married on 12 February 1490. Under their reign, Mantua knew a great age of cultural splendour, with the presence in the city of artists such as Andrea Mantegna and Jacopo Bonacolsi. Francesco had the Palace of St. Sebastian built, where Mantegna&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of Caesar&quot; was eventually placed. The Palace was where Francesco lived when in Mantua. His wife, Isabella d&#x27;Este remained at the Castello di San Giorgio where she had her own suite of rooms. On completing the decoration of his rooms at the palace, Francesco asked his wife for her views. Isabella commented favourably, though she did say that the decorations were almost as good as those within her studiolo.

Beginning in 1503, he started a long relationship with Lucrezia Borgia.

On 29 March 1519, Francesco, who had suffered from syphilis, died. He was succeeded by his son Federico, with Isabella acting as regent. Another son, Ferrante Gonzaga originated the branch of the Counts of Guastalla.

== Loves ==
Francesco was known for his passion for women, so much so that, on the occasion of the siege of Novara in 1495, his sister-in-law Beatrice d&#x27;Este, wanting to ingratiate herself with him, offered to personally procure him a &quot;femmina di partito&quot; with whom to celebrate the victory, under the pretext of protecting both him and his wife and sister Isabella from malfrancese.

Francis also actively practiced sodomy, according to the ancient Greek custom, very widespread almost everywhere at that time, as he himself proudly claims in his poisonous letter of accusations to Galeazzo Sanseverino, dated 1503: &quot;I am reputed and raised by nobility of birth and good morals; you for human and ass favors (and I usually have a party at the door of others, and not at mine!)&quot;.

It is well known that he surrounded himself with ruffians and mezzani, who had the task of procuring for him girls and young ephebes. One of these was, among others, , who therefore ran into the hatred of the Marquise.

==Family==
Isabella d&#x27;Este and Francesco Gonzaga had:
# Eleonora Gonzaga, born 1493, died 1570. Married Francesco Maria I della Rovere Duke of Urbino
# Margherita, born 1496.
# Livia, born 1501, died 1508.
# Ippolita Gonzaga, born 1503, died 1570. Ippolita became a nun in the Dominican convent of S. Vincenzo.
# Federico II, Duke of Mantua, born 1500, died 1540. First betrothed to Maria Palaeologina but later married her sister Margaret Palaeologina
# Ercole Gonzaga, born 1506, died 1565. Became a Cardinal.
# Ferrante Gonzaga, born 1507, died 1557. Married Isabella di Capua.
# Livia, later known as Sister Paola, born 1508, died 1569

<doc id="214233" wikidata="Q174957" url="?curid=214233" title="Nina Simone">
<text>Nina Simone ( ; born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, composer, arranger, and civil rights activist. Her music spanned styles including classical, folk, gospel, blues, jazz, R&amp;B, and pop. Her piano playing was strongly influenced by baroque and classical music, especially Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.

The sixth of eight children born into a poor family in North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where, despite a well received audition, she was denied admission, which she attributed to racism. In 2003, just days before her death, the institute awarded her an honorary degree.

Early in her career, to make a living, Simone played piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to &quot;Nina Simone&quot; to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play &quot;the devil&#x27;s music&quot; or so-called &quot;cocktail piano&quot;. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot;. She released her first and biggest hit single in the United States in 1959 with &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot;, which peaked inside the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Simone also became known for her work in the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s, and she later fled the United States and settled in France following the assassination of her friend Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. She lived and performed in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. In 1991, Simone published her autobiography, &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; (taking the title from her famous 1965 album), and she continued to perform and attract audiences until her death.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has ranked Simone as one of the greatest singers of all time on various lists.

==Biography==
===1933–1954: Early life===
Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on February 21, 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina. Her father, John Divine Waymon, worked as a barber and dry-cleaner as well as an entertainer. Her mother, Mary Kate Irvin, was a Methodist preacher. The sixth of eight children in a poor family, she began playing piano at the age of three or four; the first song she learned was &quot;God Be With You, Till We Meet Again&quot;. Demonstrating a talent with the piano, she performed at her local church. Her concert debut, a classical recital, was given when she was 12. Simone later said that during this performance, her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people. She said that she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front, and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement. Simone&#x27;s music teacher helped establish a special fund to pay for her education. Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist her continued education. With the help of this scholarship money, she was able to attend Allen High School for Girls in Asheville, North Carolina.

After her graduation, Simone spent the summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School as a student of Carl Friedberg, preparing for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. Only three of 72 applicants were accepted that year, but as her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy. For the rest of her life, she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice, a charge the staff at Curtis have denied. Discouraged, she took private piano lessons with Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never could re-apply. At the time the Curtis Institute did not accept students over 21. She took a job as a photographer&#x27;s assistant, found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith&#x27;s vocal studio, and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.

===1954–1959: Early success===
In order to fund her private lessons, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar &amp; Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano, which increased her income to $90 a week. In 1954, she adopted the stage name &quot;Nina Simone&quot;. &quot;Nina&quot;, derived from &quot;&quot;, was a nickname given to her by a boyfriend named Chico, and &quot;Simone&quot; was taken from the French actress Simone Signoret, whom she had seen in the 1952 movie &quot;Casque d&#x27;Or&quot;. Knowing her mother would not approve of her playing &quot;the Devil&#x27;s music,&quot; she used her new stage name to remain undetected. Simone&#x27;s mixture of jazz, blues, and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base.

In 1958, she befriended and married Don Ross, a beatnik who worked as a fairground barker, but quickly regretted their marriage. Playing in small clubs in the same year, she recorded George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot; (from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;), which she learned from a Billie Holiday album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only &quot;Billboard&quot; top 20 success in the United States, and her debut album &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot; followed in February 1959 on Bethlehem Records. Because she had sold her rights outright for $3,000, Simone lost more than $1 million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of her version of the jazz standard &quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me&quot;) and never benefited financially from the album&#x27;s sales.

===1959–1964: Burgeoning popularity ===
After the success of &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot;, Simone signed a contract with producer Hecky Krasnow at Colpix Records and recorded a multitude of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her, including the choice of material that would be recorded, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live album &quot;Nina Simone at Town Hall&quot;, Simone became a favorite performer in Greenwich Village. By this time, Simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career.

Simone married Andrew Stroud, a detective with the New York Police Department, in December 1961. In a few years he became her manager and the father of her daughter Lisa, but Simone later claimed that he abused her psychologically and physically. Simone said that Stroud treated her &quot;like a work horse&quot; in an interview with the BBC in 1999.

===1964–1974: Civil Rights era===

In 1964, Simone changed record distributors from Colpix, an American company, to the Dutch Philips Records, which meant a change in the content of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that drew on her African-American heritage, such as &quot;Brown Baby&quot; by Oscar Brown and &quot;Zungo&quot; by Michael Olatunji on her album &quot;Nina at the Village Gate&quot; in 1962. On her debut album for Philips, &quot;Nina Simone in Concert&quot; (1964), for the first time she addressed racial inequality in the United States in the song &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot;. This was her response to the June 12, 1963, murder of Medgar Evers and the September 15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four young black girls and partly blinded a fifth. She said that the song was &quot;like throwing ten bullets back at them&quot;, becoming one of many other protest songs written by Simone. The song was released as a single, and it was boycotted in some southern states. Promotional copies were smashed by a Carolina radio station and returned to Philips.

She later recalled how &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot; was her &quot;first civil rights song&quot; and that the song came to her &quot;in a rush of fury, hatred and determination&quot;. The song challenged the belief that race relations could change gradually and called for more immediate developments: &quot;me and my people are just about due.&quot; It was a key moment in her path to Civil Rights activism. &quot;Old Jim Crow&quot;, on the same album, addressed the Jim Crow laws. After &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot;, a civil rights message was the norm in Simone&#x27;s recordings and became part of her concerts. As her political activism rose, the rate of release of her music slowed.

Simone performed and spoke at civil rights meetings, such as at the Selma to Montgomery marches. Like Malcolm X, her neighbor in Mount Vernon, New York, she supported black nationalism and advocated violent revolution rather than Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s non-violent approach. She hoped that African Americans could use armed combat to form a separate state, though she wrote in her autobiography that she and her family regarded all races as equal.

In 1967, Simone moved from Philips to RCA Victor. She sang &quot;Backlash Blues&quot; written by her friend, Harlem Renaissance leader Langston Hughes, on her first RCA Victor album, &quot;Nina Simone Sings the Blues&quot; (1967). On &quot;Silk &amp; Soul&quot; (1967), she recorded Billy Taylor&#x27;s &quot;I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free&quot; and &quot;Turning Point&quot;. The album &quot;&#x27;Nuff Said!&quot; (1968) contained live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair of April 7, 1968, three days after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She dedicated the performance to him and sang &quot;Why? (The King of Love Is Dead),&quot; a song written by her bass player, Gene Taylor. In 1969, she performed at the Harlem Cultural Festival in Harlem&#x27;s Mount Morris Park. The performance was recorded and is featured in Questlove&#x27;s 2021 documentary &quot;Summer of Soul&quot;.

Simone and Weldon Irvine turned the unfinished play &quot;To Be Young, Gifted and Black&quot; by Lorraine Hansberry into a civil rights song of the same name. She credited her friend Hansberry with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the album &quot;Black Gold&quot; (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and renditions of the song have been recorded by Aretha Franklin (on her 1972 album &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot;) and Donny Hathaway. When reflecting on this period, she wrote in her autobiography: &quot;I felt more alive then than I feel now because I was needed, and I could sing something to help my people.&quot;

===1974–1993: Later life===
In an interview for &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, Simone stated that her controversial song &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot; harmed her career. She claimed that the music industry punished her by boycotting her records. Hurt and disappointed, Simone left the US in September 1970, flying to Barbados and expecting her husband and manager Stroud to communicate with her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone&#x27;s sudden disappearance, and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of her desire for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone&#x27;s income. When Simone returned to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (allegedly unpaid as a protest against her country&#x27;s involvement with the Vietnam War) and fled to Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution. Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time and had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. When Simone relocated, she abandoned her daughter Lisa in Mount Vernon. Lisa eventually reunited with Simone in Liberia, but, according to Lisa, her mother was physically and mentally abusive. The abuse was so unbearable that Lisa became suicidal and she moved back to New York to live with her father.

Simone recorded her last album for RCA, &quot;It Is Finished&quot;, in 1974, and did not make another record until 1978, when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio by CTI Records owner Creed Taylor. The result was the album &quot;Baltimore&quot;, which, while not a commercial success, was fairly well received critically and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone&#x27;s recording output. Her choice of material retained its eclecticism, ranging from spiritual songs to Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; &quot;Rich Girl&quot;. Four years later, Simone recorded &quot;Fodder on My Wings&quot; on a French label, Studio Davout.

During the 1980s, Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London, where she recorded the album &quot;Live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s&quot; in 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging with her audiences sometimes, by recounting humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and by soliciting requests. By this time she stayed everywhere and nowhere. She lived in Liberia, Barbados and Switzerland and eventually ended up in Paris. There she regularly performed in a small jazz club called &quot;Aux Trois Mailletz&quot; for relatively small financial reward. The performances were sometimes brilliant and at other times Nina Simone gave up after fifteen minutes. Often she was too drunk to sing or play the piano properly. At other times she scolded the audience, so that manager Raymond Gonzalez, guitarist Al Schackman and Gerrit de Bruin, a Dutch friend of hers, decided to intervene.

In 1987, Simone scored a major European hit with the song &quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me&quot;. Recorded by her for the first time in 1958, the song was used in a commercial for Chanel No. 5 perfume in Europe, leading to a re-release of the recording. The song reached number 4 on the UK&#x27;s &quot;NME&quot; singles chart, giving Simone a brief surge in popularity in the UK and elsewhere.

In the spring of 1988, Simone moved to Nijmegen in the Netherlands. She bought an apartment next to the Belvoir Hotel with views of the Waalbrug and Ooijpolder, with the help of her friend Gerrit de Bruin, who lived with his family a few corners away. Simone was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a friend of De Bruin, who prescribed Trilafon for her. Despite the illness, it was generally a happy time for Simone in Nijmegen, where she could lead a fairly anonymous life. Only a few recognized her; most Nijmegen people did not know who she was. Slowly but surely her life started to improve, and she was even able to make money from the Chanel commercial after a legal battle. In 1991 Nina Simone exchanged Nijmegen for Amsterdam, where she lived for two years with friends and Hammond.

===1993–2003: Final years, illness and death===
In 1993, Simone settled near Aix-en-Provence in southern France (Bouches-du-Rhône). In the same year, her final album, &quot;A Single Woman&quot;, was released. She variously contended that she married or had a love affair with a Tunisian around this time, but that their relationship ended because, &quot;His family didn&#x27;t want him to move to France, and France didn&#x27;t want him because he&#x27;s a North African.&quot; During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to come see me again, you&#x27;ve got to come to France, because I am not coming back.&quot; She suffered from breast cancer for several years before she died in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet (Bouches-du-Rhône), on April 21, 2003, at the age of 70. Her Catholic funeral service at the local parish was attended by singers Miriam Makeba and Patti LaBelle, poet Sonia Sanchez, actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, and hundreds of others. Simone&#x27;s ashes were scattered in several African countries. Her daughter Lisa Celeste Stroud is an actress and singer who took the stage name Simone, and who has appeared on Broadway in &quot;Aida&quot;.
== Activism ==
=== Influence ===
Simone&#x27;s consciousness on the racial and social discourse was prompted by her friendship with the playwright Lorraine Hansberry. Simone stated that during her conversations with Hansberry &quot;we never talked about men or clothes. It was always Marx, Lenin and revolution – real girls&#x27; talk.&quot; The influence of Hansberry planted the seed for the provocative social commentary that became an expectation in Simone&#x27;s repertoire. One of Nina&#x27;s more hopeful activism anthems, &quot;To Be Young, Gifted and Black&quot;, was written with collaborator Weldon Irvine in the years following the playwright&#x27;s passing, acquiring the title of one of Hansberry&#x27;s unpublished plays. Simone&#x27;s social circles included notable black activists such as James Baldwin, Stokely Carmichael and Langston Hughes: the lyrics of her song &quot;Backlash Blues&quot; were written by Hughes.

=== Beyond the civil rights movement ===
Simone&#x27;s social commentary was not limited to the civil rights movement; the song &quot;Four Women&quot; exposed the Eurocentric appearance standards imposed on Black women in America, as it explored the internalized dilemma of beauty that is experienced between four Black women with skin tones ranging from light to dark. She explains in her autobiography &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; that the purpose of the song was to inspire Black women to define beauty and identity for themselves without the influence of societal impositions. Chardine Taylor-Stone has noted that, beyond the politics of beauty, the song also describes the stereotypical roles that many Black women have historically been restricted to: the mammy, the tragic mulatto, the sex worker, and the angry Black woman.

==Artistry==
===Simone standards===
Simone assembled a collection of songs that became standards in her repertoire. Some were songs that she wrote herself, while others were new arrangements of other standards, and others had been written especially for the singer. Her first hit song in America was her rendition of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot; (1958). It peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Hot 100 chart.

During that same period, Simone recorded &quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me&quot;, which would become her biggest success years later, in 1987, after it was featured in a 1986 Chanel No. 5 perfume commercial. A music video was also created by Aardman Studios. Well-known songs from her Philips albums include &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; on &quot;Broadway-Blues-Ballads&quot; (1964); &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; (a rendition of a Jacques Brel song), and &quot;Feeling Good&quot; on &quot;I Put a Spell On You&quot; (1965); and &quot;Lilac Wine&quot; and &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; on &quot;Wild is the Wind&quot; (1966).

&quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; and her takes on &quot;Sinnerman&quot; (&quot;Pastel Blues&quot;, 1965) and &quot;Feeling Good&quot; have remained popular in cover versions (most notably a version of the former song by The Animals), sample usage, and their use on soundtracks for various movies, television series, and video games. &quot;Sinnerman&quot; has been featured in the films &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; (1952), &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1999), &quot;High Crimes&quot; (2002), &quot;Cellular&quot; (2004), &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (2006), &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (2006), &quot;Golden Door&quot; (2006), &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006), &quot;Harriet&quot; (2019) and &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; (2021), as well as in TV series such as &quot;&quot; (1998, &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;), &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (2000, &quot;Jackpot&quot;), &quot;Scrubs&quot; (2001, &quot;My Own Personal Jesus&quot;), &quot;Chuck&quot; (2010, &quot;Chuck vs. the Honeymooners&quot;), &quot;Boomtown&quot; (2003, &quot;The Big Picture&quot;), &quot;Person of Interest&quot; (2011, &quot;Witness&quot;), &quot;Shameless&quot; (2011, &quot;Kidnap and Ransom&quot;), &quot;Love/Hate&quot; (2011, &quot;Episode 1&quot;), &quot;Sherlock&quot; (2012, &quot;The Reichenbach Fall&quot;), &quot;The Blacklist&quot; (2013, &quot;The Freelancer&quot;), &quot;Vinyl&quot; (2016, &quot;The Racket&quot;), &quot;Lucifer&quot; (2017, &quot;Favorite Son&quot;), and &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot; (2019, &quot;Extra Ordinary&quot;), and sampled by artists such as Talib Kweli (2003, &quot;Get By&quot;), Timbaland (2007, &quot;Oh Timbaland&quot;), and Flying Lotus (2012, &quot;Until the Quiet Comes&quot;). The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; was sampled by Devo Springsteen on &quot;Misunderstood&quot; from Common&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Finding Forever&quot;, and by little-known producers Rodnae and Mousa for the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Get It&quot; on Lil Wayne&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Tha Carter III&quot;. &quot;See-Line Woman&quot; was sampled by Kanye West for &quot;Bad News&quot; on his album &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;. The 1965 rendition of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, originally recorded by Billie Holiday, was sampled by Kanye West for &quot;Blood on the Leaves&quot; on his album &quot;Yeezus&quot;.

Simone&#x27;s years at RCA spawned many singles and album tracks that were popular, particularly in Europe. In 1968, it was &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No, I Got Life&quot;, a medley from the musical &quot;Hair&quot; from the album &quot;&#x27;Nuff Said!&quot; (1968) that became a surprise hit for Simone, reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and introducing her to a younger audience. In 2006, it returned to the UK Top 30 in a remixed version by Groovefinder.

The following single, a rendition of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, also reached the UK Top 10 in 1969. &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; was featured on &quot;Nina Simone Sings the Blues&quot; in 1967, but Simone had recorded the song in 1961 and it was featured on &quot;Nina at the Village Gate&quot; (1962).

===Performance style===
Simone&#x27;s bearing and stage presence earned her the title &quot;the High Priestess of Soul&quot;. She was a pianist, singer and performer, &quot;separately, and simultaneously&quot;. As a composer and arranger, Simone moved from gospel to blues, jazz, and folk, and to numbers with European classical styling. Besides using Bach-style counterpoint, she called upon the particular virtuosity of the 19th-century Romantic piano repertoire—Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and others. Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis spoke highly of Simone, deeply impressed by her ability to play three-part counterpoint and incorporate it into pop songs and improvisation. Onstage, she incorporated monologues and dialogues with the audience into the program, and often used silence as a musical element. Throughout most of her life and recording career she was accompanied by percussionist Leopoldo Fleming and guitarist and musical director Al Schackman. She was known to pay close attention to the design and acoustics of each venue, tailoring her performances to individual venues. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; once said that Simone could &quot;channel every facet of lived experience.&quot; Simone was often credited for her ability to express an expansive emotional range in her music, from immeasurable rage to limitless joy.

Simone was perceived as a sometimes difficult or unpredictable performer, occasionally hectoring the audience if she felt they were disrespectful. Schackman would try to calm Simone during these episodes, performing solo until she calmed offstage and returned to finish the engagement. Her early experiences as a classical pianist had conditioned Simone to expect quiet attentive audiences, and her anger tended to flare up at nightclubs, lounges, or other locations where patrons were less attentive. Schackman described her live appearances as hit or miss, either reaching heights of hypnotic brilliance or on the other hand mechanically playing a few songs and then abruptly ending concerts early.

=== Critical reputation ===
Simone is regarded as one of the most influential recording artists of 20th-century jazz, cabaret and R&amp;B genres. According to Rickey Vincent, she was a pioneering musician whose career was characterized by &quot;fits of outrage and improvisational genius&quot;. Pointing to her composition of &quot;Mississippi Goddam,&quot; Vincent said Simone broke the mold, having the courage as &quot;an established black musical entertainer to break from the norms of the industry and produce direct social commentary in her music during the early 1960s&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;her honey-coated, slightly adenoidal cry was one of the most affecting voices of the civil rights movement,&quot; while making note of her ability to &quot;belt barroom blues, croon cabaret and explore jazz—sometimes all on a single record&quot;. In the opinion of AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming, she was &quot;one of the most gifted vocalists of her generation, and also one of the most eclectic&quot;. Creed Taylor, who wrote the liner notes for Simone&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Baltimore&quot; album, said the singer possessed a &quot;magnificent intensity&quot; that &quot;turns everything—even the most simple, mundane phrase or lyric—into a radiant, poetic message&quot;. Jim Fusilli, music critic for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, writes that Simone&#x27;s music is still relevant today: &quot;it didn&#x27;t adhere to ephemeral trends, it isn&#x27;t a relic of a bygone era; her vocal delivery and technical skills as a pianist still dazzle; and her emotional performances have a visceral impact.&quot;

&quot;She is loved or feared, adored or disliked,&quot; Maya Angelou wrote in 1970, &quot;but few who have met her music or glimpsed her soul react with moderation.&quot;

==Health==
Simone was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the late 1980s. She was known for her temper and outbursts of aggression. In 1985, Simone fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she &quot;tried to kill him&quot; but &quot;missed.&quot; In 1995, while living in France, she shot and wounded her neighbor&#x27;s son with an air gun after the boy&#x27;s laughter disturbed her concentration and she perceived his response to her complaints as racial insults; she was sentenced to eight months in jail, which was suspended pending a psychiatric evaluation and treatment.

According to a biographer, Simone took medication from the mid-1960s onward, although this was supposedly only known to a small group of intimates. After her death, the medication was confirmed as the anti-psychotic Trilafon, which Simone&#x27;s friends and caretakers sometimes surreptitiously mixed into her food when she refused to follow her treatment plan. This fact was kept out of public view until 2004 when a biography, &quot;Break Down and Let It All Out&quot;, written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan (of her UK fan club), was published posthumously. Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone&#x27;s, related in her own autobiography, &quot;Society&#x27;s Child: My Autobiography&quot;, two instances to illustrate Simone&#x27;s volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier at gunpoint to take back a pair of sandals she&#x27;d already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian&#x27;s songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.

==Awards and recognition==
Simone was the recipient of a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2000 for her interpretation of &quot;I Loves You, Porgy&quot;. On Human Kindness Day 1974 in Washington, D.C., more than 10,000 people paid tribute to Simone.
Simone received two honorary degrees in music and humanities, from Amherst College and Malcolm X College. She preferred to be called &quot;Dr. Nina Simone&quot; after these honors were bestowed upon her. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.

Two days before her death, Simone learned she would be awarded an honorary degree by the Curtis Institute of Music, the music school that had refused to admit her as a student at the beginning of her career.

Simone has received four career Grammy Award nominations, two during her lifetime and two posthumously. In 1968, she received her first nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the track &quot;(You&#x27;ll) Go to Hell&quot; from her thirteenth album &quot;Silk &amp; Soul&quot; (1967). The award went to &quot;Respect&quot; by Aretha Franklin.

Simone garnered a second nomination in the category in 1971, for her &quot;Black Gold&quot; album, when she again lost to Franklin for &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song (You Lied)&quot;. Franklin would again win for her cover of Simone&#x27;s &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot; two years later in the same category. In 2016, Simone posthumously received a nomination for Best Music Film for the Netflix documentary &quot;What Happened, Miss Simone?&quot; and in 2018 she received a nomination for Best Rap Song as a songwriter for Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Story of O.J.&quot; from his &quot;4:44&quot; album, which contained a sample of &quot;Four Women&quot; by Simone.

In 1999, Simone was given a lifetime achievement award by the Irish Music Hall of Fame, presented by Sinead O&#x27;Connor.

In 2018, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by fellow R&amp;B artist Mary J. Blige.

In 2019, &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Simone was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2021.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Simone at No. 21 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Legacy and influence==
===Music===
Simone&#x27;s music has been featured in soundtracks of various motion pictures and video games, including &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990), &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1993), &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; (1994)&quot;,&quot; &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (1999), &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1999), &quot;Disappearing Acts&quot; (2000), &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2001), &quot;The Dancer Upstairs&quot; (2002), &quot;Before Sunset&quot; (2004), &quot;Cellular&quot; (2004), &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006), &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (2006), &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008), &quot;The World Unseen&quot; (2008), &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; (2008), &quot;Home&quot; (2008), &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2009), &quot;The Saboteur&quot; (2009), &quot;Repo Men&quot; (2010), &quot;Beyond the Lights&quot; (2014), &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&quot; (2016), &quot;Nobody&quot; (2021), and &quot;A Quiet Place: Day One&quot; (2024). Frequently her music is used in remixes, commercials, and TV series including &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, which featured prominently in the Season Four Promo of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2004). Simone&#x27;s &quot;Take Care of Business&quot; is the closing theme of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (2015), Simone&#x27;s cover of Janis Ian&#x27;s &quot;Stars&quot; is played during the final moments of the season 3 finale of &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; (2016), and &quot;I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; were included in the film &quot;Acrimony&quot; (2018).

===Film===
The documentary &quot;Nina Simone: La légende&quot; (&quot;The Legend&quot;) was made in the 1990s by French filmmakers and based on her autobiography &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;. It features live footage from different periods of her career, interviews with family, various interviews with Simone then living in the Netherlands, and while on a trip to her birthplace. A portion of footage from &quot;The Legend&quot; was taken from an earlier 26-minute biographical documentary by Peter Rodis, released in 1969 and entitled simply &quot;Nina&quot;. Her filmed 1976 performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival is available on video courtesy of Mercury Studios and is screened annually in New York City at an event called &quot;The Rise and Fall of Nina Simone: Montreux, 1976&quot;, which is curated by Tom Blunt.

Footage of Simone singing &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot; for 40,000 marchers at the end of the Selma to Montgomery marches can be seen in the 1970 documentary &quot;&quot; and the 2015 Liz Garbus documentary &quot;What Happened, Miss Simone?&quot;

Plans for a Simone biographical film were released at the end of 2005, to be based on Simone&#x27;s autobiography &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; (1992) and to focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006; Simone&#x27;s daughter, Lisa Simone Kelly, has since refuted the existence of a romantic relationship between Simone and Henderson on account of his homosexuality. Cynthia Mort (screenwriter of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; and &quot;Roseanne&quot;), wrote the screenplay and directed the 2016 film &quot;Nina&quot;, starring Zoe Saldana, who since openly apologized for taking the controversial title role.

In 2015, two documentary features about Simone&#x27;s life and music were released. The first, directed by Liz Garbus, &quot;What Happened, Miss Simone?&quot; was produced in cooperation with Simone&#x27;s estate and her daughter, who also served as the film&#x27;s executive producer. The film was produced as a counterpoint to the unauthorized Cynthia Mort film (&quot;Nina&quot;, 2016), and featured previously unreleased archival footage. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2015 and was distributed by Netflix on June 26, 2015. It was nominated on January 14, 2016, for a 2016 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

The second documentary in 2015, &quot;The Amazing Nina Simone&quot; is an independent film written and directed by Jeff L. Lieberman, who initially consulted with Simone&#x27;s daughter, Lisa before going the independent route and then worked closely with Simone&#x27;s siblings, predominantly Sam Waymon. The film debuted in cinemas in October 2015, and has since played more than 100 theaters in 10 countries.

===Drama===
She is the subject of &quot;Nina: A Story About Me and Nina Simone&quot;, a one-woman show first performed in 2016 at the Unity Theatre, Liverpool—a &quot;deeply personal and often searing show inspired by the singer and activist Nina Simone&quot;—and which in July 2017 ran at the Young Vic, before being scheduled to move to Edinburgh&#x27;s Traverse Theatre. Simone is also the focus of another play that premiered in 2016, &quot;Nina Simone: Four Women&quot;, by Christina Ham. This &quot;play looks at Nina Simone’s shift from artist to activist after the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham and the murder of Medgar Evers.&quot;

===Books===
As well as her 1992 autobiography &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; (1992), written with Stephen Cleary, Simone has been the subject of several books. They include &quot;Nina Simone: Break Down and Let It All Out&quot; (2004) by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan; &quot;Princess Noire&quot; (2010) by Nadine Cohodas; &quot;Nina Simone&quot; (2004) by Kerry Acker; &quot;Nina Simone, Black Is the Color&quot; (2005) by Andrew Stroud; &quot;Nina Simone&quot; (2013) by Richard Elliott; and &quot;What Happened, Miss Simone?&quot; (2016) by Alan Light.

Simone inspired a book of poetry, &quot;Me and Nina&quot;, by Monica Hand, and is the focus of musician Warren Ellis&#x27;s book &quot;Nina Simone&#x27;s Gum&quot; (2021).

===Honors===
In 2002, the city of Nijmegen, Netherlands, named a street after her, as &quot;Nina Simone Street&quot;: she had lived in Nijmegen between 1988 and 1990. On August 29, 2005, the city of Nijmegen, the De Vereeniging concert hall, and more than 50 artists (among whom were Frank Boeijen, Rood Adeo, and Fay Claassen) honored Simone with the tribute concert &quot;Greetings from Nijmegen&quot;.
Simone was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.

In 2010, a statue in her honor was erected on Trade Street in her native Tryon, North Carolina.

The promotion from the French Institute of Political Studies of Lille (Sciences Po Lille), due to obtain their master&#x27;s degree in 2021, named themselves in her honor. The decision was made that this promotion was henceforth to be known as &#x27;la promotion Nina Simone&#x27; after a vote in 2017.

Simone was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.

The Proms paid a homage to Nina Simone in 2019, an event called &quot;Mississippi Goddamn&quot; was performed by The Metropole Orkest at Royal Albert Hall led by Jules Buckley. Ledisi, Lisa Fischer and Jazz Trio, LaSharVu provided vocals. Ledisi embarked on the &quot;Nina and Me Tour&quot; throughout 2019, and released a tribute album titled &quot;Ledisi Sings Nina&quot; (2021). Following the release of the album, she embarked on her second tribute concert titled &quot;Ledisi Sings Nina Tour&quot; in 2021.

<text>The Brand New Heavies are an English band formed in 1985, consisting of Simon Bartholomew, Andrew Levy, and Jan Kincaid. After the addition of N&#x27;Dea Davenport in 1990, the group experienced mainstream success and pioneered a new genre called acid jazz.

The Brand New Heavies released their debut self-titled album in June 1990. The album was reissued in 1991 with newly recorded vocals by American singer-songwriter N&#x27;Dea Davenport, a new addition to the lineup. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;Never Stop&quot;, &quot;Dream Come True&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Go to Your Head&quot; became a success with the latter two charting in UK Top 25. Their breakthrough success came with the release of their third album &quot;Brother Sister&quot; in April 1994, which peaked at number 4 on UK Albums Chart and became certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Dream On Dreamer&quot; charted in the top 20 in several different countries, including peaking at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. Davenport departed from the group and was replaced with American singer-songwriter Siedah Garrett. The group released their fourth album &quot;Shelter&quot; in April 1997 to commercial success, achieved another certified platinum album by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Garrett departed from the group in 1998 and was replaced by Carleen Anderson.

After Anderson&#x27;s departure in 2000, the group experienced a decline in mainstream popularity after being fronted by several session singers before Davenport&#x27;s return in 2006. The group released &quot;Get Used to It&quot; in June 2006, followed by their live album &quot;Live in London&quot; in 2009. In April 2013, they released their album &quot;Forward&quot;, an album featuring vocals by Davenport and new addition Dawn Joseph. The group hired Dawn Joseph as their featured vocalist, ultimately releasing Davenport from the group. Following the release of the album &quot;Sweet Freaks&quot; (2014), Joseph and Jan Kincaid departed from the group. Sulene Fleming toured with the group from 2016 to 2018, before being replaced with Angela Ricci.

The Brand New Heavies have sold over 2.5 million records worldwide and regarded as one of the leading bands in the genre of acid jazz.

==History==
===1985–1990: Formation and early years===
At Drayton Manor High School Simon Bartholomew, Jan Kincaid, and Andrew Levy formed a band to compete in the inter-house music competition. Which they won as the only genuine band. They played different genres and were for a time known as &quot;Coke Bottle Willy&quot;

In 1985, Simon Bartholomew, Jan Kincaid, and Andrew Levy formed a band originally called Brother International. The band recorded a demo which was played at a nightclub called The Cat in the Hat. After the demo received positive feedback in the club, the band was booked to perform at the club. In 1987, Brother International opened for James Brown at a concert at Wembley Arena. Shortly after their brief stint with Brown, the group changed their name to The Brand New Heavies, inspired by one of Brown&#x27;s honorific titles &quot;Minister of New Super Heavy Funk&quot;. In June 1988, The Brand New Heavies released a single titled &quot;Got to Give&quot; on Cooltempo Records. In 1989, the group moved to Eddie Piller&#x27;s Acid Jazz Records and developed a new genre of music called acid jazz.

In mid-1989, The Brand New Heavies released their second single &quot;People Get Ready&quot;. The group added female vocalist Jaye Ella Ruth to the lineup and began recording their first album. On 1 June 1990, The Brand New Heavies released their debut self-titled album. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Dream Come True&quot; peaked at number sixty-three on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Ruth departed from the group shortly after the release of single.

===1991–1999: Breakthrough success and lineup changes===

At the recommendation of their record label, American singer N&#x27;Dea Davenport was added to the lineup in 1990. The group re-recorded and released their first album on Delicious Vinyl with lead vocals by Davenport in 1991. The album peaked at number twenty-four on the UK Albums Chart and earned a silver-certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The group reissued their singles; &quot;Dream Come True&quot;, &quot;Stay This Way&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Go to Your Head&quot;, all of which peaked in the top forty on the UK Singles Chart. The success of the album invited the group to perform on &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Their follow-up album &quot;Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1&quot; was released in 1992.

In March 1994, they released their third album &quot;Brother Sister&quot;. &quot;Brother Sister&quot; peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and earned platinum-certification by the BPI. The album spawned the single &quot;Dream On Dreamer&quot; which became crossover hit, peaking within the top twenty on several international music charts. The music video of &quot;Dream On Dreamer&quot; also received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for &quot;Best R&amp;B Video&quot;. The album&#x27;s follow-up singles &quot;Back to Love&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Midnight at the Oasis&quot; peaked in the top thirty on the UK Singles chart. At the Brit Awards in 1995, the group received a nomination for &quot;British Dance Act&quot;. Davenport left the group due to irreconcilable differences in 1996 and was replaced with American singer-songwriter Siedah Garrett.
In April 1997, the group&#x27;s third &quot;Shelter&quot; was released. Like its predecessor, the album peaked in the top five on the UK Albums Chart and platinum-certification by the BPI. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Sometimes&quot; peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and earned silver-certification by the BPI. The album&#x27;s follow-up singles &quot;You Are the Universe&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; charted in the top twenty-five; with the latter peaking at number nine.

In 1998, Garrett departed from the group to continue her songwriting career. She was replaced by American singer Carleen Anderson. Anderson recorded a few songs with the group, most notably &quot;Saturday Nite&quot; and a re-recorded version of her song &quot;Apparently Nothin&#x27;&quot;, which appeared on the group&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Trunk Funk – The Best of The Brand New Heavies&quot; in September 1999. The album received silver-certification from the BPI. In 2000, Anderson departed from the group to record her third solo album.

In 2003, they released their fifth studio album titled &quot;We Won&#x27;t Stop&quot; on Canyon International. The album failed to reach the success of their previous albums.

In October 2009, they released a live album titled &quot;Live in London&quot;, which features their concert performance at The O2 Arena on 16 October 2008, in London.

In November 2011, The Brand New Heavies released a instrumental album called &quot;Dunk Your Trunk&quot;. In April 2013, The Brand New Heavies released their album &quot;Forward&quot;. The album featured lead vocals by Davenport and new addition Dawn Joseph. Davenport however was not invited back to finish recording on the album and when the group released &quot;Sunlight&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single, Davenport was not featured in the music video. The group toured during the latter part of 2013, often using concert flyers with Davenport&#x27;s image to market the tour. In a statement issued from Davenport&#x27;s Facebook, she announced that she was not invited to rejoin the group on their concert tours and any shows marketed with her likeness would not include her. On 10 October 2013, The Brand New Heavies released a statement on their website stating that Dawn Joseph had officially joined the band as full-time lead vocalist.

<doc id="214236" wikidata="Q334750" url="?curid=214236" title="The History of Middle-earth">
<text>The History of Middle-earth is a 12-volume series of books published between 1983 and 1996 by George Allen &amp; Unwin in the UK and by Houghton Mifflin in the US. They collect and analyse much of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, compiled and edited by his son Christopher Tolkien. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien&#x27;s conception of Middle-earth as a fictional place with its own peoples, languages, and history, from his earliest notions of &quot;a mythology for England&quot; through to the development of the stories that make up &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It is not a &quot;history of Middle-earth&quot; in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is instead an out-of-universe history of Tolkien&#x27;s creative process. In 2000, the twelve volumes were republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes.

Scholars including Gergely Nagy and Vincent Ferré have commented that Tolkien had always wanted to create a mythology, but believed that such a thing should have passed through many hands and be framed by annotations and edits of different kinds. When Christopher Tolkien, a philologist like his father, edited the &quot;History&quot;, he created an editorial frame, inadvertently reinforcing the mythopoeic effect that his father wanted.

== Context ==

J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973) was a professor of English language at the University of Leeds, and then at the University of Oxford. He specialised in philology, especially Old English works such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;. He is best known for his novels &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but he spent much of his time working on his legendarium. This was not published in his lifetime; he left a large mass of unsorted manuscripts for his literary executor, his son, Christopher Tolkien, to work on. Christopher, a philologist like his father, became lecturer in English language at New College, Oxford in 1963. After his father&#x27;s death, he constructed a short summary of the legendarium stories, published in 1977 as &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;; he followed this in 1978 with &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, a selection from the later legendarium.

== Structure and contents ==

&quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; documents J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, an extensive set of drafts on many aspects of Middle-earth, which Tolkien wrote in stages throughout his life. The &quot;History&quot;, edited by his son Christopher, was published in 12 volumes by George Allen &amp; Unwin in the UK and by Houghton Mifflin in the US between 1983 and 1996 as follows:

A combined index was published six years after the series was completed as &quot;The History of Middle-earth: Index&quot; (2002).

A shorter version of volume 9, omitting material not related to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, was published as &quot;The End of the Third Age&quot;; this is however usually sold as a boxed set along with volumes 6, 7 and 8 as &quot;The History of the Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Christopher Tolkien made the decision not to include any material related to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;. His reasons for this were that it had not been intended to form part of the mythology, was a children&#x27;s story, and had originally not been set in Middle-earth; it was revised during the writing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. &quot;The History of The Hobbit&quot; was published separately, in two volumes, in 2007 and was edited by John D. Rateliff.

== Reception ==

Charles Noad, reviewing &quot;The War of the Jewels&quot; in &quot;Mallorn&quot;, comments that the 12-volume &quot;History&quot; had done something that a putative single-volume edition of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (such as Tolkien had hoped to publish) with embedded commentary could not have achieved: it had changed people&#x27;s perspective on Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings, from being centred on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to what it had always been in Tolkien&#x27;s mind: &quot;Silmarillion&quot;-centred. 

Reviewing &quot;The Peoples of Middle-earth&quot;, Noad adds that &quot;The whole series of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; is a tremendous achievement and makes a worthy and enduring testament to one man&#x27;s creative endeavours and to another&#x27;s explicatory devotion. It reveals far more about Tolkien&#x27;s invented world than any of his readers in pre-&quot;Silmarillion&quot; days could ever have imagined or hoped for.&quot; He concludes that thorough study of the twelve volumes would be essential for understanding &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s imaginative art&quot;.

Liz Milner, for &quot;A Green Man Review&quot;, writes that the series provides &quot;an unprecedented opportunity to examine a great writer&#x27;s creative development over a period of 60 years&quot;. She adds that Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s editing demonstrated &quot;the endurance and cleaning power of Hercules&quot;, given that his father&#x27;s papers were all in disorder.

Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, in &quot;&quot;, describe Tolkien&#x27;s mythology as documented in the &quot;History&quot; as &quot;a work of extraordinary power and scope&quot;. They note that only with the &quot;History&quot; publication can that at last be judged; and that the legendarium as left to his son Christopher was &quot;an immense and extremely complex set of writings&quot;. They note, too, that readers were hoping for &quot;another &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;. Christopher created &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as a &quot;coherent and internally self-consistent narrative&quot; by fitting together and modifying his father&#x27;s drafts, which had been written in different styles, degrees of detail, and degrees of completeness. But this gave little idea of the diversity or process of continual change embodied in the legendarium. Accordingly, Christopher set to work on the &quot;History&quot; to try to tackle the &quot;infinite variety&quot; of his father&#x27;s writings, from prose to alliterative verse, from cosmology and annals to time-travel stories. Hammond and Scull note that some readers felt that the &quot;History&quot; &quot;should never have been published, that it is a disservice to Tolkien to display his missteps and false starts&quot;. They note, too, that other fans have objected to it &quot;on false grounds of &#x27;canonicity&#x27;&quot;, arguing that Tolkien had not &quot;approve[d] these texts for publication&quot;, nor fixed the details for use in games and the like. Hammond and Scull answer that the &quot;History&quot; was meant to present &quot;not a fixed design, but a living creation, and the process by which Tolkien gave it life.&quot; In their view, it offers &quot;a unique opportunity to view the creative spark, a fascinating insight into the work of one of the most imaginative and influential writers of the twentieth century&quot;. They predict that it would start &quot;a new era&quot; in Tolkien studies.

== Analysis ==

=== A life&#x27;s work ===

In 1967, Tolkien named his son Christopher as his literary executor, and more specifically as his co-author of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. After his father&#x27;s death in 1973, Christopher took a large quantity of legendarium manuscripts to his Oxfordshire home, where he converted a barn into a workspace. He and the young Guy Gavriel Kay started work on the documents, discovering by 1975 how complex the task was likely to be. In September 1975 he resigned from his position at New College, Oxford, to work exclusively on editing his father&#x27;s writings. He moved to the south of France and continued this task for 45 years. In all, he edited and published 24 volumes of his father&#x27;s writings, including the 12 of the &quot;History&quot;. In those volumes, Verlyn Flieger writes, 

=== Challenges ===

Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s task was complicated by numerous features of the manuscripts. The drafts were handwritten, often hastily, making them hard to decipher. Many were in pencil; earlier pencilled versions were often erased and overwritten. Drafts were frequently annotated or extended on the same sheets of paper, making the exact sequence hard to reconstruct. The papers were in disorder; relative dates had to be worked out from evidence in the texts, or occasionally from his father&#x27;s use or reuse of a stock of paper that derived from a certain place or time, giving an earliest bound to the dating of those manuscripts.

=== Editorial framing ===

The scholar Gergely Nagy observes that Tolkien &quot;thought of his works &quot;as texts within the fictional world&quot;&quot; (his emphasis), and that the overlapping of different and sometimes contradictory accounts was central to his desired effect. Further, Tolkien was a philologist; Nagy comments that Tolkien may have been intentionally imitating the philological style of authors such as Elias Lönnrot, compiler of the Finnish epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, whom Tolkien saw as an exemplar of a professional and creative philology. This was, Nagy believes, what Tolkien thought essential if he was to present a mythology for England, since such a thing had to have been written by many hands. Further, writes Nagy, by publishing his father&#x27;s writings, Christopher Tolkien, also a philologist, &quot;inserted himself in the functional place of Bilbo&quot; as editor and collator, in his view &quot;reinforcing the mythopoeic effect&quot; that his father had wanted to achieve, making the published book do what Bilbo&#x27;s book was meant to do, and so unintentionally realising his father&#x27;s intention. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings had become, in reality and no longer only in fiction, a complex work by different hands edited, annotated, and commented upon over a long period.

Elizabeth Whittingham writes that Tolkien valued the impression of depth that the mention of much older events had created in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and that he realised he could not do the same for the Silmarillion stories as they were in that older time. Instead, a man from a later age, such as Eriol of &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, could visit Middle-earth and listen to the tales of the Elves, providing a frame story. He records the stories, she writes, and &quot;Eriol&#x27;s perspective becomes the reader&#x27;s, ... separat[ing] readers from these tales of past loss and faded glory.&quot;

Flieger comments that Christopher&#x27;s remark in the introduction to &quot;The Book of Lost Tales 1&quot;, that he had made an error in not providing any sort of frame story for his 1977 &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, is at least partly correct. In her view, the one-volume &quot;Silmarillion&quot; &quot;gives a misleading impression of coherence and finality, as if it were a definitive, canonical text&quot;, while in fact the legendarium from which it is adapted &quot;is a jumble of overlapping and often competing stories, annals, and lexicons.&quot; All the same, she writes, that book was essential, as without it the &quot;History&quot; would never have been published, and the twelve-volume work &quot;provides exactly the framework its editor [Christopher] felt was lacking in the earlier and in some ways premature book.&quot;

Vincent Ferré writes that Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s editing of the 12 volumes of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, using his skill as a philologist, created an editorial frame for his father&#x27;s legendarium, and for the books derived from it. Ferré comments that this presented his father&#x27;s writings as historical, a real set of legends from the past, in just the same way that his editing of &quot;The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays&quot; presented his father&#x27;s essays as scholarly work. 

Outside Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s editorial frame, other authors have contributed more humorous framing elements. Tolkien&#x27;s friend and fellow-Inkling, C. S. Lewis, greatly enjoyed &quot;The Lay of Leithian&quot;, going so far as to invent scholars Peabody and Pumpernickel who comment on what Lewis pretends is an ancient text. 
Mark Shea wrote a mock work of philological scholarship, set in the distant future, and looking back at the works attributed to Tolkien and to Peter Jackson. Shea states that &quot;Experts in source-criticism now know that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is a redaction of sources ranging from &quot;The Red Book of Westmarch&quot; (W) to Elvish Chronicles (E) to Gondorian records (G) to orally transmitted tales of the Rohirrim (R),&quot; each with &quot;their own agendas&quot;, like &quot;the &#x27;Tolkien&#x27; (T) and &#x27;Peter Jackson&#x27; (PJ) redactors&quot;. He notes confidently that &quot;we may be quite certain that &#x27;Tolkien&#x27; (if he ever existed) did not &quot;write&quot; this work in the conventional sense, but that it was assembled over a long period of time...&quot;

<text>U.S. Route 130 (US 130) is a U.S. Highway that is a spur route of U.S. Route 30, located completely within the state of New Jersey. It is signed with north and south cardinal directions, following a general northeast–southwest diagonal path, with north corresponding to the general eastward direction and vice versa. The route runs from I-295 and US 40 at Deepwater in Pennsville Township, Salem County, where the road continues south as Route 49, north to US 1 in North Brunswick, Middlesex County, where Route 171 continues north into New Brunswick. The route briefly runs concurrent with U.S. Route 30 near Camden, about one-third of the way to New Brunswick. The road runs within a close distance of I-295 south of Bordentown and a few miles from the New Jersey Turnpike for its entire length, serving as a major four- to six-lane divided local road for most of its length. US 130 passes through many towns including Penns Grove, Bridgeport, Westville, Camden, Pennsauken, Burlington, Bordentown, Hightstown, and North Brunswick.

In 1916, pre-1927 Route 2 was designated to run along the present US 130 between the Camden area and Bordentown while pre-1927 Route 1 was to follow the current route between Robbinsville Township and New Brunswick. The current route between Penns Grove and Westville was to become pre-1927 Route 17S in 1923. In 1926, US 130 was designated to run from U.S. Route 30 in Camden to US 1 in Trenton along the alignment of pre-1927 Route 2. A year later, the alignment of US 130 became Route 25 between Camden and Bordentown, Route 39 between Bordentown and White Horse, and Route 37 between White Horse and Trenton. US 130 was extended to Pennsville in 1938 along Route 45 and Route 44 while it was realigned to follow Route 25 and Route 25M between Bordentown and Route 27 in New Brunswick by the 1940s. In 1953, the state highways running concurrent with US 130 were removed. Around the time of the renumbering, limited-access bypasses for US 130 were built around Carneys Point Township and between Bridgeport and Westville; the former alignments eventually became Route 44. In the 1960s, I-295 was designated onto most of these freeway alignments of US 130, which was moved back to its original route in Carneys Point. In 1969, the north end of US 130 was cut back to its current location, with the old road into New Brunswick becoming Route 171. The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission had proposed a US 130 freeway between Camden and Burlington, but it was never built.

==Route description==

===Salem and Gloucester counties===

US 130&#x27;s south end is in Pennsville Township, Salem County, at the east end of the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 295 and U.S. Route 40. The New Jersey Turnpike begins at this interchange, and Route 49 heads south. From here, the route heads northeast on Shell Road, a two-lane undivided road, passing development before entering Carneys Point Township. In Carneys Point Township, the road intersects with Hawks Bridge Road (Route 140) before passing to the east of a DuPont plant and a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad yard near wooded areas. US 130 makes a turn to the north at a roundabout with Hollywood Avenue (CR 618) into more residential development, crossing into Penns Grove, where the route turns northeast again as Virginia Avenue and intersects with East Main Street (Route 48). Past the intersection of East Main Street (Route 48), the road enters Carneys Point again and crosses the Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Penns Grove Secondary railroad line before continuing through a mix of agricultural and industrial areas. Upon entering Oldmans Township, US 130 heads through more rural areas as Crown Point Road.

After crossing the Oldmans Creek on a former drawbridge, the route enters Logan Township, Gloucester County, and becomes a four-lane divided highway continuing as Crown Point Road. It heads east-northeast through Nortonville before continuing through marshland and woodland. After crossing the Raccoon Creek on a fixed bridge, the road passes some homes in Bridgeport before reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 322 that provides access to the Commodore Barry Bridge. At this point, a freeway section of US 130 begins. The freeway heads east to its first interchange after US 322, a right-in/right-out at Barker Avenue, with an overpass just to the west at Springers Road. Barker Avenue leads east to the south end of Route 44. The next interchange provides direct access to Route 44. After Route 44, the route passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Penns Grove Secondary railroad line. Following this, the highway has an interchange with Cedar Swamp Road before US 130 merges into Interstate 295 for a concurrency.
Along Interstate 295, the route is a six-lane freeway, coming to an exit for Repaupo Station Road (CR 684). Continuing east, the freeway crosses into Greenwich Township and has an interchange with Tomlin Station Road (CR 607). After passing near Greenwich Lake, there are exits for Paulsboro-Swedesboro Road (CR 653) and Democrat Road (CR 673) within a short distance of each other. Interstate 295/US 130 reaches an interchange with Harmony Road (CR 680) on the border of Greenwich Township and East Greenwich Township. The road runs through a portion of East Greenwich Township before crossing back into Greenwich Township and coming to an interchange with Berkley Road (CR 678) and Cohawkin Road (CR 667) on the border of Greenwich Township and Paulsboro. Past this point, the freeway runs through marshy areas of Mantua Creek and continues into West Deptford Township. Here, there is an exit for Mantua Grove Road (CR 656). Passing near more industrial areas, Interstate 295/US 130 has an interchange with Mid-Atlantic Parkway, which provides access to Route 44 as well as to Grove Street (CR 643) and Jessup Road (CR 660). Continuing northeast, the freeway passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Penns Grove Secondary and reaches an interchange with Route 44 and Delaware Street (CR 640). At this point, Route 44 begins to parallel Interstate 295/US 130 on its northwest side as the two roads cross the Woodbury Creek. Route 44 ends at a cul-de-sac that has a ramp from the southbound direction of Interstate 295/US 130 prior to another interchange that provides access to Red Bank Avenue (CR 644). The freeway passes near some homes before US 130 splits from Interstate 295.

After splitting from Interstate 295, US 130 continues northeast as a four-lane divided road called Crown Point Road. The route runs past an oil refinery before forming the border between West Deptford to the north and Westville to the south, where it begins to pass residences along the south side of the road. The road fully enters Westville before encountering Gateway Boulevard (Route 45) at a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Past this interchange, the lanes of US 130 split briefly before rejoining.

===Camden County===
Upon crossing the Big Timber Creek, the route enters Brooklawn, Camden County, where the name becomes Crescent Boulevard and intersects with Broadway (CR 551 where it comes to a traffic circle. Here, US 130 and CR 551 head concurrent to the east, passing under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Vineland Secondary railroad line, and come to another traffic circle. At this circle, Route 47 and CR 551 head south on Broadway while US 130 continues east on Crescent Boulevard, lined with suburban shopping centers. After Kings Highway (CR 551 Spur) heads east, US 130 makes a turn to the northeast, widening into a six-lane highway with many intersections controlled by jughandles and crossing the Little Timber Creek into Gloucester City. In Gloucester City, the median of the route widens as it interchanges with Interstate 76 at a partial interchange. From this interchange, the road continues north-northeast heads across Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Grenloch Industrial Track line and crosses the Newton Creek into Haddon Township. US 130 comes to an interchange with Route 76C that has access towards Interstate 76, Interstate 676, and the Walt Whitman Bridge to and from the northbound direction of US 130. The highway continues to a channelized intersection of Mount Ephraim Avenue / Black Horse Pike (Route 168). Following this intersection, US 130 continues through urban areas, passing through a small corner of Camden before entering Collingswood as it crosses under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line. In Collingswood, the road is lined with suburban businesses again prior to meeting the intersection of White Horse Pike (U.S. Route 30) at the former Collingswood Circle.

At this point, U.S. Route 30 forms a concurrency with US 130 and the two routes head north, passing under the PATCO Speedline before meeting Haddon Avenue (CR 561) at an interchange. Past Haddon Avenue (CR 561), the road passes to the east of Harleigh Cemetery prior to crossing the Cooper River into Pennsauken Township. In Pennsauken, U.S. Route 30/US 130 comes to the Airport Circle. Airport Circle is an intersection with several flyovers; U.S. Route 30 splits to the west, while Route 38 heads east, soon splitting with Route 70. US 130, meanwhile, continues northeast through more commercial areas. The road briefly enters Camden again right before an interchange with Federal Street/Maple Avenue (CR 537) in Pennsauken, passing under an abandoned railroad line a short distance later. The route crosses under NJ Transit’s Atlantic City Line before coming to a large interchange with Route 90 that provides access to the Betsy Ross Bridge. Within this interchange, the lanes of US 130 split. A short distance later, the route reaches an interchange with Route 73, which runs to the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge.

===Burlington County===
A short distance after the Route 73 interchange, US 130 crosses North Branch of Pennsauken Creek into Cinnaminson Township, Burlington County, and continues northeast. The route turns to the east-northeast and enters Delran Township, where there is an interchange with Bridgeboro Street (CR 613). Immediately after this interchange, the road crosses the Rancocas Creek and forms the border between Delanco to the northwest and Willingboro Township to the southeast as it passes a couple of lakes. US 130 continues along the border of Edgewater Park and Willingboro. After briefly forming the border between Burlington Township and Willingboro, the road entirely enters Burlington Township and intersects with Beverly Road (CR 543). The route forms a concurrency with CR 543 prior to entering Burlington. A bypass takes US 130 and CR 543 around the downtown area of Burlington. The road comes to an intersection of Keim Boulevard (Route 413), which provides access to the Burlington–Bristol Bridge. Past this intersection, US 130/CR 543 turns east, with the median widening to include businesses. Along this portion of road, there is an intersection of High Street (CR 541). The six-lane section of US 130 decreases to four lanes as it crosses Assicunk Creek, where the median also narrows. The road turns northeast into a residential area, and CR 543 splits from US 130 by heading to the east on Columbus Road.

Past this intersection, US 130 passes some businesses and crosses back into Burlington Township, where it runs a short distance to the southeast of NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line. The road enters less dense commercial and industrial development, along with some farmland and woodland, as it continues into Florence Township. The route reaches a double trumpet interchange with the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) in Florence Township. Following this interchange, US 130 continues through development before crossing Crafts Creek into Mansfield Township Here, the surroundings become more wooded with a few areas of agriculture. The route continues into Bordentown Township, where the road widens to six lanes as it has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 295. From this point, US 130 continues to an intersection of Farnsworth Avenue (CR 545), where it narrows back to four lanes. The surroundings become more developed as US 130 merges with US 206 at an interchange, bypassing Bordentown to the east. The two routes continue north on a six-lane divided highway, briefly skirting the eastern edge of Bordentown as the road crosses the intersection of Crosswicks Street/Crosswicks Road (CR 528). After entering Bordentown Township again, US 130 splits from US 206 by heading to the northeast at an interchange. Upon splitting, the route becomes a four-lane divided highway again, passing homes and businesses with areas of woods.

===Mercer and Middlesex counties===

After crossing the Crosswicks Creek, US 130 continues into Hamilton, Mercer County, where Route 156 splits to the west to parallel US 130 as it bypasses Yardville to the east. The route intersects several roads at northbound-only interchanges, including Church Street (CR 609), South Broad Street (CR 672), and Yardville-Allentown Road (CR 524); Route 156 provides southbound access. Past these interchanges, the road passes some homes before Route 156 merges back into it. From this point, US 130 runs through commercial areas, where it has a brief six-lane segment prior to reaching a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 195. Following this interchange, the road enters Robbinsville Township and intersects with Robbinsville-Allentown Road (CR 526). In Robbinsville, the route forms a short concurrency with CR 526. At the point CR 526 turns east on Robbinsville By-Pass, Route 33 joins US 130 from the west. US 130 and Route 33 run together through rural areas with some development. The road bypasses Windsor to the east prior to entering East Windsor. Here, the road widens to six lanes and Route 33 splits from US 130, heading east into Hightstown. US 130 narrows back to four lanes and runs around the commercial west side of Hightstown, crossing the intersection of Princeton-Hightstown Road/Stockton Street (CR 571). Shortly after this intersection, the route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Route 133.

US 130 crosses the Millstone River into Cranbury, Middlesex County, where it has an intersection of North Main Street (CR 539). From this point, the route heads north through a mix of rural surroundings and inhabited neighborhoods, bypassing Downtown Cranbury to the east and crossing the intersection of Station Road (CR 615). Past this intersection, the road continues into development, crossing the Brainerd Lake and intersects with Half Acre Road (CR 535). US 130 forms a short concurrency with CR 535 and splits from US 130 by turning northeast on South River Road. US 130 briefly forms the border between South Brunswick to the west and Cranbury to the east before fully entering South Brunswick as the road runs through a mix of rural areas and business parks. The road comes to a directional Y-intersection with the western terminus of Route 32, which provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike and Monroe Township. A park and ride lot serving Coach USA buses to New York City is located west of this intersection. Following Route 32, US 130 crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Amboy Secondary railroad line before coming to an interchange with Ridge Road (CR 522). At this point, CR 522 forms a brief concurrency with US 130 before splitting to the west. After the concurrency with CR 522, the route continues north into mostly forested areas, crossing the Davidsons Mill Pond before continuing into North Brunswick. In North Brunswick, the road heads northeast through increasing development as the route starts to turn more to the north. US 130 comes to an end at an interchange with US 1, where the road continues north as Route 171, known as Georges Road into New Brunswick.

==History==

What is now US 130 was a part of two Lenape trails: the Pensaukin Trail, running from what is now Camden to Crosswicks; and the Lower Assunpink or Crosswicksung Trail, running from there north to Ahandewamock Village, near modern-day New Brunswick. The section of this trail between Crosswicks and Cranbury became part of a Kings Highway connecting South Amboy and Salem. North of Cranbury, the Assunpink trail was later called the Lower Road, then George&#x27;s Road. The route was incorporated into several turnpikes in the 19th century. In 1808, the Burlington Turnpike was chartered to run from Burlington north to the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike through Bordentown. The Bordentown and South Amboy Turnpike was chartered in 1818 to run from Bordentown to South Amboy, bypassing the Kings Highway from East Brunswick to Cranbury. In 1849 the Westfield and Camden Turnpike was legislated along the Burlington Road from Camden to the bridge at Rancocas Creek. The New Brunswick and Cranbury Turnpike was chartered in 1865 to run from the Bordentown-South Amboy Turnpike to New Brunswick along the old Georges Road.

The entire length of US 130 follows a part of the Ocean Highway, a coastal highway that ran from New Brunswick south to Jacksonville, Florida. The stretch from New Brunswick to Robbinsville was signed as the Cranbury Trail, an alternative to the Lincoln Highway running from New Brunswick to Trenton. The current route was designated as portions of three state routes prior to 1927. In 1916, the road between the Camden area and Bordentown was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 2 while the current US 130 north of Robbinsville was to become a part of pre-1927 Route 1. In addition, pre-1927 Route 17S was legislated to run from Penns Grove northeast to Westville in 1923; the only portion of road built ran from Pennsville Township south to Salem. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, US 130 was designated to connect U.S. Route 30 in Camden to US 1 in Trenton, following pre-1927 Route 2. In the 1927 renumbering a year later, the US 130 alignment was designated Route 25 from Camden to Bordentown, Route 39 from Bordentown to White Horse, and Route 37 from White Horse to Trenton.
By 1938, US 130 was extended south along Route 45 and Route 44 to end at US 40 in Pennsville where the connection to Hook Road now hits Route 49. By the 1940s, it was rerouted to follow Route 25 and Route 25M from Bordentown to Route 27 in New Brunswick The former US 130 between Bordentown and Trenton was designated as a part of US 206. During the 1940s, a new alignment for US 130 was built through South Brunswick. After the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened in 1951, the south end of US 130 was moved to its current location. Shortly before the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, US 130 was aligned to bypass Yardville with the old route becoming Route 156 in 1953. Also, prior to 1953, US 130 had been aligned to bypass Carneys Point and a stretch of Route 44 between Bridgeport and Westville.
In the 1953 renumbering, US 130 replaced Route 44 and parts of Route 45 and Route 25, as well as the short Route 25M into New Brunswick. With the 1953 renumbering freeing up the Route 44 designation, that number was eventually assigned to the two sections of old road. In the 1960s, Interstate 295 was built through Salem and Gloucester counties, following a portion of the US 130 freeway bypass of Carneys Point as well as the freeway portion of the route from north of Bridgeport to Westville. As a result of this construction, US 130 was moved back to its original alignment in Carneys Point, replacing that portion of Route 44. US 130 was cut back to its current north end at US 1 in 1969, and the continuation into New Brunswick was assigned Route 171.

In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission to alleviate traffic on US 130 between Camden and Burlington. This freeway was originally planned as a parkway between the two cities in 1932 that never materialized. The proposed freeway, which was to connect the Ben Franklin Bridge to Interstate 295 near the Assicunk Creek, was to cost $53 million and mostly follow a Conrail railroad line between the two cities. However, the NJDOT never followed through with the proposal. 

Construction in 2001 replaced a modified traffic circle at US 130&#x27;s northern terminus at US 1 and Route 171 in North Brunswick with an interchange. A service road was also built to serve the nearby shopping centers and Milltown Road (CR 606). This project was completed in July 2003. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at the southern terminus of the U.S. Route 30 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.

In 2013 the road was one of three that tied for the #1 ranking on the Tri-State Transportation Campaign&#x27;s list of the top ten most dangerous roads for pedestrians in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. The route, along with US 40/US 322 in Atlantic County and US 1 in Middlesex County, were so ranked due to the nine pedestrian deaths that occurred on each of those roads from 2009 to 2011.

<text>Andrew Phillip Cunanan (August 31, 1969 – July 23, 1997) was an American serial killer who murdered five people over three months from April 27 to July 15, 1997. His victims include Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace and Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin. Cunanan died by suicide on July 23, 1997, eight days after murdering Versace.

==Early life and education==
The youngest of four children, Andrew Cunanan was born August 31, 1969, in National City, California, to Modesto &quot;Pete&quot; Dungao Cunanan (June 25, 1930 – June 2, 2005), a Filipino American, and Mary Anne Schillaci (November 4, 1938 – April 15, 2012), an Italian American. Modesto was serving in the United States Navy in the Vietnam War at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. After leaving the navy, where he had served as a chief petty officer, Modesto worked as a stockbroker.

In his youth, Cunanan lived with his family in National City and attended Bonita Vista Middle School. In 1981, his father enrolled him in The Bishop&#x27;s School, an independent day school located in the affluent La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego. There Cunanan met his lifelong best friend, Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Cote.
At school, he was remembered as being bright and very talkative, and testing with an IQ of 147.

As a teenager, Cunanan developed a reputation as a prolific liar, given to telling tall tales about his family and personal life. He was adept at changing his appearance according to what he felt was most attractive at a given moment. Cunanan identified as gay in high school, when he began having liaisons with wealthy older men. He was voted &quot;Most Likely Not to Be Forgotten&quot; by his classmates, sometimes reported as &quot;Most Likely to Be Remembered&quot; by several media reports about Cunanan. After graduating from high school in 1987, Cunanan enrolled at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), where he majored in American history.

In 1988, when Cunanan was 19, his father deserted his family and moved to the Philippines to evade arrest for embezzlement. That same year, Cunanan had begun frequenting local gay clubs and restaurants, and his mother, who was a deeply religious Catholic, learned about his sexual orientation. During an argument, Cunanan threw his mother against a wall, dislocating her shoulder. Later examination of his behavior indicates that he may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, characterized by a lack of remorse and empathy. In 1989, Cunanan dropped out of UC San Diego and settled in the Castro District of San Francisco, a center of gay culture, moving in with Cote and her boyfriend, Phil Merrill.

==Adult life==

In San Francisco, Cunanan continued his practice of befriending wealthy older men, and also reportedly began creating violent pornography. He also socialized in the Hillcrest and La Jolla neighborhoods of San Diego, as well as in Scottsdale, Arizona, &quot;apparently living off the largesse of one wealthy patron or another.&quot; Cunanan is also believed to have been dealing drugs, including prescription opioids, cocaine, and marijuana.

Cunanan allegedly first met fashion designer Gianni Versace in San Francisco in October 1990, when Versace was in town to be recognized for the costumes he had designed for the San Francisco Opera production of Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera &quot;Capriccio&quot;, although Versace&#x27;s family has always denied that the two men ever met. In December 1995, Cunanan met David Madson, a Minneapolis architect, in a San Francisco bar. They began a long-distance relationship shortly after, but Madson ended the relationship in the spring of 1996, telling friends he sensed something &quot;shady&quot; about Cunanan. Cunanan told friends that Madson was the &quot;love of my life&quot;.

In September 1996, Cunanan broke up with Norman Blachford, a wealthy older man who had been hosting and financially supporting him. He soon maxed out his credit cards. Cunanan&#x27;s close friend Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot; Trail, a former Naval officer working as a district manager for a propane delivery company in Minneapolis, had told his former roommate Michael Williams that Cunanan had resumed selling drugs. Cunanan also was known to regularly consume these drugs, especially methamphetamine.

By April 1997, friends reported Cunanan was abusing painkillers and was drinking alcohol &quot;like there was no tomorrow&quot;. Later that month, he told friends he was leaving San Diego for Minneapolis to &quot;take care of some business matters&quot; with Trail, who had recently distanced himself from Cunanan. Trail expected Cunanan to return to San Francisco upon leaving Minneapolis. Before Cunanan&#x27;s visit, Trail told his sister that he &quot;did not want Andrew to come.&quot; A week before his death, Trail told Williams that he had had a &quot;huge falling out&quot; with Cunanan and said, &quot;I made a lot of enemies this weekend... I&#x27;ve got to get out of here. They&#x27;re going to kill me.&quot;

On April 24, Cunanan and four friends attended a going-away party at Hillcrest&#x27;s California Cuisine, a rare occasion when Cunanan did not cover the tab. He had reached the credit limit on both his credit cards, and had to ask for a credit extension to afford his plane ticket to Minneapolis. Upon arriving there the next day, Cunanan stayed with Madson, a mutual friend of his and Trail&#x27;s, in Madson&#x27;s apartment. That night, Cunanan and Madson dined at Nye&#x27;s Restaurant and visited The Gay 90&#x27;s nightclub. On April 26, Cunanan stayed in Trail&#x27;s apartment while Trail was out of town with his boyfriend, Jon Hackett. The following afternoon, Trail told Hackett that he needed to have a &quot;pretty important&quot; conversation with Cunanan. When Trail and Hackett later returned to the apartment, there was no sign of Cunanan or his belongings. Trail left his apartment to see Cunanan shortly after 9 p.m. and was likely let into Madson&#x27;s apartment at 9:45 p.m.

==Murders==
===Jeffrey Trail===
Cunanan&#x27;s killings began in Minneapolis on April 27, 1997, with the murder of his friend, 28-year-old Jeffrey Allen &quot;Jeff&quot; Trail. After an earlier argument in Trail&#x27;s apartment, Cunanan stole Trail&#x27;s gun and took it to David Madson&#x27;s loft apartment. Cunanan phoned Trail from Madson&#x27;s apartment to tell him to come and retrieve his gun. When Trail arrived, Cunanan beat him to death with a hammer in front of Madson. On April 29, one of Madson&#x27;s coworkers, concerned about his absence from work, visited his apartment to check on him and discovered Trail&#x27;s body rolled in a rug and placed behind a sofa. Trail&#x27;s watch had stopped at 9:55p.m., believed by authorities to be the time of the killing.

===David Madson===
David Jon Madson, 33, was Cunanan&#x27;s second victim. Authorities believed Madson remained in his apartment with Cunanan two days after Trail&#x27;s murder, as one neighbor witnessed both men in the apartment elevator on April 28, and another neighbor witnessed the pair walking Madson&#x27;s dog on April 29. Investigators then treated Madson as a suspect in Trail&#x27;s murder, but Madson&#x27;s family insisted he was held hostage by Cunanan. On May 2, Madson and Cunanan were seen north of Minneapolis, driving in Madson&#x27;s Jeep and eating lunch together in a bar. The following morning, Madson&#x27;s body was found on the east shore of Rush Lake near Rush City, Minnesota, with gunshot wounds to the head and back from a .40-caliber Taurus PT100 semi-automatic pistol Cunanan had taken from Trail&#x27;s home.

===Lee Miglin===
On May 3, Cunanan drove to Chicago, Illinois, and killed 72-year-old Lee Albert Miglin, a prominent real estate developer. He bound Miglin&#x27;s hands and feet and wrapped his head with duct tape, then stabbed him more than twenty times with a screwdriver, slit his throat with a hacksaw, and stole his car. Miglin&#x27;s family maintain that the killing was random, but former FBI agent Gregg McCrary argues it is unlikely that Cunanan would have bound and tortured Miglin without some motive.

Investigators noted Miglin&#x27;s 1994 green Lexus LS sedan was missing from his garage and found Madson&#x27;s red Jeep parked on the street near Miglin&#x27;s house. Miglin&#x27;s Lexus was equipped with a car phone, which, according to records, was activated on May 4 in Union County, Pennsylvania. Authorities began monitoring the phone&#x27;s activity and found it was also activated on May 8 in Philadelphia and on May 9 near Penns Grove and Carneys Point Township, New Jersey.

===William Reese===
On May 9, in Pennsville Township, New Jersey, at Finn&#x27;s Point National Cemetery, Cunanan shot and killed 45-year-old cemetery caretaker William Richard &quot;Bill&quot; Reese. Later that day, when Reese did not return home for dinner, his wife visited the cemetery to check on him and found the caretaker&#x27;s office door ajar with the radio playing inside. She then called the police, who found Reese shot in the head by the same Taurus pistol Cunanan used to murder Madson. Unlike Cunanan&#x27;s other victims, whom he killed for seemingly personal reasons, authorities believe Cunanan murdered Reese simply for his 1995 red Chevrolet pickup truck. Cunanan used this truck to drive to Florida.

On May 12, Cunanan began staying at the Normandy Plaza Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, where he paid $29 per night in cash. On June 12, he was listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. While the manhunt unsuccessfully focused on Reese&#x27;s stolen truck that Cunanan was using, he &quot;hid in plain sight&quot; for two months. Cunanan used his own name to pawn a stolen item on July 7, despite knowing that police routinely reviewed pawn shop records. On July 14, seemingly out of money, Cunanan checked out of his hotel without paying for his last night there.
===Gianni Versace===
Around 8:45am on July 15, 1997, Cunanan murdered 50-year-old Giovanni Maria &quot;Gianni&quot; Versace on the front steps of Casa Casuarina, his mansion in Miami Beach. Versace was returning from a visit to the News Cafe, where he picked up magazines, when he was shot once in the back of the head and once in the left cheek with the same Taurus pistol Cunanan used to murder Madson and Reese. A witness pursued Cunanan but was unable to catch him as he fled into a nearby parking garage. Versace was pronounced dead at Jackson Memorial Hospital at 9:21a.m. Responding police found Reese&#x27;s stolen vehicle in a nearby parking garage. It contained Cunanan&#x27;s clothes and clippings of newspaper reports about the earlier murders.

===Motives===
Cunanan&#x27;s motivation remains unknown. At the time of the murders, there was extensive public and press speculation linking the crimes to Cunanan&#x27;s alleged discovery that he was HIV positive, although an autopsy revealed he was HIV negative. Although police searched the houseboat where Cunanan died, he left no suicide note and few personal belongings. Investigators noted Cunanan&#x27;s reputation for acquiring money and expensive possessions from wealthy older men. Police considered few of the findings to be of note, except multiple tubes of hydrocortisone cream and a fairly extensive collection of fiction by C. S. Lewis.

==Suicide==
On July 23, 1997, Cunanan&#x27;s body was found in a luxury houseboat in Miami Beach, after a caretaker reported to police of hearing a gunshot. He had shot himself in the head with the Taurus pistol stolen from Trail; it was the same weapon he used to kill Madson, Reese, and Versace. Cunanan&#x27;s cremated remains are interred in the mausoleum at Holy Cross Cemetery in San Diego.

== In popular culture ==
Cunanan was portrayed by Shane Perdue in the film &quot;The Versace Murder&quot; (1998); Jonathan Trent in the film &quot;Murder in Fashion&quot; (2009); Luke Morrison in the television film &quot;House of Versace&quot; (2013); and Darren Criss (who won an Emmy Award for his performance) in &quot;The Assassination of Gianni Versace&quot; (2018), the second season of the television series &quot;American Crime Story&quot;. Cunanan has been referenced in songs by Shyne (&quot;Bad Boyz&quot;, 2000), Eminem (&quot;Criminal&quot;, 2000) and Modest Mouse (&quot;Pistol (A. Cunanan, Miami, FL. 1996)&quot;, 2015), Mickey Avalon (“Stroke Me”, 2009)

He has also been the subject of several true crime television series&#x27; episodes: &quot;Mugshots&quot; on Court TV, with &quot;Andrew Cunanan – The Versace Killer&quot;, and &quot;Six Degrees of Murder&quot;, with &quot;The Body in the Rug&quot;. He has also been featured on ABC&#x27;s news television series &quot;20/20&quot;, and Investigation Discovery&#x27;s show &quot;Most Evil&quot; in various episodes, where he is examined by Columbia University forensic psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, as well as a two-hour episode of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;.

<text>The terpenoids, also known as isoprenoids, are a class of naturally occurring organic chemicals derived from the 5-carbon compound isoprene and its derivatives called terpenes, diterpenes, etc. While sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;terpenes&quot;, terpenoids contain additional functional groups, usually containing oxygen. When combined with the hydrocarbon terpenes, terpenoids comprise about 80,000 compounds. They are the largest class of plant secondary metabolites, representing about 60% of known natural products. Many terpenoids have substantial pharmacological bioactivity and are therefore of interest to medicinal chemists.

Plant terpenoids are used for their aromatic qualities and play a role in traditional herbal remedies. Terpenoids contribute to the scent of eucalyptus, the flavors of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, the yellow color in sunflowers, and the red color in tomatoes. Well-known terpenoids include citral, menthol, camphor, salvinorin A in the plant &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, ginkgolide and bilobalide found in &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; and the cannabinoids found in cannabis. The provitamin beta carotene is a terpene derivative called a carotenoid.

The steroids and sterols in animals are biologically produced from terpenoid precursors. Sometimes terpenoids are added to proteins, e.g., to enhance their attachment to the cell membrane; this is known as isoprenylation. Terpenoids play a role in plant defense as prophylaxis against pathogens and attractants for the predators of herbivores.

==Structure and classification==
Terpenoids are modified terpenes, wherein methyl groups have been moved or removed, or oxygen atoms added. Some authors use the term &quot;terpene&quot; more broadly, to include the terpenoids. Just like terpenes, the terpenoids can be classified according to the number of isoprene units that comprise the parent terpene:

Terpenoids can also be classified according to the type and number of cyclic structures they contain: linear, acyclic, monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic, tetracyclic, pentacyclic, or macrocyclic. The Salkowski test can be used to identify the presence of terpenoids.

==Biosynthesis==

Terpenoids, at least those containing an alcohol functional group, often arise by hydrolysis of carbocationic intermediates produced from geranyl pyrophosphate. Analogously hydrolysis of intermediates from farnesyl pyrophosphate gives sesquiterpenoids, and hydrolysis of intermediates from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate gives diterpenoids, etc.

==Impact on aerosols==
In air, terpenoids are converted into various species, such as aldehydes, hydroperoxides, organic nitrates, and epoxides by short-lived free radicals (like the hydroxyl radical) and to a lesser extent by ozone. These new species can dissolve into water droplets and contribute to aerosol and haze formation. Secondary organic aerosols formed from this pathway may have atmospheric impacts.

As an example the Blue Ridge Mountains in the U.S. and Blue Mountains of New South Wales in Australia are noted for having a bluish color when seen from a distance. Trees put the &quot;blue&quot; in Blue Ridge, from their terpenoids released into the atmosphere.

<text>Terpenes () are a class of natural products consisting of compounds with the formula (C5H8)n for n ≥ 2. Terpenes are major biosynthetic building blocks. Comprising more than 30,000 compounds, these unsaturated hydrocarbons are produced predominantly by plants, particularly conifers. In plants, terpenes and terpenoids are important mediators of ecological interactions, while some insects use some terpenes as a form of defense. Other functions of terpenoids include cell growth modulation and plant elongation, light harvesting and photoprotection, and membrane permeability and fluidity control.

Terpenes are classified by the number of carbons: monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), as examples. The terpene alpha-pinene is a major component of the common solvent, turpentine.

The one terpene that has major applications is natural rubber (i.e., polyisoprene). The possibility that other terpenes could be used as precursors to produce synthetic polymers has been investigated. Many terpenes have been shown to have pharmacological effects. Terpenes are also components of some traditional medicines, such as aromatherapy, and as active ingredients of pesticides in agriculture.

==History and terminology==
The term &quot;terpene&quot; was coined in 1866 by the German chemist August Kekulé to denote all hydrocarbons having the empirical formula C10H16, of which camphene was one. Previously, many hydrocarbons having the empirical formula C10H16 had been called &quot;camphene&quot;, but many other hydrocarbons of the same composition had different names. Kekulé coined the term &quot;terpene&quot; in order to reduce the confusion. The name &quot;terpene&quot; is a shortened form of &quot;terpentine&quot;, an obsolete spelling of &quot;turpentine&quot;.

Although sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;terpenes&quot;, terpenoids (or isoprenoids) are modified terpenes that contain additional functional groups, usually oxygen-containing. The terms terpenes and terpenoids are often used interchangeably, however. Furthermore, terpenes are produced from terpenoids and many terpenoids are produced from terpenes. Both have strong and often pleasant odors, which may protect their hosts or attract pollinators. The number of terpenes and terpenoids is estimated at 55,000 chemical entities.

The 1939 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Leopold Ružička &quot;for his work on polymethylenes and higher terpenes&quot;, &quot;including the first chemical synthesis of male sex hormones.&quot;

==Biological function==
Terpenes are major biosynthetic building blocks. Steroids, for example, are derivatives of the triterpene squalene. Terpenes and terpenoids are also the primary constituents of the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. In plants, terpenes and terpenoids are important mediators of ecological interactions. For example, they play a role in plant defense against herbivory, disease resistance, attraction of mutualists such as pollinators, as well as potentially plant-plant communication. They appear to play roles as antifeedants. Other functions of terpenoids include cell growth modulation and plant elongation, light harvesting and photoprotection, and membrane permeability and fluidity control.

Higher amounts of terpenes are released by trees in warmer weather, where they may function as a natural mechanism of cloud seeding. The clouds reflect sunlight, allowing the forest temperature to regulate.

Some insects use some terpenes as a form of defense. For example, termites of the subfamily Nasutitermitinae ward off predatory insects through the use of a specialized mechanism called a fontanellar gun, which ejects a resinous mixture of terpenes.

==Applications==
The one terpene that has major applications is natural rubber (i.e., polyisoprene). The possibility that other terpenes could be used as precursors to produce synthetic polymers has been investigated as an alternative to the use of petroleum-based feedstocks. However, few of these applications have been commercialized. Many other terpenes, however, have smaller scale commercial and industrial applications. For example, turpentine, a mixture of terpenes (e.g., pinene), obtained from the distillation of pine tree resin, is used as an organic solvent and as a chemical feedstock (mainly for the production of other terpenoids). Rosin, another by-product of conifer tree resin, is widely used as an ingredient in a variety of industrial products, such as inks, varnishes and adhesives. Rosin is also used by violinists (and players of similar bowed instruments) to increase friction on the bow hair, by ballet dancers on the soles of their shoes to maintain traction on the floor, by gymnasts to keep their grips while performing, and by baseball pitchers to improve their control of the baseball. Terpenes are widely used as fragrances and flavors in consumer products such as perfumes, cosmetics and cleaning products, as well as food and drink products. For example, the aroma and flavor of hops comes, in part, from sesquiterpenes (mainly α-humulene and β-caryophyllene), which affect beer quality. Some form hydroperoxides that are valued as catalysts in the production of polymers.

Many terpenes have been shown to have pharmacological effects, although most studies are from laboratory research, and clinical research in humans is preliminary. Terpenes are also components of some traditional medicines, such as aromatherapy.

Reflecting their defensive role in plants, terpenes are used as active ingredients of pesticides in agriculture.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Terpenes are colorless, although impure samples are often yellow. Boiling points scale with molecular size: terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes respectively at 110, 160, and 220 °C. Being highly non-polar, they are insoluble in water. Being hydrocarbons, they are highly flammable and have low specific gravity (float on water). They are tactilely light oils considerably less viscous than familiar vegetable oils like corn oil (28 cP), with viscosity ranging from 1 cP (à la water) to 6 cP. Terpenes are local irritants and can cause gastrointestinal disturbances if ingested.

&quot;Terpenoids&quot; (mono-, sesqui-, di-, etc.) have similar physical properties but tend to be more polar and hence slightly more soluble in water and somewhat less volatile than their terpene analogues. Highly polar derivatives of terpenoids are the glycosides, which are linked to sugars. These are water-soluble solids.

==Biosynthesis==
=== Isoprene as the building block ===
Conceptually derived from isoprenes, the structures and formulas of terpenes follow the biogenetic isoprene rule or the C5 rule, as described in 1953 by Leopold Ružička and colleagues. The C5 isoprene units are provided in the form of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). DMAPP and IPP are structural isomers to each other. This pair of building blocks are produced by two distinct metabolic pathways: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway. These two pathways are mutually exclusive in most organisms, except for some bacteria and land plants. In general, most archaea and eukaryotes use the MVA pathway, while bacteria mostly have the MEP pathway. IPP and DMAPP are final products of both MVA and MEP pathways and the relative abundance of these two isoprene units is enzymatically regulated in host organisms.
==== Mevalonate pathway ====

This pathway conjugates three molecules of acetyl CoA.

The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is distributed in all three domains of life; archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. The MVA pathway is universally distributed in archaea and non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, while the pathway is sparse in bacteria. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, some species possess the MVA pathway, while others have the MEP pathway or both MVA and MEP pathways. This is due to the acquisition of the MEP pathway by a common ancestor of Archaeplastida (algae + land plants) through the endosymbiosis of ancestral cyanobacteria that possessed the MEP pathway. The MVA and MEP pathways were selectively lost in individual photosynthetic lineages.

Also, the archaeal MVA pathway is not completely homologous to the eukaryotic MVA pathway. Instead, the eukaryotic MVA pathway is closer to the bacterial MVA pathway.

==== Non-mevalonate pathway ====
The non-mevalonate pathway or the 2-&quot;C&quot;-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway starts with pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) as the carbon source.

C5 IPP and C5 DMAPP are the end-products in either pathway and are the precursors of terpenoids with various carbon numbers (typically C5 to C40), side chains of (bacterio)chlorophylls, hemes and quinones. Synthesis of all higher terpenoids proceeds via formation of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP).

===Geranyl pyrophosphate phase and beyond===
In both MVA and MEP pathways, IPP is isomerized to DMAPP by the enzyme isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase. IPP and DMAPP condense to give geranyl pyrophosphate, the precursor to monoterpenes and monoterpenoids.

Geranyl pyrophosphate is also converted to farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, respectively C15 and C20 precursors to sesquiterpenes and diterpenes (as well as sesequiterpenoids and diterpenoids). Biosynthesis is mediated by terpene synthase.

===Terpenes to terpenoids===
The genomes of many plant species contain genes that encode terpenoid synthase enzymes imparting terpenes with their basic structure, and cytochrome P450s that modify this basic structure.

==Structure==
Terpenes can be visualized as the result of linking isoprene (C5H8) units &quot;head to tail&quot; to form chains and rings. A few terpenes are linked “tail to tail”, and larger branched terpenes may be linked “tail to mid”.

===Formula===
Strictly speaking all monoterpenes have the same chemical formula C10H16. Similarly all sesquiterpenes and diterpenes have formulas of C15H24 and C20H32 respectively. The structural diversity of mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes is a consequence of isomerism.

===Chirality===
Terpenes and terpenoids are usually chiral. Chiral compounds can exist as non-superposable mirror images, which exhibit distinct physical properties such as odor or toxicity.

====Unsaturation====
Most terpenes and terpenoids feature C=C groups, i.e. they exhibit unsaturation. Since they carry no functional groups aside from their unsaturation, terpenes are structurally distinctive. The unsaturation is associated with di- and trisubstituted alkenes. Di- and trisubstituted alkenes resist polymerization (low ceiling temperatures) but are susceptible to acid-induced carbocation formation.

===Classification===
Terpenes may be classified by the number of isoprene units in the molecule; a prefix in the name indicates the number of isoprene pairs needed to assemble the molecule. Commonly, terpenes contain 2, 3, 4 or 6 isoprene units; the tetraterpenes (8 isoprene units) form a separate class of compounds called carotenoids; the others are rare.

*The basic unit isoprene itself is a hemiterpene. It may form oxygen-containing derivatives such as prenol and isovaleric acid analogous to terpenoids.
* Monoterpenes consist of &quot;two isoprene&quot; units and have the molecular formula C10H16. Examples of monoterpenes and monoterpenoids include geraniol, terpineol (present in lilacs), limonene (present in citrus fruits), myrcene (present in hops), linalool (present in lavender), hinokitiol (present in cypress trees) or pinene (present in pine trees). Iridoids derive from monoterpenes. Examples of iridoids include aucubin and catalpol.
* Sesquiterpenes consist of &quot;three isoprene&quot; units and have the molecular formula C15H24. Examples of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids include humulene, farnesenes, farnesol, geosmin. (The &quot;sesqui-&quot; prefix means one and a half.)
* Diterpenes are composed of &quot;four isoprene&quot; units and have the molecular formula C20H32. They derive from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Examples of diterpenes and diterpenoids are cafestol, kahweol, cembrene and taxadiene (precursor of taxol). Diterpenes also form the basis for biologically important compounds such as retinol, retinal, and phytol.
* Sesterterpenes, terpenes having 25 carbons and &quot;five isoprene&quot; units, are rare relative to the other sizes. (The &quot;sester-&quot; prefix means two and a half.) An example of a sesterterpenoid is geranylfarnesol.
* Triterpenes consist of &quot;six isoprene&quot; units and have the molecular formula C30H48. The linear triterpene squalene, the major constituent of shark liver oil, is derived from the reductive coupling of two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate. Squalene is then processed biosynthetically to generate either lanosterol or cycloartenol, the structural precursors to all the steroids.
* Sesquarterpenes are composed of &quot;seven isoprene&quot; units and have the molecular formula C35H56. Sesquarterpenes are typically microbial in their origin. Examples of sesquarterpenoids are ferrugicadiol and tetraprenylcurcumene.
* Tetraterpenes contain &quot;eight isoprene&quot; units and have the molecular formula C40H64. Biologically important tetraterpenoids include the acyclic lycopene, the monocyclic gamma-carotene, and the bicyclic alpha- and beta-carotenes.
* Polyterpenes consist of long chains of &quot;many isoprene&quot; units. Natural rubber consists of polyisoprene in which the double bonds are &quot;cis&quot;. Some plants produce a polyisoprene with &quot;trans&quot; double bonds, known as gutta-percha.
* Norisoprenoids, characterized by the shortening of a chain or ring by the removal of a methylene group or substitution of one or more methyl side chains by hydrogen atoms. These include the C13-norisoprenoid 3-oxo-α-ionol present in Muscat of Alexandria leaves and 7,8-dihydroionone derivatives, such as and found in Shiraz leaves (both grapes in the species &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;) or wine (responsible for some of the spice notes in Chardonnay), can be produced by fungal peroxidases or glycosidases.

==Industrial syntheses==
While terpenes and terpenoids occur widely, their extraction from natural sources is often problematic. Consequently, they are produced by chemical synthesis, usually from petrochemicals. In one route, acetone and acetylene are condensed to give 2-Methylbut-3-yn-2-ol, which is extended with acetoacetic ester to give geranyl alcohol. Others are prepared from those terpenes and terpenoids that are readily isolated in quantity, say from the paper and tall oil industries. For example, α-pinene, which is readily obtainable from natural sources, is converted to citronellal and camphor. Citronellal is also converted to rose oxide and menthol.

<text>The College of Staten Island (CSI) is a public university in Staten Island, New York, United States. It is one of the 11 four-year senior colleges within the City University of New York system. 

Programs in the liberal arts and sciences and professional studies lead to bachelor&#x27;s and associate degrees. The master&#x27;s degree is awarded in 13 professional and liberal arts and sciences fields of study. A clinical doctorate is awarded by the department of physical therapy. The college participates in doctoral programs of the CUNY Graduate Center in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, nursing, physics, and psychology.
==History==
The College of Staten Island is the product of a merger in 1976 of Staten Island Community College (SICC), founded in 1956, and Richmond College, founded in 1965. Richmond College had been threatened with closure because of New York City&#x27;s financial crisis, while SICC, because of its status as a community college, received state support. The merger was particularly logical since the community college offered two-year degrees, while Richmond College was an &quot;upper divisional&quot; college (the third in the nation) that offered degrees to those in their third and fourth years of schooling.

The College of Staten Island has been located on the grounds of the former Willowbrook State School since 1993. It is the largest campus by physical size in New York City. Before the relocation to Willowbrook, the college had a split campus, located at the former Staten Island Community College (in Sunnyside, on Todt Hill; the campus now houses the Michael J. Petrides School) and Richmond College (in St. George).

===Presidents===

His academic focus was access to higher education for all.
# Edmond Volpe, 1976–1994, an American literature scholar, retired in 1994, after having successfully handled the merger of the two colleges and the unification of the two campuses. 
# Marlene Springer, 1994–2007, an English and American literature scholar, under whose leadership the college improved academic standards, introduced several master&#x27;s programs, raised the level of the faculty, added research institutes, and introduced an Honors College, The Verrazano School, and the CSI High School for International Studies, retired in August 2007

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving teams have competed in the Northeast-10 Conference since the 2023-24 season, formerly competing in the Metropolitan Swimming Conference (METS) as the ECC doesn&#x27;t sponsor the sport. The college competes in 16 sports. Men&#x27;s sports are baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field (indoor and outdoor); women&#x27;s sports are basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field (indoor and outdoor).

The &#x27;College of Staten Island Baseball Complex&#x27; is primarily used for baseball and was the home of Staten Island Yankees before they moved to Richmond County Bank Ballpark in 2001. The ballpark had a capacity of 2,500 people and opened in 1999. It currently hosts the Dolphins baseball team.

<text>The House of Gonzaga (, ) is an Italian princely family that ruled Mantua in Lombardy, northern Italy from 1328 to 1708 (first as a captaincy-general, then margraviate, and finally duchy). They also ruled Monferrato in Piedmont and Nevers in France, as well as many other lesser fiefs throughout Europe. The family includes a saint, twelve cardinals and fourteen bishops. Two Gonzaga descendants became empresses of the Holy Roman Empire (Eleonora Gonzaga and Eleonora Gonzaga-Nevers), and one became Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Marie Louise Gonzaga).

==History==
The first members of the family of historical importance are known to have collaborated with the Guelph faction alongside the monks of the Polirone Abbey. Starting from the 12th century they became a dominant family in Mantua, growing in wealth when their allies, the Bonacolsi, defeated the traditional familiar enemy, the Casalodi. In 1328, however, Ludovico I Gonzaga overthrew the Bonacolsi lordship over the city with the help of the Scaliger, and entered the Ghibelline party as &quot;capitano del popolo&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s captain&quot;) of Mantua and imperial vicar of Emperor Louis IV.

Ludovico was succeeded by Guido (1360–1369) and Ludovico II (1369–1382), while Feltrino, lord of Reggio until 1371, formed the cadet branch of the Gonzaga of Novellara, whose state existed until 1728. Francesco I (1382–1407) abandoned the traditional alliance with the Visconti of Milan, in order to align their rising power with the Republic of Venice.

In 1433, Gianfrancesco I assumed the title of Marquis of Mantua with the recognition of Emperor Sigismund, while obtaining recognition from the local nobility through the marriage of his daughter Margherita to Leonello d&#x27;Este, Marquis of Ferrara in 1435. In 1530 Federico II (1500–1540) received the title of Duke of Mantua. Also the two brothers of Federico II are historical characters of a certain importance: Ercole Gonzaga became a cardinal, presided over the Council of Trent and was almost elected Pope; Ferrante was a faithful ally of the Emperor Charles V who covered him with honors and positions, Ferrante was also the progenitor of the cadet branch of the Gonzaga of Guastalla. In 1531, the family acquired the Marquisate of Montferrat through marriage. Through maternal ancestors, the Gonzagas inherited also the Imperial Byzantine ancestry of the Paleologus, an earlier ruling family of Montferrat.

A cadet branch of the Mantua Gonzagas became dukes of Nevers and Rethel in France when Luigi (Louis) Gonzaga, a younger son of Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and Margherita Paleologa, married the heiress. The Gonzaga-Nevers later came to rule Mantua again when Louis&#x27;s son Charles (Carlo) inherited Mantua and Montferrat, triggering the War of the Mantuan Succession.

Another cadet branch were first sovereign counts, later dukes of Guastalla. They descended from Ferrante, a younger son of Duke Francesco II of Mantua (1484–1519). Ferrante&#x27;s grandson, Ferrante II, also played a role in the War of the Mantuan Succession. A further cadet branch was that of Sabbioneta, founded by Gianfrancesco, son of Ludovico III.

Marie Louise Gonzaga, daughter of Prince Charles Gonzaga-Nevers, was a queen consort of Poland and grand duchess consort of Lithuania from 1645 to her death in 1667.

Two daughters of the house, both named Eleanor Gonzaga, became Holy Roman Empresses, by marrying emperors Ferdinand II of Germany and Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, respectively. From the latter Empress Eleonora, the current heirs of the Gonzaga descend.

Saint Aloysius Gonzaga was a member of a junior branch of this family.

The House of Gonzaga is the inspiration for the play-within-the-play in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In Act 3 scene 2, they act out a play called &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot; (or &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;).

Gonzaga rule continued in Mantua until 1708 and in Guastalla until 1746. Both ruling lines going extinct until passing on to a minor Gonzaga-Vescovato branch, which is the only remaining existing branch.
===Patronage of the arts===
The House of Gonzaga was an important patron of the arts. This began when Gianfrancesco Gonzaga funded a school led by Vittorino da Feltre where music and art were core subjects along with mathematics, history, Greek and Latin, religion, and philosophy. The music theorist and composer Franchinus Gaffurius was trained at this school. Isabella d&#x27;Este, wife of Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, used her influence to financially support native composers at court (such as Bartolomeo Tromboncino and Marchetto Cara) which contributed to popularizing the frottola. Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga founded an ecclesiastical chapel which employed musicians and further advance the musical live of the region through sacred music composition and performance.

Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, himself a gifted composer, founded the Basilica palatina di Santa Barbara (construction began 1562) which became a cultural center for sacred art and music. He also brought several notable composers to the Mantua court, including Alessandro Striggio, Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, Giaches de Wert, Benedetto Pallavicino and Claudio Monteverdi. Through Monteverdi, the court witnessed some of the first operas ever staged, including &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; (1607) and &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot; (1608). Marco da Gagliano&#x27;s &quot;La Dafne&quot; was staged in 1608.

The Gonzaga House also sponsored theatre. The Mantua court staged Giovanni Battista Guarini&#x27;s plays &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;idropica&quot;. These plays included incidental music by several different composers, including Monteverdi, Gastoldi, Gagliano, Paolo Birt, and Salamone Rossi. Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua also supported the arts, but financial problems for the court led to a decline in support during his reign. 

Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat employed Antonio Caldara as maestro di cappella from 1701-1707.

<text>Federico II of Gonzaga (17 May 1500 – 28 August 1540) was the ruler of the Italian city of Mantua (first as Marquis, later as Duke) from 1519 until his death. He was also Marquis of Montferrat from 1536.

==Biography==

Federico was son of Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua and Isabella d&#x27;Este. Due to the turbulent politics of the time, from the age of ten, he spent three years as a hostage in Rome under Pope Julius II. From 1515 to 1517, Federico was the hostage of King Francis I of France, to ensure Gonzaga assistance in Italy.

On 3 April 1519, Federico succeeded his father as Marquis of Mantua, initially under the regency of his mother and his uncles Sigismondo and Giovanni Gonzaga. He received the imperial investiture from emperor Charles V on 7 April 1521. Pope Leo X named him Captain General of the Church (commander in chief of the Papal Army) in July 1521, and he fought against the French at Parma in 1521 and at Piacenza in 1522.

Federico signed a marriage contract with the heir to the Marquisate of Monteferrat, Maria Palaeologina, with the aim of acquiring that land. In 1528, however, in exchange for two prisoners, Pope Clement VII voided the marriage contract.

Federico then signed another marriage contract with Charles V&#x27;s third cousin, Julia of Aragon. In lieu of this move, in 1530 he was granted the ducal title, whereby their dynasty became Dukes of Mantua. However, when Boniface, Marquis of Montferrat, died from a fall from a horse on 25 March of that year, Federico paid 50,000 ducats to Charles in exchange for the annulment of the contract, and pushed the pope for the restoration of his earlier marriage agreement. When Maria also died, he was able to marry her sister Margaret on 3 October 1531. At the death of the last legitimate male heir of the Palaiologos family, Giovanni Giorgio (1533), the marquisate of Montferrat passed to the Gonzaga, who held it until the 18th century.

Like his parents, he was a patron of the arts; he commissioned the Palazzo Te, designed and decorated by Giulio Romano, as his summer palace just outside Mantua. Romano spent 16 years as court artist under Federico&#x27;s patronage. He also bought and commissioned several paintings from Titian, and had his portrait painted by both Titian and Raphael.

Federico suffered long from syphilis, like his father. He died on 28 June 1540 at his villa at Marmirolo. His son Francesco briefly held the title of 2nd Duke of Mantua before dying in his teens; the second son, Gugliemo, became 3rd Duke of Mantua as well as Duke of Montferrat and carried on the line.

==Family and issue==

Federico and Margaret were parents to seven children:

*Eleonora Gonzaga.
*Anna Gonzaga.
*Francesco III Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua (10 March 1533 - 22 February 1550)
*Isabella Gonzaga, married Francesco Ferdinando d&#x27;Ávalos
*Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua (24 April 1538 - 14 August 1587), married Archduchess Eleanor of Austria
*Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers (22 October 1539 - 23 October 1595). Father of Charles I, Duke of Mantua
*Cardinal Federico Gonzaga (1540 - 21 February 1565).

<doc id="214250" wikidata="Q969770" url="?curid=214250" title="Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua">
<text>Ludovico III Gonzaga of Mantua, known as the Turk (), also spelled Lodovico (also Ludovico II; 5 June 1412 – 12 June 1478) was the ruler of the Italian city of Mantua from 1444 to his death in 1478.

==Biography==

Ludovico was the son of Gianfrancesco I Gonzaga and Paola Malatesta daughter of Malatesta IV Malatesta of Pesaro.

Ludovico followed the path of his father, Gianfrancesco, fighting as a condottiero from as early as 1432, when Gianfrancesco was vice-commander of Francesco Bussone&#x27;s army. In 1433, he married Barbara of Brandenburg, niece of emperor Sigismund.

Starting from 1436 (perhaps without the approval of his father) he entered the service of the Visconti of the Duchy of Milan. The result was that Gianfrancesco exiled Ludovico from Mantua, together with his wife, naming Carlo Gonzaga as heir. However, in 1438 Gianfrancesco himself was hired by the Visconti, and reconciled with Ludovico in 1441. Ludovico succeeded to the marquisate of Mantua in 1444, although part of the family fiefs went to his brothers Carlo, Gianlucido and Alessandro. At the time, the Mantuan state was reduced in size and was in poor condition after years of war and large expenses.

From 1445 to 1450 Ludovico served as condottiero for Milan, Florence, Venice, and Naples, switching his allegiance to grant a higher level of peace for his lands. In 1448 he took part in the battle of Caravaggio, and was forced to flee. In 1449 he entered the service of Venice in the league formed with Florence against Milan. In 1450 he received permission to lead an army for King Alfonso of Naples in Lombardy, with the intent of gaining some possessions for himself. However, Francesco Sforza, the new Duke of Milan, enticed him into an alliance with the promise of turning over to him Lonato, Peschiera and Asola, formerly Mantuan territories but then part of Venice. Venice responded by sacking Castiglione delle Stiviere (1452) and hiring Ludovico&#x27;s brother, Carlo.

Carlo Gonzaga invaded his brother Ludovico&#x27;s Mantuan territories on 9 March 1453 with 4,000 soldiers, seizing Castelbelforte (then known as Castelbonafisso) and Bigarello. Ludovico gathered an army of 3,000 horse and 500 infantry and along with a detachment of Milanese troops led by the condottiere Tiberio Brandolini defeated Carlo at Castellaro Lagusello near Monzambano. Ludovico then pursued the retreating Carlo across the river Adige and on 14 June 1453 routed the troops of Carlo Gonzaga at Villabona near Goito. Venetian troops under Niccolò Piccinino however thwarted his attempt to regain Asola. The Peace of Lodi (1454) obliged Ludovico to give back all his conquests, and to renounce definitively his claim to the three cities. However, he obtained his brother&#x27;s land after Carlo&#x27;s childless death in 1456.

The moment of highest prestige for Mantua was the Council, held in the city from 27 May 1459 to 19 January 1460, summoned by Pope Pius II to launch a crusade against the Ottoman Turks, who had conquered Constantinople some years earlier. However, the pope was not satisfied with the host city, writing: &quot;The place was marshy and unhealthy, and the heat burnt up everything; the wine was unpalatable and the food unpleasant.&quot; However, the council ended on a note of great personal prestige for Ludovico with the elevation of his son Francesco to the purple.

From 1466 Ludovico was more or less constantly at the service of the Sforza of Milan. He died in Goito in 1478, during a plague. He was buried in Mantua cathedral.

==Education==

On the orders of his father, Ludovico&#x27;s education had been entrusted to the humanist Vittorino da Feltre. Vittorino undertook &quot;the difficult enterprise in the interests of the commonwealth for... the education of a good prince would benefit the people he ruled.&quot; The teaching was markedly moral and religious and contained a &quot;vein of laical asceticism almost.&quot; This, argues the arts scholar Franco Borsi, explains not only Ludovico&#x27;s religious faith that led him to found churches and host Pius II&#x27;s Council, but also his concern for a humanistic culture and the growth in public works throughout the city, from the paving of the streets and building of a clock tower to the reorganization of the city centre. Among the famous humanists invited to the city was the Genoese scholar Leon Battista Alberti, who designed the San Sebastiano church and the San&#x27; Andrea church. Also, in 1460, Ludovico appointed Andrea Mantegna as court artist to the Gonzaga family.

Ludovico is featured in the &quot;Treatise on Architecture&quot;, from , by the Florentine sculptor-architect Antonio di Pietro Averlino (), better known as Filarete. The treatise takes the format of a Platonic dialogue, featuring an unnamed architect (evidently Filarete himself) who is building a new city for a princely patron (evidently Francesco Sforza of Milan). During the dialogue interspersing the treatise they are visited by another lord, in the figure of Ludovico: his role in the dialogue is to persuade Sforza that he has seen the error of his ways in showing favour to &quot;modern architecture&quot;, by which is meant Gothic architecture, and, having seen the architecture of antiquity in Rome, now favours such architecture instead, which is also what Filarete is also trying to persuade his patron.

==Children==

Ludovico III and Barbara had fourteen children:

* Federico (1438? – died in infancy).
* Maddalena (1439? – died in infancy).
* Elisabetta (1440? – died in infancy).
* Federico I (1441 – 1484), Marquis of Mantua; married Margaret of Bavaria, daughter of Albert III, Duke of Bavaria and Anna, Duchess of Brunswick-Grubenhagen
* Francesco (1444 – 1483), created Cardinal by Pope Pius II.
* Paola Bianca (1445–1447), died in infancy.
* Gianfrancesco (1446 – 1496), Count of Sabbioneta and Lord of Bozzolo; married Antonia del Balzo. Had issue
* Susanna (1447–1481), a nun at Santa Paola di Mantua.
* Dorotea (1449–1467), married to Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan.
* Cecilia (1451–1472), a nun at Santa Chiara di Mantua.
* Rodolfo (1452–1495), Lord of Castiglione delle Stiviere, Solferino, Suzzara and Poviglio; married firstly daughter of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta and then Caterina Pico. His great-grandson was Aloysius Gonzaga.
* Barbara (1455–1503), married in 1474 Eberhard I, Duke of Württemberg
* Ludovico (1460–1511), Bishop of Mantua.
* Paola (1463–1497), married Leonhard, Count of Gorizia.

In addition, Ludovico III had two illegitimate daughters: Caterina (wife of Gianfrancesco Secco, Conte di Calcio) and Gabriella (wife of Corrado Fogliani, Marchese di Vighizzolo).

It was said that the daughters of Barbara and Ludovico III had hunched backs, that is why Susanna was spurned by Galeazzo Maria Sforza and the marriage with Dorotea was delayed until the Milanese court found that her physical problems aren&#x27;t so notorious like her oldest sister. Leonhard of Gorizia also postponed his marriage to Paola due to this and when they eventually married they had one stillborn child as it is thought that this deformity in her made it harder to have children.

<text>Nordstrom, Inc. () is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores. Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015–2020) and Canada (2014–2023).

== Early history ==
John W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Luleå in Northern Sweden. In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16. His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordström (), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a potato farm in Arlington, Washington. In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000. Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.

== Operations during 20th century ==
=== Wallin &amp; Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best ===

Nordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin &amp; Nordstrom. Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop. John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.

In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.

By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best&#x27;s Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company&#x27;s name was changed to Nordstrom Best.

=== Following renaming to Nordstrom ===

In 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange. It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.

Their business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field. With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team&#x27;s first chief operating officer.

By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978. By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.

In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued. The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995. In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.

The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division led by John N.&#x27;s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com&#x27;s fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.
Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers.
In 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State. It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997, and Manhattan in 2019.

Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997. In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick &amp; Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016. At , the downtown Seattle location is the chain&#x27;s largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under . This location has since closed.

In 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.

== Operations during 21st century ==
=== 2000–2009 ===

In 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold. Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.

Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.

=== 2010–2019 ===
In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year &quot;earn-out&quot; payment based on HauteLook&#x27;s financial performance. On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don&#x27;t see the outlook significantly changing.&quot;

In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure &amp; Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure &amp; Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.

Nordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014. In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom&#x27;s decision to open in the Milwaukee area.

On January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market. Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009. The location eventually opened in September 2015.

Nordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico. After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018. On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently.

In May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom&#x27;s death in January 2019. Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.

Nordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014. In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware. The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.

In 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.

In 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii. In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.
On February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump&#x27;s branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom&#x27;s action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels. President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company&#x27;s stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. &quot;Fortune&quot; declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump&#x27;s market-moving &quot;tweet curse&quot;.

In October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first &quot;Nordstrom Local&quot; in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.&#x27;s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private. In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package. Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.

On January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family&#x27;s company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.

In fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.

=== 2020–present ===

On March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.

On March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.

In late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.

In October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honoré, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company&#x27;s clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.

On December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced their plans to take the company private in a deal valued at $6.25 billion. The plan involves selling 49.9% percent of the company to Mexican department store and real estate company El Puerto de Liverpool, with the remaining 50.1% controlling stake being held by the Nordstrom family. On the deal, CEO Erik Nordstrom stated that “Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.” 

== Nordstrom Canada ==
Nordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. () was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson&#x27;s Bay, and Simons.

Four full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term. Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction. Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014. It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015; the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015; and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017. The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013, and opened on October 21, 2016. The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014, however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.

The first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018. Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons.

On March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, &quot;Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business.&quot; The closing would be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian &quot;Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act&quot; (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator. Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023, while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023.

<text>In computing, a stateful firewall is a network-based firewall that individually tracks sessions of network connections traversing it. Stateful packet inspection, also referred to as dynamic packet filtering, is a security feature often used in non-commercial and business networks.

==Description==
A stateful firewall keeps track of the state of network connections, such as TCP streams, UDP datagrams, and ICMP messages, and can apply labels such as &quot;LISTEN&quot;, &quot;ESTABLISHED&quot;, or &quot;CLOSING&quot;. State table entries are created for TCP streams or UDP datagrams that are allowed to communicate through the firewall in accordance with the configured security policy. Once in the table, all &quot;RELATED&quot; packets of a stored session are streamlined, taking fewer CPU cycles than standard inspection. Related packets are also permitted to return through the firewall even if no rule is configured to allow communications from that host. If no traffic is seen for a specified time (time-out implementation dependent), the connection is removed from the state table. This can lead to applications experiencing unexpected disconnects or half-open TCP connections. Applications can be written to send keepalive messages periodically to prevent a firewall from dropping the connection during periods of no activity or for applications which by design have long periods of silence. 

The method of maintaining a session&#x27;s state depends on the transport protocol being used. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and sessions are established with a three-way handshake using &quot;SYN&quot; packets and ended by sending a &quot;FIN&quot; notification. The firewall can use these unique connection identifiers to know when to remove a session from the state table without waiting for a timeout. UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means it does not send unique connection-related identifiers while communicating. Because of that, a session will only be removed from the state table after the configured time-out. UDP hole punching is a technology that leverages this trait to allow for dynamically setting up data tunnels over the internet. ICMP messages are distinct from TCP and UDP and communicate control information of the network itself. A well-known example of this is the ping utility. ICMP responses will be allowed back through the firewall. In some scenarios, UDP communication can use ICMP to provide information about the state of the session so ICMP responses related to a UDP session will also be allowed back through.

=== Stateful inspection firewall advantages ===

* Monitors the entire session for the state of the connection, while also checking IP addresses and payloads for more thorough security
* Offers a high degree of control over what content is let in or out of the network
* Does not need to open numerous ports to allow traffic in or out
* Delivers substantive logging capabilities

=== Stateful inspection firewall disadvantages ===

* Resource-intensive and interferes with the speed of network communications
* More expensive than other firewall options
* Doesn&#x27;t provide authentication capabilities to validate traffic sources are not spoofed
* Doesn&#x27;t work with asymmetric routing (opposite directions use different paths)
* Can lead to unexpected disconnections or half-open connections if connections are idle for longer than the time-out
